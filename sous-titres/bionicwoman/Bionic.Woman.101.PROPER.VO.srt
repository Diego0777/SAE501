1
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:32,582
I... didn't want to.

2
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,754
I'm not in control.

3
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,314
I know.

4
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:49,543
Tell me you love me.

5
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,119
I love you.

6
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,086
We're out of Stoly!

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,876
Becca!

8
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,611
- What?
- The music's too loud.

9
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,681
What now?

10
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,401
Why is the door locked?
What are you doing?

11
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,992
Where is it?

12
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:53,586
Where's what?

13
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,406
You're not allowed to be near a
computer plugged into a phone line

14
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,260
Or would I have to show you
the court order.

15
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,944
- Why don't you email it to me?
- Becca.

16
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,123
Go ahead, tear the room apart,
do you see a computer in here?

17
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:03,877
No.

18
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,460
That means the only thing that it's
in here that doesn't belong

19
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:08,244
is drum roll please, you

20
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,284
I'm driving you to school
in ten minutes.

21
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,028
Too easy.

22
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,073
That's not real food.

23
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,426
You're not a real mum.

24
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,195
What's your problem?

25
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:51,495
You know, dad didn't try to control me.

26
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,755
- Dad trusted me, OK?
- Dad dropped you off on my doorstep.

27
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:57,796
If you want to live with dad,
live with dad, if you can find him.

28
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,506
Here's what to do.

29
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,367
Look for a big protest rally.

30
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,789
Then find the nearest bar.

31
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:05,470
You think you remember, but you don't.

32
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,367
The victim of a Baghdad car bombing.

33
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,928
Needed transplants,

34
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,440
and facial reconstructions.

35
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,254
This triathlete was told
he would never compete again.

36
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,544
For some women, bigger is better.

37
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:39,296
What these people have in common
is that they have each on some level,

38
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,845
... altered themselves.

39
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,842
But where is the threshold?

40
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,996
When is it okay,
to intervene in God's work?

41
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,624
This question is the very
cornerstone of bioethics,

42
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,984
and we're gonna spend the rest
of the semester dealing with it.

43
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,054
Come on, Will.

44
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,308
I am a bartender and a dropout.

45
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,262
- You're a professor.
- And a surgeon.

46
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:01,008
How can you take me seriously?

47
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,812
What makes you think
I take you seriously?

48
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:03,887
Do you?

49
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,397
Why are you with me?

50
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,831
You're different.

51
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:09,422
From what?

52
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:13,021
When your whole life's planned out
for you while you're still in the womb,

53
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,882
it kinda kills the mystery.

54
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,606
And then you came along,
and you were...

55
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,433
- ... unexpected.
- Unexpected?

56
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,254
The one choice my father
didn't make for me.

57
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,469
I gotta run.

58
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,280
- We're still on for dinner?
- 8 o'clock?

59
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:33,378
Make it 8:30, I have to go to the lab
for a few hours.

60
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,424
While we're on the subject,
why are you with me?

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,312
You're not entirely uncharming.

62
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,492
It's insulting.

63
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,659
The last time I left you alone,
you started a fire.

64
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:53,625
- The microwave was broken!
- We don't have a microwave.

65
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,619
- Look, the weird!
- They're my friends.

66
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,788
- Then they're your weird friends.
- Please, for me.

67
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,385
Tomorrow night.

68
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,316
Double feature?

69
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,440
Deal.

70
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,244
You look rocken.

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,631
I brought pheromones.

72
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:12,061
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late.

73
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,114
- Be good.
- Have fun.

74
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,440
I think there's a pretty good chance
the grant could come through.

75
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,512
The institute's indicating
it's a done deal.

76
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,185
And I hear Paris is great
in the spring.

77
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:30,673
You're not happy.

78
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,591
Of course I'm happy.

79
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,659
Because I think you should come with me.

80
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:36,761
I can't.

81
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,664
- Why not?
- I have a job.

82
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,789
Jaime!

83
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:40,962
And a life!

84
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,694
- We're talking Paris.
- And I have responsabilities.

85
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,280
- Did I mention it's Paris.
- I'm pregnant.

86
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,616
Yeah, that's what I said.

87
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,754
I don't want you to...

88
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:54,174
I just...

89
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,299
I know this isn't something
you just spring on someone

90
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,547
except for the part where that's exactly
what I'm doing to you right now, and...

91
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,051
I know you're in a place
where you can't even think about it,

92
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,998
and God, I'm only 24,
it's not, I mean, I said to myself,

93
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:10,406
- there's only one thing to do, but...
- Five months, fourteen days.

94
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,657
That's how long we've been dating.

95
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:19,094
Jaime, if someone had asked me
five months and fifteen days ago...

96
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:23,487
if I believed in love at first sight,
I would've said I absolutely did not.

97
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,248
And the very next day,
I would've been proven wrong.

98
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,895
- Will...
- Marry me.

99
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,563
So I'm thinking Coltrane
if it's a boy...

100
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:34,950
Billie if it's a girl.

101
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,523
You don't have to do this, you know.

102
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,615
Actually, I'm pretty sure
you have to name them.

103
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,578
- I mean you didn't have to...
- I know, but I'm still asking.

104
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,326
So what does that tell you?

105
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:56,923
Jaime.

106
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,500
Jaime.

107
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,447
That's not an internal bleeding.

108
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,706
Extensive crush injuries
to right arm and both legs.

109
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,479
- She's coming up!
- I need 5 more grams of Dazol.

110
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,946
You're gonna be OK, baby,
we're gonna put you back to sleep.

111
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:30,242
It's gonna be all right.

112
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,591
I promise it's gonna be okay.

113
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:05,114
Multiple compound radial and ulnar
fractures to the right arm.

114
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,401
- Severed brachial artery.
- Right arm's a shredder,

115
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,722
we're looking at complete
A-K amputation of both legs.

116
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,753
There were vascular damages.
Catastrophic.

117
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,666
- Loss of fœtal heartbeat.
- Dr. Anthros.

118
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,892
EP's falling. 80 systolic.

119
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,856
- Prep her.
- Dr. Anthros!

120
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:19,927
Do it!

121
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,219
Why didn't somebody stop him?

122
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:26,751
He has full clearance, we didn't have
the authority to stop him.

123
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,057
That's the price you pay
for working with a so called genius.

124
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,943
'Cause he must have left his IQ
in the car.

125
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,265
Debreeding the ulnar nerve.

126
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,888
Significant damage.

127
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,932
Should I intervene?

128
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:52,783
No.

129
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,585
This operation's patient
doesn't officially exist.

130
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,492
We have deniability,
it's a freebie.

131
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,201
We can always terminate later
if need be.

132
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:04,334
Meanwhile, get Jae.

133
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,833
It will have to be resected
to its branch point.

134
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,803
Radial nerve appears to be intact.

135
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:55,799
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

136
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,511
The doctor. Did you kill him?

137
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:01,075
It was like a ride at Disneyland.

138
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:05,426
Which one?

139
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:07,657
I've never been.

140
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,963
I'll take you.

141
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,617
You'll love it.

142
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,738
It's all fat people,

143
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,935
fat children
walking around aimlessly,

144
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:17,854
too stupid to know the difference.

145
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,311
Do you miss it?

146
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,405
The way things were.

147
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:24,284
If I could remember,
I'm sure I would.

148
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,677
Do I remind you of her?

149
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,452
Your skin.

150
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,406
Tell me you love me.

151
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:06,756
Jaime.

152
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,296
What happened?

153
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,479
There was an accident.

154
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,431
You're okay.

155
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,806
My baby...

156
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,383
What about the baby?

157
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,112
Oh God!

158
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:25,811
There was no permanent damage.

159
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,772
You'll be able to get pregnant again.

160
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,609
Why can't I feel my legs.

161
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:40,908
Okay, Jaime, I need to tell
you something.

162
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,072
What's happening to me?

163
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:43,913
I need to tell you about
what I had to do.

164
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,804
- You need to listen.
- I can't feel my arm!

165
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,109
Listen to me, Jaime.

166
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,584
Both your legs, and your arm
had to be replaced.

167
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,614
Also, your right ear and right eye.

168
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,913
Molecular machines.

169
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,875
Anthrocytes...

170
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:04,295
have been substituting
for one eighth of your blood cells.

171
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,823
Now, you should have lacerations
bone-deep all over your face.

172
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,830
But the anthrocytes are healing you.

173
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,543
At an exponential rate.

174
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,318
All of you.
We're making you better.

175
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,403
It was a dream.

176
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:19,158
The bionics enhance baseline
human strength.

177
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,096
And then some.

178
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,349
What have you done to me?

179
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,981
- Why did you do this to me?
- You were going to die.

180
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:06,230
Sir!

181
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,192
Born Jaime Wells Sommers.

182
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:12,190
Van Horn, Iowa.
February 23rd, 1983.

183
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,696
Mother deceased, cancer.

184
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,999
She's clean except for a sealed
court record from 1998.

185
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:19,276
What's in it?

186
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,734
- It's sealed.
- Unseal it.

187
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,264
I'm working on it.

188
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:24,561
I think she's a good candidate.

189
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,959
Let's pretend I'm solliciting opinions.
Why?

190
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,672
She's stable.

191
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,674
I pulled up an old Minnesota
multi-phasic personality inventory.

192
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,158
I liked what I saw.

193
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,259
Plus the situation with her sister
shows loyalty.

194
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,064
And she's smart.

195
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:42,768
I found an old IQ test.

196
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,450
How did she do?

197
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:45,950
A little better than you.

198
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,311
Sir.

199
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:48,654
Jae, can you train her?

200
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,847
Well, the last one
we screened, tested,

201
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,627
and there was psycho evaluation,
and she was a soldier.

202
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,125
Look where it got us.

203
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,762
We always talked about
non military applications.

204
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,088
- Here's our chance.
- Your opinion is invalid here,

205
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,443
you're too close to the subject.

206
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,680
This from the guy who played house
with the last one.

207
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:08,545
Let's get fresh data.
I want you to sit her down.

208
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:09,859
All right.

209
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,797
Yeah, I once had a wolf.

210
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,734
A wolf only makes a good pet
if it thinks it's a dog.

211
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,162
Your girlfriend...

212
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,496
We're keeping her here
against her will.

213
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,069
How long until she realizes
that no one

214
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,958
can make her do anything
against her will?

215
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,901
You're talking about killing a human.

216
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,973
I'm talking about killing a wolf.

217
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,448
You know what scares me about you?

218
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,892
Your father.

219
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,863
He seemed normal, too.

220
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,448
If I'm anything like my father,
you just made a big mistake.

221
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,949
All right,
we have to get you to rehab.

222
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,487
<i>- What for?
- Rehabilitation.</i>

223
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,734
<i>I am not the one performing
human experiments,</i>

224
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,108
<i>and keeping people prisoner.</i>

225
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:02,012
<i>You rehabilitate yourself.</i>

226
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,282
- I'm Ruth.
- I'm pissed.

227
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,742
Good.

228
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,570
We're here
to talk about our feelings.

229
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:54,924
How do you feel about me
being kept here against my will?

230
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,300
I was speaking editorially.

231
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,512
Actually, we're here
to talk about your feelings.

232
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,036
Something no one seems
to have any regard for.

233
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:03,048
Curve balls will do that.

234
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,826
You can have
all the contingency plans you like,

235
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,026
and then someone goes
and does something like this,

236
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,988
- and we all have to stay after school.
- And talk about our feelings.

237
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,526
- Your feelings.
- Right.

238
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,174
After all, feelings are what got us here
in the first place.

239
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:22,409
You like to draw.

240
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,361
- True or false...
- I have a sister.

241
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,142
She's staying with your landlady.

242
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,995
She thinks you're skying in Vail.

243
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,685
This is where you stayed.

244
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,200
It looks nice.

245
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:38,502
"We had fun.

246
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,905
"Except for the part where...

247
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,041
"Will injured his arm
skying into a tree."

248
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,310
Does this mean I'll be going home
at some point?

249
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,867
It means
that we have a contingency plan,

250
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,863
should you be going home
at some point.

251
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,257
We also have a plan,
should you not.

252
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:54,631
True or false.

253
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,779
"You can't teach an old dog
new tricks".

254
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,811
You would have done the same thing.

255
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,053
You never met my wife, did you?

256
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:26,334
For two years,
I watched her die in the hospital

257
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,928
while they disassembled her.

258
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,897
And the whole time,
I knew all I had to do to save her

259
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:33,866
was bringing her here,
but saving my wife was not the mission.

260
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,481
Ruth says she's stable.

261
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:40,404
How long until she's combat-ready?

262
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:42,133
She's a civilian.

263
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,831
Everyone has to sing for their supper
around here,

264
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,724
haven't you figured that out yet?

265
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,246
How long until the rest
of her implants come online?

266
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,147
- She likes to draw.
- I don't care.

267
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:09,920
I think you'll care about this.

268
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,732
Who did they bury?

269
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,204
I mean, did you ever see the body?

270
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:28,253
You showed this to anybody else?

271
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,803
- Just you.
- Keep it that way.

272
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:35,969
<i>General alert! General Alert!</i>

273
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:50,819
I can't protect you in here.

274
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,221
- We want you on the outside.
- Why should I trust you?

275
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,012
'Cause I'm the only one
you can trust.

276
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,400
Go back to your life
like none of this ever happened,

277
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,507
- I'll work it out with them.
- What about you?

278
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,917
Go. Now!

279
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,214
All right, I'll have those faxed
over to you by Friday afternoon,

280
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,886
and we're still on
for that meeting tomorrow?

281
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,654
Okay, good.

282
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:58,164
Yeah.

283
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,598
Mommy!

284
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,410
There's a lady out there running
really fast. Like as fast as a car!

285
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,233
Sweetie, what did I tell you
about making things up?

286
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,455
I just thought it was cool
that a girl could do that, that's all.

287
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:20,597
Let her go.

288
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:22,891
- What the hell did you do?
- You won, all right?

289
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:25,089
For the program...

290
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:27,239
I'll make her understand
what's at stake.

291
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:29,340
- Just let me have time...
- Time to what?

292
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:32,896
Letting her go is not a bad idea.

293
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,667
If you want her loyalty,
give her freedom.

294
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,834
Or the illusion of freedom.

295
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:42,883
All right.
Everybody, stand down.

296
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,011
- You're making a mistake.
- Listen to me.

297
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:56,323
The accident wasn't an accident.
According to the autopsy,

298
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,412
the driver's neck was broken
an hour before the crash.

299
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:03,176
Which means someone else was driving
that truck, and we need to find out who.

300
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:29,913
<i>Jaime. It's will.</i>

301
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:31,561
If you're there, pick up the phone.

302
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,227
I need to talk to you.

303
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,078
Jaime, please.

304
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,808
<i>There are things I need
to tell you about.</i>

305
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,075
<i>Before they happen</i>

306
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:50,599
Nice of you to show up!

307
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:54,142
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,135
Now what for?

309
00:24:57,922 --> 00:25:00,338
For leaving and not telling you first.

310
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,046
How was skying?

311
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,523
It was fine.

312
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:12,685
Dad used to always say "Don't leave
anything until it's been denied"

313
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,777
Don't lie to me, OK!

314
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,209
We both know you don't ski.

315
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,401
So, where were you?

316
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,403
I can't tell you.

317
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:04,902
- Coffee.
- Sure.

318
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,216
It's no smoking.

319
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:17,548
What are you?

320
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,049
A forest ranger?

321
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,377
Something like that.

322
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,401
It must be scary.

323
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,159
Alone in the forest.
Just you, and the animals.

324
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:33,242
Not if they know who's in charge.

325
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,244
Wait up!

326
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:42,891
Guard!

327
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,245
We both know you're working
in a supermax prison

328
00:26:48,393 --> 00:26:50,235
a thousand feet below Florence.

329
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,765
We both know this is a place
where they stick people

330
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,417
when they outlive their usefulness.

331
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:58,204
- I don't know who you are.
- If you don't do exactly what I say,

332
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:01,167
my brother's gonna carve your wife
Barbara up like Venus de Milo.

333
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,061
<i>Oh God, Bobby</i>

334
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:10,236
<i>Help me.</i>

335
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,451
How did you do it?

336
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,710
Do you know what they call creatures

337
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,789
that can live comfortably
in environments considered lethal,

338
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,574
say... for instance...

339
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,479
a thousand feet
below the Earth's surface?

340
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,926
- How did you do it?
- Extremophiles.

341
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:37,708
I'll do an impression of one
for you. Ready?

342
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,282
- How did you...
- What?

343
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:45,240
How did I do what?

344
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,389
Sarah Corvus is still alive.

345
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:49,759
And you came all the way here
to tell me that.

346
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,987
Let me do
another impression for you.

347
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,841
Impression of a man
who's been stabbed in the back.

348
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,692
Stripped of his rights,
and thrown in a hole like a dog.

349
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,715
Sarah Corvus is a time bomb.

350
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:02,316
We both know it.

351
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,893
Well, time bombs
only matter to those who have time.

352
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,863
Goodbye, Jae.

353
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,171
Please give my regards to Will.

354
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,285
Tell him Daddy says hello.

355
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:15,602
Guards!

356
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,608
If I may make an observation,

357
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:32,384
you seem way too innocent and sweet
to be behind a bar.

358
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:34,652
You should be out there
with the rest of 'em.

359
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,391
Finally. I'm not the only person
who feels that way.

360
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,429
- What can I get you?
- Beer.

361
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:42,835
On the house.

362
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:43,972
Thank you.

363
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:48,390
Don't I know you?

364
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,258
We met very briefly.

365
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,162
We didn't even actually meet.

366
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:55,697
- Where?
- Guess.

367
00:28:57,665 --> 00:28:58,818
Are you all right?

368
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:00,828
- Yeah.
- Let me take a look at it.

369
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,127
It's okay.

370
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:30,283
<i>Are you okay?</i>

371
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,060
<i>Come on.</i>

372
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:33,561
<i>Your husband will never know.</i>

373
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,408
<i>Please.</i>

374
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:43,760
<i>Are you all right?</i>

375
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:02,633
Let me help you.

376
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,324
Juste breathe.

377
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:12,507
It's like that.

378
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:15,219
The first time the ear and eye implants
come online.

379
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:17,643
It's too much information.

380
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,244
You have to learn how to focus it.

381
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:21,990
And turn it off and on at will.

382
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,023
You're a fast healer.

383
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,909
The anthrocytes are doing their job.

384
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,235
Who are you?

385
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:38,327
Who are you?

386
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:06,975
<i>Jaime!</i>

387
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:09,435
<i>Tell everyone
Sarah Corvus says hello.</i>

388
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:41,881
Yo!

389
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,477
Lookin'for somethin'?

390
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,638
You need somethin'?

391
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:49,967
Come here, baby.

392
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,648
I got what you need.

393
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,562
Please.

394
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,464
Please don't.

395
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:08,491
Don't...

396
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,989
- Are you okay?
- Tell me what you put in my head.

397
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,184
I almost killed a man,

398
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,955
I didn't even know what I was doing.
What did you put in my head?

399
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:37,796
Microscopic chips have been implanted
in your cerebral cortex.

400
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:43,522
My father... He developed
the technology for the military.

401
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,261
The program was meant to help
amputees in the Gulf.

402
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:48,688
Of course, he saw the combat
applications immediately.

403
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,396
You made me into a soldier!

404
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,927
You're hard wired for highly
specialized warfare, yes.

405
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,059
- I was gonna kill him. I would've.
- You didn't, you're still in control,

406
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:58,148
- and with the proper training...
- Training?!

407
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,160
We're the only ones
that can protect you.

408
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,863
Let me protect you.

409
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:03,960
How can you protect me
if you're scared of me?

410
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,561
I never meant for any of this
to touch you,

411
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,152
I didn't, I just...

412
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,234
I couldn't bear to loose you.

413
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:43,165
That isn't even me.

414
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:47,093
Yes. It is.

415
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:08,885
Hey!

416
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,455
Hey.

417
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:13,570
I have to get back to Becca.
I can't keep leaving her like this.

418
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:16,230
What are you people doin' anyway?

419
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:19,796
It's complicated.

420
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,094
Try me.

421
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:26,397
The world's further along
than anyone wants to admit.

422
00:34:27,736 --> 00:34:31,086
Technology is at the point where
science fiction isn't fiction any more.

423
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:34,694
We keep that technology
from getting into the wrong hands.

424
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,939
Who gets to decide right from wrong?

425
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:42,624
What about Sarah Corvus?

426
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,648
- Where does she figure in all this?
- Where did you hear that name?

427
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,126
Where did you hear the name, Jaime?

428
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:55,314
Will!

429
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,988
- I'm... sorry.
- Just hold on, okay?

430
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,729
Where is she?

431
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:46,977
I need everyone.

432
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,560
Time out!

433
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:06,321
The anthrocytes in our blood
can filter out

434
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,157
any impurities in our lungs.

435
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,254
Fringe benefits of being a freak.

436
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,723
What do you want from me?

437
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,120
Honestly, I'm not sure.

438
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,392
Jogging partner?

439
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:19,959
Who are you?

440
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,744
Without being too melodramatic
about the whole thing,

441
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:24,263
I'm Sarah Corvus.

442
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:26,939
The first bionic woman.

443
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,120
So, what did they replace?

444
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:37,117
I figured the eyes and the ears.

445
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:38,945
What else?

446
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:42,295
Me, they did both arms, both legs.

447
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:43,957
Only one eye.

448
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:47,506
Anthros wasn't sure
about the optical interface.

449
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,514
So I did the other one myself.

450
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,189
Part of my chest, too.

451
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,032
I'm cutting away all the parts of me
that are weak.

452
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:08,070
Time in.

453
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:24,958
You only have one bionic arm.

454
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:30,220
You should really do something
about that.

455
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,334
You gotta have to do
a little better than that.

456
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,128
How am I doing now?

457
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,784
Not bad.

458
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:43,382
Not bad at all.

459
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,502
<i>We have a 39 year old male caucasian,</i>

460
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,468
<i>gunshot victim to the left shoulder.</i>

461
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:17,269
<i>Request assistance
from Mercy General.</i>

462
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:21,649
Will gonna make it?

463
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,525
Miss Sommers!

464
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,449
Just wanted to get a look at you.

465
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:52,814
Who are you?

466
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,738
We have 50 million $ worth
of my property inside you

467
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,699
so I guess you could say
I'm your landlord.

468
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,270
What do you want from me?

469
00:41:02,638 --> 00:41:05,932
I don't know. Maybe you died 3 days ago,
and you haven't realized it yet.

470
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,989
- Is that a threat?
- There are no free agents here.

471
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,539
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
a choice. It goes something like this.

472
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:14,570
Heads, you loose.
Tails, you die.

473
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,037
Welcome in the game.

474
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:29,604
If we do this...

475
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,533
whatever this is.

476
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:33,840
We do it on my terms.

477
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:37,282
If that's not okay with you...

478
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,299
I know what I'm capable of now.

479
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,643
So you send whoever you send.

480
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,424
And I'll bury one guy after the next.

481
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:49,816
You understand me?

482
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,038
By the way.

483
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:58,277
Sarah Corvus says hello.

484
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,522
Tell Jae we have a candidate.

485
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,468
What are you doing?

486
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:44,203
I haven't seen the moon
in a thousand and twenty three days.

487
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:47,212
It hasn't changed.
Let's go.

488
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:49,750
We've got a work to do.

489
