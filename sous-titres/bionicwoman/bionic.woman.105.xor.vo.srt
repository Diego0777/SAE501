1
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,534
You alright, soldier?

2
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,573
You need a doctor?

3
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,262
Easy soldier.

4
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,645
You'll be alright.

5
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,884
Just put that gun down.

6
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,631
What about Jeremy, the one's in the bar?

7
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:12,619
- Married.
- Not happily.

8
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:15,224
- You're in a good mood tonight.
- I'm always in a good mood.

9
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,664
Honey, you've been walking around
miserable all week.

10
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,732
Seriously, what's going on with you?

11
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,000
It's like the weight of
the world's on you lately.

12
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,833
That's what margaritas are for.

13
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,246
What about my brother?

14
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,704
Euh, no.

15
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:30,838
Why not?

16
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,208
- Because honestly, Robin, he's gay.
- He is not!

17
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:36,269
It's fine, just stop trying
to set him up with your girlfriends.

18
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,615
Because you are so cynical.

19
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,905
Besides, I don't need
a man in my life right now.

20
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:42,002
Yes, you do, honey, it's almost winter.

21
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:45,708
Every day is precious. Trust me,
I don't need a man to make me happy.

22
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:47,555
That is really sad.

23
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,932
- Pathetic.
- Yeah, ditto.

24
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:53,532
Oh, my god. Girls, look at this.

25
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:57,463
names of the victims will be released
after the families have been notified.

26
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:01,410
This is a stunning and tragic event.
The soldier was a P.O.W.

27
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,133
Held captive and feared dead
for two months.

28
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,482
He was set to ship homelater this week.

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,598
Hello.

30
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,272
We have a situation.

31
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,016
What is it?

32
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,182
It's supposed to be
a treatment for depression.

33
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:20,673
I feel better already.

34
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:22,734
It has to be implanted in your brain.

35
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:26,217
But this particular neural implant
has some side-effects.

36
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,391
Three american soldiers,

37
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:32,498
All P.O.W.'S held
by an al-qaeda cell, all released.

38
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:36,829
All suddenly make very specific
attacks on their own men.

39
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,018
They're like human car bombs.

40
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:42,874
They all had this neural implant?

41
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,580
Yeah, we don't know what it does, but...

42
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,929
We know where it comes from.

43
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:48,861
Professor Howard Samuels.

44
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,500
He runs the country's most
cutting-edge lab developing

45
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,244
These things at stanwick university.

46
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,463
How about we start by arresting samuels?

47
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,184
We're not cops.

48
00:02:57,698 --> 00:03:01,095
Antonio's gonna go after the buyer,
and you're going after the implant.

49
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,459
So what, I break into the lab?

50
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,133
It's not that simple.

51
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,458
- What's this?
- Student I.D.

52
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:10,288
You're going to college.
You're transferring in from england.

53
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,252
How's your british accent?

54
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:28,158
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: bbd1980, IceFre@k

55
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,756
Okay, these are the basic classes

56
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,977
you would've had taken
as a transfer student

57
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,245
in neurobiology.

58
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:43,956
Cellular neuroscience,

59
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,528
which is just about how neurons
process physiological

60
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,067
And electrochemical signals.

61
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,106
Glad that's all it's about.

62
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,073
System neuroscience, which is just about
how neurons, you know, from circuits

63
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,137
Can you just stop saying
"which is just about?"

64
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,812
This is an insane amount of information
to process this quickly.

65
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,017
You have to pull up that
harvard part of your brain.

66
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,212
The part that never went to
harvard is much bigger.

67
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,432
Besides, I was gonna
major in irish literature.

68
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,962
Wow, then you dodged a bullet
when you didn't go,

69
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,081
Because you would've ended up a hundred
grand in debt and still a bartender.

70
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,130
Science, Jamie.
That's what pays the bills.

71
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:16,212
I'm gonna look like a total idiot.
You can't fake math and sciences.

72
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,913
Okay, just calm down.

73
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,962
Going to college was a fantasy for me.

74
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:22,497
But in my fantasy, I'm hanging out
with intellectual people,

75
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,456
Tossing a frisbee around,
making a nice pot of earl grey,

76
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:27,561
and finishing my dissertation on
James Joyce.

77
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,458
Wow, we have very little in common.

78
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,908
I'm gonna a total idiot faking my way
through cellular neuron science physio

79
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,253
- Yeah, neuroscience.
- Yeah

80
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,858
You could wear glasses.
Then you would look smarter.

81
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:43,200
Thank you, nathan, for that completely
unhelpful suggestion.

82
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:49,078
Just doing my job. "Thank you, nathan."
You're welcome!

83
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,074
So primarysomatosensory cortex,

84
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,822
we have areas one, two, and
three defined by

85
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:12,759
the medial longitudinal fissure,
central and lateral sulcus.

86
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,289
This region receives the majority

87
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,432
Young lady, you are new?

88
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,295
Sorry. Sorry.

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,212
Yes, I, um...
I just transferred in from oxford.

90
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:32,518
Clarissa Whyte.

91
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:35,676
I presume english is your first
language.

92
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,701
Yes.

93
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,913
Then perhaps you can tell me
what that sign says.

94
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,405
No cell phones.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,234
Well, come on, a little conviction
in your voice. Try again.

96
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,142
No cell phones.

97
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,531
That is so much better.

98
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,583
Now you're on the roll,
perhaps you can tell me

99
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,342
when my lecture's interrupted
by students

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
who can't remember to
turn off their cell phones,

101
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:59,267
what area of my brain is firing
like crazy?

102
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,623
Well, that would be

103
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,772
I'll give you a hint. It's the region
that processes emotions like irritation.

104
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:10,251
If that doesn't help, it's bordered by
the inferior and middletemporal area.

105
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:16,117
That would be brodmann area 38,

106
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:19,172
Also known as the polar gyrus.

107
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,569
Yes, that is correct.

108
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,569
Keep your cellphones off in my classroom

109
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,247
How about this? Faraj habib.

110
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:42,566
I'd say if he weren't in guantanamo
right now he'd be our guy.

111
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,320
Nadeem samad?

112
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,363
I like him for this.

113
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,711
He has no known ties to any terrorist
organisation.

114
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:52,180
He has no criminal record.

115
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,625
He graduated college with honors.

116
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:57,300
He started obsessively visiting
terrorist web sites for 14 months ago.

117
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm on web site all the time.

118
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
You're doing research.

119
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:02,063
Maybe he was too,
doing a paper in college.

120
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:06,017
He took two classes with professor
Samuels and became a practicing muslim

121
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,089
All in the same time period.

122
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,230
Ruth, this is racial profiling.

123
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,397
Or brilliant detective work.

124
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,306
Check him out.

125
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,117
Hey.

126
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,297
Aoki!

127
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,748
Every time you crumple that paper,
it makes me want to kill myself.

128
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,750
That's what my last roommate did.

129
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,564
Great

130
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,530
It was great.

131
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,551
I got all "a"s for the semester.

132
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,090
You're kidding.

133
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:45,254
Yes.

134
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:46,677
What are you working on?

135
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,059
Neuroscience lab work.

136
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,765
Really? I love that class.

137
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,626
Easy "A."

138
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,594
Of course you did.
What are you working on?

139
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,555
I have a paper on James Joyce due.

140
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,516
- Yeah?
- Yeah

141
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:04,839
The dead. I don't even understand
what it's about.

142
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,470
It's all, like,
irish and stupid and nothing happens

143
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,841
No, it's a great book. It's all from the
husband's point of view the whole time,

144
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,998
until the end of the book, when his wife
tells a story about her first love.

145
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,290
And the husband, who's been so loving
towards his wife all evening, realizes

146
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,360
She wasn't even thinking about him.
She was thinking about her first love,

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,752
who's dead.
It's about how you can't escape.

148
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:26,234
Like somebody dies, and you
think you're free, but you're not.

149
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:29,578
The dead are always there.
Which is a different ending to ulysses,

150
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,164
which is all about love, and life,
and sex, and optimism

151
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,783
Okay. You want to just do it for me?

152
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:39,821
You want to do my lab work?

153
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:41,131
Deal.

154
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,606
Deal, of these chocolate bars.

155
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:44,553
Sure.

156
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:49,313
There's a... a party later,

157
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:52,067
if you want to go with me.

158
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,865
So do you know lots of people here?

159
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:57,405
Eh, a few.

160
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,283
Ooh, there's food here.

161
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:02,933
Yeah, okay.

162
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,513
Hey, the transfer student from oxford.

163
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,090
The merciful T.A.

164
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,116
Tom Gilchrist.

165
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,821
Clarissa. Nice to meet you.

166
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:17,592
Thank you so much for earlier.

167
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,771
I totally blanked.

168
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,761
Well, Samuels can be intimidating.

169
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,241
Yeah, he is a little

170
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,009
He's a mean, mean cranky old man.

171
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:25,198
Yes, he is.

172
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,341
But you're very nice to take pity on me.

173
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:31,307
Um, can I interest
you in a tasty beverage?

174
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,377
A tasty beverage. Who... Step off.
Who is this guy?

175
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,955
You know what they say about the brits.
We love our drinks.

176
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,522
Go away!

177
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:44,811
He's trying to get you drunk.
Can't you see that?

178
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,291
Vodka, wine?

179
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,381
Uh, wine.

180
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,393
So you must be lonely being
so far away from home.

181
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,248
Actually, no, it's quite exciting
being in America and all.

182
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,130
I feel like felicity.

183
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,720
Only she wasn't from england, and she
wasn't a scientist, and she went to

184
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,887
College to look for a guy, which
I didn't, so...

185
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:11,141
I don't feel like felicity at all.

186
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,860
I don't know what I'm saying.
Can you talk now?

187
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:16,727
I kind of like listening
to you free associate.

188
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,811
I feel a little discombobulated.

189
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:20,056
Jet lag.

190
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:23,178
How about you? How long have
you been samuels' T.A?

191
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:27,222
Oh, just this semester.
It's too bad he's such a bastard,

192
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:29,017
Because he really is brilliant.

193
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:33,105
He's... doing work that's going
to make a difference.

194
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:37,693
It's his work in neural imaging research
that made me want to become his T.A.

195
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:40,440
My... my dad...

196
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:44,044
Died of parkinson's last year.

197
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,904
I'm so sorry.

198
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,075
Aw, oh, yeah?

199
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,049
Oh, god, the oldest
trickin the book, Sommers.

200
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:52,772
Answer the phone!

201
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:57,396
But after he was diagnosed,
it was a wake up call.

202
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,273
Before that, I was a bit of a screw-up.

203
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,869
Almost dropped out of college.

204
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,451
You'd never know it.

205
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,899
I want to be a neurosurgeon.

206
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,764
Neurosurgeon? Oh, what?
Was astronaut taken? Am I right?

207
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,511
I want to help people.

208
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,856
I want to change their lives.

209
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,888
You know, I want to make

210
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,905
- I'm sorry. This is boring.
- No, no.

211
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:27,630
Yes, chatty cathy, cut the cord.
God, what...

212
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:32,156
Hate to have to do this to you, Jamie,
but you leave me no choice.

213
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,623
You all right?

214
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:38,305
Ow, yeah, bionic ear's hurting.

215
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:41,021
Yeah, earache.

216
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:43,120
I-I left my drops at home.

217
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:44,889
Could you excuse me?

218
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:51,201
You're an ass.

219
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,331
tick tock, okay?

220
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,269
The changeover for
the lab isn't till 11:00.

221
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,583
Which is in five minutes.

222
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:58,673
Yeah, I know what time is it.
I was doing, what you call it, recon.

223
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,892
Recon? You can't just throw around
the word recon, okay? That wasn't recon.

224
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,512
That guy wants to be on top of you.

225
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,003
Really? Do you think so?

226
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:09,047
Get your head in the game, Sommers.
You gotta get over to the museum.

227
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,871
What are you eating?

228
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,004
Chinese food.

229
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,615
Kung pao cafe? You get the moo shu?

230
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:15,877
Low mein chicken.

231
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,282
The moo shu's better.

232
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,493
Okay, you should see a ladder
to the roof.

233
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:26,282
There's no ladder.
Okay, what's plan "b"?

234
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:30,151
Um... plan "b" is your bionic.
Figure it out.

235
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,128
Okay, hold on.

236
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:39,467
You okay?

237
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:44,551
Yeah, just hanging on to my cell phone.
It messed me up.

238
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,620
So typical of this place.
They spend $50 million on you,

239
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,957
And then won't spring for a bluetooth.

240
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,202
By the way, I'll bet my paycheck that
the story about his dad dying

241
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,877
Of parkinson's was a load of... crap!

242
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:00,294
You're so cynical, nathan.
It's not attractive.

243
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,251
I'm telling you as a friend.

244
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:05,252
I'm just saying that you can't believe
everything everybody says to you.

245
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:07,698
And I'm just saying you have to assume
the best in people.

246
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:10,885
You have to assume that not
everyone is trying to screw you over.

247
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,847
Even if it's hard sometimes.

248
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,221
Okay, hang on a sec.

249
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:26,637
Okay, where was I?

250
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:30,052
Not everyone is gonna want to screw
with you, even if it's hard to believe.

251
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,204
Wow, that'd be a good attitude
to have if you weren't a spy.

252
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,115
Why are you not in the lab already?

253
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,681
I'm going as fast as I can, bossy.

254
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,027
Crap.

255
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,009
The glass is wired.

256
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,202
Don't worry, it's an analog circuit.
We can override that easy schmeezy.

257
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:48,290
Can you find the contacts?

258
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,705
By the way, why are you
using the accent with me?

259
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,244
I'm a method actor.

260
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,541
Fine by me. It's literally
the hottest thing ever.

261
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,875
Found 'em.

262
00:13:58,252 --> 00:13:59,052
Okay.

263
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,013
You gotta put something metal between
the contact points to keep the circuit

264
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,607
from breaking.
Like a paperclip or a hairpin.

265
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:08,388
Or a steel bar.

266
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,804
Okay, give me the code.

267
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,163
3 q r 4 6 5 1.

268
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,987
I'm here, I'm in.

269
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:39,608
What do I do?

270
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:42,655
Computer, let's start scanning.
We need to get the dirt on samuels.

271
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,295
So I'm a glorified fax machine?

272
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,191
Come on, don't sell yourself short.

273
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,011
You also open cans.

274
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:52,566
we need to find out who he may have
contacted about the neural implants.

275
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:56,562
Okay, old journal articles.

276
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:59,906
M p t p neurotoxicity.

277
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:03,958
Apparently the guy's a pioneer
in parkinson's simulation.

278
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:06,433
There's some grant applications.

279
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,069
Wait.

280
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,581
Synthetic neurotransducers.

281
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,784
That's it, right, nathan?

282
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,332
No, it looks good.
Now let's get out of there.

283
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,220
What are you doing?

284
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,032
I'm just curious about him.
I want to know how old he is.

285
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,712
Unbelievable.

286
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,768
Professor samuels.

287
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,693
I know who you are.

288
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,309
Sean, go back to my office
and get started on the research

289
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,331
while I talk to Ms. Whyte.

290
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:45,327
I'm well aware of every pharmaceutical
company, competing university,

291
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,582
And everyone else trying to steal
information from us.

292
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:49,924
I don't know what you're talking about.
I transferred in from Oxford.

293
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,285
I don't care where you're from.

294
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:53,268
I want to know what you
were doing in my lab.

295
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:55,557
Sir, I've wanted to be
part of this program for years.

296
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:58,206
You know, you're a pioneer
in parkinson's simulation.

297
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,742
That's why i transferred here.
Your work is cutting edge.

298
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,319
And I made such an idiot of myself
in class, and someone said

299
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:06,329
if I wanted to get back in the good
books to clean out the monkey cages,

300
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:08,995
and now I realize it was a joke,
and I feel so stupid.

301
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,084
How did you get past security?

302
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,269
The door was unlocked.

303
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,302
Clarissa, what are you

304
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,646
You didn't actually clean out
the monkey cages, did you?

305
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,049
Yeah, I did.

306
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:26,212
I told her to do that.

307
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,048
Sorry. I'm also the one
that left the door unlocked.

308
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,883
I forgot some papers to grade.
I came back to get them.

309
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,980
The only reason I'm here now is because
I remembered i left the door unlocked.

310
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,316
Never happen again. So...

311
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:42,848
You're dedicated. I'll give you that.

312
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:45,756
Okay, Tom.

313
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,563
How about you escort Ms. Whyte out.

314
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,044
I'm watching you.

315
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,405
Thanks.

316
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,504
What were you actually doing in there?

317
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,255
- The truth?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,846
I was trying to get
a copy of the lecture.

319
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,210
I, um, can't read my notes,
and I'm in way over my head.

320
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,951
Well, I can help you with that.

321
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,066
You can?

322
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,575
For a price.

323
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,815
Dinner, Tomorrow
night.8:00 work for you?

324
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,484
I'm supposed to buy you dinner?

325
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,458
I'm buying. I just want you to show up.

326
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:34,669
Sure.

327
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,745
didn't turn out quite as well as I
would've hoped, but...

328
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,078
you know what?

329
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:52,931
The next time

330
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:56,290
You have a crappy lame hunch like this,
put nathan on it, please.

331
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,503
What's the latest?

332
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,823
They're getting through the appetizers.
She had the caesar.

333
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:03,780
He had the soup du jour.
Both were wonderful.

334
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,789
The tortilla soup was a little spicier
than he expected.

335
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,598
And I swear to god, if I have to sit
here while they order dessert,

336
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,209
I'm gonna kill you.

337
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:16,904
What a minute,

338
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:17,990
Hold on.

339
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,498
Hello.

340
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,572
Yes, that's right.

341
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:25,073
Sunday won't be acceptable. Friday.

342
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,476
We said 5,000

343
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,241
Get backup. We're gonna
need someone on this guy 24/7.

344
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:36,371
There are those who find dna mapping
to be the key to our future.

345
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:40,095
Me, it's the map of the brain.
The way we think.

346
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,392
How, why, who we are is in here.

347
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:46,283
Yes?

348
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,175
Check this out.

349
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:55,760
Before the implant, the subject's
tremors were so severe he couldn't hold

350
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,265
A knife, a fork, drive a car.

351
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,186
That's amazing.

352
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,141
You think that's good?

353
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:03,386
Watch this.

354
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,591
He can juggle. Great.

355
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,138
No, you're missing the point.

356
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:17,593
The neural implant not only reroutes the
pathways, but it acts as a receiver.

357
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,621
You send a signal to juggle,
and he juggles.

358
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:25,049
What you're seeing there...
totally involuntary.

359
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,035
- It's sick.
- Wait, you can make him do that?

360
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,177
Anything. Watch this.

361
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:36,355
When a computer takes over his body,
the subject can be more coordinated

362
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:38,735
and capable than he ever was before.

363
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:41,761
Stop it.

364
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:44,902
Stop it.

365
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,977
We can modify pain tolerance too.

366
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,989
Brave new world, isn't it?

367
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:55,985
What do we got?

368
00:19:56,151 --> 00:20:00,002
Nothing. The guy hasn't made any
modifications to the application.

369
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,207
He's just treating parkinson's.

370
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,028
There's no money trail with him either.

371
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,993
Maybe he's not the guy.

372
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:13,710
Who's that?

373
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,379
Oh, it's the T.A. who's trying to get
into Jamie's pants.

374
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,482
- Really.
- I know.

375
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:22,830
It's like, "keep your grubby hands off
our 50 million dollar piece of..."

376
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:24,500
Yeah, right, right, right, right.

377
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,930
So what do we know about him?

378
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,080
He went to undergrad at Stanford.

379
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,570
Majored in cognitive
and neurosystem sciences.

380
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh, really.

381
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,428
I went to Stanford.

382
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:46,120
I just think that technology
has become way too advanced.

383
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,430
Isn't it creepy?

384
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,440
I mean, it's mind control.

385
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:52,530
Well, the possibility for abuse exists,

386
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,143
but think of all the people who...

387
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,170
You know what, I don't want to
talk about the chip.

388
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,331
Let's talk about you.

389
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,715
You're just here for a semester, right?

390
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,990
I guess I have to work fast then.

391
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,338
I know, bold.

392
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,160
Just tell me if i have to slow down.

393
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,807
This is... this is cool.

394
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,750
I just realized this
is my college fantasy.

395
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,060
This is just what I
thought it would be like.

396
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,960
What?

397
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:25,979
What?

398
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,337
- You have something on your nose.
- Oh, god!

399
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,241
- No, it's okay. Here, wait.
- Embarrassing.

400
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,693
I think you need a little more on there.

401
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:45,206
Hi!

402
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,520
Hi.

403
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,424
What, you're not gonna
introduce me, Clarissa?

404
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,275
- This is tony, my...
- Uncle.

405
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,180
How are you?

406
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,370
I know, it confuses a lot of people,
me being american and all.

407
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,300
Sure. Hi, tony.

408
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,233
I'm Tom.

409
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,980
Shouldn't you be at work?
Actually, I need a little word.

410
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,743
It's really important.

411
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:16,549
Oh, well, I gotta get going anyway,
but it's great meeting you.

412
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,790
We're still on for 8:00, right?

413
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,290
Dinner, you and me?

414
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,210
Okay.

415
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:24,610
What the hell is that about?

416
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:26,730
We think Samuels is clean.

417
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,930
But that guy Tom is under some scrutiny.

418
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,940
He only has a paper trail for the last
six years. Before that, nothing.

419
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,518
That doesn't mean he's involved.

420
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:36,205
He says he majored at cognitive
neurosystem sciences at Stanford.

421
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,450
There isn't a degree
of that name at Stanford.

422
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:41,210
So he lied on his application.
A lot of people do.

423
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,450
He's had a hard time.

424
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:44,907
His dad died of parkinson's, you know.

425
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,570
We have to assume that
he's the enemy, Jamie.

426
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,240
I don't believe it.

427
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,940
My gut tells me he has
nothing to do with this.

428
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:56,064
the last time you listened to your gut,
you had your limbs replaced.

429
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,300
Your paper's done, I emailed it to you.

430
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,550
Mmm, these are delicious.

431
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:16,160
I know, huh?

432
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,800
I have some butterfingers
hidden in the bathroom,

433
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,840
but they're better dipped
in butterscotch pudding.

434
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:24,250
What's with all the hiding food?

435
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:26,390
I just like secret food, okay?

436
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,708
Why is that such a big deal?

437
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,542
It's time to take my meds.

438
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,188
Hello.

439
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:40,688
I thought we should have a
little post-first kiss caucus.

440
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:43,557
I'm good with the kiss.
It was great.

441
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,469
Um, let's do it again some time.

442
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,260
Well, what are you doing right now?

443
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,461
Oh, not now. I'm cramming.

444
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,337
I have to go to the bookstore
to get this book on neuroscience.

445
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,440
Microchips for dummies,
I think it's called.

446
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,180
Supposed to be brilliant.

447
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,480
All right.

448
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,210
We still on for 8:00?

449
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:01,334
Absolutely.

450
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,802
Great.

451
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:05,192
Bye.

452
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,040
Bye.

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, my god.

454
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,485
You totally like him.

455
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:33,760
Stop!

456
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:35,710
You have no idea what I can do to you.

457
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,681
I can't stop myself.

458
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:38,720
Help me.

459
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:46,710
They matches the one they
pulled out the soldier in iraq.

460
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:47,846
My god.

461
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,410
- Is he gonna be okay?
- They think so.

462
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:52,943
Who knew where you were going?

463
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:55,891
Tom.

464
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,860
- What did I tell you?
- It wasn't him.

465
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,899
Can I just...

466
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,434
What does a guy have to do to get
you to break up with him?

467
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:04,570
He had you manchurian candidated.

468
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:06,820
The drop is now up to 5,000 chips.

469
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:07,747
That's it.

470
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,760
- I'm pulling you off this.
- No, you're not.

471
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,010
- Yes, he is. It's too dangerous.
- I can help.

472
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:15,860
If he's the bad guy, I want to know just
as much as you do.

473
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:16,860
Come on.

474
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:20,322
You're not gonna get
anybody closer to him than me.

475
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,898
How's your sushi?

476
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:29,088
Mmm, good.

477
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:32,710
How's yours?

478
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,230
Yeah, it's great.

479
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:35,594
I love sushi.

480
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:38,510
I don't really like sushi.

481
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,489
Sorry.

482
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,700
It's okay, I don't
really like sushi either.

483
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:43,808
Well, why did we come here?

484
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:47,141
I'm sorry, this is a little weird.

485
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,347
- You feel weird.
- You just seem kind of stressed.

486
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,836
- Do I?
- Just a little bit.

487
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:54,576
It feels like something's on your mind.
You look a little preoccupied.

488
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm sorry, I just insulted you,
didn't I?

489
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,545
That was terrible.

490
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,600
This is not going the
way I wanted it to go.

491
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,040
I didn't mean that, you look beautiful.
You really do.

492
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,740
And I don't know why I'm still talking.

493
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,660
This is going kind of awfully.

494
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:11,124
You look amazing, and I'm...
All I'm doing is insulting you.

495
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,717
It's really terrible.

496
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:15,340
- Do you want to...
- Do you want to get out of here?

497
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,963
- I would love that.
- Shall we?

498
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:20,718
- I think that's a great idea.
- Best idea you've had all night.

499
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:39,498
You know what would be good?

500
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,876
I'm one step ahead you.

501
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,180
Do you...
I know this may sound silly.

502
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,426
Do you have any champagne?

503
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,027
Do...

504
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,454
You want champagne?

505
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,600
All right, I'll get some champagne.

506
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:57,410
- What kind do you like?
- The pink kind.

507
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:58,982
Of course you do.

508
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,962
Be right back.

509
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,101
This guy's too good to be true.

510
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,338
Tarragon?

511
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,263
He is the perfect guy.

512
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,631
Tarragon?

513
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:29,849
He's too perfect.

514
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:40,302
He lied.

515
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,612
I'm an idiot.

516
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,542
We'll know if it's
the same chip by morning.

517
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,770
Nathan needs to run a few tests, so
we'll just keep him under observation.

518
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,830
He's gonna want to
know what happened to me.

519
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,369
And he's gonna want to know
what happened to his microchip.

520
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:55,020
No, just sit tight. We've got your
dorm room wired.

521
00:30:17,803 --> 00:30:20,488
Subject spotted with a blue sweater.

522
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:30,800
Subject at the door.

523
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,880
Five...

524
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,060
Four, three...

525
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,351
Two, one.

526
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,652
Let's do this.

527
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:01,210
Go, go, go!

528
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,290
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

529
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,718
Don't shoot, no!

530
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:07,060
Clear!

531
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,740
- What are you doing here?
- My brother lives here, man.

532
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,690
I was just dropping off his ipod.

533
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:17,340
I swear to you.

534
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,731
This is for transporting the chips.

535
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,732
Who supplies to you?

536
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:39,766
I don't know what you're talking about

537
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:42,250
What I am talking about is
the everest project!

538
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:46,315
What I am talking about is US soldiers
that you are participating in murdering.

539
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:50,760
Tell me who is supplying to you...

540
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,680
Now.

541
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:19,740
Was that your family?

542
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,690
Is this why you did what you did?

543
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,214
Nadeem...

544
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,020
You're killing innocent men.

545
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,596
That's all you're accomplishing.

546
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:38,782
Tell me where the drop is
and when the drop is,

547
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,399
and no one else needs
to get hurt by this.

548
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,299
This is what I think.

549
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:47,933
Too many people have died already.

550
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,280
Your people...

551
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,139
Our people.

552
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,156
So let's just end this.

553
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:57,612
Here.

554
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:16,330
Hello.

555
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:18,120
Jamie, the chip's a match.

556
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,248
Antonio just found out
the drop is now, right now.

557
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:23,250
We're on our way, so you follow him.
Do not let him make the drop.

558
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:25,140
Kill him if you have to.

559
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,164
- Hey, Lee.?

560
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:02,050
Here, man.

561
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,230
Got the answers to the final, all right?

562
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:06,000
You're a friggin'angel, man.

563
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,834
- I know.
- Thank you.

564
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,537
- Excuse me. Can I have that?
- What?

565
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:18,357
- Give me your paper?
- No, that's mine.

566
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:20,079
- Just give it to me.
- No, it's mine.

567
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:22,142
- I need this, okay?
- No, you don't understand...

568
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,276
Back away...

569
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,861
- I need that...
- Back away!

570
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,232
Crazy bitch!

571
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:32,350
Let me guess.

572
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,291
You stand him up too?

573
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:37,166
Obviously you thought I was handing
him something covert.

574
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,609
- No, I...
- Who are you?

575
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,740
- Who are you?
- I asked you first.

576
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:43,140
- Why were you following me?
- I wasn't following you.

577
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,300
Are you FBI?

578
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,415
- No!
- You're friggin'FBI, aren't you?

579
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,730
- You're supposed to leave this to us.
- Who is us?

580
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:51,380
My god, are you like a CIA agent?

581
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:54,580
Well, what the hell are you?

582
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:56,856
I'm with the Berkut group.

583
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,451
The Berkut group.

584
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:01,939
The insidious, arrogant, always
getting in our way...

585
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,976
Oh, did I mention arrogant...
Berkut group?

586
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,450
Look, it's really just
a temporary gig for me, okay?

587
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:09,970
I thought it was you.

588
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:11,377
Well, it's not.

589
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,543
I thought... thought maybe it was you.

590
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,290
You're the good guy.

591
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:18,950
Well, CIA.

592
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:21,100
It's open to interpretation.

593
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,969
The Berkut group had
you investigating me?

594
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,310
First samuels, then you.

595
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,425
Sorry.

596
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,290
That's why you went out with me,
isn't it?

597
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,350
Yeah... I mean, not at first,
but then yeah.

598
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,700
- That really sucks.
- Why'd you want to go out with me?

599
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:35,867
Because I thought
you might be the buyer.

600
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:37,001
Same thing.

601
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:38,504
No, it's completely different.

602
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,430
I marked you off my list before...
What happened to your accent?

603
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,320
- I'm not really from england.
- Oh, that's disappointing.

604
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:48,222
I loved the way you said "brilliant.
it was really a selling point."

605
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,375
It turned me on.

606
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:52,445
You wanting to be neurosurgeon was
a big turn on and selling point for me,

607
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,828
and that was crap, right?

608
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,319
Your name's not Clarissa, is it?

609
00:35:56,465 --> 00:35:58,200
You're not Tom?

610
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,339
Hello, sean.

611
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,718
You got it?

612
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,193
Stay right here.
We'll come to you.

613
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,060
Wait, isn't that... yeah, it is.

614
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:16,970
They're making the drop.

615
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,360
All right, I'll go down,
you stay up here and cover me.

616
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,310
Don't underestimate me.

617
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,873
Relax, i'm trying to be chivalrous.

618
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,781
Drop the bag, Sean.

619
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,810
- That wasn't a request.
- Don't do it.

620
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,587
Oh, I think you should do what I say.

621
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,904
I'm not afraid to die.

622
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,736
I can arrange that.

623
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:01,790
You all right?

624
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,799
Look out!

625
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,580
Get up or die.

626
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,780
Get up, get up, get up.

627
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,404
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!

628
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:11,813
Don't move, man.

629
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,011
I swear to you, don't move.

630
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,419
Where's Sean?

631
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,906
You got some cuffs on you?

632
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:20,515
You want to cuff him?

633
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,625
How did you do that?

634
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,263
Top secret.

635
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,698
You all right?

636
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,540
I'm good.

637
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,540
Had a nice chat with our boy sean.

638
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,160
Why'd he do it?

639
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,550
Some deeply distorted political reason?

640
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,670
Money.

641
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,960
So why does the CIA hate berkut so much?

642
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,230
Well, you ask me, they're jealous.

643
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,830
We do what the military,
the CIA, and the FBI can't.

644
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,815
We don't have any
red tape or bureaucracy.

645
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,390
We get things done, Jamie.

646
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,799
Not a good idea.

647
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,080
- I can't believe you're leaving.
- I have to go back to england.

648
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,650
Family emergency.

649
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,340
That's too bad.

650
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:55,348
You were my favorite roommate.

651
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:58,575
Check it out.

652
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,200
You got an A on your james joyce paper.

653
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:06,290
Now the prof wants me to
apply to her graduate program.

654
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:09,183
So I don't know how
I'm gonna get out of that.

655
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:13,642
Keep it.

656
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,275
I'm late for class.

657
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,270
See you around.

658
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:23,390
See you.

659
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,180
Where are you going?

660
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:59,780
I was just, uh, casing the joint.

661
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:03,760
- You know, gonna rob you later.
- You were coming to see me?

662
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:07,786
Yeah, I was just... you know...
I wanted to see how you were, and...

663
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,822
Come on, help me pack.

664
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:17,000
So I joined the army
right after high school.

665
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,613
They gave me some tests.

666
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:22,889
Sent me to college, trained me,
and put me right in the field.

667
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,200
I've got a nice face.

668
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,130
People trust me.

669
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,399
That's true.

670
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,530
So...

671
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,248
What about you?

672
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:38,710
I mean, what's your story?

673
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,850
I mean, you've got quite an arm.

674
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,470
Were you a quarterback
in high school or something?

675
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,450
I don't want to talk about that.

676
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,910
It's my last night at college.
Can we just hang out?

677
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,070
Pretend we're normal?
Can we just have a night?

678
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,185
Yeah.

679
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,920
Wait, wait.

680
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,580
I don't even know your name.

681
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,230
Jamie.

682
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,076
Jamie sommers.

683
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,779
Hi, Jamie.
