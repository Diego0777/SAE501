00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:02,463
<i>Previously on Bionic Woman</i>

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:05,090
If I had the pleasure to take
this monster down, I'd along

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,762
- from that roof-top.
- You've done this before, haven't you?

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,270
You wanna tell me why you knew
he was arriving at the airport

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,882
before Jonas even called me?

6
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,057
Just trust me.

7
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,531
<i>They know you were here.</i>

8
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,229
They're sending more agents now.

9
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,147
Antonio is communicating
with the assassin.

10
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,054
You're gonna have to bring him in.

11
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:24,686
Actually, you're gonna
have to bring him in.

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,155
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

13
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:29,907
- I heard you with the assassin.
- I'm not working with the assassin.

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,157
But I do know her.

15
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,393
- She saved my life.
- Why the hell should I believe

16
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:36,593
- any of what you're saying?
- You gotta believe me on this one.

17
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:37,713
<I>Julia, stop!

18
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,556
- Take the shot, Antonio.
- Shut up, Sommers.

19
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,724
He just had such a rough exterior,
you know?

20
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:01,111
You think that he doesn't care
if you're having a rough day or not,

21
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:02,706
But he does.

22
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:04,617
Or he did.

23
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:06,420
To Antonio Pope.

24
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,195
It was an honor to know him,
to work with him.

25
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:13,875
I'm gonna miss you, pal.

26
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:30,423
I slept with him once.

27
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:31,662
It was amazing.

28
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:49,748
Come here for a second.

29
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,037
So you doing okay?

30
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:58,268
Yeah, I'm good.

31
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,977
Because, you know, someone died,
someone who was...

32
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,414
A friend of yours,
who you cared about so...

33
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:08,898
You know what,

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,750
I'm getting used to it.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,865
Honky with the dread is off the hook.

36
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,815
<i>How do you think I would look
with those, honestly?</i>

37
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,922
I can tell
when you're rolling your eyes.

38
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,566
Can you tell when I don't care?

39
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,189
<i>Touché.</i>

40
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:36,414
<i>Why aren't you asking me who this guy is
and why we're following him?</i>

41
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,465
<i>Why aren't you peppering me
with questions?</i>

42
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,204
<i>- Fine, who is he?
- He's a bad guy.</i>

43
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,735
<i>Why is he a bad guy?</i>

44
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:43,674
Because he does bad things.

45
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,844
This is starting to sound
like phone sex.

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,264
If this is what phone sex sounds
like to you, you're doing it wrong.

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,176
<i>- You have no idea, do you?
- What about, sex?</i>

48
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,297
No, none, zero.

49
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,605
I do know that women cry
a lot afterwards.

50
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,943
- Who the hell are you?
- Shut up!

51
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,258
What the hell was that?

52
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:42,799
<i>How'bout you shut the hell up.</i>

53
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,794
We'll get to Berkut, you can ask
your questions to somebody who cares.

54
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,538
<i>- Would you just get up on your own?!
- She's totally pms-ing.</i>

55
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,799
<i>Get up!</i>

57
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,649
Hey, it's me.

58
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,861
Sorry we keep missing each other.

59
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:41,198
Had another long day at work, and I...
just need to hear a friendly voice.

60
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,703
You know, I'm starting to...

61
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,635
get really confused about
what I'm doing and why.

62
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,335
Now I have to go upstairs, and...

63
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,854
put on a big smile, and see my sister,
and pretend like everything's okay.

64
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,940
Anyway, you're probably working too,
so, well...

65
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,458
Call me later.

66
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:16,247
What is he doing here?

67
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,687
He's doing dishes.

68
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,322
Why?

69
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:26,263
I don't know. He's your boss.
Why don't you go talk to him.

70
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:27,896
Hey, you wanna dry?

71
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,086
Becks, could you give us a minute?

72
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:37,927
I don't know what you're doing,
but this is my personal space.

73
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:41,203
Your sister watches way too much tv.
This is the home of a depressed person.

74
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:43,267
I am working all hours,
and you come here

75
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,355
- and critize my housekeeping?
- I came over here

76
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:47,797
because I'm concerned about you.
You've been through a lot.

77
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,394
You need to take some time off.

78
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,855
Is this 'cause I kicked that guy's ass?

79
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,781
It's because Antonio was your friend.
And he died.

80
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,022
And you need time.

81
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:58,364
Work is the only thing
holding me together right now.

82
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,974
If I stop and think about everything
that has happened to me,

83
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:02,719
- I'm gonna go crazy.
- I understand.

84
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,511
But it's not a good strategy, Jamie.

85
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,631
I'm no asking you, I'm telling you.

86
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,017
You're gonna take a vacation,
and Berkut will pay for it.

87
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,566
I don't take handouts.

88
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,275
Okay, then you can make
a delivery for me.

89
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,718
I need to get a briefcase
to a man in Montana.

90
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,416
You give it to him,
take a week off.

91
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,094
- Do you like to hike?
- You sure that's it?

92
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:21,475
It's just a briefcase.

93
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:25,331
Antonio used to say a briefcase
is never just a briefcase.

94
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,961
Yeah, well...

95
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:29,898
Antonio's dead.

96
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,436
Are you mad at me?

97
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,309
Seems like you got something
on your mind.

98
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:08,479
That's the most you've said
for the past two days.

99
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:10,242
What are we doing?

100
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,830
I mean, why is it okay for me
to suddenly ditch school?

101
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:15,698
You're not ditching school.
I wrote you an excuse, so it's fine.

102
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:19,562
We're just taking a little trip.
That's what we're doing.

103
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,456
I mean, you mope around the house
for a week, not taking care of yourself.

104
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,506
And, mean, clearly something is wrong.

105
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,219
And now, all of a sudden,
we're on this trip.

106
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,153
What's gonna be accomplished?

107
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,153
You think we're gonna have deep talks
and bond?

108
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:34,029
Yeah, that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

109
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,267
We're gonna talk, take spa treatments,
grab some food,

110
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:39,337
make memories.
It's gonna be great.

111
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,411
What are you doing here?

112
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,053
I want you to train me.

113
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,456
Train you to what?

114
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,723
I want to learn how to fight.

115
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,770
Aren't you supposed to be
at a Star Trek convention?

116
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm serious, Jae.

117
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:12,972
What happened to your eye?

118
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,843
- JR.
- Who's JR?

119
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,224
He's

120
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,575
my older brother.

121
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,342
Sometimes he gets a little physical
with me.

122
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,896
Aren't you a little old

123
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:24,649
for your brother to be picking on you?

124
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,106
I'm also a little too old to be living
with my parents, but I'm working on it.

125
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,104
So why does he hit you?

126
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,235
He's just always been
a little jealous of me.

127
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:36,397
Why?

128
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,516
I just have to make a call.

129
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:56,931
- Don't you have to go to the bathroom.
- I do, I just need to make this call.

130
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,149
For work?

131
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,994
Look, it's the last one
I'm gonna make, okay?

132
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,449
After that, I'll give you my cell.
No more.

133
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:07,758
- Really?
- Really.

134
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,148
All right.

135
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:29,840
Sorry.

136
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:35,382
Sorry.

137
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,023
You're Jonas' girl?

138
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,961
Just say it so I can get out of here.

139
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,821
I give you the briefcase and go.

140
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:48,143
- So, all the rumours...
- Would you just say it?

141
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,959
You really have x-ray vision?

142
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,528
Yeah, I do.

143
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,408
Just say it.

144
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,341
In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent
to prison by military court

145
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,660
for a crime they didn't commit.
They promptly escaped

146
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,245
from maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

147
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,060
Still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

148
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,872
You have a problem,
no one can help,

149
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,457
you can find them,
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

150
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,639
You want me do the theme song for you?

151
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,647
Have a nice life.

152
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,213
You're registered in the Green Party?

153
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,333
What?

154
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,931
Are you actually gonna vote
for Dennis Kucinich?

155
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,455
- How do you know this?
- Visual caller ID.

156
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:53,635
Anyone calls my line,
I see their photo,

157
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,134
date of birth, social security number,
criminal record...

158
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,994
Nathan set it up for me.

159
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,234
<i>Is that legal?</i>

160
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:01,724
How's the vacation going?

161
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:03,028
<i>Your guy's a nut job.</i>

162
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,209
Is it done?

163
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:07,102
Bye, Jonas.

164
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,151
Thank you.

165
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:20,583
- You sure you don't miss your phone?
- Not even a little.

166
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,588
Your thumbs must go through withdrawal.

167
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,496
You haven't texted anyone in,
like, an hour.

168
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,770
Leave me alone.

169
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,432
So what are we gonna do?

170
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,266
There's a million things to do.

171
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,440
There's horseback riding.
There's a spa.

172
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,508
There's friggin'ballroom
dancing classes.

173
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,699
There's meditation with gems.
That sounds different.

174
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:42,097
How'bout we go up to the room,
order some room service, turn on the tv.

175
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:44,876
You know, eat, get really fat,
so no one will love us.

176
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,084
God, I love you.

177
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:47,853
Come on, let's go.

178
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,880
Switch.

179
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:10,821
Switch.

180
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:07,088
- Okay, how can I help you?
- Our on demand isn't working,

181
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,787
and tv's
really important to us.

182
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,949
- We'll send up an engineer. What room?
- 108.

183
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,064
- You're 108?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,886
This guy has been
calling for you for the past hour.

185
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,409
He ask me to go to your room
and knock on the door.

186
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,497
But I told him
it against hotel policy.

187
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,806
He's a very pushy man.

188
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,917
- Sorry.
- You break it, you have to pay.

189
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,207
Excuse me.
Front desk.

190
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:37,263
Please hold, sir.

191
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,521
No, sir, I will not...

192
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,334
Please hold.
It's him.

193
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,067
Should I transfer it to
one of the courtesy phones?

194
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,037
- Yeah.
- Just over there.

195
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,723
Jaime, why did you
turn off your cell phone?

196
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,353
'cau you told me
need a vacation,

197
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,111
- so I turned my cell phone off.
- I told you to take a little time off.

198
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,411
Not to go off the grid.

199
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,709
I'm not off the grid.
It's a four star hotel I'm at.

200
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:09,682
Listen, I got a problem. My guy's
gone quiet. He never checked in.

201
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:11,815
- Oh, Jonas.
- He's a little unstable.

202
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:14,157
- No kidding.
- So can you look in on him for me?

203
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,085
Listen, I would never ask you to do this
if it wasn't an emergency.

204
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,741
- He's staying in room 203.
- He's staying here?

205
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,989
Yeah, I know.
I was surprised too.

206
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:24,774
He seemed like more
of a seedy motel kinda guy.

207
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,538
- Can you do this for me or not?
- Okay.

208
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:37,743
I was booking us spa treatments.
She kept me on hold for ten minutes.

209
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,895
Becks, you know, I was
thinking about what you said

210
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,894
and I know
you're not stupid.

211
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,795
I know I've been acting
weird tely, and anything. And... what?

212
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:49,513
Okay, stop talking.
Because listen, okay I met this...

213
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,483
- Nick. This is my sister Jaime.
- Jaime, this is Nick.

214
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:55,867
- Hey, Nick.
- Nice to meet you.

215
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:00,080
Well, I'm starving.
You wanna go get some breakfast?

216
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:01,718
Great, you two
grab a table,

217
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,232
and I'll run upstairs
and book the spa appointments.

218
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,230
In case you're looking for this,
don't even bother.

219
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,837
- I'm insulted.
- Okay, isn't he cute?

220
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,667
- Super cute.
- And we hate all the same things.

221
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:15,855
I mean...

222
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:29,286
Hello?

223
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,799
Oh, my god.

224
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:50,951
Yeah?

225
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,071
Jonas, he's dead.

226
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,255
He's laying right in front of me,
and he's dead.

227
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,175
How?

228
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,940
Maybe it has something to do with

229
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,112
the hypodermic needle
sticking out of his arm.

230
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,779
Damn it.
Obviously I'm on the job now, Jonas.

231
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,229
So just fill me in.

232
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:05,778
- No, I'm not gonna do that to you.
- What was I delivering?

233
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,467
- Who the hell is this guy?
- It's not your problem, Jaime.

234
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:11,783
Oh, my god.

235
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,618
He's an assassin?!

236
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:26,107
- Were you gonna have somebody killed?

237
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,792
- What was in that briefcase?
- Don't worry about it.

238
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,881
- Don't worry about it?
- The guy lying here dead.

239
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,306
Someone is gonna
come in and find him.

240
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,910
Listen, put him in the bathtub.

241
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,843
Get a bunch of ice
and some air fresheners,

242
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,578
and I'll send someone down
to deal with it as soon as I can.

243
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,757
I can't believe
this is happening.

244
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:47,452
What am I supposed to do
with the briefcase?

245
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:49,905
Put it in your room, I'll have
someone deal with that too.

246
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:51,699
Jonas, I'm here with my sister.

247
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,544
She's with you?

248
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,001
Nothing's gonna happen
to Becca. All right?

249
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,026
I promise you.

250
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:47,378
Good Morning.

251
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:34,410
Hey, we were about
to send a search party.

252
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,936
Sorry,
I was on the phone

253
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:39,311
to the spa,
and then I just passed out.

254
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:43,635
- We have treatments at 5:00.
- Oh, okay. Cool. Sweet.

255
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:48,305
Is it cool if we go with Nick and
his dad on a gondola ride at 1:00?

256
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,869
- You want to go on a gondola?
- No.

257
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,297
- No, no we won't.
- But, his dad's making him go,

258
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,594
so I thought we'd go
for moral support.

259
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,771
- We'd love to.
- Cool.

260
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,009
- Nick.
- Hi, dad.

261
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,863
Been looking
all over for you.

262
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,332
Well, I'm right here.

263
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,828
These lovely ladies as an excuse
to avoid that gondola ride,

264
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:14,238
- are you, s**rt?
- No, dad.

265
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,336
- They're gonna come too.
- Great.

266
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,228
The more the merrier.
I'm Vincent Aldridge. I'm Nick's dad.

267
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,515
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

268
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,275
Come on, it not that painful.
Give us a smile.

269
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:37,405
This is why I told you
I didn't want to work with Javier.

270
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:40,748
I've got a body on ice, a target
in play, and nobody to squeeze.

271
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,917
Well, then you
just make it right.

272
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:50,378
- Hi, I'm Jaime.
- I'll call you back, man.

273
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:53,556
- I'm Matt. How's it going?
- Could I have your cellphone for a sec?

274
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,066
- Yeah, sure. My minutes are minutes.
- Okay.

275
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,480
- I'll be right back, Mike.
- Matt.

276
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:09,424
- Hello.
- Jonas.

277
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:14,240
I... I opened the briefcase.

278
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,433
The target's son is now flirting
with my sister.

279
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,085
We're all supposed to being
on a gondola ride at 1:00.

280
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:23,123
- Who is he?
- He's a very bad guy, Jaime.

281
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:24,769
And you're
way out of your league.

282
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,839
Can you just fill me in
on everything?

283
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:34,185
Okay, he's a nuclear engineer
who's about to sell technology

284
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,562
to the north koreans.
He's posing as an accountant.

285
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,250
<i>What kind of technology?</i>

286
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,065
He's developed a more efficient way
to enrich plutonium.

287
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:44,264
It'll give 'em weapons-grade
fissile material that's 99% pure.

288
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,346
<i>You're looking at man
who's about to hand</i>

289
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,390
North Korea nuclear bomb.

290
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,554
<i>- Don't they already have one?
- This one would work.</i>

291
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:54,535
By the way, who...

292
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,535
<i>- Who the hell is matthew clarkson?
- I have no idea.</i>

293
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,570
Whose phone is it
that you're calling me from?

294
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,565
Oh, it's the valet guy.

295
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:07,754
Looks like a dweeb.

296
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:18,290
- Okay. Hey, thanks, Mark.
- Matt.

297
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,263
Yeah.
You're not so much of a dweeb.

298
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:23,140
Thanks.

299
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,951
So it's like boom. Twist.
Back.

300
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:30,070
- There you go.
- OK. All right. I can.

301
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,709
- I can take little bit more if he's...
- Give him a little bit more.

302
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,762
I can take a little...
All right, let's do this.

303
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:36,532
All right, I can take a little more.

304
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,444
What'd you...

305
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,472
- Easy, easy.
- Oh, god.

306
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,375
It's all
the weapons around...

307
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,867
What are you doing? I've been looking
all over for you.

308
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:48,959
Jae's teaching me
how to fight.

309
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:52,955
What happened
to your eye?

310
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,334
- Oh, my brother...
- I actually don't even want to know.

311
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:56,462
So listen.

312
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,628
We've locked in on the engineer in
Montana, but I can't find a button man.

313
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:01,913
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to montana.

314
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,564
- And you're coming with me.
- Why am I coming with you?

315
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:08,112
- Is he ready?
- Yeah, he's got a couple of moves.

316
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:10,597
- R... ready? What?
- It's actually only one move.

317
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,012
He'll be all right.

318
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,073
You're my backup.
If I miss the target, go center mass,

319
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:17,846
Then put one in his head.

320
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,920
- What? I'm not...
- I'm kidding.

321
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,400
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

322
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,788
I need you there in case Vincent
has some of his research,

323
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:26,610
we need to figure it out.

324
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,832
- Go get some kevlar.
- Some kev...

325
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,601
So, Jaime,

326
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:03,019
- What line of work are you in?
- She sells timeshares.

327
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,531
No kidding.
I have a timeshare in St. Barts.

328
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:09,694
Six weeks in the winter. Three bedrooms,
right on the beach, pool.

329
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:10,915
It's fantastic.

330
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,235
Unfortunately, I can't use it this year,
and I'd like to sell it.

331
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,901
But since they introduced
that new tax clause...

332
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:20,607
I'm sorry to intervene, Mr. Aldridge,
but we kind of have a no work hole

333
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:23,396
- in effect right now.
- I'm sorry. I completely understand.

334
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,592
Gotta play too, right?

335
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,430
Yeah, sometimes you mistake
your job for your life.

336
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,833
Which isn't
such a bad thing

337
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:33,942
if you love
what you do.

338
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:37,118
- Do you love what you do, Mr. Aldridge?
- Are you kidding me?

339
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,780
I wake up every morning with a giant
smile plastered on my face

340
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:44,940
because I love what i do so much.
Jaime, please, call me Vincent?

341
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,282
Who are those guys,
Vincent?

342
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,612
Oh, well believe it or not,
there are some people out there

343
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:56,255
who don't love
what I do.

344
00:24:57,082 --> 00:25:00,034
Who would have thought accounting
could be so controversal.

345
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,133
Yeah.

346
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,723
What time is it?
Oh, boy, you know,

347
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,680
I've got to get you back
to the room, sport.

348
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,979
I promised your mom you'd call.
And, I believe you two ladies

349
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:33,346
have some spa appointments.
Watch your step, ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,906
- Maybe we'll see you guys for dinner?
- Yeah.

351
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:38,432
Sure.
Come on, Nick, let's go.

352
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,885
- What was that about accounting?
- What?

353
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:48,297
Nick's dad never said
he was an accountant.

354
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,772
It was a real conversation stopper.

355
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:02,096
Okay, I'm gonna go shower and warm up
before we go to the spa.

356
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:15,589
Jonas, I think I messed up.
I think I got made.

357
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:18,604
Is that what you say?
This guy Vincent, I think he made me.

358
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,074
Okay, that's a problem.

359
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,755
Yeah, I know it is. What do I do now?

360
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,424
You're gonna have to take him out.

361
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,922
Take him out where?

362
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,945
Jaime, listen to me.
He knows who you are.

363
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:33,606
He's not gonna wait long. You
have to kill him before he kills you.

364
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,433
Okay, I'm all robed up.

365
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,378
You ready for the most relaxing
three hours of our lives?

366
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:51,964
- Totally.
- Let's go.

367
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,983
Let's go.

368
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,214
Heat wraps or...

369
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,814
Rejuvenating facial.

370
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,569
Yeah, your skin's too young
for anything else.

371
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,550
Right this way, miss Sommers.

372
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,454
So I'll see you in three hours.

373
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:08,490
Yeah, we probably won't even recognize
ourselves, we'll be so pretty.

374
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,048
I have to leave.

375
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:13,937
If you could make sure she stays
in that room for the next three hours,

376
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:15,919
I'll make it worth Your while.

377
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,014
- Okay.
- Thanks.

378
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,480
- I don't think I can do this.
- Trust me, I understand.

379
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:48,890
<i>Do you have any advice?</i>

380
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,017
I do, but you're not gonna like it.

381
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,824
- Don't think of him as a person.
- That's gonna be hard for me.

382
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:56,644
I just spent two hours
on a gondola with him and his son.

383
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,247
You gotta think about what could
happen if you don't do it, jaime.

384
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,347
It does get easier.

385
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:07,049
That's what scares me.

386
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,458
Thanks, jae.

387
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:33,851
- Hi.
- Yes.

388
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:36,692
- I need to talk to Vincent.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.

389
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:38,762
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

390
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,070
Well, if I could just take a look,
that would be...

391
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:45,808
okay, we can do this
the easy way or the hard Way.

392
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,000
You're coming with me.

393
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:03,992
It's on the left.

394
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,473
Did you do it?

395
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,587
No, I couldn't do it.
I was nowhere near being able to do it.

396
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:15,756
You know, in an hour and 45 minutes
Becca is gonna walk through that door.

397
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,883
So can you tell me
what I'm supposed to do?

398
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:20,258
<i>I need you to calm down and
put him on the phone.</i>

399
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,584
He wants to talk to you.

400
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,500
<i>Vincent, Jonas Bledsoe here.</i>

401
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,471
<i>Nice to meet you over the phone.
You with me?</i>

402
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:31,921
Yes, I'm here.

403
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,064
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

404
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,364
Number one, I kill you.
The other one is you talk.

405
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,360
And by "talk" I mean
you tell me everything

406
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,866
I need to know to keep
this technology out of north Korea.

407
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:44,224
<i>Which would you prefer?</i>

408
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:48,120
<i>It doesn't matter to me. I just need
to know whether or not to wear gloves.</i>

409
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:50,803
I understand your son is with you.

410
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,034
I'll talk.

411
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,260
But you've got to get me out of here,
or my own people will kill me first.

412
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:58,985
And my son comes with me.

413
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:02,616
Done.

414
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,587
- Where are we going?
- Little change of plans.

415
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:14,300
Do you wanna get my car, please?

416
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,467
- I called for Mr. Aldridge's car.
- Fine.

417
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:20,303
- I'll drive.
- Thank you.

418
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,792
What's going on, dad?

419
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:44,803
You're gonna have to tell
him sooner or later.

420
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:47,804
I can raise my son without your help.
Thank you.

421
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,056
It's nothing you need
to worry about, Nick.

422
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:53,088
Does it have something
to do with your job?

423
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,450
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

424
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:12,618
- Get out of the car.
- Why?

425
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:13,824
Get out!

426
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:17,434
- Get out.
- Dad, it won't open.

427
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,223
- Open the door.
- I can't open it!

428
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,257
- Open the door!
- Dad, it's stuck.

429
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,384
Come on. Come on.

430
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,970
It's all in the wrist.

431
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:13,464
Somebody tried to blow up Vincent's
car with him in it.

432
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,304
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

433
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,544
Where are you?

434
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:19,510
- Five miles south of the hotel.
- How are you fixed for transportation?

435
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,992
- I stole a car.
- That's my girl.

436
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:25,214
Look, we're heading west on the road.
I think we're being followed.

437
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,214
Well, slow down and see if he passes.

438
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,140
We should... we should get away more
often together, road trip.

439
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,212
- Shut up.

440
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,355
He passed.

441
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,551
A good tail is always from the front.

442
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,377
- You hungry, Sport?
- No.

443
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,384
Who are you? And how the hell
did you rip that door off my car?

444
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,094
Maybe you should be happy
I did and not ask questions.

445
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,319
You saved my son's life.
Thank you for that.

446
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:20,891
- He's a sweet kid.
- He takes after his mom.

447
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:25,947
I think I've lost him.

448
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:28,508
Maybe he deserves to know
the truth about his dad.

449
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:31,504
Maybe your sister deserves
to know the truth about you.

450
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,787
It's a different situation.

451
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,565
Hello.

452
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,714
- Did you get the plate on that truck?
- X-u-v-0-5.

453
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,632
Well, it's here, and so am I.
Get out of there and meet me up front.

454
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,449
We need to move now.

455
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,675
- Let's get you out of here right now.
- What about my son?

456
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,756
We'll pick up his mother
and protect them.

457
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:33,211
You can speak to 'em after
you've made your statement.

458
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:38,264
Jaime! Jaime, it's Matt!

459
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,108
- Who's that guy?
- The valet guy.

460
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:42,821
The guy whose
phone I used to call you.

461
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:04,834
The guy whose phone you used
looked nothing like this.

462
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:14,675
- Clean this up for me.
- I'll take you back to the hotel.

463
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,119
It's gonna be all right. The Berkut
guys are on their way.

464
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:20,260
Now, Nathan.

465
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,329
I'm worried that if I keep lying to her,
i'm gonna lose her.

466
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,954
So don't lie to her.

467
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:55,883
I don't want her to think I'm a freak.

468
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,839
Listen, I never said
you couldn't tell her.

469
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,634
You've got to do what's right for your
family. I found that out too late.

470
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,302
The question you have to ask yourself...

471
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,734
Is is she ready to hear it?

472
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,815
Anything has to be better than this.

473
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,805
Maybe, maybe not.

474
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:18,903
See, here's the thing,
every person who knows

475
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,222
is a potential source
of information for people

476
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:24,911
who might want to scrap
you for parts or technology.

477
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,720
Teenagers aren't exactly known
for their discretion.

478
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,757
And if...

479
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:35,977
If you're at great risk,
then so is Becca.

480
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:40,063
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

481
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,385
I think either way she's lucky

482
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,798
because she's got you for a big sister.

483
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:09,133
Thanks.

484
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,501
How was yours?

485
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,494
- It was great.
- You look great.

486
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,463
Yeah.

487
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:21,498
Look, I wouldn't tip your girl too much.

488
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,014
I'm sorry, you don't look any better.

489
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,634
That was, like, three hours for nothing.

490
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,419
Thanks. Come on.

491
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,491
- Nick never said good-bye.
- No?

492
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:37,934
No. That's okay though,
I wasn't that into him anyway.

493
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,753
- Oh, this trip had learning.
- Hey.

494
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,666
Yes, it's more fun to be with a
guy who gives you the time of day.

495
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,512
Good for you.

496
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:51,664
And I'm glad we came.

497
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,383
I had fun with you.

498
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:57,167
Maybe we could do this again sometime.

499
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,721
What?

500
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,415
What? You're freaking me out.
Is there something on your mind?

501
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:12,014
There's something I should tell you.

502
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,000
What?

503
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:19,162
There this guy who I work with who died.

504
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,029
I didn't even really know him that well,
but...

505
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:28,170
... what I realized is
it's really affected me.

506
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,416
- Was he a guy you liked or something?
- No, it wasn't like that.

507
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,248
I'm really sorry.

508
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:41,594
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I didn't want you to worry about me.

509
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,093
- Well, that was really stupid.
- I know.

510
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,490
Jaime, you can talk to me
about this stuff.

511
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:49,682
- I'm stronger than you think I am.
- Okay.

512
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,439
Now, is there anything else you
want to tell me?

513
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,564
No. Nothing at all.
