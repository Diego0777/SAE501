00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,867
<i>Previously on Bionic Woman</i>

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,730
This saving the world thing...

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,161
I'd like to give that a try.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,460
Anything else?

5
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:11,732
What are you doing?

6
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:14,706
I'm trying to buy back your love
because I've been working so much.

7
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:19,506
You get some bad ideas in your head
these days, don't you, Sarah?

8
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,234
It's the bionics, isn't it?

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,921
They've changed me.

10
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:24,976
Turned me into this thing.

11
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:27,708
We think Sarah Corvus might be working
with Anthony Anthros.

12
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:29,608
Will's father?

13
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:31,008
He escaped from prison.

14
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:33,708
He tried to sell bionics
to the highest bider.

15
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:35,647
Am I ticking time bomb too?

16
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,676
I guess I just want to know the truth.

17
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,274
About everything.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,643
I don't like secrets, Jamie.

19
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,698
You're not gonna kill me twice, are you?

20
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,073
Oh we all know,

21
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:52,864
that if your training is worth a damn,

22
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,739
I should be able to take this crowbar

23
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,155
and swing it as hard
and as fast as humanly possible...

24
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,507
This is what you call
"studying at Rachel's house"?

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,858
Who the hell is she?

26
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:39,437
Nobody.

27
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,135
- Jamie, stop!
- You lied to me!

28
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:45,055
You looked me right in the face
and you lied.

29
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,003
- You're a piece of work!
- Are you insane?

30
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,243
This is the thanks I get
for buying you those jeans?

31
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,139
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're 15.

32
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,776
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm living my life, Jamie.

33
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,415
- It's none of your business.
- Yes, it is my business.

34
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:59,067
Do you know she's 15 years old?
You could go to jail!

35
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,744
- You said you were 18.
- Shut up!

36
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:02,276
We're going home.

37
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:06,030
What did you do to my toe?

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,150
It's my toe,

39
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:10,670
and why does it hurt? What happened
to the self-healing anthrocytes?

40
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,273
Well, you're an early prototype, Jamie.

41
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:16,753
As time goes on, we're gonna discover
countless imperfections.

42
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,443
That's so not reassuring.

43
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,046
And you're giving me the creeps.
You keep staring at it.

44
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,737
Do you have a foot fetish?

45
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,935
Actually, no, Jamie, I do not.

46
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm pretty much just a simple boob man.

47
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,289
You did this surveiling your sister?

48
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,698
She lied right to my face.

49
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,133
Just looked at me and lied.
"I'm going to Rachel's house."

50
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:35,797
Well, that's what teenagers do.

51
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:38,713
They lie. They get tatoos.

52
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:41,871
They have wild sex,
and then knock off liquor stores.

53
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,495
Your toe is screwed.

54
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:47,412
I'm gonna have to shock that thing
into submission.

55
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:50,137
Now this shouldn't hurt at all.

56
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:52,895
On three.

57
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:55,302
One.

58
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,841
- You suck!
- Here's what I think.

59
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:02,854
You cannot be grudge a teenage girl
the opportunity

60
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:05,002
to make out in parked cars
with older guys.

61
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,184
It's the lying.

62
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:09,270
Is it this righteous indignation
just a...

63
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:13,479
tiny bit hypocritical considering
you're a $50 million weapon

64
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,466
- leaving a double life?
- That's mean.

65
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,989
I don't really care so much about
what she does.

66
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,272
I know she's gonna make stupid mistakes
and all that.

67
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,207
I just don't want her to lie to me
because

68
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,330
then I can't help her.

69
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:24,976
That sounds good.

70
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,215
Tell her that.

71
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:28,387
Check it out.

72
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,322
- Good as new.
- You're a genius.

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,370
Let's keep this between us, okay?

74
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,294
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

75
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,468
I'll see you,

76
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,690
and I'll raise you all in.

77
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:48,415
Everything.

78
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:50,931
That's a lot of coin.

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,760
You know, people say
that men take all the risks.

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,544
I'm here to tell you it isn't true.

81
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,482
You all turn out to be a bunch
of scared litlle boys.

82
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,182
It's disappointing.

83
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,643
It really is.

84
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,468
Sarah, put your hands on your head.

85
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,231
My guess's the fun's over.

86
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,115
This is my boyfriend.

87
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,332
It's an on again off
again sort of thing.

88
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:15,575
You know how it is.

89
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,890
I kill all those people.

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,581
He shot me in the head.

91
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,148
Our friends call us the Bickersons.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,640
Isn't that right, honey?

93
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,056
But you know what they say.

94
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:28,630
At the end of the day,
the most important thing...

95
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,382
in the world...

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
is love.

97
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,316
I knew the game was fixed.

98
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,697
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:10,785
You owe me $27,269.31

100
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,123
for the toe.

101
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,478
How'd you find out about that?

102
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:15,632
Your bionics represent
the most advanced form

103
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:17,642
of biotechnology known to man.

104
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:19,612
It was developed to protect
the human race,

105
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,289
not spy on your delinquent sister.

106
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,080
I find your whole proprietary attitude

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,129
about my body
to be deeply inappropriate.

108
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,374
How's the toe?

109
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,151
Take a look at this.

110
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:31,988
<i>My name is Marc Stevens.</i>

111
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,491
<i>I'm an american doctor
working in Paraguay.</i>

112
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:36,715
<i>I'm being held against my will.</i>

113
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,075
They say that they'll kill me unless...

114
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,344
A group that calls themselves
the "sons of the red sand" took Stevens

115
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,428
in Ciudad del Este two days ago.

116
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,362
- They claim he's CIAn.
- Is he?

117
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:53,199
He's American.
That's enough for them.

118
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,756
He's got some incredibly
sensitive information,

119
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,596
and they're gonna behead him in 48 hours

120
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:00,297
unless the CIA admits he's theirs,
which they won't.

121
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,729
So why is this our problem?

122
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:04,900
You mean besides he's an american
who would get his head chopped off?

123
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,394
I mean, why isn't the military
sending someone in?

124
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,478
Paraguay never passed
any anti-terrorism laws.

125
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,241
They're not about to let the US mount
an operation on their soil.

126
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,100
- But we can?
- The two of you can.

127
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,364
Anything that looks like
special OPS is out.

128
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,329
But an american couple moving
about the city?

129
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,435
I wanna help this guy, but I don't think
I can fly off to Paraguay right now

130
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,094
- Becca...
- Becca'll be watched 24/7

131
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:25,430
by a surveillance team.

132
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,175
Okay, I'm in.

133
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:31,455
Just... What am I gonna tell Becca?

134
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:34,647
You'll think of something.

135
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
The eggs!

136
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,640
You were cooking?

137
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,069
Who are you making breakfast for?

138
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,191
You.

139
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:33,912
Why are you making me breakfast?

140
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,264
About last night.

141
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,703
- I just want to clear the air. I was...
- Fine.

142
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:42,800
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.

143
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,253
Yeah, I mean, shouldn't have done it.
It was dumb.

144
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:50,028
Besides, that guy's a creep anyway.

145
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,734
Mean, usually
those internet chat room guys,

146
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,737
you know, they turn out
to be reasonably cool.

147
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,388
Oh, my God!

148
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,407
I'm kidding.

149
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,127
God, you think I'm retarded?

150
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,538
- No, I don't think you're retarded.
- Yeah, you do.

151
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:06,102
So what's going on with you?

152
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,054
Carly invited me up to Napa to...

153
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:11,927
celebrate her getting into law school.

154
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,570
That should be fun.

155
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,735
- We land on an airstrip.
- An airstrip?

156
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,764
Is that different from an airport?

157
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:29,687
Yeah, it's dirt.

158
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,939
I have an asset in place, a local cop.

159
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,550
He's gonna help us
locate Stevens when we get there.

160
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,009
How can you land a 747 on a dirt runway?

161
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,132
No, it's not a 747.
It's a little gulfream.

162
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,252
Really?

163
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:41,885
You okay with that?

164
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:43,295
Yeah, I'm good.

165
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,145
Do you have anti-anxiety meds?

166
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:48,213
Sedatives? Anything in that area?

167
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:50,889
Hi, Jamie.

168
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:52,567
How's it going?

169
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:54,420
You look great.

170
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,606
How's Becca?

171
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,517
Stevens is running out of time.

172
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:00,791
We have to go now.

173
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,706
Jonas will take care of her.
Okay?

174
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,183
We're almost done.

175
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,496
I'm just getting started.

176
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:27,045
Let him go, Sarah.

177
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:32,058
Take him to the infirmary.

178
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,017
You're not helping yourself.

179
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,394
Reflexes.

180
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:41,618
Your reflexes were recalibrated
through sensory neurons

181
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,053
with your original surgery.
That was hostility.

182
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,686
You noticed.

183
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,713
A girl likes to be noticed.

184
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,793
Let's cut to the chase.

185
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:54,158
You're having hand tremors,
night sweats, anxiety, paranoia.

186
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,078
Even paranoids have enemies.

187
00:09:56,286 --> 00:10:00,179
The bottom line is the medicine Anthros
gave you barely gave you any relief.

188
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,963
The truth is it probably made you worse.

189
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,270
And you're gonna fix me?

190
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,685
- My hero.
- It's not what you want.

191
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:06,909
From you?

192
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,379
I want nothing.

193
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,386
Kill me or let me go.

194
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,180
You know, I tried that once before.
It didn't work.

195
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,958
This time I thougt it'd help.

196
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,195
You don't know how.

197
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,312
Will was working on upgrades.

198
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,537
I want Anthony Anthros.
You tell me where he is,

199
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,950
you get your life back.

200
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,355
You're full of crap, Jonas.

201
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,155
And you're getting worse.

202
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,015
Who made me this way?

203
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,040
You're a liar, Jonas!

204
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,676
A liar playing God!

205
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:53,028
My contact has a very good idea
where Stevens is being held.

206
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,529
He's gonna meet us there.

207
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,177
Hook us up with some transportation...

208
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:04,688
You okay?

209
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,008
I'm scared of flying.

210
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,205
I couldn't find any drugs,

211
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:09,987
and I think getting wasted
before a mission is a bad idea.

212
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:15,454
I just think you know, a hunk of metal
in the sky. Counterintuitive.

213
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,638
Okay.
Let's talk about something else.

214
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,347
I'm upset because I keep lying
my sister about my job.

215
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,316
You're protecting her.
You're not lying.

216
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:30,238
If she knew the truth about you putting
your life on the line, I don't think

217
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:33,047
- she would be able to handle that?
- I don't think I buy that.

218
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:36,782
- Everybody should know the truth.
- The world doesn't work like that.

219
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,221
But then how can you have trust?

220
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,937
Trust and full disclose
is not the same thing.

221
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,837
You trust me right?

222
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,363
- Relatively speaking.
- But what do you know about me?

223
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:52,837
What have I disclosed?

224
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,697
- It is supposed to make me feel better?
- All you need to know

225
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,055
is that we are a team

226
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,294
and that I have your back.
Isn't that enough?

227
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,149
Thank you.

228
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,650
Easy, tiger. Easy...

229
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,691
That's your bionic hand.

230
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,814
Sorry.

231
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:26,888
We must hurry.

232
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,499
No one can know we've met.

233
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,127
Remember,

234
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:32,427
Paraguay is a complicated place.

235
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,015
We have no law against terrorism.

236
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,723
This group has
a legimate business interests.

237
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,448
Kidnap and ransom is legimate?

238
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,863
All the perimeter doors are alarmed.

239
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,137
The only other access is
through the venting system.

240
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,329
But it's blocked by an exhaust fan.

241
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,335
It'll take your head off
before they will.

242
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,129
Thanks.
We'll keep that in mind.

243
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,416
If they catch you,

244
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,706
I don't know you.

245
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:57,698
My police won't help you.

246
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,531
My opinion, for what little
it's worth, this is suicide.

247
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,723
But you americans know all
there is to know

248
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:07,203
about handling these foreign
situations, yes?

249
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,500
He's an optimist.

250
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,005
OK, we get in, we get him, we get out.

251
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,905
Sure, easy

252
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,709
there wasn't supposed to be an alarm.

253
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,035
Just get us in.

254
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,937
You know how to disarm it?

255
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:31,287
Stevens' life is ticking away.

256
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:33,414
Just do it.

257
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:35,076
Trust me.

258
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,093
You're a machine. Don't think about it.

259
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,194
Even if it's not real,
it's still attached.

260
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,194
I'd like to keep it that way.

261
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,194
Give me a second.

262
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,142
You see?

263
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,142
Matter over mind

264
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:48,661
What now?

265
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,407
Are you crazy?

266
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,545
What the hell are you doing?

267
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,142
I suggest you follow my lead
or you'll be shot.

268
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:11,142
You told me I could trust you.

269
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,314
Beauty is supposed to be
the mark god sets upon vertue.

270
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,984
And are you god in that homily

271
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,358
She got less virtue
than she bargained for.

272
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:49,151
I know you don't want to believe this,
but every step of the way

273
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:50,723
She had no bigger supporter than me.

274
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,421
Why make her your enemy?

275
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,643
She needs help.

276
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,808
Will came up with a fix
before he was killed.

277
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,009
Swap out the nerve bundle infuse
new anthrocytes.

278
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,142
She knows where anthros is.

279
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,777
He's been giving her treatment.

280
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,812
Maybe if you fed her, she'talk.

281
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,389
Chicken, egg.

282
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,245
Be her friend, Jae.

283
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,123
You want to help her?

284
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,530
Help her help herself.

285
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,212
At least we're together.

286
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:44,768
You're out of your mind.

287
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,105
We're about to be executed.

288
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,229
They want to make an example out
of us to stevens,

289
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:50,097
or they make an example out
of him for us.

290
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,484
Either way, that gets us to him

291
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,634
I need you to lose the fear
and go bionic.

292
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,592
if I told you what I was going to do,
you would've backed out!

293
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:05,909
Friends of yours?

294
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,557
I believe, Dr. Stevens
that you don't believe

295
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:12,297
what whappen to you if you don't decode

296
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,667
the contents of your flashe drive.

297
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,297
Which is nothing compared to
what will happen to her.

298
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,884
Please, I'm working as fast as can.

299
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,146
Perhaps you need a little inspiration,

300
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,751
it's a multi-level asymtric encryption!

301
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,074
It's gonna take time.

302
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,321
Now could be a good time, Jamie.

303
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,107
Jamie, now!

304
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,015
Jonas says he can help you.

305
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,177
And he's got every reason to lie.

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,275
He's also a man of self-interest.

307
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,668
You're valuable to him.

308
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:42,957
He's playing you.

309
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,754
Getting off watching this dance.

310
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:48,921
Or you're playing.

311
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,129
I want you to know you can trust me.

312
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,558
I want you back.

313
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:57,354
We all want something back.

314
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:59,711
Believe if Jonas could help me,
I don't trust him.

315
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,202
You trust me?

316
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,543
Bring me proof
that jonas is telling the truth.

317
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,947
That they made advancements
they can use to fix me

318
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:13,184
I might remember
where he can find anthros.

319
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,290
Take this rope.

320
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,134
We'll tie him and take him.

321
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:31,772
take the rop tie his hands up.
We gotta move.

322
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:33,819
What are you gonna do to him?

323
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:35,816
No worse than
what he was going do to you.

324
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:37,816
You want answers, right?

325
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,680
And when you're done,

326
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:45,460
Take him down to the fan room.

327
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:47,726
What about you and Stevens?

328
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,148
What about me?

329
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,049
He stays.

330
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,372
What are you talking about?

331
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,868
You deciphered the flash drive.

332
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,424
- You were stalling.
- You read it!

333
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,204
What was on the flash drive?

334
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:03,876
Tell me.

335
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:06,783
You.

336
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:11,448
Blueprints, materials, everything
there is to know about bionics.

337
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,784
If you know what was on that drive,
you know who gave it to me.

338
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,454
To decipher, not to read.

339
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,488
This doesn't make any sens
we came here to save him.

340
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,050
And we would have.

341
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,623
I'm not gonna say anything.

342
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,675
Yeah, until you're caught, tortured,
or your brother is taken.

343
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:32,246
They put a machete to a pretty girl's
neck and you were gonna give it up.

344
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,349
I was trying to save you.

345
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,678
Take him down to the fan room.

346
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,476
So you're just gonna kill him,
is that it?

347
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,568
Jamie, go.

348
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,379
Go!

349
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:48,065
Far end of the building, fan room,
I'll meet you there, go.

350
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,103
You let him go, he talks,
you're in the crosshairs.

351
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:57,462
A target for people to catch
and dissect. You won't last a month.

352
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:58,701
Then I won't.

353
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,331
Are you okay?

354
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:41,857
You've been hit.

355
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,008
Go through.

356
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:02,314
Thank you.

357
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:04,818
- What you did back there.
- Stupid

358
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,510
I'm gonna get us both killed.

359
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,174
I have no plan. You know that, right?

360
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,066
There'll be supplies in here
for your wound.

361
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:13,125
- We can't stop.
- No, you can't keep going.

362
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,383
Can you get the lock?

363
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,752
Can you see what numbers to push?

364
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:40,127
Your eye, can you tell what numbers?

365
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:53,181
2 5 6 9.

366
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:55,504
These are usually four digit codes.

367
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,377
That gives us 24 combinations.

368
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,350
Let's try it in reverse.
Highest probability.

369
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:07,636
All right.

370
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,671
Who gave you the flash drive?

371
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,486
I have a contact.

372
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,509
A voice on the phone.

373
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,742
When he needs help, he tells me
where to pick things up.

374
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:21,677
What about the terrorists?

375
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,977
Do you know who hired them?

376
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:26,542
I assumed it was just them.

377
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,638
Somebody tipped 'em off to
what I was doing.

378
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:36,846
Your body's in shock.

379
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,102
You really are a doctor?

380
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,748
It's not just a cover?

381
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,176
Yale medical school.

382
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,210
Two-year residency at walter reed.

383
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,014
Specialty in espionage?

384
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:54,127
I was always kind of a savant
with word games and puzzles.

385
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:02,734
How many words can you make out of the
letters in yoo-hoo, that kind of thing.

386
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:06,681
I was showing off one day at Walter Reed
and a CIA guy recruited me.

387
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,232
How bad?

388
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,923
The human response to a foreign
object is to repel it

389
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:26,182
And fight it like an infection.

390
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:29,374
But you...

391
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,732
Aren't human?

392
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:34,611
You have anthrocytes.

393
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:37,234
The files say they're designed
to keep your body

394
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:38,933
From rejecting the bionics. So they work

395
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,018
to incorporate what's foreign
and not repel it.

396
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,851
Doesn't sound so bad.

397
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,757
The anthrocytes are moving the bullet.

398
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,942
It could damage other organs.

399
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,687
I need to take it out.

400
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:56,465
Now.

401
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,781
She could be dead.

402
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:02,049
No, she's not.

403
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,452
She's still green.

404
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:07,031
- It was your idea to send her in, Jonas
- And you nearly got her executed!

405
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:09,672
You know the risk involved better
than anyone, buddy.

406
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,050
No, willingly surrendering a $54 million
bionic woman is not in my play book.

407
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,252
Well, it got us inside to get stevens
and the flash drive.

408
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:20,061
You don't have the flash drive,
and you don't have Jamie.

409
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:22,750
Well, how about I get off the phone
so I can go and find her?

410
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,943
- You better.
And Antonio?

411
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:28,492
You treat her like she's expendable
again, I won't be this nice.

412
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:30,735
Do not tell me how to do my job.

413
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,498
I'm gonna go and get your girl back.

414
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,071
What are you doing here?

415
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,557
Nice to see you too.

416
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:12,002
- Seriously, what are you doing here?
- Is everything okay?

417
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:14,811
Yeah, I just borrowed these from Jamie.

418
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,106
Is she home?

419
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:18,984
No, she's in Napa...

420
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,191
With you.

421
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,121
Excuse me?

422
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,873
Exactly.

423
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:35,782
What are you looking for?

424
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,212
What you promised Sarah.

425
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:39,051
Proof of Will's upgrades.

426
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,346
You told me to get her trust.

427
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,938
I'm trying to get her trust.

428
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,910
You didn't trust me.

429
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,253
There's nothing here.

430
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:46,471
No files at all.

431
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,000
What is going on, Jonas?

432
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,994
I don't know.

433
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:50,092
So you lied to me?

434
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:54,423
I told you will was working on
fixes, not that I had them.

435
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,908
Apparently, the files are on a
flash drive in Paraguay.

436
00:26:58,028 --> 00:26:58,902
How?

437
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:01,727
I don't think we knew Will
as well as we thought.

438
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:13,915
Ah, damn it!

439
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:17,605
Sorry.

440
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:21,057
Not what you want to be hearing
from your surgeon.

441
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,572
Are you holding up?

442
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:29,566
I've been sitting here thinking
about all the lies ve been told.

443
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:32,301
All the lies I've been telling,

444
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:33,751
even to myself.

445
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:36,895
How do you make peace with it?

446
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,858
You don't.

447
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:44,063
You do what you can.

448
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,294
Sometimes you pay a price.

449
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:51,253
Three years ago, a lie I deciphered
lead to a bombing raid in Iraq.

450
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,351
87 civilians killed.

451
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:57,690
Another 113 injured.

452
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,814
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:01,970
So I came to triple border...

454
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:04,987
To atone.

455
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,837
Doctoring people who have nothing.

456
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,744
What about the CIA?

457
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,455
Occasionally they ask a favor.

458
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,548
But now I only succeed at deciphering
those things that I can live with.

459
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,398
I can live with.

460
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:24,895
If you had told the terrorists what you
knew about me, they might've let you go.

461
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:29,050
Yeah, and I'd have given them the
technology to do what?

462
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,915
And then who would they
have sold it to?

463
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,027
Do the files say why it does that?

464
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,132
It stops after a few minutes?

465
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,963
What?

466
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:54,568
It's your bionic interface...

467
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,223
Failing...

468
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,415
And being reset.

469
00:28:58,554 --> 00:28:59,951
It keeps happening.

470
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,069
It's inherent in the system.

471
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:03,532
And?

472
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,525
The anthrocytes function like
an anti-rejection drug.

473
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:10,919
But over time,

474
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,574
they become fatigued.

475
00:29:13,157 --> 00:29:14,979
So they'll replace them?

476
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,199
On the flash drive,
they've talked about

477
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,632
a five-year...

478
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,306
projection.

479
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,427
Until what?

480
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,411
Bionic systems cease to function.

481
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,095
What does that mean?

482
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,155
What does that mean?

483
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:41,920
You're gonna die.

484
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:49,134
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink.

485
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,548
So that's where we're starting.

486
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,158
With horses?

487
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,974
Mr. Ed won't drink, you grab him by
the mane, force him under.

488
00:29:58,094 --> 00:30:01,130
Hold him there long enough,
he'll swallow.

489
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,931
The point is to interpret the saying.

490
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:11,572
You do know your horses.

491
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:13,616
You and your sister had one
when you were little.

492
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:14,781
Am I right?

493
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,436
And Anne named it Coco?

494
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,517
What happened to Coco?

495
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,383
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

496
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:29,969
Or have sex without curtains.

497
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,961
Me, I like throwing stones.

498
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,885
Wakes people up.

499
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:39,524
You're caught between a rock
and a hard place.

500
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,605
Now you're just trying to be funny.

501
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:43,436
Actually, I'm just trying to do my job,

502
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:44,953
which as much as I don't like it,

503
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:47,516
it means trying to understand you.

504
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:49,828
I'm messed up, honey.

505
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:51,923
See, now we're getting somewhere.

506
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:54,900
Does that make you all warm
and cuddly inside?

507
00:30:57,835 --> 00:31:00,791
You should know I don't
do warm and cuddly.

508
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,206
You're caught between a rock
and a hard place.

509
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,068
Well, we both know how
that ends, don't we?

510
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,016
Three.

511
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,436
Three?

512
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,864
You can make three words out of yoo-hoo.

513
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:18,802
Oh, yoo, and ooh.

514
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:22,920
Actually, nine.

515
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:28,570
You know, what I said...

516
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:31,764
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:35,998
No, it's good to hear the
truth for once.

518
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,736
- He's coming.
- Who?

519
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:44,851
Quick.

520
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,382
Around the back.

521
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:50,945
Here.

522
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:53,739
Hold on to this, wait here.

523
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,012
- Wait, what are you...
- Just do it.

524
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,362
There is no fix, is there?

525
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:07,041
Jonas is predictable, if nothing else.

526
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,183
Tell me you love me.

527
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:24,542
I love you.

528
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,553
Let him go!

529
00:32:29,692 --> 00:32:31,600
Stand down, stand down!

530
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:33,958
Sarah, stop.

531
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:36,720
Seriously, is that the psychological
way of talking me down?

532
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,709
- Let Jae go.
- And you'll what?

533
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,403
Help me?

534
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,815
- Where is he?
- Gone.

535
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,400
Jamie, where is he?

536
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,563
You were gonna kill him.

537
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:24,921
I was just doing my job.

538
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,481
You kept me completely in the dark.

539
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,308
Sometimes that's what the job requires.

540
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:30,597
I refuse to believe that killing an
innocent person

541
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,170
could ever make things right.

542
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,511
Yeah, well, that information on
the flash drive could save you.

543
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,303
What we were doing here was for you.

544
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:41,296
You think cause I cost $50 million,
my life is worth more than his?

545
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:42,910
Oh, we can talk about that later.

546
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,193
Give him up now.

547
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,215
No.

548
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:48,941
No!

549
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:54,186
Stevens is what we call
collateral damage.

550
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:56,502
Killing him saves you.

551
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:58,988
Maybe one day you'll understand that.

552
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,779
You want Stevens...

553
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:03,655
You're gonna have to get through me.

554
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,051
And this time you'll have to do
it without a crowbar.

555
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:11,473
I find this inappropriate
workplace behavior.

556
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:18,106
- Now who's being inappropriate?
- You don't want to fight me.

557
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,115
You know what I'm capable of.

558
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,913
Just because you're a machine
doesn't mean you can't be beat.

559
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:45,811
That hurt?

560
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:47,113
Yep.

561
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,176
You've gotta get out of here...

562
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,113
She took that pen from the tech.

563
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,894
The one with the multi-fractured hands.

564
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,184
She figured you'd never help.

565
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:37,519
The point is moot.
She's gone.

566
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,864
So is Will's flash drive.

567
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,478
Seems Jamie and Antonio had
a misunderstanding.

568
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,347
That can be dangerous.

569
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,559
Antonio's doctor can attest to that.

570
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:51,033
So if... If Will's work is gone,
then what?

571
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,218
Sarah's gonna die?

572
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:57,703
I wouldn't want to be in her shoes.

573
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:05,461
I have never been snowboarding.

574
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,704
That seems insane to me now.

575
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:11,357
I can't believe I've lived my whole
life never having done that.

576
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:13,580
My friends all head up to snow together.

577
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:15,565
Usually in february.

578
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:16,930
You should come.

579
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:18,560
Oh, you know.

580
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,878
Can't plan that far in advance.

581
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:25,092
Like to live in the moment?

582
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:26,676
Go for it.

583
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:30,213
See it, want it, take it never
look back at the carnage.

584
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,757
Exactly.

585
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:37,543
Life's too short.

586
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:41,242
You have no idea.

587
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:46,096
What do you say you and
I get out of here?

588
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,347
Okay.

589
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:13,684
Five years?

590
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:16,877
Listen, five years is a lifetime in
technology, Jamie, it's generations.

591
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:18,947
You didn't think I had a right to know?

592
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:20,591
Yeah, I just didn't want to tell you.

593
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,930
- I wanted to protect you from...
- No, stop.

594
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:23,979
This is my life.

595
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,391
You will not treat me like this.

596
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,347
I'm entitled to know
you will not lie to me.

597
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,273
- It's disgusting.
- You're right.

598
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:32,252
You're right I'm sorry.

599
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,725
My sister.

600
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:37,188
We will find a way to fix this.

601
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:40,933
Jamie, look at me.

602
00:37:44,332 --> 00:37:45,847
I will fix this.

603
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:52,645
I'll fix this.

604
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:15,383
How was your trip?

605
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:16,752
Good.

606
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,318
Yeah, you have fun with Carly?

607
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:20,984
Yeah, we hung out.
It was cool...

608
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:24,427
Look, are you, like, having an affair
with a married man or something?

609
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:25,505
What?

610
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,509
Carly dropped off your shoes.

611
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:33,694
God, you know, I mean,
you're just like dad.

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,983
You make these big pronouncements,
but I can't even trust a word you say.

613
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,978
And you think that I'm the liar?

614
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,712
Look, what is going on, Jamie?

615
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:45,806
Just tell me, okay?

616
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,225
I need to know.

617
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:48,793
I deserve to know.

618
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:53,497
I can't.

619
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:01,578
I love you the most.

620
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:07,150
Remember when mom used to say that?

621
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,283
Yeah.

622
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,011
Only she'd say it so we could both hear.

623
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,155
Now I love you the most.

624
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:20,665
And I want to tell you everything.

625
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:23,890
But I can't, I...

626
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:30,202
Trust... It's supposed
to be a two-way street.

627
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,081
Yeah, I know, and it sucks.

628
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:36,584
But you have to trust me, Becca.

629
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,469
My new job is...

630
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,029
It's complicated.

631
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:42,757
I just...

632
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,191
I need to know that you're
never gonna leave me.

633
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,439
I will never leave you.
