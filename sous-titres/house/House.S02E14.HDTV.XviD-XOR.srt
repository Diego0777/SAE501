1
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:06,895
Two spades.

2
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:08,971
Three hearts.

3
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:11,515
It's all yours.

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,979
I fold.

5
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,702
And that's five.

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,302
- And that's six.
- Yay!

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,492
Not bad.

8
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:24,542
On a slam contract, you normally
want to play your winners early.

9
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:25,462
Sorry, Dad.

10
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,801
Nah. You're learning.
You're doing fine.

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,912
Woman:
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

12
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:35,317
I should, uh, take her out
because she can play bridge.

13
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,801
You're a true romantic.

14
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:41,366
Woman 2:
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,473
- Cecile was dating before she left.
- Oh, shut up, Marv.

16
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,564
No. I have a partner.
And she's doing great.

17
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,720
Amy should be out having fun.

18
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:52,740
I'm having fun.

19
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:53,963
Yeah.

20
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:57,233
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

21
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:08,252
- One no trump.
- (Woman, laughing) Ooh!

22
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:12,626
I'm just...a little nauseous.
I, uh, I think I ate too much.

23
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,961
- Can we take a break?
- Of course.

24
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,704
Excuse us.

25
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:20,264
What did you eat?

26
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,409
Nothing weird.

27
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:23,989
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad. You know I don't--

28
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,216
Because I don't mind if you--

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,676
Dad?

30
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,771
[Echoing] Dad?

31
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:34,505
Dad, what are you doing?

32
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,572
You're scaring me.
It hurts. Let go!

33
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,615
What are you doing?

34
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:45,635
Man:
Henry?

35
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:49,489
Henry.
Let go of her.

36
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:54,822
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me. But...

37
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,309
What?

38
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:58,453
Are you okay?

39
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,494
What's the matter?

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,983
2X14 - Sex Kills

41
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,804
Original Airdate (FOX):  7 March-2006

42
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,850
You had what's called
an "absence seizure."

43
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,868
Anything like that
happen to you before?

44
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,122
No, Nothing.

45
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:50,346
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right. He--

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,370
I--well, I did have
a headache last Sunday.

47
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:57,310
And for the past two years,
I've been getting acid reflux a lot.

48
00:02:57,369 --> 00:03:00,895
And I thought that, uh,
antacids were all I needed.

49
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,553
Should I have come in sooner?

50
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,551
For acid reflux and a headache?

51
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:13,841
Well, I--you know,
I hear the coffee downstairs
is really good.

52
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,035
Could you get me a cup, Honey?

53
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,687
Would you mind
closing the blinds?

54
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:29,744
Foreman:
His right testicle is almost
twice as big as his left.

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,737
Cool.

56
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,803
It's probably testicular cancer.

57
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:35,072
Mmm, no.
That's impossible.

58
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:38,847
- The symptoms all indicate--
- The shoes aren't right.

59
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,838
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

60
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,737
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

61
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,527
Then Foreman would examine him.

62
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:52,958
Then he'd suspect
testicular cancer on account of
the symptoms being so perfect.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,681
Then he'd stick a needle in it.
Then he'd call a surgeon.

64
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:59,929
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

65
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,055
And since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

66
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,408
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

67
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,331
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI is clean.

68
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,139
Sure. If you call a microabscess
in his brain "clean."

69
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:15,523
What, you don't trust me?

70
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,690
Are you talking about
the left temporal lobe?

71
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,758
Neat. You can see
through my hand.

72
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,950
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

73
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:26,649
When guys have brain/crotch problems,
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

74
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,846
Blood and urine were negative for
syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

75
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,934
So treat him for all three.
Stat.

76
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,496
Um...negative means
he doesn't have it.

77
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:38,208
No. Negative means
he probably doesn't have it.
Which means he probably has cancer.

78
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,022
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

79
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,739
We're wearing the wrong shoes
for testicular cancer.

80
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,596
They're perfect for lymphoma.

81
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,890
Except Chase's.
They're just goofy.

82
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:50,848
Lymphoma could cause infiltrants
in his reproductive organs and his brain.

83
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:53,321
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

84
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:57,252
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

85
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,749
Svinnuk.

86
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,592
Who's the lucky woman?

87
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:08,465
My wife.

88
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,939
No, I don't want to know
who gets the chocolates.

89
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,094
I want to know who
you're having the affair with.

90
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,462
Fell on his head as a child.
Tragic.

91
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:18,586
Norwegian chocolate.

92
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:21,578
Frankly,
you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

93
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:26,287
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

94
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:30,127
Healthy human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

95
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,923
Gifts express guilt.

96
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,611
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt. That's a $12 box.

97
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:38,841
So either you haven't
slept with her yet,
or she wasn't that good.

98
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,746
It's  not all about sex, House.

99
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,227
Really?
When did that change?

100
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,980
I want to get Depo-Provera.

101
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,999
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

102
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,707
the risk of you getting
pregnant is pretty limited.

103
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,998
Yeah, but it would
calm me down.

104
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,633
Right? If I get
a high enough dose.

105
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:03,474
You mean
"calm" as in a peaceful lake,
on cool summer evening?

106
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:09,087
Or in the lesser used meaning of,
nothing can ever bother you again
because life has absolutely no meaning?

107
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:12,503
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

108
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,043
Yeah.

109
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,973
Okay. I'm gonna
get up to leave now.

110
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,118
And I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle.

111
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:26,326
And then you're
suddenly gonna decide that
you have to tell me the truth.

112
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,705
I'm  gonna have to turn around
and come all the way back.

113
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:30,644
See, the thing is,
my leg hurts.

114
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:33,437
Can we cut the walking
out of the equation?

115
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,851
I love cows.

116
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,909
Any particular...variety?

117
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,145
Guernseys? Holsteins?

118
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,020
Which are the black and white ones?

119
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,372
Oh, God.

120
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:53,560
I pass a farm
on my way to school.

121
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,291
And they're so beautiful.

122
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:58,780
They're so majestic.
I dream about them.

123
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,867
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How can anybody do that to a cow?

124
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:06,974
Make love, not belts.
It's beautiful.

125
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,294
- I haven't actually--
- Well, relax.

126
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,596
Something we doctors
deal with all the time.

127
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,777
I'm gonna write you
the name of a drug.

128
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:16,914
You don't need a prescription.
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

129
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:19,577
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

130
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,577
That stuff has
all sorts of nasty side effects.
It's real medicine.

131
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,293
No, this is all you need.

132
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,296
Your frat buddies will
be completely fooled.

133
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,015
Tell them how appalled
the doctor was.

134
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:32,974
Lots of laughs.

135
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,812
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

136
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,281
No. It's not possible.

137
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:41,044
Sir, maybe we should
speak in private?

138
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,838
Have you tested him for this?

139
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:43,919
The tests were negative.

140
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:45,940
Well, then it's not that.

141
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,501
So what else could it be?

142
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,972
Nothing good.

143
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:53,046
If you've been having sex,
you have to tell me.

144
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:57,332
I have not had sex
since my divorce.

145
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,307
I didn't ask him
to take the medicine.

146
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,281
I asked you
to give him the medicine.

147
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,143
He hasn't had sex
in over a year.

148
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,445
- He's lying.
- He knows what's at stake.

149
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:11,137
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

150
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,759
- Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--
- Wilson!

151
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,947
How long can you
go without sex?

152
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,780
How long can you
go without annoying people?

153
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,808
No, seriously.
Week? Month?

154
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,307
I'm not having an affair.

155
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:24,083
I didn't say you were.
Not in this conversation.

156
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,558
We're talking about a patient.

157
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:28,785
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

158
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:32,155
Well, not like air.
But as a biological imperative,
sure we do.

159
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,108
There's two things
we get stupid for.
Money and sex.

160
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:37,640
And since money rarely
enters the bloodstream...

161
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:40,245
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

162
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:43,121
I told him we could talk privately.
He didn't care if she was there.

163
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:46,159
It's  almost noon.
Little girl would go to lunch.

164
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:49,593
Soon as she's out the door,
you're gonna get paged.
Then you page me.

165
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,400
[Foreman's pager beeps]

166
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,937
Lunch is early, huh?

167
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,343
Hi.

168
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,555
I'm Dr. House.

169
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:10,228
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

170
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,003
I'm sorry. I...
couldn't tell my daughter.

171
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,450
Right. 'Cause she's...what, 22?

172
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,573
I slept with her mom.

173
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:23,111
She probably knows
that's happened already.

My wife had an affair.
I forgave her.

176

She had another affair.
And I forgave her again. And...

177
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,761
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

178
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,005
So smart.
You must be very proud.
Roll over.

179
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,876
I assume you've been in love.

180

Is that the one that

Amy is just getting over it.

183
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,029
She barely spoke to her mom
for months actually.

184
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:59,063
If she thought that
it was happening again,
that that's why I got sick--

185

We just happened to be at
the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.

186

Cheese is the devil's play thing.

187
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,591
It was just the one night.

188
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,131
Oh, you're obviously
completely over her.

189
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,233
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

190
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,729
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

191
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,468
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

It wouldn't.

It was flash pulmonary edema.

We took a liter of fluid off, but
the problem wasn't with his lungs.
It's his heart.

00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,393
There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

212
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:52,513
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't
erupt that suddenly.

213

So what is it, then?
A disease that attacks
his brain, heart, and testicles.

- Then why are you--
- Advocating for my patient.

338
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,869
I've got clinic duty.

339
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:07,066
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

340
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,181
You really think this thing'll
change their decision?

341
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,359
Nope.

342
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,327
Mooooo!

343
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,795
I think I broke my ankle.

344
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:25,394
I was kicked. By a hoof.

345
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:29,442
I'm so in love.
She was so beautiful.

346
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,812
- Which one?
- One of the black and white ones.

347
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:34,488
- I'm not sure what type.
- Which "type"? Which one?

348
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,970
I want a name.

349
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,851
- Why would it have a name?
- Well, not "it." She. Or he.

350
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:42,355
I want to know
her dreams, her hopes.

351
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,090
It's a cow.

352
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,103
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

353
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:55,206
People who actually have this condition
rationalize it. They dismiss it.
They don't elevate it to the level of poetry.

354
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,558
Plus there's
a wooden splinter in there.

355
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,485
So either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four
or Elsie has a peg leg.

356
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm off duty at 6:00.

357
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,495
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

358
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,338
I'm sick. And you're a doctor.
You have a duty to help me.

359
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,726
Technically I don't
have to treat anybody.

360
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,936
Before running a series of
painful and often humiliating tests.

361
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,805
Whatever you need.

362
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,394
90-year-old woman
died of pneumonia.

363
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,770
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

364
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:35,555
- Um...baby died in the ICU.
- Babies are useless.

365
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,045
They've got hearts the size
of ping-pong balls. Next?

366
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,163
Um...40-year-old male...

367
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:42,689
Yes?

368
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,218
Heart attack.

369
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:47,975
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

370
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,882
There's no other deaths.
There's one woman who
was in a car accident.

371
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,240
Bad  one, I hope.

372
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:54,520
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

373
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,545
Give me her file.

374
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,390
It's in the ER.
They're still working on her.

375
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:01,141
- Age?
- About 40.

376
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,801
- Young. Damn.
- Young is good.

377
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,768
- Smoker?
- Don't know.

378
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:06,718
Find out.

379
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:09,780
She's still alive.
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her until--

380
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,276
Overweight?

381
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,515
She's on the hefty side.

382
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,694
Excellent.
Our odds just went up.

383
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,623
What odds?
What is this?

384
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:22,961
60 % of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash because
there's something wrong with them.

385
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,855
With fat people,
it's closer to 80.

386
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,548
But if her heart's
no good, then--

387
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:30,299
Big, fat, sloppy heart.
Beats no heart at all.

388
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,139
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

389
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:52,401
I'm Dr. House.

390
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,232
Need to ask you a few questions
about your wife.

391
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:55,413
Is she gonna be okay?

392
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,337
I'm afraid I don't know that.

393
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:59,146
Could you tell me
about her accident?

394
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,586
They, uh, think she fell asleep,
went off the road.
That's all they told me.

395
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,069
Any problems with her health
up until now?

396
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,025
Why?

397
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,348
Please, it's important.

398
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,810
Um...

399
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,732
she had a fever today,
but otherwise she was--

400
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,124
How high?

401
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,019
About 101.

402
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:19,786
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

403
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,789
And I should've
made her stay home.

404
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,417
Any other symptoms?

405
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,937
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash.

406
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:29,951
- Mr. Neuberger.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:33,450
My name's Ellen Stambler.
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for Southern New Jersey.

408
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:37,662
I just want to assure you
that we'll treat her organs
with care and dignity.

409
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:41,597
Her organs?

410
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:46,472
Laura died?

411
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,729
I--I'm sorry.
I thought, um--

412
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:54,778
She was just pronounced dead.
I thought he was telling you.

413
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,089
I didn't know.

414
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,861
You should never make assumptions.

415
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,800
What did you want from me?

416
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:09,849
I'm sorry for your loss.

417
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,519
But I need your wife's heart.

418
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,304
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

419
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:24,320
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

420
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:27,800
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or "W"?

421
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,960
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

422
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:31,715
Is that a problem for you?

423
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,364
It's a "U". N-E-U.

424
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,454
Berger.

425
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:44,081
Three minutes ago,
her organs were officially
declared not viable.

426
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,189
Time to go dumpster diving.

427
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,937
Hey.

428
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:59,274
She's got hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

429
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,153
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

430
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:03,990
Fortunately,
she didn't have hep C.

431
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,467
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

432
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,815
Her husband told me
she was running a fever
with stomach pains.

433
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,096
Not symptomatic of hep C.

434
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:44,751
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

435
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,715
Hey. What are you doing?

436
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,394
Again, sorry.

437
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:51,407
But we need to talk.

438
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:55,915
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

439
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,150
His wife signed
an organ donor card.

440
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:01,087
Which became invalid when
her organs were turned down.

441
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:03,867
I can use them!
I just need some time.

442
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:05,844
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

443
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:08,114
Another committee says
the guy can't have a heart.

444
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,897
It's a marriage made in heaven.

445
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:11,719
I can find a surgical team
that can do this.

446
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:14,642
Classified as experimental,
it's not gonna screw
with their numbers.

447
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,773
- This is what she wanted.
- No.

448
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:16,808
She wanted her organs to help--

449
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,117
She never wanted to
be kept alive on a ventilator.

450
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:21,156
She's not. She's dead!

451
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:24,076
She's not in pain.
She's not suffering.
It's just her...

452
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,191
meat we're dealing with here.

453
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:31,129
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

454
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:34,030
She deserves some respect.
Some dignity.

455
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,750
- I respect the living.
- Right.

456
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:38,384
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor.

457
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,080
Made me believe that
maybe there was some hope.

458
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,324
I never said that
I was her doctor.

459
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:45,604
Fine, you didn't lie.
But you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

460
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:48,021
I am taking her
off the machines. Now.

461
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:51,786
Nicely played.

462
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,207
It's not over.

463
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,642
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Neuberger?

464
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,680
Yeah. Why?

465
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,676
I'm Amy Arrington.

466
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,135
I wanted to thank you.

467
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:20,328
This girl's father will die
by next weekend unless
he gets your wife's heart.

468
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,844
House. Don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

469
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:26,100
No. It's hugely manipulative.

470
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,603
You're an ass.

471
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,933
Hey. Listen!
You take your wife
off life support,

472
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,642
and I'll have forgotten
about this in two weeks.

473
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,279
- Gail here, on the other hand--
- Amy.

474
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,993
Whatever.

475
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:43,105
You're mad at me.
Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me. Not on her.

476
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,994
Oof!

477
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:04,859
Fine. Your dad can, uh...
have her heart.

478
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:30,348
Fever. Stomach pain.
Raised liver enzymes.

479
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,458
She's sick.

480
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,702
Worse than that.
She's dead.

481
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,797
My point is,
even if it's not hep C,
it's something.

482
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:40,670
They turned her down as a donor
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

483
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:42,561
Whatever made her sick
will kill him.

484
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:45,124
Yeah. So what is it?

485
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,352
Enzymes indicate--

486
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,190
You want us to do
a differential diagnosis
on a dead person?

487
00:27:49,274 --> 00:27:50,427
We're going to cure her.

488
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,781
We're going to cure death?

489
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:55,229
[Laughs theatrically like a demon]
Doubt it.

490
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,085
Just want to get the infection
out of her heart before
we get the heart out of her.

491
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,007
The fever indicates an infection.

492
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:04,076
She probably has hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

493
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:08,439
Let's assume, just for fun,
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

494
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,854
Fever and belly pain
could be a gall bladder infection.

495
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:13,305
Like that.

496
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,594
Do an MRI. Stat.

497
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,205
You really don't need to be here.

498
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,017
I assume, uh,
House is a great doctor.

499
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,520
Why would you assume that?

500
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:34,468
Because, uh,
when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

501
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,721
No sign of gall bladder infection.
But there was a cyst.

502
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,832
Perfectly round.
Now, hep C wouldn't cause--

503
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,588
The question was never,
is it hep C?

504
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,507
The question was given
that it's not hep C, what is it?

505
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,649
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

506
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,206
Cavernous hemangioma?

507
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,542
Not vascular enough.

508
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:57,952
What if she was sloppy about
washing her hands after pooping?

509
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,070
Uh...amoeba infection?

510
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:04,859
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,
that would explain all her symptoms.

511
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,839
Except for the crushed skull, but
I'm assuming that's from the car crash.

512
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,875
I'll start her on
paromomycin and chloroquine.

513
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,177
Ten grams each.

514
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:14,339
That's...20 times
the normal dose.

515
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,871
Right. So we'll destroy
her retinas and damage her hearing.

516
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,608
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

517
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:23,394
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

518
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,810
Got your labs.

519
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:34,308
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

520
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:37,153
How about hamsters or mice?

521
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,361
Humans?

522
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:39,803
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,507
Is something wrong with me?

524
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,208
Absolutely nothing.

525
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,069
Your blood work is perfect.

526
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:49,071
You've got lots of vitamins,
minerals. All kinds of proteins.

527
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:54,112
Including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin.

528
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:57,165
Which you get from eating
the animals mentioned.

529
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,296
Or cow.

530
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,217
You don't really worship cows.

531
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,483
So I have to wonder,

532
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:10,366
what could be more humiliating than
someone calling your girlfriend a cow
and not being metaphorical?

533
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:27,856
- Nice.
- It's my mom.

534
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:33,691
Well, either that's
a very old photograph,
or it's your stepmom.

535
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,769
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

536
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,619
I-I can't stop
thinking about her.

537
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:42,883
My dad's in Europe.
I'll be watching TV,
she'll give me a massage.

538
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,193
I can't walk for an hour.

539
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:47,840
- Still. Cows?
- She's my mother!

540
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,067
Step.

541
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,099
Please.

542
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,808
I just need the medicine
for three months until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

543
00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:00,136
Please.

544
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,898
You're not gonna have
any fun at graduation.

545
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:09,226
Keep up the good work.

546
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:11,316
Your shirt is ironed.

547
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,847
That means you haven't
told your wife anything.

548
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:16,317
Let's say you're right.

549
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,886
You're saying I'm right?

550
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,967
No. Let is saying.

551
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:27,606
Does it occur to you that maybe
there's some deeper guidance
than "keep your mouth shut"?

552
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:33,027
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness? That maybe...

553
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:40,379
Maybe I'm going through
something that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

554
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:44,523
[Hosue's beeper goes off]

555
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:52,582
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,
you may have made some deeper errors.

556
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,443
Chase:
Her heartbeat's irregular.

557
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,941
Looks like global hypokinesis.

558
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,021
Stop the meds.

559
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:15,440
You're giving up?

560
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:18,359
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable...

561
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:22,529
or right, but the treatment
we had to give her will
make her heart unusable.

562
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,381
I'm sorry.
You can pull the plug now.

563
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:28,914
Find me another body.

564
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,241
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

565
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,615
No!

566
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:35,185
She's not ready.

567
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,522
You were ready this morning.

568
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:40,173
She's not done.

569
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:44,002
She's gotta save that guy.

570
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,783
House:
Alternate theories?

571
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:56,563
Amebiasis was our best hope.

572
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,743
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal when
we stopped the meds pretty much--

573
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,540
What's our second best hope?

574
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,236
House, put down the wand.

575
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,831
There's no obstruction.

576
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,375
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

577
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:09,867
She's a fridge
with the power out.

578
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:13,649
We start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

579
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:16,578
No offense.

580
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,382
I don't see that
we have a lot of choice.

581
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:19,867
The only way we're
gonna find that infection--

582
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,143
Cameron:
What if it's not an infection?

583
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:25,005
Toxins can cause similar symptoms.
Especially if whatever it is did liver damage.

584
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:27,314
Her, uh, toxin screen was clean.

585
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:30,481
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

586
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,472
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

587
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,678
You, keep the other patient alive.

588
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:37,504
You, check out the school.

589
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:41,324
And I seem to need
o hire another doctor
to go search her home.

590
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:44,656
Come on.

591
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:50,657
If she was taking
any medications,
I'd know about it.

592
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:55,048
Did your wife dye her hair?

593
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:56,449
No.

594
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,426
Her mom never went gray.

595
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,469
She didn't either.

596
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,679
Guess this must be yours, then.

597
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,684
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

598
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:08,302
Any drugs she "gave up"
when she married you?

599
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,151
How are you feeling, sir?

600
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,081
Mr. Arrington?

601
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,665
Mr. Arrington?

602
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,373
[Monitor starts beeping]

603
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,582
What's going on?

604
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:30,683
His heart's not pumping
enough blood to his brain.

605
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,377
We're gonna have to
give it some help.

606
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,440
Get the balloon ready.

607
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,021
You use this drawer?

608
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,512
Neuberger:
No, that's for her vitamins.

609
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,851
And sleeping pills.

610
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,090
She never took sleeping pills.

611
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:49,684
Okay.

612
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,592
You on a diet?

613
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:55,199
No.

614
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:03,837
I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

615
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,804
Quite the insight.

616
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,129
She lied to you
about her hair color.

617
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:12,069
And didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

618
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:15,801
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge.

619
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:18,492
And then you can
probably let those slide.

620
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,781
Diet pills could've
messed her up.

621
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:25,246
Raised the live enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

622
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:26,829
But not the fever.

623
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,941
Maybe something else
set off the fever.

624
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,353
Like what?

625
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:32,781
Before I show you these,
they were in a locked drawer
in her desk.

626
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:36,244
The vice principal said that
Laura must've confiscated them.
They've had some problems with--

627
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,465
Neither interesting nor helpful.

628
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:42,707
This at least is interesting.

629
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:45,087
[Scoffs]
No, it's not.

630
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:48,057
Sex with teenagers
isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

631
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,212
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

632
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,851
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

633
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,351
Then we have nothing to go on.

634
00:35:57,497 --> 00:36:00,014
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

635
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,380
What if it's a scar?

636
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,211
Foreman:
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome?

637
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:05,241
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

638
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:07,039
You got anything better?

639
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:10,410
Test her.
And start her on ceftriaxone.

640
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,181
What are you testing for now?

641
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:29,282
Just some more infections.

642
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:45,315
She's positive for gonorrhea.

643
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:51,215
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

644
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:52,358
Meds are started.

645
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,592
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

646
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,303
I'll go tell the families.

647
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,657
He's in a coma.

648
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,309
Start him on dobutamine.

649
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,627
Already did.

650
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:04,715
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain too.

651
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:08,734
House, she's still got
a significant amount of
gonorrhea in her system.

652
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,963
Hopefully tomorrow,
it'll be in his system.

653
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,873
I need two O.R.s
and the transplant team.

654
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:21,968
What is it?

655
00:37:29,368 --> 00:37:30,744
Amy:
What's going on?

656
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:32,997
- Is he getting a heart?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

657
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,336
I assume this means
you, uh, you found out
what was wrong with Laura?

658
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:56,679
She had a amebiasis.

659
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,510
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

660
00:38:02,218 --> 00:38:03,203
Thank you.

661
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,253
That was kind of you.

662
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,774
I didn't want him
going postal on us.

663
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:15,594
Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands,
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

664
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,490
He's gotta be tested.

665
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,650
Preferably before he gets
any sympathy sex.

666
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:56,378
Paddles.

667
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:03,123
50 joules.

668
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,479
Charging.

669
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:15,738
Charging.

670
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:22,579
[Heart begins to beat]

671
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,272
Let's take him off bypass.

672
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:47,748
Mr. Neuberger.
There's something
I need to tell you.

673
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:51,499
The last, uh...

674
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:55,900
year or so, uh...

675
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:59,079
Laura was kind of
distant with me.

676
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:00,881
I don't know why.

677
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,728
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

678
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:08,376
But...not Laura.
And I'm not excusing myself,

679
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:13,027
but when I was traveling
during Christmas, I had a...

680
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:15,613
I had a one-night stand.

681
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:17,427
I got gonorrhea.

682
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,737
- Are you sure--
- Yeah.

683
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:26,060
I should've said
something to you.

684
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,173
But I didn't want to believe
that I gave it to her.

685
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:30,814
That's what made her sick,and...

686
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,442
that was why she got
into the accident.

687
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:58,405
Cecile?

688
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:00,795
Am I dead?

689
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:03,088
Hopefully not for a long time.

690
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,853
Why are you here?

691
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,715
Amy called me.

692
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:12,059
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

693
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,273
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

"Honky Tonk Women"  by Taj Mahal

695
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:32,432
<i># I met a gin-soaked
barroom queen in Memphis #</i>

696
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:32,697
[Knock on the door]

697
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:42,823
<i># She tried to take me
upstairs for a ride #</i>

698
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:52,939
<i># She had to heave me
right across her shoulder #</i>

699
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,477
<i># 'Cause I just can't... #</i>

700
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,777
Could I stay with you
for a few days?

701
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:01,547
You idiot.

702
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,797
You told her.

703
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:04,737
She told me.

704
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:08,623
Things have been
crappy at home lately.

705
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:10,909
I figured I wasn't
spending enough time there.

706
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:12,775
I figured...

707
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,672
It turns out, you're right.

708
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,981
It's always about sex.

709
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,886
She's been having an affair.

710
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:32,287
<i># It's the honky-tonk women #</i>

711
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:34,061
Want a beer?

712
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:41,494
<i># That gimme, gimme, gimme
the honky-tonk blues  #</i>
