00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:03,905
Hi, kids.

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:07,474
- Mommy, look what I made.
- Oh wow.

3
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:12,507
It's a farmer and
a cow and some horses.

4
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:13,650
It's beautiful.

5
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:15,047
It's for Ted's office.

6
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:16,239
Oh, he's gonna love it.

7
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:18,201
And it would be nice
if you called him Dad.

8
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,929
Give me a big hug.

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,796
Secret is the Haas avocados.

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,854
I can e-mail you
the recipe if you want.

11
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:28,282
[Cell phone ringing]

12
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,657
Oh. It's the third time
they've changed plans since Friday.

13
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:36,351
These idiots think
you could just add the 14th floor
and the mayor won't notice.

14
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,588
I thought turning the garage
into a nursery was complicated.

15
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,008
Any luck on your end yet?

16
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:42,937
Not for luck of try.

17
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,608
Ted.

18
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:49,844
Oh, come on, Margo.

19
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:52,450
I have to go Teleclient.
He is an idot.

20
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:53,877
Go kick some ass.

21
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:59,287
I have to take Stella to karate by 3:00
and birthday party at Julia's after.

22
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:05,525
You okay?

23
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:09,585
Yeah, I'll be back.

24
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,240
Just make sure
she's dressed.

25
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,875
[ A crow cawing]
[A dog barking]

26
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:15,306
[Unlocks her car]

27
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:16,740
Ow!

28
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:32,957
[Starts the engine]

29
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:40,586
Ah. Oh.
[Tires screeching]

30
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,599

Honey!

34
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,474

Original Airdate (FOX): 7 February-2006

37
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,305
Cuddy:
He's actually on time.

38
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,053
He's six minutes early.

39
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,672
- Something's hapened.
- I'm on it.

40
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,911
Morning, Jimmy.

41
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,481
Anybody die while I was gone?

42
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,755
Did--did you iron your shirt?

43
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,521
Thought about shaving.
Couldn't find a razor.

44
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,532
What the hell
happened in Baltimore?

45
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,966
Sorry, chief.
Never kiss and tell.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,532
I think you just did.

47
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:03,610
[Elevator dings]

48
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:06,741
There's no such thing
as "Just a kiss".

49
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,141
Did you iron your shirt?
Everybody's flash today.

50
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,627
Has she left Mark?
Is she going to?

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,420
I think I can hear
cancer kids calling.

52
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:17,990
Are you planning on
asking her to leave Mark?

53
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:19,062
Not sure.

54
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,935
- Cameron keeps my calendar.
- Hey.

55
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,388
This is a big deal.
This is an affair.

56
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,183
Have you even talked to Stacy
about what the hell this means?

57
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:28,045
*** a lot of time for talking.

58
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:29,766
- If you know what I mean.
- Great.

59
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:32,208
Breaking up a marriage.
Fertile ground for high comedy.

60
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,033
We need to talk about this.

61
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:36,616
Gosh, wish I could.

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,319
How did the HIV tests go?
Did you study up?

63
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,533
I rescheduled for this afternoon.
We have a new patient.

64
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,752
34-year-old female.
Movement disorder.

65
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,426
Movement disorder?

66
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,839
Fascinating.

67
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:51,529
[Gives a deep sigh]
This isn't just gonna go away.

68
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,982
No. But maybe you will.

69
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:57,511
Probably suffered head trauma
in the car accident.

70
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:58,975
Trauma leads to the dyskinesia.

71
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:02,771
According to her husband,
the flailing started before
she got anywhere near that car.

72
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,204
What does the flailing look like?

73
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:07,034
Arm spasms, uncontrollable way
and there's a mild facial twitch.

74
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,359
Demonstration?

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,165
You want to know what it looks like, go see the patient.

76
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:13,124
Oh... Snarky.

77
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,400
Was he like this
the whole time I was gone?

78
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,571
Patient's been a fertility regiment
for the last 13 months.

79
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,683
Cameron:
Excess estrogen in her system
could explain--

80
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,078
We finish the animal crackers?

81
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,832
Sudden movement disorder could be
a symptomom of Huntinton's.

82
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:29,206
If you finish something,
don't just put back the empty box,
throw it out.

83
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:35,762
Huntington's takes a day to confirm.
We should put her on Tamoxifen
in case it is the fertility meds.

84
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,119
- Counteract the estrogen.
- It's a great idea

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,363
if you want to kill her baby.

86
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,845
Movement disorder can present
in the first trimester.

87
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:45,770
She's not pregnant.

88
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:48,198
Peeing on a stick is
only 99% accurate.

89
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,611
Get a real pregnancy test.

90
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,315
You know, the one with
the blood hormones and the rabbit.

91
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,399
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's still your limo.

92
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,569
What do you say, Miss Daisy?

93
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,843
Whatever you want.

94
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,292
- Lame duck's done quacking.
- You quack, people shoot you.

95
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,237
Cuddy just put me here
to make you miserable.

96
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,199
Another two days,
you can go back to
making yourself miserable.

97
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,290
Okay. Get an MRI.

98
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:13,336
See  if it's in her head
or in her uterus.

99
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:15,952
You're gonna want to paralyze her.

100
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:22,190
You run tests on a flailer,
somebody's gonna lose an eye.

101
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,919
Ow. Sorry.

102
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,450
You think I'm pregnant?

103
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:27,868
We need to find out for sure.

104
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,258
Would all this go away
once she delivered?

105
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,692
It could also be neurological.
We need to get an MRI.

106
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,204
Can she do that
if she's pregnant?

107
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,198
The risk to the fetus
is extremely low.

108
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,056
But there is a risk?

109
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,562
I-I don't think we should do it
until we're sure.

110
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:42,962
Ah.

111
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,342
Ted, I think you should
take Stella home.

112
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,255
I  want to stay here.
We should be with you.

113
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,721
You should take her
out of the room.

114
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,945
We're going to temporarily
stop Margo's spasms.

115
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,747
- You can do that?
- Vecuronium.

116
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:57,355
It's a paralytic.
Essentially cuts off the brain
from the muscles.

117
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,246
Don't worry.
Your mom'll be just fine.

118
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,353
It'll make running the tests easier.
And it won't be dangerous for the baby
if you are pregnant.

119
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:07,301
Let's go, Stella.

120
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:10,135
- I wanna go with Mommy.
- We'll be just outside. Okay?

121
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,889
We gotta let the doctors
get her that. Alright?

122
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,697
It's okay, sweetie.

123
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,591
- Love you.
- Love you.

124
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,315
Your vitals will be watched closely.

125
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,204
I'm going to close your lids
so your eyes will dry on***.

126
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:35,901
Just try to relax.

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,341
What the hell did you do?

128
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,449
Were you just
cold and lonely?

129
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,452
[Sighs]
Of course he told you,
he's a 8 year old boy.

130
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,305
Hey, you're the one
who kissed him.

131
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,987
Why are you so
worked up over this?

132
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,514
- Because you're married.
- Not to you.

133
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,076
This is none of your business.

134
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:58,683
The last time you left,
I was the one stuck
picking up the pieces.

135
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,851
Oh, right. He cried himself
to sleep every night.
That so sounds like him.

136
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,549
He's been pining for five years!

137
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,803
- You're being dramatic.
- No. Actually, I'm underplaying.

138
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,766
- This is me being restrained.
- It was one kiss.

139
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,247
Are you being
intentionally thick?

140
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:22,024
This was not just
a one-night stand.

141
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,072
- You can't toy with him.
- I'm not.

142
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,302
He's probably toying with me.
I do--

143
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,191
I don't know what I'm doing.

144
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,312
Oh, boy.

145
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,637
Welcom back to the world.
You're off the vecuronium.

146
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,841
Could you wiggle your toes for me?

147
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,750
The MRI was clear.

148
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,216
Whatever this is isn't in your brain.

149
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,151
MRI. So I'm not pregnant?

150
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,113
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,819
So what do we do next?

152
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:08,575
It could be a variety of things.

153
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,028
Some treatable.
Others more serious.

154
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,420
Open up.

155
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,806
We're gonna run a genetic test
for Huntington's.

156
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,834
That one of more serious ones?

157
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:17,306
Yeah.

158
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,904
It's also possible that this is just
a symptom of the fertility treatments.

159
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:24,726
Now that we know you're not pregnant,
we're gonna start you on Tamoxifen
to counteract the estrogen.

160
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,442
Will that undo
all the fertility treatments?

161
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:30,399
For the time being, yeah.
But it could cure you.

162
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:33,050
You can start trying again
once we get you healthy.

163
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,715
Damn  it!

164
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,222
The spasms are going to get worse,
now the vecuronium's wearing off.

165
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,939
What are you so scared of?

166
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,951
I'm still your mother.
I'm just a litte sick.

167
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:50,772
Why did you even bring her here?
I told you to leave her at home.

168
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:58,402
Foreman:
Hypervigilance, sudden irritability...

169
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,197
Symptomatic of...
lunch with Cuddy?

170
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:03,091
The patient now defines Huntington's.

171
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,341
Then what do you need me for?
Start her on Huntington's meds.

172
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,157
Before we get her test results back?

173
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,536
If we start her *****
it could destroy her liver.

174
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,342
Could stroke.

175
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,298
If we wait she could progress
full blown psychosis.

176
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:16,805
Then her kid will never get
the chance to say good-bye.

177
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,112
Want to tell her the class of that feels?

178
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,985
Huntington's patients don't
progress to psychosis in a day.

179
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,322
Shcwen from 0 to 600
in world-record time.
[Beeper goes off]

180
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:29,234
Indicating it might be something
other than Huntington's.

181
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,762
We got a problem.

182
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,020
Stay away from me.

183
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,674
- Where's my daughter?
- What's happening?

184
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,274
- She's having a psychotic beak.
- No!

185
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,897
She is not yours.
What do you want with her?

186
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,578
Calm down.

187
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,673
- Margo, you're gonna hurt someone.
- No!

188
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,345
- Push two milligrams of Ativan!
- I want my daughter!

189
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:53,754
She's not yours.
I want my daughter.
No more experiments.

190
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:55,517
No!

191
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,804
How can her Huntington's test
be negative?

192
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:08,360
All the signs are there.
Movement disorder, psychosis.
It should be Huntington's.

193
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:11,907
Yeah. That'd certainly
make your job easier.

194
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,372
Well, good news for Margo,
it's not Huntington's.

195
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,074
Bad news for us.

196
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:19,400
Her psychotic break
eliminates fertility meds.

197
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:21,521
Which means we have no idea what's wrong with her.

198
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:24,401
We give you so much.
You give us so little.

199
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,843
You know, patient is prime age
to develop spontaneous schizophrenia.

200
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:31,015
Almost impossible.
No family history of mental illness.

201
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,489
Chase:
How about toxins?

202
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:34,857
None of her family members are sick.

203
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:39,049
Nobody at her office,
her volunteer group, kid's classes,
and PTA members. All fine.

204
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:44,906
So she raises a daughter,
runs a business,
she does charity work.

205
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,630
She volunteers at school.
Attends PTA.

206
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,796
- What makes mommy run?
- You thinking drugs?

207
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:52,817
Cocaine.

208
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:55,911
Explains the psychosis and the flailing.

209
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:02,360
And the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never ever let Teddy forget that he's a man.

210
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,107
I'll go look for her stash.

211
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,853
Take Foreman.

212
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:09,127
There's gotta be a reason
for the stereotype.

213
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,003
I know you're in there.

214
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,780
I can hear you caring.

215
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,271
The door was locked.

216
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,196
Means I didn't want to see anyone.

217
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,212
High school reunion?

218
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,997
It's for a patient.
She can't roll.

219
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,158
Now lock that door too.

220
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:53,576
Paranoia.

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,445
Must be the good stuff.

222
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,673
Times like these,
I wish I had cancer.

223
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,561
So what did she say?

224
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,081
That depends.

225
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,760
What did you do, and
who are we talking about?

226
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:07,674
We both know that
as soon as we talked, you ran to Stacy
so you could gossip and giggle.

227
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:09,002
I need to know what she said.

228
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:11,655
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't you go talk to her?

229
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:14,578
Because  my bestest buddy says
that could lead to trouble.

230
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,035
She sounds confused,
but I don't think she is.

231
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,112
I think she's waiting
for you to do something.

232
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,794
Show her you're serious.

233
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:30,920
Wow.

234
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:35,017
It's a big jump from infidelity
is morally wrong to do her.

235
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,556
I didn't say do her.
I said do something.

236
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,650
What exactly did she say?

237
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,933
She  didn't say it was a mistake.

238
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,917
She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab.

239
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:48,960
Too much guilt.

240
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,940
She left you.

241
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:55,285
Harsh toke, dude.

242
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,023
House.

243
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,541
Killjoy.

244
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,976
I could've covered this.
You need to get that test today.

245
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,715
I wish you guys remember
my birthday instead of my HIV test.

246
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,096
Forgive us for being concerned.
I got a bet with House.

247
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:32,478
He says you're too scared to get it.
I say you're too anal not to.

248
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:35,354
I'll cut you in.

249
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,503
Cameron:
That was a colossal waste.

250
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,506
Foreman:
Who would've known?

251
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,095
Searching a high end family home
for illicit narcotics was
such an obvious choice.

252
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:48,860
Working moms practically
live in their cars.

253
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,028
- Little bump on the run?
- You were a car thief, right?

254
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:55,949
Ha.

255
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,347
Mama's little helper.

256
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,149
House. Ritalin.

257
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:11,689
- Cocaine with a PG rating.
- Prescribed to her daughter.

258
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,177
Mommy does everything
for her family these days.

259
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,580
Even swallows their pills.

260
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:18,155
It's possible
the kid's meds are the kid's meds.

261
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,276
Pop enough Ritalin,
it can explain everything.

262
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,995
Well, Ritalin maybe explains
some tics, some involuntary--

263
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,189
Case reports have referred to chorea.

264
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,354
She's been cut off from her stash,
so the flailing's tapered off and
the psychosis hasn't returned.

265
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,793
- It's perfect.
- Tox screen will confirm that.

266
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,329
Half-life's 12 hours.
The drugs'll be out of her system.

267
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,621
- We're done. Get rid of her.
- We're not done.

268
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:40,606
We have to confirm the diagnosis
before we send her home
to die of something else.

269
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,821
Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet.

270
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,459
You just can't resist.

271
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:48,464
You're like a diabetic
at the ice cream counter.
You want to say no,

272
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,330
but you need that
chocolaty goodness.

273
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,892
Yeah. Well, I'm still
signing the charts.

274
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,594
So until tomorrow,
you're not allowed to kill anyone.

275
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,733
Wuss.

276
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,734
We've asked her three times
if she's on any meds.

277
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,833
So we don't ask her.

278
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,509
Candy striper.

279
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,986
[Hooks chair, pulls to himself]

280
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,361
So you like dogs?

281
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,833
That's not a dog.

282
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:38,720
Smart kid.

283
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:40,870
Are you always such a good little girl,

284
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:44,036
or does mommy sometimes say
you're the reason
she needs a double martini?

285
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,809
Who are you?

286
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:48,370
Over here, kiddo.
I'm talking to you. Focus.

287
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,585
It must be because
you're off your meds.

288
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:54,013
- Who are you?
- Doctor and candy striper.

289
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:55,439
She's not on any medication.

290
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,251
Well, that's strange
'cause this bottle has her name on it.

291
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,605
And I think these are
medical pills inside.

292
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,144
What's he talking about?

293
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,672
Doctor prescribed Stella...

294
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:11,784
a few months ago.
I never told you about it
because I never gave her any.

295
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:16,045
Hmm. That's funny
'cause the bottle's almost empty.

296
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,650
You missed a couple of days.

297
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,335
- Take five.
- Stop.

298
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,194
Why?
Unless they're not hers.

299
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,794
- Do you need some water, sweetie?
- I'm not taking Ritalalin.

300
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:27,632
Come on.
All the cool moms are doing it.

301
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:31,811
And tox screen says you're cool too.

302
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:36,541
You were on drugs
while taking care of Stella?

303
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,506
I'm sorry, Ted.

304
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:53,815
It's a cafeteria menu.

305
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,003
It should take
a couple of hours to process her.

306
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,304
Then you can take her home
and divorce her.

307
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:15,880
Working late?

308
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,752
Or you just avoiding Mark?

309
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,282
It was one kiss, Greg.

310
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:20,631
So far.

311
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,685
I'm planning on keeping a chart.

312
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,077
I'm moving back to Short Hills.
I think it's time.

313
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:27,836
You're leaving?

314
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,231
It's never meant to be permanent
now that Mark's getting better.

315
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,415
Yeah. Much better.

316
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,053
Except for the whole walking thing.

317
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,843
He needs to get back to work.

318
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,821
Right.

319
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:44,568
Saving the next generation
from making bad choices
about acne cream.

320
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,472
You're running away because
the kiss meant something.

321
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,276
I'm not running away.
I'm going home.

322
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,892
With Mark.

323
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,748
I love Mark.

324
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,566
You love me more.

325
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:06,091
I don't want you to leave.

326
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,841
Are we okay?

327
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,118
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,458
Let's just get you home.

329
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:29,341
That's a good idea.

330
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:40,863
- Mommy!
- Hey!

331
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:41,437
Call the code.

332
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,548
- What's wrong, Mommy?
- What's going on?

333
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:49,072
[Phone ringing]

334
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,983
This better be important.

335
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,228
You've gotta come back in.

336
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,248
- No, I don't.
- Margo's stable, but--

337
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:57,192
Oh, my God.
Well, I'll be right there.

338
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,960
She had a stroke.

339
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,850
Perfect.

340
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,009
Gotta go back to work.

341
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,455
Right now?

342
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,608
Well, patient's stable.

343
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,852
Could maybe wait a half hour.

344
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,664
He should've been here 20 minutes ago.

345
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,407
Doubt if he makes it all.

346
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:30,719
I saw him leave with Stacy.

347
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,244
He's probably just
walking her to her car.

348
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:34,451
Oh, yeah.
That sounds like House.

349
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:37,269
He's not an idiot.
He's not going to hook up
with a married woman.

350
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:40,070
I hope he is getting some.
Maybe he'll mellow out.

00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:54,033
You owe me 100 bucks.

355
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:56,631
You didn't take the test?

356
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,220
Fear trumps anal every time.

357
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,742
It's not a big deal.

358
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:05,273
I had the viral load and antibody tests.
99.9% that I don't have HIV.

359
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:08,598
And if you had the test
and it's negative,
you gain a tenth of a point.

360
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,485
But if it's positive,
you lose...nearly 100, right?

No arrhythmia.

362
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,402
So Ritalin isn't the big problem.

Something else is going on.

I removed the clot
which caused the stroke.

367

Problem is, we don't know
where it came from.

368
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,929
Did ultrasounds of her heart,
arms, and legs. All clear.

369
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:28,651
Could be a protein C deficiency.

370
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,346
Wouldn't explain
the movement disorder.

371
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,824
Nothing  explains everything.

What if it's a crime syndicate?

373
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,117
Let's say Ritalin and the
fertility meds plotted a caper.

374
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,904
Ritalin takes care of
the psychosis, the flailing.

375
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,280
I still don't think Ritalin--

376
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,972
Fertility meds are competitive by nature.

377
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,979
They gotta do something bigger.
Something really unexpected.

378
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,664
Fertility treatments have been known
to cause endometrial cancer.

379
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:56,187
Which could cause clots.
Which could've caused her to stroke.

380
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,149

Did you tell Mark?

I told him I had to work late.

391
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,287
You going to tell him?

who's been through this.

518
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,437
I'm shutting her out.

519
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:26,980
I'm saying things and then
hating myself for saying them.

520
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:30,414
- How did you get past that?
- Didn't.

521
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:34,537
Can you please be a human being
for one minute and talk to me?

522
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:44,276
Sorry. Gotta go.
People dying.

523
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,238
You're not gonna outrun me.

524
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,109
House.

525
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:02,259
You're not ready for this.

526
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:09,822
I've seen the way
you and Stacy talk to each other.

527
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:13,178
You're an idiot.

528
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:16,028
You probably just
set your rehab back three months.

529
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:18,463
Let go of me!
Get off of me!

530
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,784
Liver tumor doesn't make sense.

531
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,870
Are you saying
the CT was wrong?

532
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,046
I'm saying
the symptoms don't add up.

533
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:41,106
"A" plus "B" does not
equal liver tumor.

534
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,095
We gotta solve for X.

535
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:47,157
We gotta look at this differently.

536
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,719
What do we know about her?

537
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:51,943
Side effects of Ritalin
caused the--

538
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:54,224
No. We've examined
the file up and down.

539
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:55,787
Come here.
Give me that.

540
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,978
Why do you people always
overlook the human element?

541
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:00,896
What do we know about her?

542
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,497
Margo...

543
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,890
Dalton.

544
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,388
The woman.

545
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:10,341
She's a people pleaser.
She doesn't like to let people down.

546
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:11,973
Who never fights
with her husband.

547
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:15,446
She went to drugs instead of
asking for help to manage her life.

548
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,905
So if she can't manage now,

549
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,716
why does she want another kid?

550
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:27,761
Foreman.

551
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,454
Need your help here.

552
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,507
You want to pull a bank job.
Would you go it alone?

553
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:36,566
If you're gonna rob a home, sure.
It's a one or two man crew.
But a bank...

554
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:38,708
Lookout, getaway driver.

555
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:42,905
I'm not saying anything
until the metaphor plays itself out.

556
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:44,984
So here's the caper.

557
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:47,916
Fertility meds
create a distraction.

558
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:51,200
Mommy had
three refills on the Ritalin
in the last three weeks.

559
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:53,017
That team goes straight
for the top floor.

560
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,862
Has no problem
taking out communications.

561
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,669
But they also
need  a specialist.

562
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,825
Safe cracker.

563
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:02,318
All this guy does is stroke,
blood clot, liver tumor.

564
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,200
Foreman was right.

565
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:06,881
This bad ass even does flailing.

566
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:08,718
Come on.

567
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:11,357
Only one guy I know
does that kind of work.

568
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,958
Birth control pills?

569
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:21,600
[Bam!]

570
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,880
While the surgeons are
cutting out a chunk of your liver,

571
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:27,736
should I have them
do a hysterectomy too?

572
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,523
A hysterectomy?

573
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,636
I'm trying to get pregnant.

574
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:33,345
You don't have to lie to me.

575
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:34,828
We're not married.

576
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,276
You're super mom.

577
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,442
You can do anything.

578
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,085
You work seven days a week.

579
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,100
You volunteer.

580
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:41,313
Raise a kid.

581
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:44,972
Yet you still somehow find the time
to lie to hubby number two that

582
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:49,327
you really really want to give him a child
with his chin and pretty brown eyes.

583
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:51,916
- What makes you think that I--
- Because it fits.

584
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:55,864
Birth control pills caused
hepatocellular adenoma.

585
00:31:56,202 --> 00:31:59,706
Explains all your symptoms that
aren't explained by your other lies.

586
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,474
That's it?

587
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:07,674
Also.

588
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,445
I'll have the tuna on rye.

589
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:14,909
Would you like to
leave my room now?

590
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:18,995
Tumor is benign.
Stop taking the pill,
and it'll go away on its own.

591
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,697
I'm canceling the surgery.

592
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,192
What are you going to
tell my husband?

593
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,373
That I'm canceling the surgery.

594
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,418
You can do the explaining.

595
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,402
It's tricky, huh?

596
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,100
It's one thing to say
you can't have a baby.

597
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:33,132
It's another to say
you don't want one.

598
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,302
Personally, I'd make up
some other lie.

599
00:32:36,642 --> 00:32:37,376
Could--

600
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,158
Could I die on the table?

601
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:44,335
Could you die
if you tell him the truth?

602
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,194
I need the surgery.

603
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,860
I'm not on the pill.

604
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,790
You can't cancel the surgery.

605
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:01,648
If she goes off the pill,
the tumor goes away on its own.

606
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,904
You have no proof
the birth control pills caused this.

607
00:33:03,988 --> 00:33:05,445
You have no proof
she's even taking them.

608
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:07,852
Well, if we do the survey,
maybe we'll kill her on the table.

609
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:09,687
Then I can prove
I'm right at the autopsy.

610
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,381
Or we can forget the surgery,
let the tumor grow, and kill her.

611
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,088
Why don't you
take it up with Stacy?

612
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:17,591
See which option
minimizes your risk.

613
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,519
Here's what I think
she's going to say.

614
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:20,644
Oh, I love Greg.

615
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,528
But if you go
against a patient's wishes,
you're calling her a liar.

616
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,887
And if something goes wrong,
I end up in court having to
defend the big, mean doctor 

617
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,628
albeit with dreamy eyes
who wouldn't believe
the nice suburban mom.

618
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:34,331
And even though
his cane makes me melt,
do the damn surgery.

619
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,879
Shocking.
It's benign.

620
00:34:10,602 --> 00:34:12,819
People do crazy things for love.

621
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:17,996
No. Crazy is
hanging out at the park
all day talking to pigeons.

622
00:34:17,996 --> 00:34:19,856
Margo knows what she's doing.

623
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:23,007
She gave up half her liver
to save her marriage.

624
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:28,341
No. She surgically removed her fingerprints to cover her pathetic lie.

625
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:32,872
It's twisted and manipulative,
I get that. But it's also...

626
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,116
romantic.

627
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:41,697
I'm barely willing to
put the seat down after I pee.

628
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,485
- Do we need to talk?
- Nope. I'm fine.

629
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:55,223
So the surgeon got
the whole tumor.
And it was benign.

630
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:57,478
- That's good, right?
- Yeah. Benign is good.

631
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,369
How could a benign tumor
have caused all the symptoms?

632
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:06,983
We believe
all your wife's symptoms
will go away now.

633
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:09,583
Oh. Thank God.

634
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:11,559
Look. I'm gonna pick up Stella.

635
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:17,082
I'll call you after
I get the baby-sitter.

636
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:25,270
Dr. Foreman,
you can help me.

637
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,911
You could tell my husband that...

638
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:32,523
because of all this...

639
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:37,456
I can't take any more
fertility treatments.

640
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:45,279
Confidentiality rules
stop me from telling
your husband the truth.

641
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:49,830
But my obligation to lie
ends there.

642
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:54,473
Are--are there--

643
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:00,267
is there a birth control method,
something that won't make me sick?

644
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,826
Margo, you're gonna have
risks with everything.

645
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,639
Especially if you're not
telling your fertility doctor.

646
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:10,098
If you keep doing this,
it's gonna kill your marriage
and kill you.

647
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,438
You don't know.

648
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:21,094
In a few years, we'll give up, stop trying to get pregnant.

649
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:24,470
We'll hug, cry.

650
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:28,223
Eventually, Ted will stop
thinking about it.

651
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:31,219
And he'll appreciate
Stella even more.

652
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:37,629
And we'll live happily together
for the next 50 years.

653
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:54,222
Something you need to see.

654
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:04,756
Knowing is always
better than not knowing.

655
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,188
It's a referral request.

656
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,396
Right.

657
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,853
HIV thing came in earlier.

658
00:37:25,137 --> 00:37:26,670
You're fine.

659
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,262
You won't read your mail,
but you'll open mine?

660
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,083
It said confidential.

661
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:33,702
I wanted to know.

662
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:37,330
The most important letter of my life.
And you're still an ass.

663
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,182
Comforting, isn't it?

664
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,348
Hey.

665
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:15,675
Hi.

666
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:30,084
I'm going to
talk to Mark tonight.

667
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:32,271
Then I'm going to
stay here with you.

668
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,223
Don't do it.

669
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,237
This isn't funny, Greg.

670
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:40,908
I know.

671
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:46,952
You...

672
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:50,942
spent all these months
chasing me.

673
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:54,733
Now I'm here and
you start running.
What the hell changed?

674
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:56,640
Nothing.

675
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,052
Nothing changes.

676
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:03,623
- I'm not going to change.
- Who asked you to?

677
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:07,833
Mark is willing to
do whatever it takes.

678
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:10,510
I'm not.

679
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:12,642
Never was.

680
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:16,893
Now you're introspective?
Weren't so analytical
the other night.

681
00:39:18,014 --> 00:39:19,237
You were happy with Mark.

682
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:20,201
You'll be happy again.

683
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:22,604
Shut up about Mark.
What the hell's wrong with you?

684
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,262
I can't make you happy.

685
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:25,922
What?

686
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,163
How do you think
this is gonna end?

687
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,062
We'll be happy for what?

688
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:36,371
A few weeks, few months.

689
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:44,247
And then I'll say
something insensitive,
or I'll start ignoring you.

690
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:48,329
And at first it'll be okay.
It's just House being House.

691
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:54,019
And then at some point,
you will need something more.

692
00:39:54,173 --> 00:39:57,495
You'll need someone who
can give you something I can't.

693
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:01,617
You know I'm right.
I've been there before.

694
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,281
Oh.

695
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,851
It doesn't have to be.

696
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:14,248
It does.

697
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:17,595
It does.

698
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:23,957
I don't want to go there again.

699
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:32,186
I'm sorry, Stacy.

700
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,722
50 bucks says
they're divorced in a year.

701
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:00,193
Six months tops.

702
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,862
I'll take that bet.

703
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:03,671
It's the perfect marriage.

704
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,810
There nothing to fight over
if you never talk about anything.

705
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:40,170
What did you tell her?

706
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,069
I told her she's
better off without me.

707
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:45,999
Huh.

708
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:47,905
That's probably true.

709
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,560
You're an idiot.

710
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:01,803
You don't think she'd be
better off without you.

711
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:07,001
- Right. I set her off on a whim.
- You have no idea why you sent her off.

712
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:09,911
- Don't do this.
- This was no great sacrifice.

713
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,441
You sent her away because
you've got to be miserable.

714
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:16,032
That kind of psycho-crap help
get your patients
through the long nights?

715
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:17,588
Or is it just for you?

716
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:21,118
Tough love make you feel good?
Helping people feel their pain.

717
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,942
You don't like yourself.

718
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:31,367
But you do admire yourself.

719
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,482
It's all you've got,
so you cling to it.

720
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:38,192
You're so afraid if you change,
you'll lose what makes you special.

721
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:46,591
Being miserable doesn't make you
better than everybody else, House.

722
00:42:47,135 --> 00:42:49,206
It just makes you miserable.
