to kill himself,</i>

182
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,266
<i>then he knows how miserable
his life is.</i>

183
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,166
It means there's still
something there to kill.

184
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,566
It means your dad's
still there.

185
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,266
[knock on door]

186
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,067
Sorry. Need you.

187
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,633
Thank you.

188
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:15,166
We were doing the EMG,
but we never got past

189
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:17,099
the insertion
of the conduction pin.

190
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,232
Did she just say
"thank you"?

191
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:21,067
I loaned her some money.
What went wrong?

192
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:22,600
Nothing went wrong.

193
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,633
If nothing went wrong,
then something went right.

194
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,299
You're not gonna tell me
why she thanked you?

195
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,600
You're not gonna tell me
what went right?

196
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,533
You did something
for which she is grateful,

197
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,566
and you're...
embarrassed?

198
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,666
For you.

199
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:35,700
She saw you coming up,

200
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,067
thought you were
a 14-year-old boy.

201
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,266
I set her straight.

202
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,866
I am not telling you
what went wrong.

203
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,299
Or right.

204
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,866
Until you tell me
why she said thank you.

205
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,067
Oh, you've got me.

206
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:48,399
You know I need to know.
I am so gonna fold.

207
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,033
Except you're forgetting
there's one thing

208
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,067
I can do now.

209
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,833
It's either that
or a reflex response or--

210
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,199
What happened?

211
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.
This is Dr. House.

212
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,399
<i>House, this is Caren.</i>

213
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,633
Pleasure's all mine.
What happened?

214
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,566
When we inserted
the conduction pin,

215
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,499
she flinched.

216
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,299
She flinched!
Did you hear?

217
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,833
<i>Does that mean
I'm getting better?
How big is a flinch?</i>

218
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,299
Bigger than a twitch?

219
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,967
Smaller than a spasm?

220
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:15,800
<i>[Caren gasps]</i>

221
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,232
You smoke?

222
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,000
Socially. Not a lot.

223
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:20,533
You do yoga
and you smoke?

224
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,166
<i>I know.</i>

225
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,433
<i>It's hypocritical.
Not at all.</i>

226
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,600
The world sees your legs.

227
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,266
<i>No one's checking out
your lungs.</i>

228
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,900
How would smoking--

229
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:29,967
It wouldn't.

230
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,067
I just needed a lighter.

231
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:33,466
[screams]

232
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:37,433
House!
Oh, my God!

233
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,166
The case was looking
so promising.

234
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:38,733
Hey, I'm not faking.

235
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,199
Get this lunatic
out of here

236
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,967
before she bores again.

237
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,232
I'm not faking!

238
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,299
I heard you
were watching surgery

239
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,866
with a patient's family.

240
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,033
<i>Talking
to a patient's family.</i>

241
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,466
It's because of your
hallucination, isn't it?

242
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,132
<i>After you were shot.</i>

243
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,299
<i>You chose life.</i>

244
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,866
You decided
you wanted meaning.

245
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,499
So you took a case
with no mystery.

246
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,299
<i>Something any doctor
could do.</i>

247
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,633
A case with no upside except

248
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,166
She thanked me.

249
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:45,399
And...you felt nothing.

250
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:49,366
I wasn't even sure
what I was supposed to feel.

251
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,399
It's like your leg.

252
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,067
<i>It's atrophied.</i>

253
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:53,766
<i>Keep working it.</i>

254
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,833
The feeling will come.

255
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,199
Sorry. Need you.
Again.

256
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,666
I told you
to get rid of her.

257
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,900
<i>It's a good thing
we didn't.</i>

258
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,700
Tightness in her chest.
She can't breathe.

259
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:03,633
It could be
a pleural effusion.

260
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,933
Right.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,700
Either that
or she's holding her breath

262
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,466
like a four-year-old.

263
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,333
[gasping]

264
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,833
Relax.

265
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,399
I'm not gonna
burn you again.

266
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,533
I'm going to stab you!

267
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:27,533
[gasping]

268
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,700
Look, either you're faking

269
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,033
or you've got
a pleural effusion.

270
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,666
That's a buildup of fluid
around the lungs,

271
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,067
<i>which is very serious,
and I'd have no choice</i>

272
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,132
but to stab you in the back
with this needle

273
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,033
and suck all the fluid
out of you.

274
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,533
[gasping]

275
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,466
<i>So.
(Cameron)
We should give her a local.</i>

276
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,600
That would defeat the point
of me being nasty.

277
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:59,600
Ready?

278
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,099
<i>Down.</i>

279
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,700
She can't breathe
if she's down.
Down.

280
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,599
She can't--
Down, down, down!

281
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,132
That's not
a pleural effusion

282
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,199
in the last two hours.

283
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,932
<i>So either we figure out
what's causing blood</i>

284
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,133
to build up
around her heart,

285
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,366
or I follow her around
with a needle

286
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,333
for the rest of her life.

287
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,466
Echo was clean.

288
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,533
No structural abnormalities.

289
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,867
Could be an
infectious process, TB.

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,299
<i>(House)
But not the paralysis.</i>

291
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:31,800
Let's assume
that she wasn't faking it.

292
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,066
<i>(Cameron)
She moved.</i>

293
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,633
Therefore, she could move.
She wasn't paralyzed.

294
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,733
Doesn't mean she was faking.

295
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,999
Could have been a delusion.

296
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:39,867
<i>Either she was faking</i>

297
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,700
and coincidentally
got a real cardiac problem

298
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,666
<i>at the exact same time,</i>

299
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,400
<i>or it's a delusion.</i>

300
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,867
And the fake paralysis
is a real neurological symptom.

301
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,966
You thinking vascular tumor
in her spine?

302
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,166
Her platelets are normal.

303
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,299
And she's been scanned
up and down.

304
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,333
It was all clean.

305
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,966
So open her up

306
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,633
and find it.

307
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,633
<i>(Foreman)
So what do you want us to do?</i>

308
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,767
<i>Start at her neck</i>

309
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,600
and just keep cutting
down her spine

310
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,266
until we stumble on something?

311
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,433
That should work.

312
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,333
[heart monitor beeping]

313
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:11,566
His heart rate's
a little high.

314
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,066
Should I be worried?

315
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,333
Probably just means
he's still in discomfort

316
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
from the surgery.

317
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,233
I'm gonna up his morphine
a little.

318
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,533
You've been so nice to us.

319
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,700
That's the job.

320
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,800
No, I mean,
all the other doctors,

321
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,333
all they did was obsess

322
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,366
<i>on the cancer, the treatment,
the damage.</i>

323
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,566
Just trying to fix him.

324
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,299
<i>You're the first doctor</i>

325
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:34,733
that's ever given a damn
about the quality of his life.

326
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,233
His heart rate's
come down.

327
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:39,966
Morphine worked.
I was right.

328
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:40,899
What a touching moment.

329
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:50,366
That's why
we become doctors.

330
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,767
One of those rare moments
when our hearts are warmed--

331
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,500
Would you like
to get a drink?

332
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,700
Are you serious,

333
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,133
or are you just trying
to change the subject?

334
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,166
No, I'm serious.

335
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,366
I drink.
You drink.

336
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,600
We could do it
at the same time.

337
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,133
At the same table.

338
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,833
Do you eat?

339
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,833
We could do that, too.

340
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,266
I mean, if the answer is no,

341
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,032
that's cool, but--

342
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:18,899
No, it's just--

343
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:19,700
You're just coming
off the surgery,

344
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,199
and you're not yourself yet.

345
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:25,466
And I work for you,
and even though last year's...

346
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,233
[sighs]

347
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,767
You're smiling.

348
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm saying no,
and you're smiling.

349
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,400
Oh, don't take it
personally.

350
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,800
It's just 'cause
you're full of crap.

351
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:36,366
You have no interest
in going out with me.

352
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,099
Maybe you did...
when I couldn't walk.

353
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,066
When I was a sick puppy

354
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,099
that you could nurture
back to health.

355
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,733
Now that I'm healthy,
there's nothing in it for you.

356
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,266
You are not healthy.

357
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,932
Cuddy wants to see you.

358
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,032
You've been back at work
24 hours,

359
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:04,433
and you're already
playing hide-and-seek

360
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,600
in a woman's spine.

361
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,433
Who won the pool?

362
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,800
There's no tumor.

363
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,966
Her platelets are normal.

364

<i>The scans didn't--</i>

365
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,533
What's the worst
that can happen?

366
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
I paralyze her.

367
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,366
She wouldn't even notice.

368
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,032
Her lawyers might.

369
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,366
You're not doing the surgery.

370
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,733
And lower the morphine
on your other patient.

371
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,700
Fine, I'll lower it.

372
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,066
If you'll let me do
the surgery.

373
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,533
What?

374
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,666
You want to trade?

375
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,233

puttin' up a barn.

377
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:30,500
You want something.
I want something.

378
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,966
We compromise.

379
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,466
It's the grownup way
to resolve our differences.

380
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,966
There already
is a mechanism for that.

381
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:38,032
It's called the employer-
employee relationship.

382
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,500
You tried to swap?

383
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,433
Ran a few more tests.

384
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,066

Does that make me evil?

388
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:15,966
Yeah.

389
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,133
The girl's life
is at stake.

390
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,999
All we're talking about
with the guy is--

391
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,366
All we're talking about
is the reason you took the case.

392
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,366
To help someone.

393
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,700
Too bad for them.

394
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:25,666
Too bad for you.

395
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,833
The reason we crave meaning

396
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,966
is because
it makes us happy.

397
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,999
The first level
of happiness is--

398
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,066

399
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,833

<i>The seventh level

00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,466
You're saving lives.

404
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,666
Which is tantamount
to creating lives.

405
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,199
But all you're taking
away from this

406
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,566

True, but that's not

<i>That is not a sexy

has that got to do with--

424
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,466

Lots of protein, lots of--

No vitamin C.

436
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,999
Now drink.

00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,633
Well, thank you.

438
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,533
And thank Dr. House.

439
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,633
Send him a note.

440
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,700
The nurse changed
his morphine.

441
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,500

It's just post-op

So he won't have
any pain?

00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,099
Thank you.

Well, you took away his pain,
and that--

449
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,999
that changes a lot.

450
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:31,199
Why don't you put him
in some sort of facility?

451
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:33,899
Someplace without a pool.

452
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:40,500
Yeah, I could dump him there.

453
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:44,666
Except...he's my husband.

He's my son's father.
Right.

I have a responsibility.

463
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:10,199
So he's just an anchor weighing
you and your family down.

464
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,500
Sapping your energy,
wasting your life.

465

That's the meaning
you take from this.

I can't abandon him.

469
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:22,666
So you don't want
to take care of him.

470
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:26,032
Taking care of him

471
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,166

make you happy.

472
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,733
But not taking care of him
would make you miserable.

473

00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,666
You like wasting your time?

540
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,699
I'm learning.

541
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:41,900
To do what?

542
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:43,766
Reconsider solved cases

543
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,733
<i>because you don't want to deal
with the real world?</i>

544
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,066
He's pushing
where there's nothing.

545
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,233
Cameron, you are
an excellent doctor.

546
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,599
You'll get lots
of tearful thank-yous

547
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,833
from grateful patients.

548
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,699
Yeah, am I such a bitch
for wanting that?

549
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:55,332
Well, it's not a bad thing.

550
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,599
<i>But it's not
why I'm here.</i>

551
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,399
I took this fellowship
to learn from House.

552
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,033
He's teaching you
to be a masochist.

553
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,566
Dry eyes goes on the board.

554
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,666
<i>(Foreman)
In eight years,
the patient experienced</i>

555
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,000
<i>214 symptoms,
many of them repeating.</i>

556
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,833
Any patterns?

557
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,966
<i>(Chase)
Fever plus frequent urination
could mean prostatitis.</i>

558
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,066
Or a urinary tract infection.

559
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,966
White count was normal.
No infection.

560
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>(Foreman)
If you add pain
into the mix,</i>

561
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,432
<i>fever, frequent urination</i>

562
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:25,866
<i>could indicate
a kidney problem.</i>

563
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,833
I like it.

564
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,399
No.

565
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,432
Creatinine and BUN
were both normal.

566
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,332
Not the kidney part.
The pain part.

567
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>Abdominal pain
plus all that stuff</i>

568
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,332
<i>could equal
pancreatic cysts.</i>

569
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:37,566
<i>(Cameron)
Perfect.</i>

570
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:38,566
<i>You've managed to pick
the one symptom</i>

571
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:39,167
he never had.

572
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,033
Abdominal pain.

573
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,033
It's the first symptom
on the board.

574
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,066
<i>Grunt.</i>

575
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,966
Grunting isn't pathognomonic
for abdominal pain.
No.

576
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,666
The traditional
diagnostic marker

577
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:49,733
<i>is compression
of the diaphragm</i>

578
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,633
<i>and vibration
of the larynx,</i>

579
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:51,966
<i>leading to the audible sound.</i>

580
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,167
"I have a pain
in my abdomen."

581
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,366
<i>(Cameron)
Richard's symptoms are culled</i>

582
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:56,066
from eight years
of medical history.

583
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,033
They're not patterned.

584
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
These are random,

585
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,733
<i>individual events over time.</i>

586
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,733
Illnesses have
incubation periods.

587
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,900
<i>Do an upper endoscopic
ultrasound.</i>

588
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,233
<i>(Foreman)
His throat will collapse.</i>

589
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,733
Muscle degeneration
in his neck

590
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,733
won't tolerate the scope.

591
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,133
It's an automatic trach.

592
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,833
You're talking about him
like he's an invalid.

593
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
We're insensitive.

594
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,133
<i>Does he drool?</i>

595
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,332
<i>Can he hold
his neck straight?</i>

596
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,432
Does he choke
on his food?

597
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,566
His neck's fine.

598
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,133
His throat's
not gonna collapse.

599
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Cameron, get consent
from the wife.

600
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,233
Open.

601
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,466
I need you to swallow.

602
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,299
[gulps]

603
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Sorry about that.

604
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:59,233
Here we go.

605
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:10,066
Passing through the lower
esophageal sphincter,

606
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,466
<i>into the antrum
of the stomach.</i>

607
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:15,432
<i>There's the tail</i>

608
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:16,432
of the pancreas.

609
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,800
Looks clean.

610
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,332
<i>Moving medially,</i>

611
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,566
the body and the head
of the pancreas look clean--

612
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,267
Get it out.
Get it out.

613
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:24,833
It's stuck.
I can't move it.

614
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
His throat's collapsed.

615
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,432
[sucking air]

616
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,133
Vitals are all over
the place.

617
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,733
We're losing him.

618
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,699
I'm cutting.

619
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:36,432
We trached him, endoscopically
removed the probe,

620
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:39,267
and he's breathing again.

621
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:40,366
So, all in all,
great idea.

622
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,933
Did you get a look
at the pancreas

623
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,900
before the world ended?

624
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,533
It was clean.

625
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,599
Which means,
barring anything else,

626
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:47,666
meaning you,

627
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:48,933
<i>he can go home tomorrow.</i>

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,900
This man nearly died.

629
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,366
How can you discharge him?

630
00:25:51,432 --> 00:25:53,733
His throat collapsed because
of what we predicted.

631
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,966
<i>(Foreman)
You stick something
down someone's throat,</i>

632
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,332
they gag.

633
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,299
Spasm.
Which he did.

634
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,399
It took us a half an hour
to get that thing out.

635
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,033
Except our patient's throat
was sedated.

636
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Which means the brain
should have sent a signal in

637
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:05,566
not to do anything.

638
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:06,733
This could be cancer.

639
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,866
Even a new type
of vacular--

640
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,100
Stop it.

641
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:14,800
You're enjoying this.

642
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,033
I find it interesting.

643
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,533
It's interesting
only if you're right.

644
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,167
If you're wrong,
we're torturing this guy

645
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:24,633
to amuse you.

646
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,267
Half hour
to remove the probe?

647
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,200
House.

648
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:32,233
It's not a spasm.

649
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,332
His throat didn't collapse.
It locked down.

650
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,432
<i>Brain is supposed to tell
every muscle in the body</i>

651
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,432
<i>to relax and contract
at the same time.</i>

652
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:39,900
This muscle was only
contracting,

653
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,267
which means a signal from the
brain was not getting through.

654
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,167
Nothing to interrupt
any orders.

655
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,399
<i>All it takes
is one wire down.</i>

656
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,633
A few microtumors
on the meninges,

657
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:50,699
suddenly you're choking
to death.

658
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:54,766
You wanna look
at the lining of his brain?

659
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,533
<i>(Chase)
The amount
of contrast material</i>

660
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,432
<i>you'd need to pump up there
just to see--</i>

661
00:26:58,499 --> 00:26:59,933
He'll bleed into his brain.

662
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,666
No, he won't.

663
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,233
Because that wouldn't
be interesting.

664
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:05,499
You can get permission
this time.

665
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,399
The brain is enclosed
in a sack called the meninges.

666
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:13,699
Does this mean
the cancer's back?

667
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:14,900
No, no, no, no.

668
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,299
House.

669
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,033
If we found cancer,

670
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,766
it wouldn't be
the original cancer.

671
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,466
It'd be new.

672
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,599
So what?
More surgery?

673
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,332
<i>More radiation?</i>

674
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,533
Might not be
the worst thing.

675
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,900
If this isn't
just ancient history,

676
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,533
maybe it's something
we can correct.

677
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,699
<i>Might even get</i>

678
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:39,666
some brain function back.

679
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:42,100
He could get better?

680
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,033
No.

681
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:52,599
But understanding what
you're saying would be nice.

682
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:56,499
Maybe you can figure out
ways to communicate.

683
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:01,399
Thank God he spoke
to you.

684
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,566
Mrs. McNeil.

685
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,432
<i>The test to do this
is very risky.</i>

686
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,000
He could die.

687
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,432
He's already dead.

688
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,133
[tense music]

689
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,933
<i>(Foreman)
Contrast material entering
into the fourth ventricle.</i>

690
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,533
<i>No parietal bleeds.</i>

691
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,299
Blood pressure's high.
But it's holding.

692
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,167
<i>(Foreman)
Meninges are intact.</i>

693
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,267
<i>No bleeding.</i>

694
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,266
Surgeon repaired
the CSF leak.

695
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,667
You're lucky he didn't die.

696
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:16,732
<i>I'm lucky?</i>

697
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,600
He's the one
who didn't die.

698
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,866
We told you
he'd hemorrhage.

699
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,400
You told me he'd bleed
into his brain,

700
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:22,466
not out of his ear.

701
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:23,732
You've gotta drop this.

702
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,832
We're missing something.

703
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,266
We did
a dangerous test.

704
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,866
And something
bad happened.

705
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,699
That's all this is.

706
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:34,066
Give me a tour
of the brain, Foreman.

707
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,667
Walk me through the scans.

708
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,766
1998.

709
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:39,133
What happened?

710
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,133
5-centimeter, grade IV
astrocytoma

711
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
between the parietal--
Nothing. Next.

712
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,667
Speck on the superior
temporal region.

713
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,400
It's a regrowth.
Benign.

714
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:51,099
Star thingy next to
the Rathke cleft?

715
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,466
Scar tissue
from a biopsy.

716
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,400
House, every speck

720

Redo every blood test
he's ever had.

721
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,233
Re-scan his head.

722
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,233
No.

723
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,133
He's been sick and suffering
for eight years.

724
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm not gonna
help you make it worse.

725
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,633
I'm not gonna help you
make it interesting.

Foreman's better at that stuff
than you are.

728
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,033
We need 5-millimeter cuts

729
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:17,433

and hypothalamic regions.

730
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,266
No.

731
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:31,433
How many millimeters?

732
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,033
<i>I can help him.</i>

733
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,933
This is it?
That's your argument?

734
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,633
Seems like a good one.

735
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,066
If I thought for a second
you wanted to help him,

736
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,266
<i>you'd have carte blanche.</i>

737
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,966
You're doing this
because it's fun.

738
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,832
Does nobody

739
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:48,500

to talk about

740
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:49,999
than my motives?

741
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,500
My motives have nothing to do
with the case.

742
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,466
Your motives have everything
to do with your judgment.

743
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,667
For the first time in years,
I've got no opiates in my body.

744
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,500
Now you question my judgment.

745
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,533
24 times a year you come
storming into my office,

746
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,366
<i>spouting that you
can help someone.</i>

747
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,200
Only you never say
those words.

748
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:06,300
<i>You say something like,
"His pancreas</i>

752
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,732
I didn't want to bore you
with the details.

753
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,533
There are no details.

754
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,667
You have a hunch.

755
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:19,766
<i>House, you don't use hunches.</i>

756
00:31:19,832 --> 00:31:21,600
You always have reasons.

759
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,166
I'm sorry.

760
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:28,567
As of 7:00 A.M.
tomorrow morning,

761
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:29,699
I'm sending your patient home.

762
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,433
The answer is no.

763
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,033
Cuddy called 30 seconds
after you left

764
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,333
and said you'd try
an end around.

765
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,933
My leg hurt.

766
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,600
How bad?

767
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,567
Enough that I'm
telling you.

768
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,166
Did it go away?

769
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:12,567
Ached for a while.

770
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,266
First time I've felt anything
there since the surgery.

771
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,667
But it went away.

772
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,866
[sighs]

773
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:20,933
It was muscular.

774
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:22,433
There was some cramping.

775
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,233
What are you smiling about?

776
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,400
You're 40-something
years old.

<i>You've been running God knows

781
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:36,600
Just give me
a prescription.

782
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,799
For Vicodin?

783
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:39,933
House, people get
aching joints,

784
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,866
cramps, they put on
an ice pack.

785
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,266
They take some ibuprofen.

786
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,466
I know what the pangs
of middle age feel like.

787
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,832
No, you don't.

788
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,633
Because you've been stuffing
Vicodin every five minutes

789
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,899
since you turned middle-age.

790
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,433
The surgery didn't work.

791
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,732
Don't play me.

792
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,033
Oh, you think
this is a scam?

793
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,799
I think you want me
to feel sorry for you

794
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:58,500
<i>and either do the end around
on Cuddy</i>

795

Either way, you get the high

797
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:13,333

798
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,699
You're fine.

799
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:18,466
It's just gonna take time

806
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:53,899
The circumventricular system
senses cytokines released

in the early stages
of the immune response.

808
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:59,133
But CVOS releases prostaglandins
that reset the hypothalamic

He drove that wheelchair

because he couldn't regulate
his body temperature.

815
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,999
He had hypothalamic

isn't gonna regenerate brain.

825
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,200
No, but if the scar tissue
on his hypothalamus

826
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:33,099
is resting
against the pituitary,

827
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,667
the adrenals would shut down.

828
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,066
Addison's disease.

829
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,667
You didn't see any

I can make him talk.

00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,166
that came to you

837
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,799

Hopefully that's
the combination he was using.

00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,899
[laughs weakly]

899
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,933
Huh!

900
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:20,466
<i>[Richard laughs weakly]</i>

901
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:25,033
Thank you.

902
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:38,966
<i>(Cuddy)
He got up.</i>

903
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:41,600
I have to go tell House.

904
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,600
<i>No.</i>

905
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,266
Cuddy.

906
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,766
You can't tell him.

907
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:47,933
I have to tell him.
He was right.

908
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,866
Why did you do it?

909
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,033
Why did you think
he might be right?

910
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,300
Because he's House.

911
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:54,400
Medically.

912
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:55,600
What made you think
he was right?

913
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,633
Nothing.

914
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:58,866
He got lucky.

915
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:00,466
That's all that happened.

916
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:01,699
Telling him no
was a good thing.

917
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:05,899
Because next time,
he won't get lucky.

918
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,667
He'll kill someone.

919
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,366
Just because
he was right

920
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:11,033
doesn't mean
he wasn't wrong.

921
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:21,333
I see him every day.

922
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,533
I can't just...

923
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,099
Everybody lies.

924
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:24,667
[soft trumpet]

925
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:35,133
* *

926
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,933
* You can't always get *

927
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:40,832
* What you want *

928
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,633
* You can't always get *

929
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:44,533
* What you want *

930
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,899
* You can't always get *

931
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,667
* What you want *

932
00:41:52,732 --> 00:41:55,533
* But if you try sometimes *

933
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,732
* Well, you might find *

934
00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:00,400
* You get what you need *

935
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:04,433
* Oh, yeah *

936
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,200
* And I went down *

937
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:14,699
* To the demonstration *

938
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,300
* To get my fair share *

939
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:18,166
* Of abuse *

940
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,033
* Sing it to me now *

941
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,266
You can't always get *

942
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,300
* What you want * *
