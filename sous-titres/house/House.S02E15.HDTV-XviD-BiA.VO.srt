Bob, what's wrong?

00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,657
What happened? Talk to me.

did I wake you up?

Excuse me for actually
caring what I look like.

28
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:07,704
I think the word you're
looking for is obsessing.

29
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,551
Been at it for almost an hour.

30
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,752
If you wanted in,
all you had to do is say so.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,082
I don't want in.
I want sleep.

you got up anyway.
It's almost 9:00.

00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,949
You. Staying here.

00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,103
You're kicking me out?

38
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:32,283
What, you think
we should try counseling first?

39
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:37,892
Why do you want to
sleep on a couch anyway?
You got money.

40
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,217
At least until
the divorce is finalized.

00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,990
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.

00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,628
Bob:
It was three days ago.

44
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:06,650
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue felt like
it was blowing up like a balloon.

45
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,783
I assume somebody checked
for food allergies?

46
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,398
Well, the first two doctors, both did.

47
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:13,962
Next one said it was a panic attack.
The one after that
wanted to take his tonsils out.

48
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,778
The last one had no idea.
He just referred us to Dr. House.

49
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:20,690
It says the attack was
preceded by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

50
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:22,392
Um...yeah.

51
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:23,801

52
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,233
Awesome.

53
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,256
A sex fiend
with a swollen tongue.

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,215
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

55
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:40,385
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

56
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,058
No such thing.

57
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:47,992
What're you doing?

58
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,516
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,226
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

Wilson's moved in and apparently
has unusually loud toenails.

62
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,803

which could cause choking.

I didn't see  any sign of trauma,
and they were remarkably open.

64
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,216

they admitted participating in
a threesome a few months ago.

65
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,255
Hundred bucks says
they're as miserable
as the next couple.

00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:18,696
Another guy or girl?

67
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,886
Girl.
His wife's college roommate.

68
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,199
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

69
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,712
They're looking for something.

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,595
If you're happy,
you got nothing to look for.

71
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,982
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

72
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,652
And if you ask me,
if two people really
trust each other,

73
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:36,702
a threesome
once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

74
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

75
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,518
I'll take the bet.

76
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,353
Maybe the first doctor was right.
A food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

77
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:54,149
Could be neurological.
Progressive Bulbar Paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

78
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,361
No. ALS would affect
his facial muscles
before his throat.

79
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,363
What if the problem's
not in his throat?

80
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,568
That'd be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

81
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,289
- Says who?
- The patient.

82
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:08,231
Since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

83
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:12,775
I'm guessing this guy also
doesn't know the difference
between choking and suffocating.

84
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,092
His throat might be fine.
His lungs might be messed up.

85
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:18,463
Get more blood, a chest CT,
and a body plethysmograph.

86
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,771
Unless of course, you think
we should be asking the patient
where his anus is first.

87
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:28,665
It, uh, feels like I have to urinate,
and then when I try to go--

88
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,721
Pull up your pants.

89
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:35,734
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope. Not your prostate.

90
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,795
Herpes.

91
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,140
Herpes?

92
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,177
Herpes.

93
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,848
Your  turn.

94
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:46,363
If it makes you feel any better,
half the patients who come into this place
have some sort of crotch rot.

95
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,535
Uh, no, it doesn't.

96
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:52,099
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

97
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,255
You had any sex
in those 20 years?

98
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,760
- Yes, of course--
- Then that's how you got it.

99
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,918
The only person
I've had sex with is my wife.

100
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:02,331
Bummer.

101
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,497
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

102
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,470
It's not gonna cure it, but it'll lessen
the frequency of the outbreaks.

103
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,581
But there must be some mistake.

104
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,908
You got any kids?

105
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:13,593
Yeah.

106
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:15,732
Any of them take guitar lessons?

107
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:16,954
No.

108
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,645
Tennis, art, acting?

109
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,110
My daughter does karate. Why?

110
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,891
Give this to her sensei.

111
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:26,952
Oh, wait.
Does your wife play tennis?

112
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:27,865
No.

113
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,985
That's what I figured.
It never hurts to make sure.

114
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,953
[Rip of paper]
For Miyagi.

115
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,804
I'm gonna close the shutter now.
I need you to pant. Kind of like a dog.

116
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:43,864
[Pants]

117
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,958
That's  good. Keep going.

118
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,919
Can I ask you
a personal question?

119
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:54,643
Uh, I guess.

120
00:07:54,727 --> 00:08:02,453
The, um...the threesome.
And...the role playing.
Is that because things get boring?

121
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,988
No.

122
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:10,129
We just...enjoy our fantasies.

123
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:14,876
- You married?
- No.

124
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:20,366
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

125
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,106
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

126
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,476
They fail because...

127
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,940
while they're dating, people pretend
to be the person they think
their partner wants and then....

128
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,967
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

129
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,929
Maybe they are that person
while they're dating,
but then they change.

130
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:44,826
People thinking their partner will change?
That's another reason marriages fail.

131
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,384
People don't change.

132
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,974
At least not in any way
that really matters.

133
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,502
I think you've had
enough caffeine.

134
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,824
You were right.
It's not his throat. It's his lungs.

135
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,019
Plethysmograph  revealed
decreased lung capacity.

136
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:08,970
And the CT showed lung scarring.

137
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:13,620
It's definitely
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
What's not definite is the cause.

138
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:17,994
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.
Uh, he's not on any prescription meds.

139
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,992
And he's a wedding photographer
so I doubt he got exposed to
coal dust or asbestos at work.

140
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,532
Cause could be idiopathic.

141
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,720
Can't be idiopathic.
Idiopathic means
without a known cause.

142
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:27,614
What I meant was that--

143
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,651
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

144
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:32,707
Just say that, and
we can avoid this conversation.

145
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:35,815
No applause?

146
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,175
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

147
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,219
- Then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

148
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:44,099
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

149
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,180
You know it's going to.

150
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:50,672
It's possible the IPF could
just continue to--
[Beepers go off]

151
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:56,890
There's something wrong
with his skin.

152
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,918
Okay, stop scratching.
I gotta look at it.

153
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,499
I can't!
This is driving me crazy.

154
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:01,579
Stop scratching so--

155
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,210
- Make it stop!
- Okay--

156
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,619
Make it stop!

157
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,222
Make it stop.

158
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,298
Now we got something to discuss.

159
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:20,662
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?

160
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:24,226
It's obviously not
a reaction to medication.
We haven't given him any yet.

161
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:29,287
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not can cause
both lung scarring and the splotchies?

162
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:30,283
Where are you going?

163
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,865
To complete the second half of
the caffeine delivery system.

164
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,990
Either talk louder
or get in here!

165
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,367
Same color coming out as going in.

166
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,864
You think that's
a marketing thing?

167
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,473
Lupus could cause
lung scarring and a rash.

168
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,209
Or it could still be
a food allergy.

169
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,730
We've already
ruled out allergies.

170
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,411
Did we?

171
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:57,720
Where's Cameron?

172
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,474
We're in the men's room.

173
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,464
We need an allergy expert in here!

174
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,728
This can wait two minutes.

175
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,917
You don't know that.

176
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,972
Chase thinks that food allergies
should still be on the table.

177
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,550
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

178
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,869
Some homeopathic studies have found
a connection between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

179
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,292
which could cause lung inflammation.

180
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:23,914
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found that
ground-up spiders can cure cancer.

181
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:25,277
Can I go now?

182
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,384
No.

183
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,910
Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs.

184
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,730
Sklungs?

185
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,351
Lungs, skin.

186
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,440
Throat.

187
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,574
Heavy metal toxicity.

188
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:48,591
It explains the lungs, the itching,

189
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,539
the swelling in
his tongue and throat.

190
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,669
I thought you didn't believe
there was anything wrong
with this throat.

191
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,361
I never said
I didn't believe it.

192
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,559
I just said
I had good reason to doubt it.

193
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,647
And now?

194
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,573
And now I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

195
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,395
Patient's a little old to be
chewing paint off the walls.

196
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,156
Nor does he drink well water or eat fish
every day or do anything else that
could've exposed him to heavy metals.

197
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:12,272
He and his wife worked a wedding
in Cabo San Lucas last month.

198
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,516
A lot of pottery in Mexico is
contaminated with lead-based paint.

199
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,181
Now aren't you glad
you joined us?

200
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:21,485
Search their house and screen
his blood and hair for lead.

201
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,544
And test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

202
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:25,814
Chase.

203
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:30,560
Find out what the resort cooks with,
and if they have repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

204
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,602
I don't speak Spanish.

205
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,861
Then it'll be challenging.

206
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,204
Good Lord.

207
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,340
What is that smell?

208
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,342
Stuffed pepper.

209
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,305
Stuffed with what?

210
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:55,845
Vomit?

211
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,386
Thought you were
going to a hotel.

212
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,001
I found an apartment.

213
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,308
I can move in on Monday.
Is that fast enough for you?

214
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,512
What's today?

215
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,001
Where'd you get all that stuff?

216
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,844
Well, not from your kitchen.

217
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,963
Don't you ever eat anything besides
canned soup and peanut butter?

218
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,123
Don't you eat anything that
doesn't look like it's been rolled
onto your plate by a dung beetle?

219
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,281
Try it.

220
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,832
It's good, isn't it?

221
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:41,318
No.

222
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:43,879
Just better than it looks.

223
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:49,765
How much beans and rice do you think
you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot

224
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,991
painted with lead-based paint
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

225
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:55,667
Are we talking a child or an adult?

226
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,781
Adult.

227
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:58,060
Then I'd say a lot.

228
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:01,614
You'd have to beans
every day for months.

229
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:05,667
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

230
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,617
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

231
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,533
How much more
suspenseful can you get?

232
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:13,177
- I'm--I was watching something.
- No...

233
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,985
You were about
to watch something.

234
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:18,105
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

235
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,489
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick too?

236
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,196
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

237
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,003
We'll test it to be sure.

238
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:31,231
- Have you done any
recent renovations?
- No.

239
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:34,233
Have any problem
with bugs or rodents?

240
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,285
Just the occasional ant.

241
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:38,957
Use bug spray?

242
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:41,331
No. I hate the smell.

243
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:45,464
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

244
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:48,081
Yeah, I can tell.

245
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,978
You think ants are the problem?

246
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:03,442
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

247
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,591
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

248
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:08,680
Wilson made 'em
and they're amazing.

249
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:13,156
- She said she doesn't
use bug spray, but--
- Silver dollar slices of heaven.

250
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,670
- Some ants are poisonous. Maybe--
- Forget the 72 virgins.

251
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,711
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

252
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,234
I'm gonna be asking
for a plate of these babies.

253
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,922
Is the ant big and red
or small and black?

254
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,048
Medium and brown.

255
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,823
Halle Berry brown
or Beyoncé brown?

256
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,316
Is there a difference?

257
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:32,369
Is there a difference?

258
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:37,798
Army ants could devour, dissolve,
eat a cow in a matter of hours.

259
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:40,258
Australian bull ants on the hand

260
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:45,497
are nasty little bastards, but they're
more of a nuisance than a threat.
No surprise there.

261
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:46,953
Beyoncé.

262
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,695
Well, then that's not it.

263
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:51,150
How much clay did
he eat at the resort?

264
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:54,765
It's a five-star, 400-a-night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

265
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:55,467
Tox  screen?

266
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,755
No evidence of lead,
mercury, or arsenic.

267
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,842
Run 'em again.

268
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:02,022
Call the resort.
Find some disgruntled
employee to talk to.

269
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:04,143
- Go back to the home--
- It's not heavy metals.

270
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,389
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

271
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,408
Well, who you gonna believe?
The symptoms or the tests?

272
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,243
Could also be a food allergy.

273
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,467
Cameron says it's not.

274
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,554
If your tests can be wrong,
why can't hers?

275
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:17,119
His diet hasn't changed
since he was a kid.
His favorite foodis Corn Flakes.

276
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:21,526
Which I assume he eats with milk,
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

277
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:24,577
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

278
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:28,194
And yeah,
you can test him for allergies
for dairy, wheat, and legume.

279
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:40,691
I am not having an affair with
my daughter's karate instructor,
and I did not give my husband herpes.

280
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,642
Found out where House is.

281
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:50,313
If you're convinced it's allergies,
why're you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

282
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:52,224
We're not convinced
of anything, yet.

283
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,456
I think I need something else.
This cream isn't working.

284
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,295
We're doing everything we can.

285
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,812
Ow!

286
00:16:59,032 --> 00:16:59,616
Sorry.

287
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,914
No, no, it's not my back.
It's my feet.

288
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,543
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

289
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:07,009
Uh, it's on my socks.
It's burning!

290
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,384
I don't see anything.

291
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:12,622
Bob:
Please take my socks off.

292
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,033
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

293
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,278
Ow! Stop. Stop, stop!

294
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:19,743
What did you just
scratch him with?

295
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:23,409
If there was an allergic reaction,
it'd be on his back, not on his feet.

296
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,831
Oh, God, it's burning!
Please make it stop.

297
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,562
Gonna need some
gabapentin in here.

298
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:34,605
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

299
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:36,878
Not a sign of a food allergy.

300
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:38,557
Means there's
a neurological problem.

301
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,600
More significantly,
it's yet another classic sign
of heavy metals.

302
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:48,870
And I just did yet another hair and blood test
for lead and everything else he could possibly
have been exposed to. They're all negative.

303
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,076
It's gotta be something else.

304
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,748
- Lupus could cause--
- No.

305
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:54,813
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

306
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,717
So it's not a typical case.

307
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:59,557
- We should get an ANA--
- It's not lupus.

308
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,928
Symptoms don't match.

309
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,230
And the tests don't match
heavy metals.

310
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,399
[Beepers go off]

311
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,348
Maria:
It's happening again.
He's not breathing!

312
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,835
Tongue's swelling,
airways closing.
He's not getting any air.

313
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,956
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

314
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:26,441
Try to relax, Bob, this is
gonna help you breathe.

315
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:27,678
Oh, my God!

316
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,496
He's gonna aspirate.
Need suction!

317
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,274
What's happening?

318
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,465
Suction.

319
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,516
There's too much vomit.
We're never going
to be able to intubate.

320
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:35,847
We need to trach him.

321
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,411
He's not breathing.

322
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,389
Foreman:
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

323
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,572
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment--

324
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,682
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

325
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,637
And so would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

326
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:12,750
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

327
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:16,480
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation
can cause facial swelling.

328
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,758
It's still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

329
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,102
I'm doing an ANA and
a serum compliment.

330
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,998
If you're so sure,
why waste time with tests?
Just start treatment.

331
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,738
Oh, no, wait, we can't do that
because we already have and
it's not working. Ergo--

332
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,918
Corticosteroids aren't
the only treatment
for lupus nephritis.

333
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,514
We could also try
cyclophosphamide or
immunosuppressants.

334
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:41,806
Only if we confirm the diagnosis with
an ANA, serum compliment, anti-DNA,
IV pyelogram, and kidney biopsy.

335
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,648
So  now you suddenly
believe in tests?

336
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:47,797
- The symptoms--
- The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

337
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,376
Yeah, we all get it.

338
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:52,798
Unless you've got proof and
can tell me which heavy metal it is,

339
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:55,095
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

340
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:06,806
Systemic lupus erythematosus
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

341
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,434
Attack normal tissue.

342
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,096
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation

343
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:15,350
as well as the swelling in his throat
and now what appears to
be damage to his kidneys.

344
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,799
The treatment's
usually steroids.

345
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,590
But he's already on steroids.

346
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,046
If the tests confirm we're on the right track,
there are other medications we can try.

347
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,255
And if those don't work?

348
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:28,803
Well, lupus is a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

349
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:30,974
What do you mean, generally?

350
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:35,342
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

351
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,058
Cardiovascular and...

352
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:41,860
renal. That's, uh, the heart
and the kidneys, right?

353
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:42,980
Yeah.

354
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:58,359
[Hoarsely]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

355
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,547
Enjoying the salad?

356
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,152
There's no lettuce.

357
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,867
I'm aware that
there's no lettuce!

358
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:18,880
Do you know when
I obtained this knowledge?

359
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:19,822
Actually, I'm in the middle of--

360
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:20,987
When I made it.

361
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,550
For myself.

362
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,216
Well, how was I supposed to know?

363
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:30,179
Well...I was hoping--
This might tip you off.

364
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,284
That's kind of selfish.
Don't you think?

365
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:34,509
I offered to make you some.
You said no.

366
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,741
Ah, that was before
I tasted the pancakes.

367
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,764
It's a compliment,
you should be flattered.

368
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,918
Here.

369
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,051
It's Mrs. Lambert's
herpes test results.

370
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,303
Mrs. who?

371
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:50,908
You've told more than one patient
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

372
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:53,765
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

373
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,488
What would you do
if you got herpes?

374
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:57,396
She's coming in at 5:00,
don't make me come looking for you.

375
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,896
Actually, I know what you'd do.
But I mean a normal guy--

376
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,641
And don't be calling in sick, or saying
that your team needs you for
some kind of emergency consult.

377
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:11,142
If he suspected that maybe his wife
had also been playing pickle games,
he could just keep it on the down low.

378
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,957
At least wait
till she got infected.

379
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,260
You'd give your own wife herpes
just to shift the blame onto--

380
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:18,212
Oh, he'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

381
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,075
Of course, maybe it was the wife.

382
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,271
Maybe she was the one who--

383
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,477
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

384
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:31,974
She's waiting outside. Why?

385
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,033
Go search her.

386
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,809
What, you mean
her medical records?

387
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:38,137
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

388
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:41,909
You think she's poisoning him?

389
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:45,845
His symptoms should be getting
better the longer he's here.
Instead they're getting worse.

390
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:49,775
So either she's poisoning him or--
It's not heavy metals.

391
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:52,346
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens--

392
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,902
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

393
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:58,291
They don't get into the air or food.
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

394
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:02,028
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's been sprinkling on
his corn flakes is to search her.

395
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:06,698
I am not going to accuse a woman
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

396
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:08,246
It's the only explanation.

397
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,024
We've eliminated
every other possibility.

398
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:12,064
We have not eliminated
every other possibility.

399
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:13,817
Has he responded to
the latest lupus treatment?

400
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,107
He's only been on it
for a few hours.

401
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,090
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

402
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,836
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis, or sarcoidosis.

403
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,605
She's all that's left.

404
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,351
Do it!

405
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,312
Hi.

406
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,757
I'm Dr. House.

407
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:36,600
Mind if I take a lookin your purse?

408
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:38,122
Why?

409
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:43,652
Because I'm going to need to search it
and you for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

410
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:47,028
Why would I want
to hurt my husband?

411
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,451
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

412
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:55,274
Go ahead.

413
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,350
You satisfied?

414
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,951
Absolutely not.

415
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:14,268
She agreed to let me
search everywhere else,
but this she says no to.

416
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,349
Doesn't that tell you something?

417
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:19,690
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching
her vagina with a flashlight.

418
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:20,683
Oh, Cameron could do that.

419
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:21,647
I'm not going to--

420
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:23,650
The woman hasn't left
the hospital since they arrived.

421
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,686
Whatever she's using, she's
obviously hiding somewhere.

422
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,101
She's not poisoning him.

423
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:28,190
It's the only explanation.

424
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:31,189
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

425
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:34,297
because you're angry that
you can't find the answer,
and you're taking it out on her.

426
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:38,198
And you are protecting
a complete stranger based on
some childishly romantic notion that

427
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,566
people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

428
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,668
You calling me childish?

429
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,216
Grow up.

430
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,134
Shut up.

431
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:46,252
Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

432
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,272
Sorry. I'm not giving you
permission to assault someone.

433
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:12,148
Let's see. I'm thinking

434
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:16,451
Colonel Mustard
in the music room
with the candlestick.

435
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:19,901
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

436
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,700
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

437
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:27,064
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,
he'll be dead in a week.

438
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:28,252
If you're right.

439
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,637
If Foreman's right,
you'd have basically raped
an innocent woman.

440
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:39,624
My wife fired the maid.

441
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:43,844
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

442
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,631
You did your maid?

443
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:50,334
I was nice to our maid,
which...annoyed her.
God knows why.

444
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,687
Maybe she was doing her.

445
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,367
No one was doing her.
All right?

446
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,133
But, you still
feel responsible.

447
00:25:56,238 --> 00:26:00,046
Even though nothing
or no one was done,
it's still your fault.

448
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:04,459
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

449
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:08,559
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so--

450
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,850
If you want someone to
clean your apartment,

451
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,001
It's on me.

452
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,683
You're supposed to moving out,
not moving more people in.

453
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,254
She's not moving in.
She's gonna clean.

454
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,847
Maybe I should just move out,
and the the two of you could--

455
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:21,620
Oh, God!
[Machine beeps]

456
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,399
- Oh, God, no.
- Call a code!

457
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,377
Please.

458
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,798
Charge it to 360.
Give him epi.

459
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:33,477
Clear!

460
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:36,384
Still no pulse.

461
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,358
Charging. Clear!

462
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,776
I got a pulse.

463
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,251
Pupils are reactive.

464
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:45,442
You still with us?

465
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:48,284
He was without oxygen
for less than a minute.
It can't be hypoxia.

466
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:49,693
Could be a stroke.

467
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:51,815
Honey, can you hear me?

468
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:52,760
Back up.

469
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,946
Bob, talk to me. Bob?

470
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,878
Honey, please.

471
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:00,372
Bob, can you hear me?

472
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,161
He's awake.

473
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,186
Can you hear me?

474
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:08,649
Honey?

475
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,071
[Whispers] Hi.

476
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,288
Yes. She is...
quite the little actress.

477
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:27,613
So, let's say she's
not poisoning him.

478
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,502
There's nothing more to discuss.

479
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:33,515
We've got lungand kidney failure,
neurological symptoms,
and now cardiac arrest.

480
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,984
A systemic disease with
multi-organ involvement
is the definition of lupus.

481
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,559
Autoimmune suppressants
aren't helping.

482
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:41,681
We should start him
on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

483
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:45,016
Yeah. And interferon.

484
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:47,916
Interferon isn't an approved
treatment for lupus.

485
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:48,791
You're not still thinking--

486
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,206
Interferon isn't
an approved treatment for
heavy metal toxicity either.

487
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,566
True. But it's pretty much
the only thing we can do
for a viral infection.

488
00:27:58,304 --> 00:27:59,597
We didn't consider it because--

489
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,564
Because it doesn't make sense.
There's no fever.

490
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,691
Because he's got
no immune system.

491
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:06,745
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribe for lupus treatment.

492
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,210
He didn't present
with a fever either.

493
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:11,594
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction.

494
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:12,425
Which again--

495
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:16,389
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment,

496
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:18,794
his immune system basically
rolled out the red carpet

497
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:22,756
for the dormant virus, waking it up,
turning it into a present viral infection.

498
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,297
Give him interferon.

499
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:27,766
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse.

500
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:29,295
Suppress his bone marrow
even further.

501
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:30,039
Which is more likely?

502
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,629
A rapidly progressing, acute-onset lupus
in a patient who's already on steroids,

503
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,472
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

504
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:37,999
We didn't miss anything.

505
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:43,522
Well then, I'm wrong
and you shouldn't--
Give him interferon!

506
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:49,549
Intravenous interferon has
been shown to be effective
against some viral infections.

507
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:53,858
But, I thought you said
it wasn't an infection.
You said it was lupus.

508
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:57,946
The increasingly rapid
progression of the symptoms
has caused us to reconsider.

509
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,109
And what if you're wrong here too?

510
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:01,762
What if it's not a virus?

511
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:03,942
There are risks
with interferon.

512
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,177
Especially in a patient who's
already immunosuppressed.

513
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:12,240
Look, at this point, you're lungs,
kidneys,and heart are all failing.

514
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:15,047
We really don't have any choice.

515
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,648
[Hoarsely] I cheated.

516
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,608
What?

517
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,116
9th grade...
earth science.

518
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,188
Mr. Foley.

519
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:05,176
I sat behind you
so I could cheat off of you.

520
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:13,038
And I let you cheat...
so you'd sit behind me.

521
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:18,204
I thought we were gonna
grow old together.

522
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,635
In 9th grade?

523
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,556
No. 10th.

524
00:30:25,438 --> 00:30:28,168
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

525
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:31,277
No.

526
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,519
I knew you put out
in the 7th grade.

527
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:42,854
I love you.

528
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:48,565
Yeah, I know.

529
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,849
Say you love me.

530
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:54,719
No. [Crying]

531
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,543
Why not?

532
00:30:57,763 --> 00:31:01,942
Because...you're not dying.

533
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:05,253
Say it anyway.

534
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,435
You gonna make me hurt you?

535
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,542
I love you.

536
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:31,986
Foreman:
It's not working.

537
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,895
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

538
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,034
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

539
00:31:38,118 --> 00:31:39,106
Apparently not enough.

540
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,361
I don't think it's a virus.

541
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:43,171
We've been running titers
for everything we could think of.
They're all negative.

542
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,620
[House's beeper goes off]

543
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,900
Increase the interferon.

544
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:51,721
House.

545
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,666
You got a better idea?
Other than lupus?

546
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:56,488
No.

547
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,171
Then up the dose.

548
00:31:58,255 --> 00:32:01,401
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

549
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:05,666
Sorry. I was sick.
And my team needed
an emergency consult.

550
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:12,516
Your wife has herpes.

551
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:14,351
What?

552
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:16,761
That-- That's impossible.
I don't have any--

553
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:19,281
You haven't had
an outbreak...yet.

554
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:20,915
Don't worry, you will.

555
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,955
You rutty jackass!

556
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:27,165
Me? I haven't been
with anyone in 20 years!

557
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,718
But you're the one
with the blisters on his--

558
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,727
Doesn't mean
that he got it first.

559
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,886
You don't need to have
an outbreak to spread the virus.

560
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:36,380
Yeah! And you're the one always
talking about wanting more sex.

561
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:37,388
From you.

562
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,589
And maybe I'd get more
if you weren't actually
getting it somewhere else.

563
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:42,709
Well, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

564
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,486
Don't even think about
dumping this on my lap.

565
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,432
There's gotta be someway
to prove that it's him.

566
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,548
I'm sorry. There is no test.

567
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:52,436
Either you two ever
sit on a public toilet?

568
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,898
Well?

569
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:56,177
Of course.

570
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:59,396
Herpes can live
for short periods of time
outside the body.

571
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,976
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes--

572
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,328
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible
to get infected by a toilet seat,

573
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:09,803
but they'll also tell you not to use
the same bath towel to dry your crotch
and your face during an outbreak.

574
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:10,770
See the contradiction?

575
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,871
I always use a paper cover.

576
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,063
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

577
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:16,151
What about you?

578
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:17,696
No.

579
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,871
I never knew.

580
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:22,875
Oh, please.
This is ridiculous.

581
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,970
Damn.
I was sure it was Miyagi.

582
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:26,806
What?

583
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:30,252
He could believe that you can
get herpes from a toilet seat, or

584
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:33,255
he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

585
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:35,256
The toilet seat
makes sense, doesn't it?

586
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,636
Sure, but she'd only refused
to believe such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

587
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:43,514
And since you both
can't be innocent...
You rutty jackass.

588
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:44,765
Oh, you--

589
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,401
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

590
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,226
Honey. Wait! Please.

591
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:52,515
Wow.

592
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:56,879
Not bad.

593
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:08,426
She has a family history
of arthritis, doesn't she?

594
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,966
Yeah, she does.
What does--?

595
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,323
Stop the interferon.

596
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,220
Do another heavy metal screen.
Only this time, test for gold.

597
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,106
You don't still think that she--

598
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,728
And don't let her
go to the bathroom.

599
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,346
Why would you care if she--
[House hangs up]

600
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:22,649
Hello?

601
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,127
Ho!

602
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:04,387
Hi.

603
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,149
I'm Lady.

604
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:09,797
What'd you do to my closet?

605
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:10,873
I cleaned it.

606
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,862
Uh, Dr. Wilson said
that I could go ahead--

607
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,258
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet!

608
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:18,932
Where's the wood box?

609
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:21,413
- A wood box?
- Yes, the wood box.

610
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,304
It's made of wood,
and it's box-shaped.

611
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,755
It's been in the back of thiscloset since the day I moved in.

612
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,744
I didn't seeany kind of wood--

613
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:30,801
You may not have seen it,
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where?

614
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:32,897
Well, I did not move anything, I just--

615
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,724
Look, it was in this closet.
Then you came.
Now it's not in this closet.

616
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:39,469
Okay, uh--What type of box?

617
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:40,939
Wood! Wood!

618
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:44,403
It's a brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top.
It looks like a--

619
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,076
like a tackle or a toolbox.

620
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,337
Ah, you mean the chest?

621
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,377
The one that's under the bed?

622
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:10,131
Do you need to fix something?

623
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,691
Um. Thanks.

624
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:28,771
Well, fine, then I'll go
to one on another floor.

625
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:31,381
Well, actually, they're
not working there either.

626
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:35,587
Every bathroom
in the whole hospital
is out of order?

627
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:39,006
Well, they're,
um--The water--

628
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,572
I'm going to the bathroom.

629
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:47,008
Where is she?

630
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,483
She had to go to the bathroom.

631
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,508
- I told you not to let her.
- What was I supposed to do?

632
00:36:50,593 --> 00:36:53,043
- Tie her up?
- Why not? She likes that.

633
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:07,965
What are you doing?

634
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:11,483
Uh, your hand is wet.

635
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:13,262
Sorry. Must be nervous.

636
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:15,182
I got some bad news.

637
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:17,934
What?

638
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:22,241
The damage to your husband's
lungs is permanent.

639
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,576
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

640
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,885
he should regain
full neurological function.

641
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:32,778
Other than the fact that he's not
gonna be running any marathons,
he should be fine.

642
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:35,883
But that's good news, isn't it?

643
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:37,478
I'm not finished.

644
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:44,432
When I was a kid,
my dad was stationed
in a Marine base in Egypt.

645
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:48,720
We were in the middle of nowhere,
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do except...

646
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:50,369
look for a mummy's tomb.

647
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:54,033
You didn't want me
to go to the bathroom
because you wanted to tell me

648
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:58,812
my husband is going to be fine
and that...you used to live in Egypt?

649
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,419
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

650
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,282
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

651
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:09,644
I never actually found a mummy.

652
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:12,815
But, I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

653
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:18,024
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride is not only
great for toughening ruby glass,

654
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:21,992
but if it's mixed with gold,
it turns bright purple.

655
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,707
Now either, your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold,

656
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:38,629
or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal
with gold sodium thiomalate.

657
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,614
It's an arthritis remedy that
it's rarely used here in the in the U.S.,
but it's still popular in Mexico.

658
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,973
Gotta give you props.

659
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:50,487
I've never heard of
anyone using gold before.

660
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:56,339
It's almost...poetic.

661
00:38:57,904 --> 00:38:59,433
It's ridiculous.

662
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:02,983
Heavy metal tox screen
for gold was off the chart.

663
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:07,159
Why would I--

664
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:09,145
Because you were
trying to kill him.

665
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,806
I'd love to know
the why behind that why.

666
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:16,488
But, you're not gonna
tell me, are you?

667
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:19,667
You're wrong. I--

668
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:23,982
I love Bob.

669
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,473
I never said
you didn't love him.

670
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,500
How does somebody do that?

671
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:40,034
Sit by someone's bedside day and night,
helping them, comforting them,
and at the same time killing them.

672
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:41,950
Maybe he was
having an affair.

673
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:43,905
Maybe she was
having an affair.

674
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:48,557
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out of
slowly sucking the life out of a guy,
watching him suffer.

675
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,424
He must've done something to her.

676
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:51,818
Yeah, he had it coming.

677
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:53,136
I didn't say he deserved it.

678
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,944
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

679
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:58,800
Or maybe she just got
tired of being married.

680
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:05,026
Didn't want to admit to family and friends
that the marriage everyone thought
was perfect wasn't.

681
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,227
Shouldn't of us stay with her?

682
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:08,443
What is she tries to run?

683
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:10,832
Yeah. Cameron,
go back there.

684
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:14,055
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

685
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,659
Cameron:
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

686
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:50,673
Thrilled to hear it.

687
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,020
His kidney function
hasn't improved.

688
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,690
It will.

689
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,414
He's gonna need
a lung transplant.

690
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,298
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

691
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:06,734
You're pleased.

692
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:10,725
You think you've proved
every marriage is a mistake.

693
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:13,056
Do I look pleased?

694
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:36,134
Ignorance is bliss.
