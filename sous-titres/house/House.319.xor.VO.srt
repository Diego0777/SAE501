1
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:10,062
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming. Hold still.

2
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,024
What did he do now?

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,891
He got in another fight. And
I can't get his nose to stop bleeding.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,342
You have to apply much
more pressure than that.

5
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,617
You had to do this today.

6
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:25,465
I got office hours.
Supposed to have dinner with the Dean.

7
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,564
You just can't lash
out whenever you get angry.

8
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,868
- He said I smell like a monkey.
- Well, you do.

9
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:33,225
You can't refuse to take a bath and then
hit kids who tell you that you smell.

10
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,528
- Damn!
- Don't you think we should call 911?

11
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:37,929
This isn't his first nosebleed.
He'll be fine.

12
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,862
- Daddy!
- Hey, Lucy-goosey.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm playing doctor.

14
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,644
So am I. Um, can you go back and play?

15
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,319
- When was this fight?
- Over ten minutes ago.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,835
I feel dizzy.

17
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:55,643
- Maybe you should make that call.
- Okay.

18
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,907
- Daddy, look. I can help.
- No... that's great, honey.

19
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,858
Can you just please leave Daddy alone?

20
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:04,252
One of my kids is bleeding
profusely from the nose. Please hurry.

21
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,481
They're sending an ambulance.

22
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:14,352
Call them back.

23
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,432
He'll be fine.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,310
How you feeling, bud?

25
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:19,876
- You lightheaded?
- Lucy.

26
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,245
Oh my God.

27
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:25,337
Lucy, are you okay?

28
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,768
Lucy, are you okay?

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,370

30
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,104
Oh, for God's sake.

31
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,001
Stop. Don't move.

32
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,129
The way the soft...
evening light catches your eyes.

33
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,880
The gentle caress of dusk on your hair

34
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:25,091
as you turn around and leave
my office without giving me that file.

35
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,044
- Restrictive Pericarditis.
- Boring.

36
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:29,818
- She's in Kindergarten.
- Less boring.

37
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,869
Or grandma's been held back a few years.

38
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,936
It's calcified and she's hypertensive.

39
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,930
- Better get her into surgery.
- She already is in surgery.

40
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,931
Tricky procedure. Gonna take all night.

41
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:40,082
Sleep tight.

42
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:43,635
No congenital defects,
no health problems.

43
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,635
- But her heart is strangling itself.
- Fascinating.

44
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,189
Since the pathology on
the pericardium won't be back

45
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,569
until after they remove it.

46
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,270
Get started on her blood. You can
test for viral infections, bacteria...

47
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,262
Round up the usual suspects.

48
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,888
Amyloidosis,
Sarcoidosis, Hemochromatosis...

49
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,613
Heck. Go wild. Do all the osises.

50
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,911
All taken care of. Sleep tight.

51
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:15,620
This thing is already
all around her heart.

52
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,621
If it gets into the muscle, she's dead.

53
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:21,663
Best bet is Coxsackie virus.
Parvovirus B-19, CMV...

54
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:25,174
Bacterial infection's more likely
to turn constrictive. It could be TB.

55
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,625
Right. Forgot about the part
where she did time in a Russian gulag.

56
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,715
Her hematocrit's elevated.

57
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:33,668
A few extra red blood cells means
nothing. She's probably just dehydrated.

58
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,344
Yes, and I could assume three
or four things to fit my theory too.

59
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:38,312
She's sick.
She obviously hasn't been drinking...

60
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:39,216
Enough!

61
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,674
I take it you two aren't
sleeping together anymore?

62
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,711
We do what House said.
We test for everything.

63
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:47,662
Good.

64
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,076
Then I can go home.

65
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,130
Since when does we not include you?

66
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,466
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots anyway.

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,367
Might as well be a well-rested idiot.

68
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,511
You guys are idiots.

69
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:05,906
Why? Because we stayed up all night
doing exactly what you told us to do?

70
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:09,083
No, because you stayed up all night
doing exactly what I told you to do

71
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,263
and have nothing to show for it.
- We eliminated dozens of wrong answers.

72
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:16,087
I asked you what two plus two equals.
And a day later, you tell me, not 25.

73
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,738
Pathology report just got filed.

74
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,822
Found granulomas in Lucy's pericardium.
Indicates a fungal infection.

75
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:24,549
Nice work.

76
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:25,595
He went home.

77
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,243
Work smart, not hard.

78
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,069
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

79
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,623
Take "employee of the month" with you.

80
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,213
- I would rather Foreman...
- I know.

81
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:48,993
- I don't want anymore shots.
- I don't want anymore shots.

82
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,291
Jasper.

83
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,418
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

84
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,628
This will tell us why you're sick,
so we can make you all better.

85
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,329
Where would she pick up a fungus?

86
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:01,507
Anywhere moist. Around a pool,
locker room, public shower.

87
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,689
She doesn't have
any gym or swim classes.

88
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,860
She doesn't even like
to play with kids outside.

89
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,111
Haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

90
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:12,106
It's been hard to get away...
since their mom.

91
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:13,389
My mom's dead.

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,952
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,819
Last year. Brain cancer.

94
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:24,415
You're gonna stick
that thing in her arm?

95
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,686
Cool!

96
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,955
The cool part is,
your sister won't feel a thing.

97
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:37,838
Nice necklace.

98
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,952
- Thanks.
- You like videogames?

99
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:42,978
Love them.

100
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,524
That should do it.

101
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,505
You okay?

102
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,799
I want my bunny.

103
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:58,666
Are you being silly?

104
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,304
I don't know which one to take.

105
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,060
What do you mean?

106
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:06,892
What's happening?

107
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,716
So what does the double vision tell us?

108
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:16,238
Slit lamp revealed the eye's
anterior chamber is swollen. Uveitis.

109
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,593
Means it's not a post-op
effect and it's not neurological.

110
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,417
It's not fungal either.
The lymph node biopsy was clean.

111
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:22,955
So we're back to square one.

112
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,293
One and a half.
We've eliminated two more conditions.

113
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:27,970
Yes. Two plus two doesn't
equal 12 or 16 either.

114
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:31,086
Vision issues plus screwy heart
equals some type of auto-immune.

115
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:33,611
Lupus and Kawasaki's are
the most common in a six-year-old.

116
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:37,803
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old
who doesn't have Lupus or Kawasaki's.

117
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,312
Did you look at her knees?

118
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:44,541
Those knobby things in the
middle of her legs. Any scars or scabs?

119
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,712
What does that have to do...

120
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:48,159
Most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

121
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,334
They crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump.

122
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:53,282
Dad said she doesn't
like to run around outside.

123
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:56,802
- Because running around outside hurts.
- She didn't mention anything about...

124
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,853
Most six-year-olds are not familiar with
the phrase, "My joints feel inflamed."

125
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,297
So two plus two equals...

126
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,731
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.

127
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:09,846
We're checking her ANA to confirm and
giving her steroids to fix her vision.

128
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,800
Some idiot gave me two
ticket for a play tonight.

129
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:15,938
Saved his life. Apparently worth $186.

130
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,124
Sorry, I had to take a leak.

131
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,454
Oh, I... I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

132
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:22,405
It's an exam room.

133
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,770
What did you think I was doing?

134
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,812
What you usually do...
hiding from Cuddy.

135
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,613
Be stupid to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

136
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,986
- You been drinking more?
- Uh, no, I...

137
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,042
Guy's peeing all the time.

138
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,693
- The play, interested?
- Sure.

139
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,864
You want me to pick you up?

140
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,965
- I'm not going.
- You said two tickets.

141
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,769
You thought this was a date?

142
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,326
- Any other symptoms?
- My stomach hurts.

143
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,727
I have back pain and muscle aches.
I feel dizzy.

144
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,590
And I have trouble concentrating
sometimes in class.

145
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,535
- I really should...
- You want the tickets or not?

146
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:56,677
- Why don't you wanna go with me?
- It's a play.

147
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,275
Dudes only go to plays

148
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,735
if they're dragged by women
they're hoping to see naked.

149
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,306
So why are you giving them to me?

150
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,507
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

151
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,191
All right.

152
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,039
- Any fever?
- No.

153
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,439
- Anything in your pee other than pee?
- No.

154
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,296
- I'm gonna need a urine sample.
- No.

155
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,096
Yeah, that last one wasn't a question.
You might have diabetes.

156
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,970
- I can't pee in public.
- We have bathrooms.

157
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:29,693
I can't pee in public bathrooms.

158
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,437
Where can you pee?

159
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,399
I only live a few miles from here.

160
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,682
I thought arthritis was for old people.

161
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:44,004
JRA's an autoimmune disease.
Her body's attacking itself,

162
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:47,781
causing inflammation in the joints,
her eyes, and her heart.

163
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,280
Is it treatable?

164
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:52,897
It can be crippling. But it
can also go into complete remission.

165
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,523
Well, the good thing
is we caught it early.

166
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,274
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

167
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,303
Don't get up, Goosey.

168
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:02,745
Your stitches.

169
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,370
She's having a stroke.

170
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:37,545
Stroke was caused by a clot
in her middle cerebral artery.

171
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:38,731
Started her on TPA.

172
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,165
Should dissolve the clot
and hopefully prevent brain damage.

173
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,767
But we won't know for sure
until she regains consciousness.

174
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,118
Or she has another stroke.

175
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,778
Arthritis... heart disease.

176
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,819
Why can't this kid act her age?

177
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,891
JRA doesn't affect the blood. Means
the clot's a symptom of something else.

178
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,381
It's a symptom of polycythemia.
She's fully hydrated.

179
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,671
Her blood's still thicker
than pancake batter.

180
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,322
Thick blood explains the stroke.

181
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,231
Can also have cause
an auto-immune response.

182
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,501
Which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

183
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,902
But what explains the thick blood?

184
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,580
Lack of oxygen forces the
body to overproduce red cells.

185
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,164
- What explains the lack of oxygen?
- Carbon monoxide fume, cigarette smoke.

186
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:13,591
- I doubt our patient's a smoker.
- Dad could be.

187
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,782
- He's not.
- He says he's not.

188
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,326
Don't make me turn the hose on you two.

189
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,729
Chase is right.
You two go check the house.

190
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,493
See if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man.

191
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:25,890
You're intentionally punishing us.

192
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,687
By making you do your job?
It does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?

193
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,123
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks.

194
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,701
And you, start her on hydroxyurea to
control her red blood cell production.

195
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,621
Dig out a Merck manual,
medieval edition,

196
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:39,822
tell you how to drain a pint
or two so she doesn't clot again.

197
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,615
Dr. Cameron!

198
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:52,687
I got you flowers.

199
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,696
- For helping my sister.
- That's so sweet.

200
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,408
- Does your dad know you're down here?
- Yes.

201
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,011
Congratulations on your bundle of joy.

202
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:07,563
Something you forgot to tell me?

203
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:11,511
You should take these
back to where you found them.

204
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:12,321
Okay.

205
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,476
Excuse me,
can you make sure these flowers

206
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:16,371
and this kid get back
to where they belong?

207
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,729
- Sure.
- Thanks.

208
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,045
Let's go. Come on.

209
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:23,759
Wait.

210
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,613
So you're just draining blood from her?

211
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,410
You're not testing it,
you're not fixing it?

212
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:50,195
Your daughter's vascular
system is engorged with blood.

213
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:53,094
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

214
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:57,077
We're also starting her on a drug that
suppresses the production of red cells

215
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,928
so we don't have to keep doing this.

216
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,467
Good chance she'll make a full recovery.

217
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,249
- She hasn't spoken yet.
- Give her time.

218
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,149
Uh, this is your boy?

219
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,567
- Where have you been?
- Exploring.

220
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,432
- See ya.
- Thank you.

221
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:19,508
You know, you just can't
run off without telling me.

222
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,362
Okay. Can I have two dollars?

223
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,815
Oven's a long shot. They'd smell
the gas long before anyone got sick.

224
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,666
Yeah, right. House loves it when we
skip something 'cause it's a long shot.

225
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:37,791
Why'd you take the flower?

226
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:39,011
Why'd you kiss him?

227
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:41,362
- He did something sweet.
- He stole flowers.

228
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,472
He's eight.

229
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,392
You were trying to make me jealous.

230
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:48,743
Yeah, I want you to
profess your love for me.

231
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:52,670
Oh, wait, you already did that. And
it caused me to end our relationship.

232
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:56,854
You're enabling a thief.

233
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:58,624
And a delinquent.

234
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:06,016
Letters from school.
Fights, detentions, a parent conference.

235
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,382
Oh, I know, I know.
The bad boy is hard to resist.

236
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,770
It's a crush. It's harmless.

237
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,124
- It's never harmless.
- So I'm learning.

238
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,613
So this is us now?

239
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:20,773
We snipe at each other?

240
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:24,089
I'm not sniping, I'm looking for a vent.
Her room's directly above the garage.

241
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,340
There's all sorts
of CO sources down there.

242
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,507
I found a vent.

243
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,530
I think there's something in it.

244
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,870
This isn't right.

245
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,785
You dumped me. You don't get to be mad.

246
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,519
We had a really good thing.

247
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,160
You broke the rules. I'm angry.

248
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,174
I'll get over it.

249
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,916
She's being abused.

250
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:25,436
A bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse.
Kids get hurt all the time.

251
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:26,958
That amount of blood?

252
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,979
Oh, crap. You two are agreeing again.

253
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,210
Father's overwhelmed. Hectic job,
his wife passed away last year.

254
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:37,015
He could easily be
taking it out on the kids.

255
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:39,048
Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a t-shirt.

256
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,649
She's so ashamed of a nosebleed

257
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,026
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed.

258
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:46,124
She's socially isolated, the brother's
always in trouble. It's classic signs.

259
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,311
But no physical signs.
No marks on her body. No bruises at all.

260
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,701
What if it's sexual?

261
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,729
We should call Social Services.

262
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:01,255
Well, this sucks.
Either it's abuse or it's not abuse.

263
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:03,901
Which means either it's a symptom
or it's completely irrelevant.

264
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,852
Either way, we gotta waste
half a day figuring out which.

265
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,243
Full physical exam.
Look for bruises we may have missed.

266
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,942
Check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

267
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:16,519
We can't do a vaginal exam on a
six-year-old without the dad's consent.

268
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,870
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

269
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:22,049
Never is just "reven" spelled backwards.

270
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,186
Have you been abusing your daughter?

271
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,222
What? Why would you...

272
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,561
We found this hidden
in a vent under her bed.

273
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,751
I don't know anything about this.

274
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,123
Maybe she had a bloody nose.

275
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,996
- We need to examine her for abuse.
- You can't really think I...

276
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,476
Maybe you, maybe the school bully,
maybe the creepy neighbor.

277
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:56,220
I'm guessing you're not paying
as much attention as you should be.

278
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,939
You even know where
your son is right now?

279
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,191
Yeah, he was here just...
here a minute ago.

280
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,126
She isn't being abused.

281
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:07,476
Unfortunately,
that answer doesn't help me.

282
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:09,915
If you have abused her,
you're obviously gonna lie about it.

283
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,852
I'm not lying!

284
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,324
We need to do a vaginal exam.

285
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,625
No, she may be dying,

286
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,278
she still can't talk, and you're
gonna waste your time with this?

287
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,013
You consent,
and we waste a few hours doing the exam,

288
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,404
or you refuse and
I call Social Services.

289
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,931
And they waste three
days doing an investigation

290
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,182
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

291
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,762
I'm gonna look inside your mouth.
Open wide.

292
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
I need to look at your
chest and your back next, okay?

293
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,586
I know you can't talk
so stop me if you get scared.

294
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,166
Before you came here,
did anyone hurt you?

295
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:02,759
Make you bleed?

296
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,356
I need to look in your vagina now.
Do you understand?

297
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,950
I'm a doctor, so it's okay, all right?

298
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,649
Bend your knees,
keep your ankles together.

299
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,511
And just let your knees
fall to the side, okay?

300
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:21,888
Oh, my God.

301
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,031
She has cuts all over her genital area.
Like slices.

302
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,915
Some are almost healed,
but some are new.

303
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,916
- She could be doing it to herself.
- She's a little young to be cutting.

304
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,667
She's a little young for a stroke.

305
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:36,055
Depression accounts for the cuts.
Molestation accounts for the depression.

306
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,831
But do the cuts account
for all that blood?

307
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:38,841
They weren't deep enough.

308
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:41,531
So she's getting cut,
but that's not the source of the blood?

309
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:43,908
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

310
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,704
Obvious source of the blood,
not the cuts.

311
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:47,936
And there was no tearing.
There was no evidence at all.

312
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:50,637
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

313
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:52,651
Where is he?

314
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,640
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

315
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,591
Meaning what?

316
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,108
We found a t-shirt covered
with blood hidden in the heating vent.

317
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,059
- How do we know it's even hers?
- Her dad identified it.

318
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,146
Not the shirt, the blood.

319
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,689
Are... are those the urine test results?

320
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,159
- Yes.
- And...

321
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,808
- I'm going to ask you for some blood.
- Why?

322
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,814
To see if your answer will be,
I can't bleed in public.

323
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,979
This wasn't your urine, was it?

324
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,812
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

325
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:30,263
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

326
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:31,312
I'm not an athlete.

327
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:35,097
Second favorite reason
is because you're on drugs.

328
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,360
- I'm not.
- I am.

329
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:39,124
Third favorite reason is,
you have insurance,

330
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,075
but your friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

331
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:44,917
So eggs describes a list of symptoms
and you repeat them to a doctor.

332
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,308
Which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

333
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,306
Need you. Now.

334
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,358
My work here is done.

335
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,925
Am I okay? Is it diabetes?

336
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,276
No, you're pregnant.

337
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:10,534
Six-year-old abuse victim and
you haven't called Social Services?

338
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,935
She might have been abused?
That's horrifying.

339
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,729
Why are you wearing extra
concealer under your eyes?

340
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,164
The law is clear. You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

341
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,898
You don't proceed as usual while
the possible abuser sits by her bedside.

342
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,799
Dad consented to the exam,
which means it's not the dad.

343
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:27,762
How late were you out last night?

344
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:30,213
It's always the dad.
And I don't have a curfew.

345
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,296
Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?

346
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,344
I went to a play.

347
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:39,055
House, you are going
back to your office.

348
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,019
You are picking up your phone,
calling Social Services,

349
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,089
and you are reporting suspected abuse.
Do you understand?

350
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,741
What play?

351
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,167
You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.

352
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:01,448
Fries?

353
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,699
You took her to a play.
You only take women to plays because...

354
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,251
No, you only take women
to plays for that reason.

355
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:08,572
That's your theory.

356
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,469
Okay, then why did
you take her to a play?

357
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,733
- She's a friend.
- A friend with a squish mitten.

358
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,307
It is possible to have
a friend of the opposite sex.

359
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:17,258
Blasphemer!

360
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:21,167
She's not a friend of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

361
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:24,080
She's an administrator. She's
gonna eat your head after she's done.

362
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,239
Yes, I slept with her.

363
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:27,776
- Seriously?
- No.

364
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:31,967
Yes, you did.

365
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:34,733
Yes, I did.

366
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,698
- Seriously?
- No.

367
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,046
You got a problem, House.

368
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,294
We just tested the blood on Lucy's
t-shirt. It's full of endometrial cells.

369
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,963
So it's not her blood.

370
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:52,411
We tested that too. It is.

371
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,103
Your six-year-old patient?

372
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:57,678
It's menstrual blood.

373
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,517
She's started puberty.

374
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,817
How can someone start puberty
before they even start the first grade?

375
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,646
She was in diapers two years ago.

376
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,091
For some reason,
her body has too much sex hormone.

377
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:20,259
Caused her reproductive system to get
confused. Start operating prematurely.

378
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:23,906
We need to find out the source
of the hormones and cut it off.

379
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,857
She's so young.

380
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,905
I haven't even...

381
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,427
talked to her about sex.

382
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,413
I doubt she even knows what a period is.

383
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:42,338
Girls talk to their moms about that.

384
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,999
You're going to be okay, Goosey.

385
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,699
I love you.

386
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:00,714
I...

387
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:03,149
want...

388
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:06,043
juice.

389
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:15,884
She got her period and didn't know what
it was. She was scared and confused.

390
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,331
Her friend told her to
put a t-shirt in her underwear.

391
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:19,828
When she started growing pubic hair,

392
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:22,429
she snuck daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

393
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,047
Apparently,
forgot to sneak the shaving cream.

394
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,110
Tumors, most likely.

395
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,107
A pituitary adenoma would
send her hormone level sky-high.

396
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:32,139
In Puerto Rico in the '70s, there
was an epidemic of kids growing breasts

397
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,940
because of estrogen in the poultry.

398
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,048
If it was in the food, it would
be an epidemic. We've got one kid.

399
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,207
She's six. She's tiny.
She lives on chicken fingers and milk.

400
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,348
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels.

401
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:44,875
He's probably buying
stuff packed full of hormones.

402
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,003
Excellent argument. It's a tumor.

403
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,294
There's all sorts of environmental
sources: pesticides, soy products.

404
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:54,131
Some shampoos are basically
a placenta in a bottle.

405
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:58,675
If the tumor's not in her brain,
it's her reproductive tract. Get an MRI.

406
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,435
- Can I at least...
- Waste your time?

407
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,336
Wouldn't recognize you if you didn't.

408
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:13,390
Frontal cortex is clean.
Moving caudally.

409
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:18,073
For the record,
Cameron's the one who broke it off.

410
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:19,656
Not interested.

411
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:22,763
No masses in the hypothalamus.

412
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,819
I wanted more.

413
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:30,293
- She didn't share my feelings.
- I feel like I'm in a similar position.

414
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,091
Pituitary's clean.

415
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,282
You're an idiot.

416
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,936
Either she's lying,
or she's actually emotionally detached.

417
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:43,001
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

418
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:43,952
Neither.

419
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:45,694
You have to choose one.

420
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,437
There's a bright spot on the left ovary.

421
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:56,811
Looks like a solid tumor.

422
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,738
They printed my letter.

423
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:09,327
You were right.

424
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:12,244
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

425
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:14,045
- They printed my letter.
- Great.

426
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:16,819
You wanna see her naked.

427
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,515
No, no, no. She wants to see me naked.

428
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:22,737
She sent me flowers.

429
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,384
She's just thanking you for the play.

430
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:28,085
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude...

431
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,229
There's a card.

432
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,143
I suspected. Explains how
you knew who they were from.

433
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:36,241
"Let's do it again... soon. XX, Lisa."

434
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:38,164
X's are the kisses, right?

435
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,915
No, I think they're the hugs.
The O's are the kisses.

436
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,141
No, no. The X's are
definitely the kisses.

437
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:45,487
"Soon" is its own sentence.

438
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:49,468
I gotta go!

439
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,085
I'll miss you.

440
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,224
You were a good friend.

441
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:00,551
They printed my letter.

442
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,500
How was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?

443
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,301
- What's up with Wilson?
- He's just a little freaked.

444
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:06,326
Why?

445
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,265
I sent him flowers.

446
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,378
You're not supposed to be up here.

447
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,229
Is that other doctor your boyfriend?

448
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:25,454
No.

449
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,163
Your dad's probably looking for you.

450
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:28,874
He's got enough to
worry about right now.

451
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,696
Do you like him?

452
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:31,503
He's a friend.

453
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,048
Do you like him like him?

454
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,646
We should get you back to your dad.

455
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,997
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

456
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:46,118
I could be your boyfriend.

457
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,965
I... think that wouldn't
be fair to the girls your own age.

458
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:53,433
- He seems like a tool.
- He's not.

459
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,135
And that's rude.

460
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:57,301
I'm taking you back to your father.

461
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:10,482
Mass is small...

462
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,371
about a centimeter across.

463
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,261
Firing the biopsy needle.

464
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,323
- You nick an artery?
- No.

465
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,698
She's in V-tach; no pulse. Charging 50.

466
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:24,967
Clear!

467
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,807
Arrhythmia must've been
a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

468
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:39,164
We have to stop the drug therapy.

469
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,541
Bone marrow will just
go back to overproducing blood cells.

470
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,689
She'll keep having strokes and we'll
have to keep bleeding her... forever.

471
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,590
We resect the tumor, hormone levels
go back to normal, her symptoms go away.

472
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,638
Great plan... except for the
fact that her tumor's not a tumor.

473
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,158
It's a benign cyst.

474
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,870
If it's not a tumor, that
just leaves an environmental source.

475
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:04,503
Feeling another late night.

476
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,121
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

477
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,605
- You're kidding me, right?
- What?

478
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:14,047
The answer's right there.
It's just a question of finding it.

479
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,359
You don't need me for that.

480
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,861
Don't get the mochaccino.

481
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:31,542
They screwed up and put
hot chocolate in the dispenser.

482
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:33,484
Thank you.

483
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:34,864
You were right.

484
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,871
The eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.

485
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,848
I shouldn't have encouraged him.

486
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:43,181
Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

487
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:46,249
- You were a pervert at eight?
- Maybe 11.

488
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,003
I didn't realize
you were gonna get hurt.

489
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:58,153
I'm sorry I misled you.

490
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:01,037
You didn't.

491
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,226
You have feelings for me.

492
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:08,351
You come back to me again and again.

493
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,338
For sex. It's a simple, physical...

494
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:14,582
You have feelings for puppies
and patients that you barely know.

495
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:18,204
But when it comes to a guy that
you've worked with for three years,

496
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,680
had sex with, spent the night with...

497
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,885
you're telling me you feel nothing?

498
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:28,237
Absolutely nothing?

499
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:32,122
Get away from her! Don't touch her!
I'll kill you if you touch her!

500
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:35,879
Get him off!
Ah! He's biting me! Get him off!

501
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,402
Somebody better be dying.

502
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:04,387
Lucy's big brother's got a crush
on me so he bit the crap out of Chase.

503
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,218
- And I care because...?
- Just thought you might wanna know

504
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:10,070
when one of your employees
gets attacked by a sociopath.

505
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:13,379
Bees or monkeys, yes. Sociopaths, no.

506
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,059
- Hello.
- He's not a sociopath.

507
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,977
- How do you know?
- He's acting logically.

508
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:44,677
He's got a crush on you.
He's being aggressive about it.

509
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:46,234
Not just regular aggressive...

510
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:49,553
he's out-of-his-mind-on-hormones
aggressive.

511
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:51,623
You think he's...

512
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,652
You better figure out
what's killing the girl...

513
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,353
because her brother's got it too.

514
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,106
Jasper's got 100 times more testosterone
than a healthy, eight-year-old.

515
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:04,031
But we scanned his brain
and reproductive tract...

516
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,482
no hormone-secreting tumors.

517
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,378
Not surprised. What's more likely?

518
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:10,775
Brother and sister get the same
type of tumor at exactly the same time

519
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,987
or they both play in
the same toxic sandbox?

520
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,996
Yes, you would think that if, for
some reason, you were completely unaware

521
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:18,881
of the fact we spent the entire
night testing everything from that home.

522
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:19,877
It was all negative.

523
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:21,966
You went home?

524
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,071
Good for you.

525
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,807
- Delegate.
- We're not his subordinates.

526
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:29,981
Making it all the more impressive.

527
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:31,306
What if it's genetic?

528
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:37,473
Anyone else think it's more than
a coincidence these kids have symptoms

529
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:40,766
that could be caused by a brain tumor,
which is exactly what killed their mom?

530
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:43,873
You just said there were no tumors.
We scanned both their brains.

531
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:46,674
They looked clean.
So did their moms, until it didn't.

532
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,394
It can't be genetic.
Mom had none of the same symptoms.

533
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:50,345
Yes, she did.

534
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,535
If the symptoms were
pubic hair and menstruation.

535
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:56,107
That's ridiculous. If menstruation
is a symptom of brain cancer,

536
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:57,656
than I should be on chemo right now.

537
00:30:57,657 --> 00:31:00,757
That's ridiculous. You're
way too skinny to be menstruating.

538
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,514
What if the mom had other problems...

539
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:06,315
symptoms her doctors ignored on account
of the fact she was already dying?

540
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:12,119
Pull all her medical records.
Find any similarities to our patients.

541
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:16,729
Punch the little brat on the nose so he
doesn't have a stroke like his sister.

542
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:22,768
- I'm not sick.
- Just trying to keep you that way.

543
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,844
I want Dr. Cameron to do mine.

544
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:28,204
Trust me. You don't want
her cutting you right now.

545
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,682
So... Jasper's behavioral issues...

546
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:37,038
Could be a function of
the increased testosterone.

547
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,650
Hopefully, he'll be a delight
as soon as we figure this out.

548
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,758
My tummy hurts! It hurts!

549
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,124
No, it doesn't. Don't be such a baby.

550
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,151
- My tummy hurts!
- Where in your tummy?

551
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,417
It hurts!

552
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,321
Stomach pain is from
a cyst in her pancreas.

553
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:03,431
I found two more in her
kidneys and one in her lung.

554
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:05,082
They weren't there 48 hours ago.

555
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,567
The hormones are making
her body go haywire.

556
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:10,018
She gets one in her brain or heart,
she's dead.

557
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
No pressure though.

558
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:15,578
Mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

559
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,350
She had none of the
symptoms the kids have.

560
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,451
It's not genetic.
It's not environmental.

561
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:21,987
It's gotta be a pituitary adenoma.

562
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,617
Yes, that would make
complete sense if we had one.

563
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:29,105
Just because we haven't found anything
on the scan doesn't mean it's not there.

564
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,610
You should remove her pituitary gland.

565
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:36,577
Two siblings, same condition.
It's gotta be genetic or environmental.

566
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:39,273
We add in the same time and
we're back to just environmental.

567
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:42,297
And that would make complete sense if
there was anything in her environment.

568
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:44,082
That's 'cause we haven't
found anything yet.

569
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:48,039
She's been out of her environment for
four days and she's still getting worse.

570
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:54,016
- I'm getting the father's consent.
- No!

571
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:58,393
- We have no evidence.
- This is your process, House.

572
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:03,324
You asked us what two plus two is.

573
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:05,825
We've eliminated every
number except for four.

574
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,440
She needs brain surgery.

575
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,374
The ovaries produce sex hormones

576
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,846
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

577
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:21,211
Since we know the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause...

578
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:25,201
"Most likely" means she wants to root
around inside your little girl's brain

579
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,420
without any guarantee that it'll work.

580
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:29,544
That's why she's holding
off on doing your son.

581
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:33,195
Dr. House knows that unfortunately,
we've ruled out every other option.

582
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:35,433
We need to resect Lucy's
pituitary before...

583
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:38,155
- Who else visits these kids?
- They don't have any family in town.

584
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,228
You got a girlfriend?

585
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:41,751
- No one visits.
- School?

586
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:43,820
They don't go to the same school.
House, I've...

587
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,246
- Nanny?
- They don't have one.

588
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:48,160
They go to an after-school day care,
but none of the other kids are sick.

589
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,136
Yet.

590
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:52,012
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms as your daughter.

591
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,191
- Maybe the other kids are just slow.
- We wait and your daughter may die.

592
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,864
She does this, your daughter
will need hormone-replacement therapy

593
00:33:57,865 --> 00:34:00,613
for the rest of her life.
- The treatment are extremely effective.

594
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,578
She should lead a
relatively normal life.

595
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,363
And isn't that every parent's dream?

596
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:06,764
To have a kid grow
up to be relatively normal?

597
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:17,344
My husband died of thyroid
cancer that metastasized to his brain.

598
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,217
I've been there.
I know how terrifying this can be.

599
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,860
I am telling you that this is your best
chance to save your daughter's life.

600
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:35,786
You did not just play
the dead husband card.

601
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,706
My wife died

602
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:43,459
because she signed a consent
form that I didn't want her to sign.

603
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:46,028
Died.

604
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,680
Thank you.

605
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:58,139
How did you know?

606
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:00,927
Know what?

607
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,300
That the other kids weren't sick.

608
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,211
You've been here for four days.

609
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:06,162
I just...

610
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:09,175
I would've heard.

611
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:14,749
Right.

612
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,669
Do you have hair on your special place?

613
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,284
Miss Janie!

614
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,500
Can I help you?

615
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,241
I'm a doctor.

616
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,190
Two of your kids are
sick and I need to know why.

617
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,332
You think they got sick here?

618
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:40,611
I think you're dating their dad.

619
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:45,719
He told you?

620
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:47,688
No...

621
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:49,856
and I don't really care why he didn't.

622
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:52,760
I just need to know how often you
go to their house and what you bring.

623
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:54,887
- I don't.
- Shampoos, fancy soaps?

624
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:59,027
- Kids get in your bag?
- I've never been to their house.

625
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,865
They just lost their mom.
And we thought it was too soon.

626
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,462
Why are you staring at me?

627
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:13,867
Lip wax?

628
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,445
I just had it done over lunch.

629
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:19,912
- Mani-pedi?
- No...

630
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,720
just the wax.

631
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:26,923
Women get a wax, it's part of
the whole self-indulgent, beauty ritual.

632
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:29,596
Pedicure, steam, cucumber masks.

633
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,988
No one runs out of lunch
just to get a lip wax,

634
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:36,143
unless you woke up
looking like Yosemite Sam.

635
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:37,484
You're an ass.

636
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,669
It's always the dad.

637
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,966
Excess facial hair in women.
It's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance.

638
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:50,362
Exactly what the little kiddies have.

639
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,831
Is there something wrong
at the day care center?

640
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:54,828
There's something wrong in your pants.

641
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,098
She's a lot younger than I am. I...

642
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,377
use a...

643
00:37:08,964 --> 00:37:11,870
male-enhancement cream to keep up
with her. What does this have to do...

644
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:14,369
It never occurred to you to
get a prescription instead of some

645
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,327
penis pumper loaded with testosterone?

646
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:17,577
I keep it at the gym.

647
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:20,554
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says on the bottle.

648
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:23,698
It's never been in my home.
It's obviously never been near the kids.

649
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,403
- But you have.
- We been through that.

650
00:37:25,404 --> 00:37:27,883
I'm not a pervert or a pedophile!

651
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:30,376
30% of our waste is
excreted through our skin.

652
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:32,535
That sounds high.

653
00:37:33,278 --> 00:37:35,428
That's why you stink
after eating garlic.

654
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,137
Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week.

655
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,203
He's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

656
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:45,081
Every time you gave
the little tykes a hug,

657
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,982
you gave them a dose of testosterone.

658
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,732
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies can handle.

659
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:55,147
So...

660
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,166
I did this to them?

661
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,816
Just... holding their hands?

662
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:09,861
If I stop using it?

663
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,749
You'll be floppy, they'll be fine.

664
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:19,422
Give it back.

665
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:21,202
He'll still be eight.

666
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,039
You okay?

667
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,803
Yeah, I think so.

668
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,765
- Talk to Cuddy?
- No, not yet.

669
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:49,929
I don't know what to say.

670
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,336
Just be straight with her.

671
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:54,757
I'm not sure what that is.

672
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,517
I can't stop thinking about her.

673
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:02,277
In what way?

674
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:04,354
Maybe she's right. Maybe.

675
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:07,222
Maybe this is worth exploring.

676
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:16,073
- Are you sure that she feels...
- She sent me flowers.

677
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,903
How do I do this? What do I say?

678
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:23,701
Cameron would tell
you to say how you feel.

679
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:25,719
Me, I'd get her drunk.

680
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:33,087
I'm not gonna say anything.
I'm just gonna walk... into her office

681
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:35,632
and I'm gonna kiss her.

682
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:41,518
That's a...

683
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:42,653
bold move.

684
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:44,518
Cuddy likes bold.

685
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, you're right.

686
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:48,890
If you spoke,
you'd say something stupid.

687
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,800
Yeah, I mean, I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

688
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:01,312
Okay.

689
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:03,621
Yeah, okay.

690
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:18,991
You! You... you!

691
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,768
You were gonna let me do that?!

692
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:25,881
- You made a compelling argument.
- You sent those flowers to me!

693
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,390
Yes, because you took her to a play.

694
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:32,285
Because actually you do want
to march down there and kiss her.

695
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:34,045
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!

696
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,517
You're right.

697
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,022
Seriously?

698
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:44,087
No.

699
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,149
You're a jerk.

700
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,521
- Night, Wilson.
- Night, House.

701
00:41:18,698 --> 00:41:19,648
They're beautiful.

702
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,510
I thought about what you said.

703
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,900
And

704
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:36,171
I really don't want
a relationship with you.

705
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:38,791
I know.

706
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,456
I also know you like flowers.

707
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:07,887
I don't get the whole
May-December thing.

708
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:11,951
Give him a break.
It's May-October at worst.

709
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:14,637
Well, why can't it be October-October?

710
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,542
'Cause May is when
things start to get hot.

711
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:22,314
If that guy wasn't trying so hard
to keep up with a woman half his age,

712
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:24,665
he wouldn't have almost
killed both his kids.

713
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:27,056
Guy gets a little something-something...

714
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,580
couple of kids have to die...

715
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:29,839
circle of life.

716
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:35,094
So many people. So much energy
and drama just trying to find someone

717
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,436
who's almost never
the right person anyway.

718
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:38,769
It just...

719
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,021
shouldn't be so hard.

720
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,677
I got tickets to a play.

721
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,204
