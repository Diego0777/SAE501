1
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,601
Wait.

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,064
We shouldn't--

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,250
We shouldn't be doing this.

4
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,089
What? You're not having fun?

5
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,162
It's not that, I just--

6
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,063
Rather be with the boys?

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,770
No.

8
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,651
Well, then. Come on.

9
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:38,045
- You kids need any help?
- No. No, we're fine.

10
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:39,185
Car trouble?

11
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:40,658
No.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,859
Then, why are you here?

13
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:43,727
We're just talking.

14
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,382
And she do all the talking?

15
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,765
Most of it.

16
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,442
I know what it's like.

17
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:56,384
I'm gonna come back
through here in ten minutes.

18
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:59,716
Ans if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,038
Yes, sir. Thank you.

20
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:13,832
Now, where were we?

21
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,332
We were going.

22
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:17,511
Nine minutes.

23
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:36,602
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,218
Stevie? What's wrong?

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,340
Oh, my God!

26
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,063
Help! Someone help me!

27
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:05,741

28
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,862
16-year-old with respiratory arrest.

29
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,793
The only thing I hate more
than a thief is a crippled thief.

30
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:37,575
Yeah, me too. No sign of trauma.
No history of asthma or allerg--

31
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,854
- Who the hell is J. Whitner?
- No idea.

32
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,925
Stevie Lipa's EKG and
echocardiogram were normal, but--

33
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,725
Normal is good. Send him home.

34
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,327
J. Whitner! Doctor.

35
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:49,757
Who is he and where do I find him?

36
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,860
She's a new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

37
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:52,555
Is she hot?

38
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,749
- She's in a wheelchair.
- Doesn't mean she's not hot.

39
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,482
Just means she can't bend over,
so Cuddy has to bend over backwards.

40
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,181
16-year-old kid. E.R. work-up
revealed a bloody pleural effusion.

41
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,523
- That's odd.
- Yeah, that occurred to me.

42
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:09,793
- What took you so long to mention it?
- No tumors or pneumonia on the CT.

43
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:12,874
He passed out while making out.
If he's into sex,

44
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:16,450
drugs and rock and roll can't
be that far behind I'm guessing cocaine.

45
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,551
Tox screen was clean.

46
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:20,238
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been using drugs.

47
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,884
Looks like a plumbing problem to me.
Leaky pipes.

48
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,511
If he popped an aneuvrysm,
he'd be in the morgue, not the E.R.

49
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,074
That's why you're gonna do
a venogram instead of an arteriogram.

50
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,492
This is not a high pressure burst,
it's a low-pressure leak.

51
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:33,593
Still could've been drugs that caused
the pipes to corrode in the first place.

52
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:34,812
So go look under his mattress.

53
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:38,113
See if he's go any pills or
powder stashed with the hand lotion.

54
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,113
Sweet ride.

55
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,714
I asked for the one with
the sissy bar and the banana seat,

56
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,315
but Santa gave me this instead.

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,350
Guess that's what
I get for being naughty.

58
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,231
You must be Dr. House.

59
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,498
Oh, looks like there's been some
sort of mix-up at the parking office.

60
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,343
They had to move me closer to the door.

61
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,144
Had to? You don't look
like the type to pull a weapon.

62
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,465
- Wheelchair.
- Cane.

63
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:20,449
I think you should do the honorable
thing, let me have my space back.

64
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,509
Oh, well, uh,
since you asked so nicely-- wheelchair.

65
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,570
Cane. Walking long
distances makes my leg hurt.

66
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,264
And it's easy for me?

67
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:30,657
Of 'course not.

68
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,651
Pushing that little lever,
your thumb muscles must burn.

69
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:36,300
I'm sure the last ten
yards are pure torture.

70
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,703
Crossing the parking lot's dangerous--
cars can't see me.

71
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,115
Did you ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

72
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:43,983
No, gosh, on account
of the fact that I can't walk!

73
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,887
Maybe you should ask the
parking office for some crampons.

74
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:52,495
This is about who can most easily cross
the parking lot. You're the winner.

75
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:55,417
Oh, and the prize is
apparently a parking space.

76
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,377
There's still no answer at either
one of your parents' cell numbers.

77
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,785
Is there any other way
we might be able to contact them?

78
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,736
No.

79
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,364
They're in a conference.

80
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:16,650
They probably had to
turn them off or something.

81
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:18,041
What does it matter where they are?

82
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:19,993
I mean, he's in pain.
You gotta do something.

83
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,344
We need them to sign this.

84
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,615
Why can't he just
sign the papers? He's 16.

85
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,784
Still not an adult.

86
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,741
Then call my parents. They know him.

87
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,845
They'll take responsibility,
do whatever you need.

88
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,823
I can't. It won't--

89
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:32,969
You can't just l him sit here in
agony until his parents finally decide--

90
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,043
Leah. It's okay.

91
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,026
No, it's not.

92
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:41,455
I feel like there's an
anvil sitting on my chest.

93
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,138
You win.

94
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,915
We're doing the venogram now.
We'll deal with the fallout later.

95
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,466
My fingers feel wet.

96
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,978
That's just the dye. Your nerves
can't tell the difference between

97
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,341
the cold inside your body
and the wet outside your body.

98
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,242
The nerves can't tell the difference,

99
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,583
or the brain can't
interpret the difference?

100
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,081
It's a little of both.

101
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,974
You like science?

102
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,687
It looks like a diffusion pattern.

103
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,738
That's because it's the venous side,
low pressure.

104
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,167
So Graham's Law applies?

105
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,280
You've taken physics already?

106
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,984
No. Just sort of read up on my own.

107
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:51,300
I had to teach myself a lot of stuff
too Schools sucked where I grew up.

108
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:52,751
You go to public or private?

109
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:54,476
Public.

110
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,990
Leak has to be in the pulmonary
veins to get in my lungs, right?

111
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:00,365
Yep.

112
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,001
I don't see anything. Do you?

113
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,523
No.

114
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,069
It doesn't make sense.

115
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:09,077
How can I have a bloody
effusion without any bleeding?

116
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:28,737
This is putrid.

117
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:32,795
Put food-borne parasites and
infections on the list to check on.

118
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,570
I'll take the bedroom.

119
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,766
I'm sorry,
I didn't know there was anyone--

120
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:52,717
We were just--

121
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,053
I have a gun.

122
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:58,290
Look, you can take whatever you want.
My wallet's in my suit.

123
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,241
Freeze!

124
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,014
I'm calling the cops.

125
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:05,039
Okay, you don't have a gun.
And you're not calling the cops.

126
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:06,986
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops,

127
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,816
unless you two get
out of here right now.

128
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:12,207
Unless? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar does something?

129
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,683
You don't want to have
to explain the affair.

130
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,084
We're not having an affair.

131
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,032
He's got a ring. You don't.

132
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,835
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

133
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,386
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

134
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:31,091
I'm guessing you're a better
lover than you are a maid.

135
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,042
Maid?

136
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,390
You son of a bitch.

137
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

138
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,059
Oh, sorry.

139
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,852
And what's wrong with my kitchen?

140
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:45,988
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here to help Stevie.

141
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:48,566
Who's Stevie?

142
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,240
Your... son?

143
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,261
It was the address you gave.

144
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:58,046
The E.R.
must have written it down wrong.

145
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:00,445
Or you lied cause you don't
want us to talk to your parents.

146
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:01,851
I gave you their phone numbers.

147
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,628
You gave us some numbers.
We haven't been able to reach anyone.

148
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,406
I told you,
they must be in a conference.

149
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,663
- He's lying.
- Leah.

150
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,717
He's Romani.

151
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:11,944
A gypsy.

152
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,465
So you don't have a home?

153
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,913
Of course we do.

154
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:20,567
Next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires and--

155
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,097
stealing children?

156
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,016
This is why I don't tell people.

157
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,434
They share everything with
each other and nothing with the gadje--

158
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:28,385
the outsiders.

159
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,610
Sharing information with outsiders
has not gone so well for my people.

160
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:37,142
But right now you're making
yourself more vulnerable by lying to us.

161
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,443
You can't go to my house.

162
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,306
You'll pollute it.

163
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:43,838
- All we're gonna do is look around.
- Your presence is enough.

164
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,911
My parents take it seriously.

165
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,770
It's spiritual as
much as it is physical.

166
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,763
- You know where he lives?
- Don't.

167
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:55,582
Look, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

168
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,851
If we can't trust your answers--

169
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:59,448
I drink sometimes, okay?
I've smoked pot.

170
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:02,201
I'll tell you anything. The truth.

171
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,860
You just--

172
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,899
You can't go in my home.

173
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,267
The pot wouldn't cause
a bleeding problem.

174
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,918
A pesticide on the pot could.
Where did you get it?

175
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,326
Some kid at school.

176
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:19,736
He got the pot from me.
He doesn't even go to school.

177
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:20,970
His parents made him drop out.

178
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,971
- I'm home schooled.
- He reads books.

179
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:26,343
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really a professor?

180
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:28,100
He's a salesman.

181
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,895
They buy and sell anything
they can get their hands on.

182
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,553
They-- so you're with your
dad when he's making these deals?

183
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:35,743
He was just in Chicago a week ago.

184
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,235
- You fly?
- No.

185
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,629
My dad's got a truck.

186
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,270
- You can't be serious.
- Actually, I can.

187
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:51,887
See?

188
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,394
It's my space. I want it back.

189
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:57,342
It's not your space. It's the
hospital's space. And the hospital

190
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:01,072
thinks that the person who's
worse off should get the better space.

191
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:04,374
Your application for a handicapped
space says you can walk 50 yards.

192
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,746
And Whitner says she can
roll 50 miles between oil changes.

193
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:08,985
I can't change my leg.

194
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:12,508
The space I moved you to is
only 46 yards away from the front door.

195
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:13,993
I measured. You'll be fine.

196
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,808
Great, so I can collapse

197
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,547
four yards into the lobby
instead of outside in the cold.

198
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:19,900
As long as it's not in my office.

199
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,808
You know who won the New York
City Marathon six years in a row?

200
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,161
Guy in a wheelchair.

201
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,498
Then go get yourself
one and leave me alone.

202
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,249
Gimme my space,
I'll be happy to roll around all day.

203
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:32,185
You couldn't last
one week in a wheelchair.

204
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,784
Wanna bet?

205
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:39,642
What's wrong with you?

206
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,943
Nothing that a week
off my feet won't solve.

207
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,642
Venogram's negative. No leak.

208
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:45,124
You mean you couldn't find the leak.

209
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,725
- Is your leg worse?
- No, but my parking spot is.

210
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:51,097
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

211
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:52,576
which means when we find it outside

212
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:54,315
There's no leak.
I even checked lymphatics.

213
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,750
You're spending a week in a
wheelchair to get a parking space

214
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,073
- closer to the door?
- Easier than chopping off my legs.

215
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,948
- We've ruled out toxins and drugs.
- Kind of. He Romani.

216
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,666
Apparently,
they feel the need to keep secrets, so

217
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,097
it's hard to know anything for sure.

218
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,321
Yeah, he's also a human being,

219
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,598
which means you shouldn't
be trusting him to begin with.

220
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,999
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,450
It's a deep vein thrombosis.

222
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,349
The kid spent 16 hours
in the backseat of an old pickup.

223
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,333
Causes a clot and makes
its way to his lungs.

224
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:20,803
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot, bust it with TPA.

225
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,254
- Or we could find the leak.
- There's no leak.

226
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,540
You can't yell at a guy in a wheelchair.

227
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,458
It's a slow leak. You gotta speed it up.

228
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,558
Thin his blood. Redo the venogram.

229
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,105
That could cause a massive bleed.

230
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,506
Excellent-- massive'll
be even easier to find.

231
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:37,677
Pardon me.

232
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,754
Guess you guys are gonna
have to get the next one.

233
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:46,364
I thought you were redoing the venogr.

234
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,739
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

235
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,707
Okay, you're gonna feel a little poke.

236
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:57,700
- Can you maybe do that?
- Don't worry. It's just your leg.

237
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:59,377
I don't have to go
any further than this.

238
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:00,428
Take a look at this.

239
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,034
Bones of your forearm.

240
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,154
Uh, radius and ulna.

241
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,422
How 'bout the wrist?

242
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,379
Lunate...

243
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,236
hamate... the...

244
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,665
Scared lovers try positions
they can't handle.

245
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:21,163
It's anemonic for the wrist bones.
It's the only way I can remember them.

246
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,760
Are you okay?

247
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,318
Ow, my stomach.

248
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,305
- You hit something?
- I barely started.

249
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,656
- Lie flat.
- No, I can't. It hurts too much.

250
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:39,404
I'm getting out.

251
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,225
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

252
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:42,901
If he moves, I could shred his artery.

253
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,002
Just get it out! Now!

254
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,543
It's gonna be okay, Stevie.
Just inject the dye.

255
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,799
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

256
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,293
The clot's gonna be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

257
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,489
It's not constricting it.
It's completely blocking it.

258
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,740
His whole liver's fried.

259
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,753
Kid's liver's failing because of
massive clots blocking his hepatic vein.

260
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,554
How can he have a bleed and a clot?

261
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,136
It's not a clot. Must have
blocked a vein with a catheter wire.

262
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:15,879
Not a chance.

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,116
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

264
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,725
There's no heart failure or cirrhosis.
Means it has to be a clot.

265
00:15:20,726 --> 00:15:23,309
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

266
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,430
And since he clearly has some kind of--

267
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,741
You having a little problem?

268
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:30,679
Would you mind?

269
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,190
Boy, that was humiliating.

270
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:37,506
How does Whitner
make it through the day?

271
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:39,007
"Pride goth before the fall."

272
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,579
Lucky for me,
I'm sitting in one of these babies.

273
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,521
So, what other theories
can I shoot down?

274
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,835
DIC would explain both--

275
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,203
His platelets are normal
and his PTT isn't eleved.

276
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:51,848
- Leukemia?
- Normal CBC and differential.

277
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,537
You guys are still thinking like doctors

278
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,481
when you should be
thinking like plumbers.

279
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,382
Come on, I wanna see some butt crack.

280
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:00,427
Something inside the liver
is punching holes in the pipes.

281
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:03,244
Blood bleeds through the opening,
sticks to the intruder, forms mass.

282
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,904
- A clot.
- A mass.

283
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,142
Cancer. A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

284
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,905
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis or scoidosis.

285
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:12,243
Do a CT,
MRI, a sputum, and an ACE level.

286
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,500
Excuse me, sorry.
Cripple coming through.

287
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,341
He says his throat hurts.

288
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:27,788
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

289
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,180
No, I don't.

290
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,649
Good enough for me.

291
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,955
- Where are you going?
- Mothers know best.

292
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,882
Get yourself a sucker on the way out.

293
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,976
Look, I think he's just faking
so he doesn't have to go to school.

294
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,027
How did you know I was a truant officer?

295
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:46,098
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

296
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:50,068
Right-- he's wasting your precious time,
so you decided to waste mine.

297
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:51,124
How thoughtful.

298
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:58,602
I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't examine
him all the way up there. Hop down.

299
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,685
My life is just one
horror after another.

300
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,765
Open.

301
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:05,846
Does it look like it hurts.

302
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,355
Nope.

303
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:16,887
What's that?

304
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,544
It's a syringe.

305
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:20,227
I'm with you,

306
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,978
make him hate the doctor's
office more than he hates school.

307
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:25,166
That's okay.
I don't-- I don't think that's--

308
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,047
It's just saline--

309
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,306
hurts like hell when it's
injected directly into the muscle.

310
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:30,794
So what do you think? Arm or ass?

311
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:33,415
- I think he's learned his lesson.
- Oh, I don't know.

312
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,164
We better check. Jack,

313
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,686
is your mommy a big fat idiot?

314
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,336
Well, what do you know?
Guess you we right.

315
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,673
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

316
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,737
Sorry, I'm guessing the mike
in this thing doesn't pick up nods.

317
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:58,529
- Smart kid.
- Too bad it's all gonna go to waste.

318
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,353
Nothing wrong with being a salesman.

319
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:02,060
He should be able
to pursue his own life,

320
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,640
not be stuck helping
his parents sell old toasters.

321
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,928
He's still young, you never
know what he'll end up doing.

322
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,529
Unless he goes back to school,
I know exactly what he'll end up doing.

323
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,241
Wait.

324
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,140
Is that a lesion?

325
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,995
Magnifying times five.

326
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,306
It's a granuloma.

327
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,046
Means Wegener's is most likely.

328
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,002
- Stevie!
- Mom, is at you?

329
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,109
- Get him out of this now!
- Your son is sick.

330
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,990
- The sign on the do
- The sign says no metal.

331
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,591
- We took everything off.
- It says no admittance.

332
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:34,005
- What's wrong with our son?
- We don't know yet.

333
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,256
He not gonna die, is he?

334
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,391
Your son is very ill.

335
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:41,187
We're still trying to figure out why,

336
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,438
which is why we need
you to leave the room.

337
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,376
What are you going to do now?

338
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,853
Oh, now I've gotta slide my
butt from one padded seat to another.

339
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,320
What if I bump my knee?

340
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,426
MRI showed a granuloma in his liver.

341
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,498
Fantastic.

342
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,156
- Wanna give me a hand here?
- No--

343
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:20,659
Clotting, bleeding,
and a granuloma equals Wegener's.

344
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,610
I know. That's why I said fantastic.
I was being sincere.

345
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,828
- Now give me a hand.
- It wouldn't be fair.

346
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,643
We're gonna biopsy the liver to confirm.

347
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,875
Wouldn't be fair not to.

348
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,326
People are good and kind and
gentle and help people in wheelchairs.

349
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,465
- You don't believe that.
- But you do.

350
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,542
No, I don't.

351
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,267
Forget the biopsy. His liver'll
be gone before you get the results.

352
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:42,885
Start treatment with cyclophosphamide

353
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,386
before Wegener's punches
a hole in another pipe.

354
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,980
What's with the clothe.
You're not being discharged.

355
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:16,909
I know. It--

356
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:21,723
It's my parents.
They insist that I wear this stuff.

357
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,099
We insist on our own food,
gown, and furnishings for a reason.

358
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,436
Hey, my-- my chest burns.

359
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,730
Are you sure the treatments are working?

360
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:31,981
Wegener's causes the
body to attack itself.

361
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,285
It doesn't get undone overnight.
Be patient.

362
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,714
- Where's your soup?
- It's in the garbage.

363
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:38,316
It has willow bark extract.

364
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,437
Willow bark extract
is basically aspirin.

365
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,586
Yes, for the fever.

366
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:45,879
He's already on meds-- our meds.
We can't risk any adverse interactions.

367
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:49,330
We need all this stuff to go.
We need to control this environment.

368
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,399
So do we. People get sick for a reason.

369
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,895
'Cause something in their
life is out of balance.

370
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:56,656
Dad, he's a doctor.
He doesn't want to hear your talk.

371
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,701
Balance is just starting to
be restored now that that girl is gone.

372
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:02,334
That girl took pretty good
care of your son while you were away.

373
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,914
Yes, we can see that.

374
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,911
All this stuff may make him
feel more comfortable, but it's not--

375
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,442
How long is this treatment gonna take?

376
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,205
We should start to see some
improvement in his liver function soon.

377
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,042
"Soon." Very scientific.

378
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,275
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:28,183
Be back in a little bit to check on you.

380
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,855
Ah, yes. If it isn't Dr. Ironside.

381
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,459
Ah, if isn't "Dr.
I had no friends when I was growing up,

382
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,711
"so all I did was watch TV by myself,
which is why I can now make constant

383
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:46,662
"pop culture references
which no one understands but me."

384
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,522
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

385
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,298
Safe from Cuddy, but I guess
not from her trusted rat-complice.

386
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:58,962
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits of their handicaps.

387
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,133
Reasonable peoe rules
based on evidence--

388
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:05,453
like difficulty covering a distance,
say 50 yards,

389
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,874
not on some pre-ordained
pathetic-ness scale.

390
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,932
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth heavenly virtue.

391
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,425
It's only pigheaded if you're wrong.
If you're right,

392
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:15,289
they call it sticking
to your principles.

393
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,891
Give it up. You're demeaning yourself.

394
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:18,592
That's what they told Rosa Parks.

395
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,188
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

396
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,327
Get out of our home.

397
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,872
This is not a home. It's certainly not--

398
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:28,019
It's our home as
long as our son is here.

399
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,393
Mom, Dad,
will you just please just calm down?

400
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,974
You're not family.
You have no right to be here.

401
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:36,937
What are you gonna do, throw me out?
You can't even touch the gadje.

402
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,738
- I'll touch you.
- What is going on?

403
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm the one who brought him here.
I should be able to see how he's doing.

404
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,946
He wouldn't even need to
be here if it weren't for you.

405
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,737
Right-- I'm so unclean,
I caused his liver to shut down.

406
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:48,815
Enough. No one is leaving.

407
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,109
He's our son,
and we want her out of here.

408
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,510
- It hurts.
- Your stomach again?

409
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,046
- No.
- What?

410
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:10,045
His liver's actually improving. We
plug one hole and end up poking another.

411
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,857
We talking about the patient
or how to get a raise from Cuddy?

412
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,736
The Wegener's treatment gave
him a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.

413
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:16,733
Which means...

414
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,588
- it's Wegener's.
- What did I just say?

415
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,847
We were treating him for Wegener's
when it went wrong.

416
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:22,669
Not everything.

417
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,278
Yeah, it was a very lovely day outside.

418
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,930
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse.

419
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,143
Treatment made his bladder worse,
not his liver.

420
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,639
Clot in the liver's breaking up.

421
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,983
And the MRI, sputum, and ACE
ruled out TB, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma,

422
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:38,898
- which leaves us with...
- Still could be a cancer with multiple

423
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,452
A cancer we can't see on MRI,
CT, or blood tests?

424
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:43,756
It's Wegener's.

425
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:47,059
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

426
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,635
We could increase immunosuppression.
Add methotrexate.

427
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,136
We can't give methotrexate to
a kid who's already had lung problems.

428
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:56,035
Methotrexate is carpet bombing.
Hits everything.

429
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,577
We need a smart bomb.

430
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:01,102
So we don't suppress the immune system--

431
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:02,579
we change it.

432
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,281
Immune modulation.

433
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:09,545
FT-28. His antibodies are
attacking his blood vessels.

434
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,099
The irritation causes
them to bleed and clot.

435
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,707
We change his immune system
so the antibodies don't interact

436
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,414
with his blood vessels
but work fine everywhere else.

437
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,255
FT-28's still experimental.
It's not FDA-approd.

438
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,048
It's worked for Crohn's
Disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

439
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,414
He doesn't have Crohn's or arthritis.

440
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:26,955
Let's say that he does...

441
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,717
and start the treatment.

442
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:37,345
Absolutely not.

443
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,590
My people have been experimented
on before. Never again.

444
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:42,501
Mr. Lipa, with all due respect,

445
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:46,254
comparing this hospital to Auschwitz,
it's ridiculous.

446
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:50,647
- FT-28's been proven safe in hundreds--
- People always say you can trust them.

447
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:53,092
Why'd they say anything else?
Why do they think we'd listen

448
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:55,688
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come from a people

449
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,964
who've been enslaved,
mistreated, and experimented on?

450
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,790
Tuskeg went on for 28
years after World War II.

451
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,968
And the laws that made
it illegal for the Romani

452
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:06,229
to even set foot in this state
were still on the books until 1998.

453
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,726
It's not ancient history.

454
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:10,003
Conventional therapy hasn't worked.

455
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,467
Your son may be dying.

456
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,140
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

457
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,062
I'm sorry. A lifetime of experiences
tells me I can't trust you.

458
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:29,711
And the past three days
have done nothing to change that.

459
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:33,272
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

460
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,859
If you don't know how to do that,

461
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,884
then just tell us so we can
take him someplace where they do.

462
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,963
They're absolutely right.

463
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,941
Stay away from that unproven,
experimental stuff.

464
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,241
Much better to stick

465
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,711
with the "moving of furniture
until he gets better" approach.

466
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,212
You're right. We're gonna have
to come up with something else.

467
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,136
You mean another last-ditch
desperation move? You got anything?

468
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,067
Go back and don't take no for an answer.

469
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:57,601
- What kinda salesman are you?
- The kind who avoids the house

470
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,905
with the crazy couple who
put tinfoil over their windows.

471
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,648
They got money for tinfoil, they
got it for whatever you're selling.

472
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,560
What's that mean?

473
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,070
Means that if they don't trust you,
you should earn that lack of trust.

474
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:10,115
What does paying for tinfoil mean?

475
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,761
Why should I have to
answer all the questions?

476
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,465
Sorry.

477
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:21,616
Still getting used
to the power steering.

478
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,763
- I assume you've heard the news?
- I'm not worried.

479
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:27,726
From what I hear, what you lack
in shame you also lack in willpower.

480
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:30,929
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong.

481
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:33,982
And pain-free,
now that I've stopped using the cane.

482
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,514
Of course,
it's harder to look down Cuddy's shirt.

483
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:39,356
Then, the vantage point
on her ass is much improved.

484
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:42,161
That's just me-- always
looking on the bright side.

485
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:44,812
I'm the guy who said
that her C cups are half-full.

486
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:47,407
They are nice, aren't they?

487
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:52,392
No.

488
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,431
You're not gonna
win me over that easily.

489
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,684
You may have a wheel.
It doesn't mean you get the grease.

490
00:26:58,685 --> 00:26:59,635
You gotta squeak.

491
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:16,594
What's that?

492
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,648
Cyclophosphamide. We're continuing
the standard treatment as you requested.

493
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:27,570
I have to ask everyone to
leave the room for a few minutes

494
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,045
while I apply some bandages.

495
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,869
Why do we have to leave?

496
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,010
For his penis.

497
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,440
You lied to them.

498
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:56,065
The bleeding stopped.
I don't need any bandages.

499
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:00,864
We need to change your treatment, but
your parents won't let us. They've got

500
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:04,474
it in their minds that we want to try
some sort of inhuman experiment on you.

501
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,975
The treatment's experimental?

502
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:08,579
FT-28's been through
extensive clinical trials.

503
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:11,558
It's also been used successfully
for other conditions.

504
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:13,633
The fact that you're recommending...

505
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:17,356
experimental treatment
means you have no other options?

506
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:19,393
Sorry.

507
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:22,666
We stop the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails.

508
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,459
We save your liver, the bladder fails.

509
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,170
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this

510
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,521
What do you need me to do?

511
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,297
Take the medicine,
but don't tell your parents.

512
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,415
I don't like lying to my parents.

513
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:37,483
The rest of the world, though--

514
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,167
The rest of the world I can't trust.

515
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:40,164
You can trust me.

516
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,185
How do I know?

517
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,520
Because if you do this, then
tell your parents, I lose my license.

518
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,337
You okay?

519
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,152
- God!
- Get in here!

520
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,892
Spleen basically exploded, huh?

521
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,069
Got another bleeder.

522
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,363
2-0 silk on a stick.

523
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:20,566
Got it.

524
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:32,417
I believe you ordered your meat rare.

525
00:29:32,697 --> 00:29:33,647
Keep him open--

526
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:35,026
if I confirm Wegener's,

527
00:29:35,027 --> 00:29:38,227
might as well stage the disease
while he's still on the table.

528
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:47,244
What's taking so long?

529
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:49,854
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

530
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:51,598
No signs of a clot or bleed.

531
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:53,965
Normal follicles.
Normal lymphoid tissue.

532
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,801
His spleen is ripped to shreds. There's
gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.

533
00:29:57,802 --> 00:30:00,756
Come on. Can't leave Humpty
Dumpty like this forever.

534
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:03,916
I don't see anything but normal spleen.
No granulomas.

535
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:04,917
Means no Wegener's.

536
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,194
That's all I need to know.

537
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,145
Let's go, people.

538
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:09,916
Run his bowel.

539
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:11,468
No need. I'm closing.

540
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,166
Suture.

541
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:49,225
- Run his bowel.
- Nothing suspicious in the spleen.

542
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:50,636
Get him out of here.

543
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,180
You missed it.

544
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,098
He had a gnuloma in his liver.

545
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,352
No, it was just scar tissue.

546
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,481
Looked like a granuloma on the MRI,
but it's not.

547
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,859
Don't know why I'm debating this.
Pass me the Kelly clamp.

548
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,146
I'm closing.

549
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,091
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into this kid's stomach.

550
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:10,378
Get out of there. He's unstable.

551
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,251
He's got Wegener's which
means he's got granulomas.

552
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,439
I'm calling my lawyer.

553
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:16,520
It's only 26 feet.

554
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:19,209
If he were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

555
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:22,716
Blood pressure's dropping.

556
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,488
Hang another bag of Ringer's Lactate.

557
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,293
I'm having nothing to do with this.

558
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:29,221
- Foreman, hang another bag--
- Ringer's Lactate.

559
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:30,172
Got it.

560
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:43,207
Come on, come on. It's gotta be in here.

561
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,802
It's gotta be in here.

562
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:55,831
But it's not.

563
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,273
Mind if we close?

564
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,573
Well, it's a good thing
we never sold him on FT-28.

565
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:08,935
His parents were right.

566
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,439
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us near him again.

567
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,359
They won't be able to transfer him
until he's recovered from the surgery.

568
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,268
Add the surgical team to the list
of people who won't let us near him.

569
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:28,363
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots.

570
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,400
Spleen explodes.

571
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,011
We should test him for Von Willebrand's.

572
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,278
Or we could just play tic-tac-toe.

573
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,332
Okay, Xs are bleeds. Os are clots.

574
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,346
It started in the lungs, right?
What did we do?

575
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:45,287
CT, sputum, two venograms.

576
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:48,590
That's one bleed, one clot. Then what?

577
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:52,141
Liver shut down. MRI,
labs, treated with cyclophosphamide.

578
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:56,628
Whereupon, he peed out 3
units of O negative. Another bleed.

579
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,029
- Where is this going?
- I don't know yet.

580
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,586
- What's next?
- Bladder, kidneys.

581
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,295
High resolution CT scan.
UA and urine sediment.

582
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,799
- GI tract?
- You ran his all bowel in the OR.

583
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,793
The large bowel is fixed to
the abdominal wall. I didn't run that.

584
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:10,017
Because there was no reason to.

585
00:33:10,018 --> 00:33:12,127
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

586
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,292
Do a colonoscopy.

587
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,236
- Because he's had no symptoms?
- You lose your keys,

588
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:19,734
first thing you do is look everywhere
you might logically have placed them.

589
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:22,223
You don't find them,
then you start looking in other places.

590
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:24,224
The medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox.

591
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,685
We need to look in this kid's mailbox.

592
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:29,053
Why don't we x-ray his feet?
They're fine too.

593
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:31,415
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

594
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,981
Okay, even if that did make sense,

595
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:36,382
it's kind of hard to do a colonoscopy
on a kid you can't get near.

596
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,880
He's in the ICU now. His parents
only have limited visiting privileges.

597
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:47,469
I like that kid.

598
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:49,068
He's got spunk.

599
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:07,660
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

600
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,490
- You're still in that thing.
- What thing?

601
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,780
Oh, this. Forgot it was even there.

602
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,897
You know, even if you manage not to
get struck down by a bolt of lightning

603
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:20,026
and make it a week, Cuddy's
not gonna give you the space. She can't.

604
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:20,977
Bet's a bet.

605
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:24,251
Yes, and that rule outrank
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

606
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:27,955
You think you've got logic on your side,
but Whitner's got the legal system.

607
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:30,508
And legal beats logic
every time-- just ask O.J.

608
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:31,608
You're right.

609
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:34,523
- I am?
- Yeah.

610
00:34:35,227 --> 00:34:36,248
So you're doing this

611
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,994
even though you know you've
got no legal leg to stand on.

612
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:42,527
Who needs legs when you got wheels?
I'm gonna get that spot.

613
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,244
No way Cuddy is going to gyp me!

614
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,012
What'd you say?

615
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:53,125
I'll see you later. Gonna have them
yelling at me for the next 20 minutes.

616
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:58,539
Mucosa looks normal, healthy.
No lonely diverticula.

617
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:00,793
Blood pressure's dropping.

618
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,165
- He's bleeding again.
- Not in his colon.

619
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,763
- Hurry up.
- I am.

620
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:11,021
- There's nothing there.
- Wait, wait, what's that?

621
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,916
- A reflection?
- No, it's something...

622
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,199
Looks like a...

623
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:25,483
- toothpick.
- Are you sure?

624
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,138
He must have swallowed it
accidentally and just figured he'd

625
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:30,312
digest it eventually.

626
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,697
When you two were making out in the car,
it must have folded awkwardly and

627
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:37,789
pushed the toothpick through the
wall of the intestine and into the lung.

628
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,679
And it moved on to his liver and
made its way to his bladder and spleen.

629
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,350
So that's it. He's gonna be okay.

630
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,824
Yeah. Small holes.

631
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,190
He shouldn't take that long
to heal now that we've got it out.

632
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:48,308
See?

633
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,904
- See what you did?
- Me?

634
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:53,886
- If you hadn't been kissing him...
- That's what you heard?

635
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,539
It was the toothpick!
It was that disgusting habit--

636
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,373
It would have just passed right through
him if he hadn't been writhing around.

637
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:01,362
Isn't that right--

638
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:07,577
That's it?

639
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:09,439
Yeah. That's it.

640
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,278
Wood absorbs water, becomes the
same density as the tissue around it.

641
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,819
That's why it didn't
show up on the CT or MRI.

642
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:17,723
That's cool.

643
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,161
I mean, not cool for me, but...

644
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:25,491
lot of damage for something so small.

645
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:31,100
You know, the lab here,
they have a paid intern position.

646
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,739
It's usually given to one of
the kids from the universities, but

647
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:35,783
if you want,

648
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,435
I could probably get you an interview.

649
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:41,504
There's some entry-level stuff,
some gopher work, but

650
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:43,955
you'd also have access
to a lot of cool things.

651
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:49,364
Thanks, really, but...

652
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:51,565
I can't.

653
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,195
Yes, you can.

654
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:55,415
Stevie, you're bright.

655
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,573
You have more curiosity than
90% of the doctors on the staff.

656
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,735
It's not that. It's just...

657
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,501
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

658
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,457
People I've known my whole life.

659
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,670
- I don't want to lose that.
- You can have both.

660
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:19,582
No, I can't.

661
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:22,282
Because they don't want to let you.

662
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:25,415
They shouldn't be making you choose.

663
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:28,275
Maybe not, but they are.

664
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,606
And I'm choosing them.

665
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:35,673
Look, change

666
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,403
is hard.

667
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,740
Trust me, I know.

668
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,591
But it worked out for me.

669
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,783
You're a successful doctor.

670
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,768
Your name is on journal articles.

671
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,776
I would love that.

672
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:53,193
It's just...

673
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:58,098
I see you with Drs.
Chase and Cameron, and...

674
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:01,326
you all got empty ring fingers.

675
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:06,993
You're alone.

676
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,664
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

677
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:30,041
So are you gonna tell Dr.
Whitner she's outta my space or can I?

678
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,092
Why would I do that?

679
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,974
Because you said that you would.
And lying is wrong.

680
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:39,173
I said I would give you the
space if you made it a whole week--

681
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:40,830
- Which I--
- Didn't.

682
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:46,083
The bet didn't stipulate that you
had to be the chair for a week unless

683
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:50,117
you had to barge in an operating room
and shove your hands in a kid's bowels.

684
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,247
You know about that.

685
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:53,661
You lost.

686
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,417
I saved a life.

687
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:59,131
Two minutes out of the
chair to save a kid's life.

688
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,082
You lost, House.

689
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,925
- I earned that space.
- No, you didn't.

690
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:07,556
I earn that space every day I limp
into that building and do my damn job.

691
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,391
You lo-ost.

692
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:21,513
You were never gonna
give me that space, were you?

693
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:23,776
I saw Whitner the other day.

694
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:26,235
She knew about the bet.
Didn't seem that worried.

695
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:28,636
- She knew I'd win.
- But she doesn't know me.

696
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,294
In fact, she doesn't know anything
except what you tell her, and

697
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:35,358
you told her that you were never
gonna give me that space, didn't you?

698
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:39,774
Just tell me.

699
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,337
Do you at least feel a little guilty?

700
00:39:44,786 --> 00:39:46,336
If you wanna teach me lessons,

701
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,894
don't make commitments you can't keep.

702
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:56,752
How's it going?

703
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,080
How guilty does she look?

704
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:03,972
About an eight.

705
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:06,986
That space is mine.

706
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,354
Veni, vidi, vici.

707
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
