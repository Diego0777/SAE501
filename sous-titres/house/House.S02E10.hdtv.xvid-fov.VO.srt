1
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:10,568
So there I am, on my 25th birthday,
driving from Wheeling, West Virginia
to Bensonhurst in a Dodge Dart with no radio

2
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:13,014
and a gun runner
named Barrelhead,

3
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:16,950
[Laughter (o<)]
who insisted we sing
every Jimmy Buffet song he could recall.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,006
What can I say?
The man was heavily armed. [(o<)]

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,630
So 500 renditions of
Margaritaville later,

6
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:30,446
my first cover, 8,000 words on
how Barrelhead and his friends were
transporting handguns for sale to New York city.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,644
The day the magazine hit the stands,
the D.A. hit me with a subpoena.

8
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:36,085
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

9
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,504
Greta had been managing editor
for three whole days.

10
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:44,564
So she invited me
across the street to the fancy bar,
where they use real glasses. [(o<)]

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,573
And after about the sixth
vodka and tonic,

12
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,698
she said,
"Fletch, I want you to know
the magazine is behind you."

13
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,488
Well, I was impressed.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,528
I said,  "Do you think
you can get the DA off my back?"

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,001
And she said,
"No. But when you get out of jail,
you'll still have a job." [(o<)]

16
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:05,502
I'm 45. I've given up a lot.
I've given up the road, that life.

17
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,120
Thanks,  Elizabeth.
No regrets. My lovely wife.

18
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,915
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

19
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,481
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

20
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,849
One's rock and roll.
The other's a source.

21
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,125
Greta Sims.

22
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,601
[Cheers and applause]

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,578
Great memories, Greta.

24
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,633
We'll miss you, Greta.

25
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:21,565
We'll miss you.

26
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,319
I only hope you can adjust
to the lack of stress in your...

27
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,163
Fletch!

28
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,668
Fletch!

29
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:30,786
Fletcher.

30
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:32,918
Fletch.

31
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:34,744
Fletcher.

32
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,835
Fletcher!

33
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,600
Honey, sweetie.
Are you okay?

34
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,406
Oh!

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,317
Are you okay?

36
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,569
I flung the investment.

37
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:52,303
[Laughter]
What did you say?

38
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,952
I flung the investment.

39
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,404
Why consign?

40
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,909
Why consign?

41
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,813
I'll call 911.

42
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,970
It's proficient.

43
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,388
Why disqualify the rush?
I'm tabled.

44
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,839
I'm tabled.

45
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:31,473
2x10 - Failure to Communicate

46
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,834
Original Airdate (FOX): 10 JAN-2006

47
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:06,405
[Whistles]

48
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:09,915
I need your advice.

49
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,735
What's the best diagnostics department
within 60 miles of here?

50
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:14,916
We are.

51
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,248
"We" aren't here.

52
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,693
House is in Baltimore lying
to Medicaid about his billings.

53
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:22,469
- So? I'm board certified.
- You are not House.

54
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:25,502
Why'd you put me
in charge of the department
if you think I can't handle it?

55
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:28,747
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

56
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:33,588
- What are the symptoms?
- Oh, come on.

57
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,647
You're gonna diagnose him
without meeting him?

58
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:38,466
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

59
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:42,179
I need to know the symptoms to
know which hospital to recommend.

60
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:47,382
EMT's report...
patient struck his head
and is suffering from aphasia.

61
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,965
Hmm, neurological problem.

62
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:55,057
You know, I know a lot of
good people in that field seeing
as I happen to be a neurologist.

63
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,873
- You're pouting.
- Not at all.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,184
Taylor's pretty good.

65
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,577
House was ready to hire him
till he got my resume.

66
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,206
It's Fletcher Stone.

67
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,573
Wrote 12 books.
Exposed three administrations.

68
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,234
- Before he exposes us...
- I get it. Famous patient needs
famous doctor.

69
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,171
- I'll call Taylor.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,967
Or maybe you should call him.

71
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,264
What if I say something stupid?

72
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,518
Oh, God.

73
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,520
House is easier.

74
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,612
Have you been taking any drugs?

75
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,055
I displaced my function.
Accolade.

76
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:42,794
He used to drink regularly,
but he's been clean and sober
for nearly a year.

77
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:47,397
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,
but your speech is impaired.

78
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:52,448
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he reaches for a word,
he finds something else.

79
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:55,430
I grapple average.

80
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,271
Tanzer glisten.

81
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:01,095
He doesn't know
that he's saying it wrong?

82
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,629
It all sounds right to him.

83
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,675
I want you to write
your name and draw a face.

84
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:27,706
It's called agraphia.
Loss of ability to write.
Most often it's temporary.

85
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,515
How hard did he hit his head?

86
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,633
It was a pretty good crack.
It made a really ugly sound.

87
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,164
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

88
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,737
Of golf.

89
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,076
Don't give me a sentence.
Just say yes or a no.

90
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:41,501
You understand me?

91
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,246
Yes.

92
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,163
Elizabeth. Fletch.

93
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:49,463
Is he okay?

94
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,753
We don't know.
This is Fletch's editor.

95
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,801
Greta Sims.
I wanted to make sure that
the EMTs told you the right story.

96
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,309
How many stories are there?

97
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,667
He didn't trip.

98
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,066
He just fell.
Out of the blue.

99
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,883
His foot jerked a little bit first.
That's what made it look like a trip.

100
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,161
Stacy:
Don't say anything.

101
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,959
Don't attempt to defend
your billing practices.

102
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,700
Your billing practices
are indefensible.

103
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,012
We've  been over this.

104
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,461
If I thought you were capable
of listening, I'd shut up.

105
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,489
That makes no sense at all.

106
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:32,337
- [Sighs] Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

107
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:42,474
Every  case you have rates a five
on the complexity scale?

108
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,856
Dr. House has a rather
specialized practice.

109
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,913
Ah. Okay.

110
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:52,133
Then let's go through these.

111
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:53,893
All of these?

112
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,213
If you have lunch reservations,
cancel them.

113
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,384
All right. Patient...

114
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:04,521
If he didn't trip,
something made him fall.

115
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,271
Stoke? Seizure?

116
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:10,063
30 people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.
Who you gonna believe?

117
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:12,202
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

118
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,249
Causes a contusion or a seizure.
That causes the aphasia.

119
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,310
We should get an EEG.

120
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:17,984
If it was a stroke,
it could be a clotting issue.

121
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,688
Even if he fell,
drug use is far more likely.

122
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,031
I'm ordering a tox screen.

123
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,389
Chase, we're not done
with the differential.

124
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:26,517
You're not my boss.

125
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm House's boss.
House is your boss.

126
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:30,905
The math is pretty simple.

127
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:34,149
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring or firing?

128
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,226
This is not about that...

129
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,627
The only thing you've been
asked to do is supervise House
in case he doessomething insane.

130
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:42,346
Which might,
you know, save a life.

131
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,686
- Somebody's gotta be in charge.
- Why?

132
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:47,893
You think we should all just do
whatever we wanna do?

133
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,392
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

134
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,028
I think it should be
a discussion among peers.

135
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,911
I think we're grown up enough
to reach a consensus.

136
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:04,716
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

137
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:11,103
I look in vain for the words
erectile dysfunction in the notes
for Delores Smith.

138
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,169
She had a heart condition.

139
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:15,151
And you ran out
of nitroglycerin?

140
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,373
She also had low blood pressure.

141
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,565
So nitro would be dangerous.

142
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,159
Little blue pills
improve blood flow.

143
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:23,789
They're vasodilators.

144
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,893
It's why you sometimes
get the headaches.

145
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,338
Stacy:
I think Dr. House understands.

146
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,378
House:
Oh, of course I do.

147
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,416
The woman has a heart condition
she's on her own.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,676
A man can't nail his office assistant,
it's national crisis time.

149
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,741
Are you seriously expecting us
to foot the bill for
off-label use of medication?

150
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,482
Fine. I'll pay for it.

151
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:43,757
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

152
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,405
Put the money away.

153
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,119
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- No.

154
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:51,167
I could.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

155
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:52,820
My client's an idiot.

156
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,556
But is he wrong
about the pills?

157
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,245
Off-label use
is not sanctioned.

158
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,226
You're retiring
in three weeks.

159
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,311
You've been doing this job
nearly 20 years.

160
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,945
Aren't you tired of
administering policy
you disagree with?

161
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,610
- I-I never said I disagree.
- What can they do to you?

162
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,637
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

163
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,497
Absolutely.

164
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,166
You do background checks
on Medicaid personnel?

165
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,924
I do what's necessary
for my client.

166
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:31,787
- Wow, new personal record.
- Yeah, timing's good for me too.

167
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:35,079
I got a reservation
at a little place in the Inner Harbor.

168
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:39,535
- You booked us dinner reservations?
- Best Maryland crab in...Maryland.

169
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,302
- Don't you have a plane to catch?
- Not for hours.

170
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,471
Your flight leaves at 7:00.

171
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,512
You did a background check on me?

172
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,213
And mine doesn't leave till 9:00pm.

173
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,955
It looks like
you'll be dining alone.

174
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,948
You checked on my flight

175
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,643
so you could be sure
to be on a different one.

176
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,445
I thought we were past
the avoidance stage.

177
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,462
I didn't think
we'd be finished this soon.

178
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,573
Where's your crucifix?

179
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,806
I left it at the jewelers
to be cleaned.

180
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:10,931
Right.

181
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:19,262
This will show us if there's
a problem with your carotid artery
that might cause a blood clot.

182
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:23,429
If  it went to his brain,
that could explain the aphasia
and the falling down.

183
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:26,284
And you're giving him an EEG?
Is that for the same thing?

184
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:27,951
Uh, it's just a precaution.

185
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:32,813
I think the trauma caused some swelling,
and we need to keep him stable
until the bodycan repair the damage.

186
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:34,844
And you think
they're both wrong?

187
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,811
Foreman:
We're just covering all the bases.

188
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,014
- Being safe.
- [Chokes and coughs]
[Monitors start beeping]

189
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,125
His O2 sats are going down.

190
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,356
[Continues coughing]

191
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:52,138
- Fluid in his lungs.
- Push 40 IV Lasix.

192
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,145
- We need to intubate.
- He's losing his respiratory drive.

193
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,279
Now put him down.

194
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,152
Foreman:
And then there were two.

195
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,145
Aphasia and fluid in the lungs.

196
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,606
Seizure can't cause both.

197
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:28,945
Neither can a stroke.

198
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,686
Unless he had
an abnormal heart rhythm.

199
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,587
Chase:
And then there was one.

200
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,138
Urine test is positive
for amphetamines.

201
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,203
Amphetamines don't cause
pulmonary edema.

202
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,948
They doif you smoke 'em.

203
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:44,003
In one of his books he talked
about giving updrugs and alcohol,
how it changed his life.

204
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:46,315
Everybody lies.

205
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,693
When he started wanting to hear
every minute of my day,

206
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:55,500
it should have been a clue
he was the jealous type.

207
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,567
But you know,
in that first stage
of a relationship,

208
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:04,241
where it's like your body's full of
these chemicals that make you think
everything they do is charming...

209
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,900
[Cell phone rings]
Ah.

210
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,952
Excuse me.

211
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:10,868
Wilson: <i>Hello?</i>

212
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:14,134
Hey, honey, how are the kids?
They miss me?

213
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,973
This may take a minute.

214
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,537
House:
<i>So what's new with Mr. Aphasia.</i>

215
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,008
Cuddy called you?

216
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,684
Everybody covers their ass.

217
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:24,838
Wilson:
<i>Pulmonary edema.</i>

218
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:27,601
Chase  did a tox screen.
It came back positive
for amphetamines.

219
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,144
He did the dance of victory.

220
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,255
I'm betting
there's another shoe.

221
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,984
I thought
the kids didn't call you.

222
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,107
[ Thump!]

223
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,174
I know the way
you tell stories.

224
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:42,819
Foreman went to talk to Stone
about his drug test, found him
running a temperature.

225
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:44,907
So it's not the drugs.

226
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:48,348
They've just got such a bad rep.
[Thump!]

227
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,415
Mother:
Honey, you shouldn't do that.

228
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,926
Okay, I gotta hang up.

229
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,388
They're probably trying
to reach me.

230
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:58,005
- You don't have call waiting?
- I'm hanging up on you now.

231
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,860
Wilson:
<i>It's $5.00 a month.</i>

232
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:07,719
[Thump!]

233
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,259
Drugs don't cause fever.

234
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:13,202
Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.
Start him on antibiotics.

235
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:16,398
It could be
an autoimmune disease.
Lupus, Behcet's.

236
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,622
We could start himon a high dose of steroids.

237
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:22,474
[Phone ringing]
Except if he does have encephalitis,
steroids could weaken his immune system.

238
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:23,769
Foreman.

239
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,416
How high a fever?

240
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:29,003
Put me on speaker phone.
And why haven't you called me?

241
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,642
101.
How'd you know?

242
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:36,636
What? You think you guys can
have a party as soon as the parents
are gone, and I won't hear about it?

243
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:40,514
House:
<i>Start with broad spectrum antibiotics
for possible bacterial meningitis</i>

244
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,738
and an antiviral in case we luck out,
and it's herpes encephalitis.

245
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,186
What if it's autoimmune?

246
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,764
Well, then we're screwed.

247
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,261
Which is why we need
more information.

248
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,155
Any genetic issuewith the family?

249
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,663
Foreman:
<i>The man can't talk.</i>

250
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:55,855
<i>His medical records are sketchy.
And the wife's only known him
a couple of years.</i>

251
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,115
House:
<i>MRI show anything?</i>

252
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,106
CT scan was negative.

253
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:00,524
CT?

254
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,918
That's, like,
short for MRI, right?

255
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,098
<i>Excellent.
That'll save us a lot of time.</i>

256
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,206
We've got an MRI
scheduled in 20 minutes.

257
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,171
Earliest Foreman
could get the machine.

258
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:11,998
I teach you to lie,
cheat, and steal,

259
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,737
and as soon as my back
is turned you wait in line?

260
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,104
Get an MRI, and get
a better medical history.

261
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,643
The man can't talk.

262
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:22,146
Who cares?
He's probably gonna lie anyway.

263
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,080
My flight's a little late.
I'll be back in a few hours.

264
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,418
So you're in charge of us
because you're in charge of him?

265
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:40,349
Any family history
of neurological problems?

266
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:41,658
No.

267
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,617
You've been out of the country
in the last five years.

268
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:46,857
Yes.

269
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:48,643
Three years?

270
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,178
Yes.

271
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:52,482
Two years.

272
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:57,127
He stopped traveling for work
two years ago after we got serious.

273
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,610
Any vacations?

274
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,329
His last one was
six months ago.

275
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:04,288
It was a golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

276
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:06,272
No way it was
a golf resort.

277
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:10,370
Knowing Fletch, I assume
he was working his way
through every bar in the Keys.

278
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,671
Last hurrah
before settling down.

279
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:15,078
[Elevator dings]
- Alcohol?
- No.

280
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:18,050
- Amphetamines.
- No.

281
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,176
You tested positive.

282
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:24,472
Elizabeth:
He doesn't use drugs.
I told you.

283
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:30,458
When we got engaged,
we decided we wanted
a different kind of life.

284
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:35,070
And he dropped the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

285
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,665
That includes his health.

286
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:39,693
He asked me not to tell Elizabeth.

287
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,016
He's been lying to herabout his drug habit?

288
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,372
Well, yes and no.

289
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:48,687
BE...before Elizabeth...
he used drugs recreationally.

290
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,061
I wasn't crazy about it,

291
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:54,098
but that thrill-seeking behavior
is what made him the kind
of journalist that he was.

292
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:56,569
And now, AE?

293
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:59,461
The man's twisted himself
into knots for her.

294
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:02,134
- Completely cleaned up his act.
- But the drugs?

295
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:04,861
They're medicinal.
Sort of.

296
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:06,922
He was having trouble sleeping.

297
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,967
His new suburban lifestyle.

298
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,436
Lack of excitement
was throwing him off.

299
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,348
So he started
with sleeping pills.

300
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,683
When they knocked him out,
he needed something to
perk him back up during the day.

301
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,333
Chase:
Every day?

302
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,235
No slippery slope there.

303
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:30,290
Keep the stain.
Knife can't force.

304
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:33,020
We're not gonna tell your wife.

305

We're not cops.

306
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,061
There's a little edema.
Brain swelling.

307
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:50,894
And an area of scarring.

308
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,766
Is that what's
causing the aphasia?

309
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:55,365
Actually, that's what's odd.

310
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:59,232
The scarring's not in the area of 
the brain normally associated
with conduction aphasia.

311
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,913
And it's old.
Happened before he hit his head.

312
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:06,125
Maybe a small stroke or
some other underlying condition
that could be causing this, or

313
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,115
it might have nothing
to do with it at all.

314
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,361
Have you ever had
head trauma before?

315
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,225
- An accident?
- Uh-uh.

00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,962
You ever had any numbness
on one side before?

317

Got you some coffee.

324
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,235
So...what do you
wanna talk about?

325
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,413
The scarring on the MRI
could be anything.

326
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:42,954
MS, toxins, any one of a hundred demyelinating diseases.

327
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,889
If it's meningitis,
we have to ID the bug fast.

328
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,280
We need to do
a lumbar puncture.

329
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,365
I'm not doin LP
with this edema.

330
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:51,110
- We could paralyze him.
- What does House say?

331
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:54,487
"The person you're trying
to reach is out of the area or
has turned off their phone."

332
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:55,902
So what are your orders?

333
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,892
- We need more information.
- There is no more information.

334
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,318
We'll break into his place.

335
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,341
Have fun.

336
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,621
How's the patient?

337
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:11,545
Fine.

338
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:13,203
- Where you going?
Foreman: - Dinner.

339
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,560
Oh, well I'll join you.
You can bring me up to speed.

340
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,688
Sorry.
Reservation for two.

341
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:25,014
When people
give themselves away,
it's by little things.

342
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,050
That woman over there,

343
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,672
she's not sneering at her coffee.
She's recovering from Bell's Palsy.

344
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:40,460
The cashier at the coffee place,
she doesn't want anyone to know,
but she's dying of ALS.

345
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:45,082
There's a particular
sort of twitchy stiff arm
that's characteristic.

346
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:48,007
And then there's you.

347
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,019
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

348
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:52,995
I told you, I left it at...

349
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:57,300
You keep jewelry cleaner
under the sink so you won't
have to go a day without it.

350
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,065
True, you forgot it
that morning the pipes burst.

351
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:06,245
But then you went back
and waded through the flood
to retrieve it.

352
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,881
So...why no wading today?

353
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,541
Didn't you bring a book
to read or something?

354
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:22,528
Nothing.

355
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,906
Caffeine pills and amphetamines.
Same stuff he told us he was taking.

356
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,126
And Topamax.

357
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,628
An anti-convulsant?

358
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,609
He said there was
no history of prior seizure.

359
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,206
It's not even prescribed to him.

360
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,473
Still doesn't explain his fever.
Probably just using it for weight loss.

361
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:48,224
Just gives us another lie.
He must really be devoted.

362
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:49,305
Should we check the home?

363
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:52,596
If he wanted to hide something
from his wife, why wouldn't
he hide it in the office?

364
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,699
Maybe she's
hiding something.

365
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,040
Nothing but aspirin and
flu meds in the bathroom.

366
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,844
Looks like this stuff's
been sitting here for weeks.

367
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,447
Chase:
Hmm, home improvement.

368
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:14,543
He probably thought
he could take the project on,

369
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:17,427
then realized it was a little
more than he could handle.

370
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:22,682
You got a point to make, or did you just feel
like giving a long, unnecessary explanation
for something medically irrelevant?

371
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,780
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

372
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,050
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

373
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,409
"I'm as good as House,
but I'm nicer."

374
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,221
I never said that.

375
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,576
I guess it's safe to be confident
when House is there to overrule you.

376
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:35,486
Now that it's all on you?

377
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,520
It's different. Yeah.

378
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:43,574
A nnouncement:
<i>Flight 106 to Nashville
has been delayed...</i>

379
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:47,886
Either you left it behind
on purpose or by mistake.

380
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,116
The only reason you'd leave it
behind intentionally is
if it no longer meant anything to you.

381
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,968
But since it was
a gift from your mom,

382
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,471
that would mean
you had a fight with her.

383
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,924
And since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

384
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:01,031
- Leave it alone, Greg.
- Yeah, I'm good at that.

385
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:04,352
So that leaves
forgetting it unintentionally.

386
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,339
But then we have to explain
why you didn't go back for it
when you realized.

387
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,238
I didn't realize
until I got to the airport.

388
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,089
Nope, you were wearing makeup
when you got to the airport.

389
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,413
You can't put on makeup
without looking at yourself.

390
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,624
You can't look at yourself
without touching that thing.

391
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,510
Why does this matter to you?

392
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:23,490
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

393
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,752
Then you're gonna suffer.

394
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:40,000
[Groans in pain]

395
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,589
I think it's his stomach.

396
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:44,993
I teal indigent.

397
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,687
Is it something you ate?

398
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,096
He keeps doing that.

399
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,547
I teal indigent.

400
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:52,884
- Are you hungry?
- No.

401
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,779
- He's in pain. Is it a sharp pain?
- No!

402
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:58,272
Teal indigent!

403
00:22:58,356 --> 00:22:59,947
- Taste?
- Yes!

404
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:03,425
- Uh, metallic taste?
- Yes!

405
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:06,209
I'll be right back.

406
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,210
Ow!

407
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:09,885
<i>Attention, passengers, flight 118...</i>

408
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:13,424
House:
I suppose it's also possible
that the clasp broke.

409
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,401
But then you'd be carrying
the thing around in your purse.

410
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:17,842
We had a fight.

411
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:20,421
We had a fight, and I was angry
and not thinking straight.

412
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,616
And I walked out
without my makeup
and without my cross.

413
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,317
And I stopped at
the drugstore to buy makeup,
but I couldn't buy a cross

414
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:28,584
because they don't have an aisle
for personal talismans!

415
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,123
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'll blow over.

416
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,195
- It was about nothing.
- Of course it was.

417
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,451
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

418
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,405
It's normal to blow up
over little things.

419
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,456
I don't mind fighting over little things.
And I don't mind fighting over big things.

420
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,157
That I could understand.
But we fight over nothing.

421
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:54,618
You know, a mailbox with a sign
that says "Last pickup 5:00 p.m."

422
00:23:54,703 --> 00:24:00,784
Does that mean last pickup to go to
the post office or last pickup to leave
the post office and be sent out of town?

423
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,531
You fought over mail delivery?

424
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:06,359
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

425
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:08,859
I told him he was right,
he thought I was
being condescending.

426
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,316
You were.

427
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:13,676
He's pushing me
out of his life.

428
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,516
Or maybe you're
misinterpreting.

429
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,364
Did I misinterpret with you?

430
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:23,278
At least this time
I recognize it.

431
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:26,144
That's the benefit of
convincing the only two men
you've ever loved,

432
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:28,144
they're better off without you.

433
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:33,262
Yeah. It's all your fault.

434
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,314
You know,
"Stacy" in the original Greek
means relationship killer.

435
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm gonna go wash my face
so I look like a grown-up again.

436
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:59,245
[Phone rings]
Hello.

437
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:04,982
It's for you.

438
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:05,731
House.

439
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:07,119
Do you know
your phone's dead?

440
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,565
Do you ever recharge
your batteries?

441
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:09,798
House:
<i>They recharge?</i>

442
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,647
I just keep
buying new phones.

443
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:15,020
I thought you should know
your aphasia guy is tasting metal.

444
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:16,271
Where's his creatinine?

445
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:18,205
<i>6.8. He's got kidney failure.</i>

446
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,460
Cameron's got him on dialysis,
and he's stable for the moment.

447
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:23,667
Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

448
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,259
It's either meningitis
or encephalitis.

449
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,289
Or maybe autoimmune.

450
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:31,927
That's perfect.
Seems like you really
narrowed it down over dinner.

451
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,149
Here's the plan.
We talk to House...

452
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,896
Been trying.
He's not answering his cell.

453
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,866
It's obvious we have
to do the lumbar puncture.

454
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,428
There's no choice anymore.
[Phone ringing]

455
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:44,660
House:
<i>You have to do it just right.</i>

456
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,068
What are you talking about?

457
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,573
Either you've decided
to do a lumbar puncture,

458
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:53,544
or you have to fire me
so that I can't fire all of you
as soon as I get back in charge.

459
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,340
Is Cuddy there ranting?

460
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:57,331
If I'd known
you'd be out of contact...

461
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:58,228
They can handle it.

462
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:01,618
Right, so far only
three organ systems have failed.

463
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:03,586
<i>Okay, they can't.
Doesn't matter.</i>

464
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,212
The guy's not stable
enough to move.

465
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,235
So go rant in your own office.

466
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,649
Fine. Call me
when you're done.

467
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:18,018
What do you mean by
doing the LP just right?
We're not gonna screw it up.

468
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:20,389
The odds are this guy
knows something we don't.

469
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:24,175
He could know the answer
to the meaning of life.
The man can't communicate.

470
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:27,826
<i>Have you had any indication
that he's tried to communicate
something important?</i>

471
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,087
No.

472
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,420
That's because you guys
haven't scared him enough.

473
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:34,170
I'm sure you've been all,
"We'll take realgood care of you."

474
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,620
<i>Why should he say anything?</i>

475
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:38,013
When you prep him,
tell him he's gonna die.

476
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,181
<i>Crush all hope.
Don't let Cameron do it.</i>

477
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,240
Cuddy.

478
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:46,862
You got a problem
with any of that?

479
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,829
You're scheduled
for a lumbar puncture.

480
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,412
But you shouldn't count on
that having the answers.

481
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,188
If your husband
continues to decline...

482
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:01,497
You'll die.

483
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:08,305
If there's anything
you haven't told us...

484
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,826
How you holding up?

485
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:35,243
I know what you just heard
is scary as hell, but...

486
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,519
Couldn't tackle the bear.

487
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:42,948
Couldn't tackle the bear.

488
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:45,182
They took my stain.

489
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:50,896
<i>Your attention please,
due to the weather conditions,</i>

490
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:54,075
<i>all flights are grounded
until further notice.</i>

491
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,241
Oh...

492
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,488
You gotta be kiding.

493
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,877
<i>Cots are being provided
on the lower level.</i>

494
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:59,860
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

495
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,288
I don't believee it.

496
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,806
You want me to run down and
reserve you a cot with a view?

497
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,968
Where's your knapsack?

498
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:08,333
I checked it through.

499
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:12,034
Oh, that's right,
I forget it's hard for you
to carry and walk.

500
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,769
I booked a room at the airport hotel
when I saw how bad the weather was.

501
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,713
It's the last one available.

502
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:22,178
Your leg can't handle
a night on a cot.

503
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,210
Thanks.

504
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,427
I'm ready.

505
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,485
Right.

506
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,886
Hotel's upstairs.

507
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:36,172
Does Mark know about this?

508
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,019
Mark knows when things are bad,
I always like to have
an escape route planned.

509
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:06,128
[Sighs] I have to know
what's going on here.

510
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,969
When you have a fight with Mark
and you try to avoid me,
I have to think that...

511
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:18,805
That I'm feeling vulnerable and
I don't wanna be around you
because it might lead to something.

512
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,055
Right.

513
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:23,467
But then a hotel room...

514
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,544
Might also lead to something.

515
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,348
Hmm.

516
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,853
So which is it?

517
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:39,776
Our relationship's
like an addiction. It's... like...

518
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,713
Really good drugs?

519
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:45,988
No, it's like vindaloo curry.

520
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:47,833
Okay, sure.

521
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:51,051
Really, really hot Indian curry
they make with red chili peppers.

522
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,802
I know what it is.

523
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,018
I didn't think
it was addictive.

524
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:59,322
You're abrasive and annoying and
come on way too strong, like...

525
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:03,359
vindaloo curry.
When you're crazy about curry,
that's fine. But

526
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:08,280
no matter how much you love curry,
you have too much of it, it takes
the roof of your mouth off.

527
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:11,600
And then you never wanna see curry
for a really, really long time.

528
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,067
But you wake up
one day and you think...

529
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,772
God, I really miss curry.

530
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:37,642
You're a jerk.

531
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,509
I know.

532
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,396
If you hadn't just had
a fight with Mark...

533
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:11,048
For once in your life,
will you shut up?

534
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:19,556
[Phone ringing]
Oh!

535
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,379
<i>House.</i>

536
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,324
You're on speaker phone.

537
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,640
How did the LP go?

538
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,244
Give me the Reader's Digest
condensed version.

539
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:41,800
Preliminary results are
some kind of infection
which...narrows it down.

540
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,130
From infinity. Yeah.

541
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,121
At the rate
his organs are deteriorating
he's got maybe a day or two.

542
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:51,807
Okay, well, call me back
when you have something.

543
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:54,426
Cameron:
<i>He was trying to
tell us something.</i>

544
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,463
What did he say?

545
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,487
You were wrong.
It wasn't the fear.

546
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:09,797
- He opened up to me when I...
- Sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

547
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:13,334
Classic interrogation technique.
What did he say?

548
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,841
- You knew that I'd...
- <i>Act the way you always do?</i>

549
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:18,500
Yeah, I did.
What did he say?

550
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,314
He couldn't tackle the bear.

551
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,506
Now all we need is
the English-Aphasiac dictionary.

552
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:28,761
A fluent aphasiac retrieves words
that are stored somewhere
close to the one he wants.

553
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:31,865
They can be filed
by sound or by meaning.

554
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:37,022
So if he wants to say table,
he could say label,
or he could say chair,

555
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,133
or he could just say jabberwocky.
There's no way to tell.

556
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:43,886
<i>He also said,</i>
"They took my stain."

557
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:46,495
Hold on.

558
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,276
I'm gonna take this phone downstairs
so I don't disturb you. Is that okay?

559
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:55,190
Sure.

560
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,558
Keep him talking.
Write down everything he says.

561
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,506
Stacy...

562
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:10,502
[Sighs]
that new makeup you bought,
you mind if I borrow it?

563
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,377
What did you mean by stain?

564
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,416
Dirty? Soiled?

565
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,203
No. No.

566
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:25,027
Foreman:
What about rhymes?
Uh, pain. Brain?

567
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,864
Thane?

568
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:31,985
He's dying from some kind of infection,
and you allare playing word games?

569
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,513
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

570
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,481
Foreman:
L-Let's start this again.

571
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:51,479
Bear.
Is it bare as in naked?

572
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,923
Crimson desire
shows up well on sheet rock.

573
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:33,791
That's why I chose it.

574
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:50,994
You must have gotten
one new phrase out of him.
<i>Something.</i>

575
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,752
We've been talking
to him for hours.

576
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:55,346
Maybe he's just given up.

577
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,891
You sure you told me everything
you found at his home and office?

578
00:34:58,028 --> 00:34:59,827
Chase:
No, we're hiding something.

579
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:02,713
- Maybe it's not a rhyme or a synonym.
- What else is there?

580
00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:05,015
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

581
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:06,929
Maybe House is wrong.

582
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,996
Hope that's not
the end of the thought.

583
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,012
He mentioned stain once before
when Chase was giving him the MRI.

584
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:15,357
- Before we scared him.
- He did?

585
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:16,996
It's in your notes.

586
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,685
Chase:
<i>So he only talks during MRIs
and lumbar punctures?</i>

587
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:24,613
Your theory is he can only talk
with a needle in his back or...

588
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:27,345
Or when his wife's
not in the room.

589
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:34,644
The more devoted,
the more reason to lie.

590
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,396
That's cynical.

591
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:37,507
You disagree?

592
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:42,013
No, I'm just kvelling.
Our little girl is growing up.

593
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:45,635
Okay, what's the best way
to rip a woman from
the side of her dying husband?

594
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,943
He woke me up to lie
to a patient's wife?

595
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,742
Tell her there's been
a miscommunication over
their insurance coverage.

596
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:52,946
Not a big deal.

597
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:58,423
Tell me, if it is your aim to sell me
the same crazy ideas that House does,

598
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:01,107
how are you an
improvement on House?

599
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:03,631
I brought you a coffee.

600
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:10,520
Your flight's been boarding
for 20 minutes.

601
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:12,035
I'll take a later one.

602
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,213
Greg, they can't leave without you.
You checked your knapsack.
[Phone rings]

603
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,525
Are we in?

604
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:18,273
Yeah.

605
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:20,106
House:
<i>Hi, I'm Gregory House.</i>

606
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,826
I'm your attending physician.

607
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,305
Your wife's not there.
Start talking.

608
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,353
They took my stain.

609
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,898
I couldn't tackle the bear.
They took my stain.

610
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,288
House:
Okay, shut up now.
Nice work, Cameron.

611
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:34,428
Give him the list again.

612
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,638
Let us know when
something sounds right.

613
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,653
Dirty?

614
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,709
Soiled? Pain?

615
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:42,410
- Brain?
- Yes!

616
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,786
Foreman:
Where does that get us?

617
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:47,080
We're already paying plenty
of attention to his brain.

618
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,784
We've got an MRI.
We've got a CT.

619
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,593
Are we sure he
wasn't reacting to pain?

620
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:52,089
He's been on painkillers.

621
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:53,546
House:
<i>Come on, Chase.</i>

622
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,997
Drugs didn't do this to him.
Even if he is an addict.

623
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,809
I dissuade the tonal category.

624
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:02,666
<i>Oh please,
Mr. Sleeping Pills.
Amphetamines.</i>

625
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:05,094
Bring me up.
Bring me down.

626
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,757
Announcement:
<i>Will passenger Gregory House
please report to gate seven?</i>

627
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:11,130
<i>Gregory House to gate seven.</i>

628
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,395
Ever hear this one?

629
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:20,633
<i>You build a house.
Each wall has a southern exposure.</i>

630
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,891
Big bear comes wandering by.

631
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,567
What color's the bear?

632
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:27,965
White. It's a polar bear.
You built your house in the North Pole.

633
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,208
House:
<i>Polar.</i>

634
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:33,563
Whatever your name is,
patient, are you bipolar?

635
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,014
House:
<i>What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?</i>

636
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,532
Yes.

637
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,993
Topamax isn't just off-label
for weight loss.

638
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,970
It's off-label
for mood disorders.

639
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:47,314
Plenty of bipolars are
manic in the daytime,
depressive at night.

640
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:50,923
He's been medicating
for years with alcohol.
Sleeping through the bad hours.

641
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:52,806
<i>It explains
the danger journalism.</i>

642
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,357
<i>It explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.</i>

643
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,391
<i>Okay, technically
it's kitchen cabinets.</i>

644
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,361
He starts a project,
then he stops.

645
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,922
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

646
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:05,157
House:
<i>And it doesn't shut down
your kidneys. But what it does do...</i>

647
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,889
Guard:<i>Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?</i>

648
00:38:06,973 --> 00:38:09,280
House: <i>I'm on the phone.</i>
Guard: <i>Now, please.</i>

649
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:11,121
House? What is it?

650
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,050
<i>I'm a doctor.
This is an emergency call.</i>

651
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,897
You have to come
with me, Sir.

652
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,035
I'm not going anywhere.

653
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,519
Do you think
you're gonna take me on?

654
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,672
I kick, and I bite.

655
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,933
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

656
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:31,523
Foreman:
<i>House?</i>

657
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:32,690
You still there?

658
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,621
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

659
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,736
You seek excitement.
You make up stories.

660
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,314
I dime valutate a lever!

661
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:45,048
Fine, maybe your stories are legit.
But people would start to wonder.

662
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:49,000
<i>Annoyed politicians.
Entire governments
would be on your ass.</i>

663
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:51,331
<i>So you couldn't tell anybody
you were bipolar.</i>

664
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,177
Which was fine

665
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,532
until you fell in love.

666
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,669
And you wanted that life.

667
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:04,786
And you hear that
there's a surgical cure.

668
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:09,256
<i>You can give the woman you love
the life she wants.</i>

669
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:12,115
All you have to do is change.

670
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,222
Bilateral cingulotomy.

671
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:22,324
<i>An experimental surgery
that some people claim
helps mood disorders.</i>

672
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:25,217
And if it's done by gamma knife,
there's no trace of cutting.

673
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:27,240
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

674
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,358
Which explained nothing because
it wasn't even in the right area.

675
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:33,215
It's not the surgery.
It's the secrecy.

676
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,629
What causes recurring fever?

677
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:39,988
Neurological problems,
lethargy that you fight with
caffeine pills and amphetamines?

678
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:42,344
<i>It wasn't your secret
psych disorder.</i>
[Door opens]

679
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:44,448
<i>It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.</i>

680
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:49,324
<i>It was the secret trip
for your secret surgery
in Caracas or Buenos Aires.</i>

681
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,348
Which, by the way,
didn't work, given the state
of your kitchen cabinets.

682
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:53,662
Cameron:
House!

683
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,910
Shut up.

684
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:58,681
What's going on?

685
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,748
Is he right?

686
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:11,452
Your doctors
know you better than I do.

687
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:17,724
That man on the speaker phone,
he never even met you, and
he knows you better than I do.

688
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:22,461
You love me?

689
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,049
Yes. Yes.

690
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,809
You just don't trust me.

691
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,844
House:
<i>Get some blood on a slide.</i>

692
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,808
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

693
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:40,954
Yep.

694
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:57,913
Foreman:
Cerebral malaria.

695
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:02,175
I'll get him started
on intravenous quinidine.

696
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:07,773
If a human being had
actually looked at his blood
anywhere along the way,

697
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:10,881
instead of just running tests
through the computer,

698
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:13,798
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

699
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,842
The price
of the electronic age.

700
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:33,240
Greta:
Fletch.

701
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:36,473
She'll be back.

702
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:44,007
Give her time to miss you.

703
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,968
Announcement:
<i>Final boarding call for Flight No. 7...</i>

704
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,379
I'm counting on you
to get me off the no-fly list.

705
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,976
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

706
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:00,108
Physically,
his chances are good.

707
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,222
Physically?

708
00:42:01,523 --> 00:42:03,894
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

709
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:07,288
Maybe they'll get a happy ending
just because they both want it so much.

710
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,342
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

711
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:12,457
He loved her enough to convince
himself he could change.

712
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:17,179
But he couldn't, could he?

713
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:22,629
Thank you.

714
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:26,537
You know what Woody Allen
said about relationships?

715
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:29,409
Irrational and crazy,
but go through it all because...

716
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,137
We need the curry.

717
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:40,272
