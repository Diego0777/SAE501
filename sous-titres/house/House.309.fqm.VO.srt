1
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,527
All right, stand here.

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,089
You're just tall enough.

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,680
I--I don't--

4
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,343
I don't think I am.

5
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,565
It just goes around. There's
nothing to be scared of, all right?

6
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,214
I didn't say I was scared.

7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:35,226
It'll be fun. Come on. When I was a kid,
this was my favorite thing ever.

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,636
I don't like rides.

9
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,591
All right, all right.

10
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:44,153
I just--I thought it'd be fun.
I shouldn't be making you do this.

11
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,972
Let's go home. We can have fun at home.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,996
No, Daddy, wait.

13
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,523
The ride does look like fun.

14
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,263
Oh, this is awesome!

15
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,131
Alice, are you all right?

16
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,232
Honey, you all right?

17
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:36,928
Alice!

18
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,283
Alice, are you okay?

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,400
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26
www.sub-way.fr

20
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,707
Nothing happened.

21
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,067
Something happened.

22
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,562
It was a little kiddie ride.

23
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:19,377
She hates those rides. I don't
understand why you insist on making--

24
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,835
Okay, I appreciate the
fullness of your answers, but

25
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,481
I just wanted to know if she
had any history of abdominal problems.

26
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,432
-No.
- No.

27
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,935
The admitting doctor
noted no family history of--

28
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:31,956
I have an aunt with Crohn's Disease.

29
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,324
You didn't mention that?

30
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,052
I forgot what it was called. Your aunt
has got a million things wrong with her.

31
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:38,656
If you paid attention for five minutes--

32
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,940
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of the other symptoms.

33
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,622
You're alone with her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

34
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:47,273
I'm wondering if we can focus on
answering the questions, Mrs. Hartmann.

35
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:49,315
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.

36
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,539
I suspected.

37
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:57,114
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

38
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,112
We're half a million
dollars from our goal.

39
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,163
Of course, this is a naming
opportunity for your foundation.

40
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:08,059
Is--is there a problem?

41
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,616
There's something on your face.

42
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,960
It's, uh--

43
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:21,659
Excuse me.

44
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,745
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper

45
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,753
because at least then the
sociopath isn't my employee.

46
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:37,216
This baby won me second
place in the clinic's weekly

47
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,713
"weirdest thing pulled
out of an orifice" contest.

48
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:42,503
I am this close to putting
a new lab in Oncology.

49
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,151
You do not want to
know what came in first.

50
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,167
- House.
- Rhymes with "fucchini."

51
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:48,997
Give me his pills.

52
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,701
- Where's my prescription?
- No more free floating prescriptions.

53
00:03:57,702 --> 00:04:00,352
Princeton PD has already
forced Wilson to shut down.

54
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:03,363
A cop says boo, Wilson shuts down.

55
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:07,893
Every doctor in this place is afraid
to make a move without covering his ass.

56
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,762
Do you think maybe you're
shouting at the wrong person?

57
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,859
Tritter's obviously out to get me.
He doesn't care--

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,010
- Your forged prescriptions!
- Allegedly.

59
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,361
Your pain has become my pain.

60
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,656
From now on you get reasonable
doses at reasonable times.

61
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,528
But I hurt in an unreasonable way.

62
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,485
- Then dip into your secret stash.
- Tritter took it.

63
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,814
Then move onto your secret secret stash.

64
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:29,542
I ran out.

65
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:31,943
Then move onto your
secret secret secret stash.

66
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,906
Parents say she's not on any med.

67
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:48,952
If the pancreatitis wasn't set
off by drugs, and she hasn't been sick,

68
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:51,653
that leaves trauma or
some kind of structural defect.

69
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,648
Put up the CT.

70
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,585
- What's that density there?
- Shadow. Looks normal to me.

71
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,634
- We got a referral from--
- Excuse me.

72
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,389
You stash your drugs
in a Lupus textbook.

73
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:09,733
It's never Lupus.

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,520
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

75
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,666
- Gallstones?
- Biliary duct is dilated.

76
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,700
Probably from a stone lodged in it.

77
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,643
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

78
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,938
She's six.
Six-year-olds don't get gallstones.

79
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,589
So she didn't have pancreatitis.

80
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,578
Your theory is an invisible gallstone?

81
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:27,291
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

82
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,009
You might want to wait until
he actually tells us his theory

83
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,018
before you start kissing
his theory's ass.

84
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,210
My theory is...

85
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:35,578
vanishing gallstone.

86
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,352
She had it, and it passed.
Those things travel in packs.

87
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,624
The rest of them are probably hiding out
in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.

88
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:46,075
If I'm right, we'll take out
the organ so we can analyze the stones.

89
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,235
I wasn't kissing his ass.

90
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,719
It must've just looked that way from
our angle. You on your knees,

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,596
House bending over.

92
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:01,077
He predicted the pancreatitis.

93
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,617
- It's his dad's fault.
- My dad was an ass.

94
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,077
But you did everything he wanted you to,
and in return

95
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:09,010
- you got everything you wanted.
- Yeah, it's that simple.

96
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,061
The strategy worked.

97
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:13,060
Dad got him a cushy job.
Paid for his cushy life.

98
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,050
Cut me out of his cushy will.

99
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,242
I told you.

100
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,101
It's just his nature.

101
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,075
Poor guy's hardwired to kiss ass.

102
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,375
House was right.

103
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,958
Gallstones.

104
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,592
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

105
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:31,769
It's unusual. That's why
we need to see what's causing it.

106
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,142
We'd like to remove Alice's
gallbladder and analyze the stones.

107
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:36,145
- Sure.
- No.

108
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,650
- Just 'cause I said sure?
- I am capable of my own thoughts.

109
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:40,979
It's a simple procedure.
The gallbladder isn't essential--

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,156
If the doctor thinks we should do it,
we should, Edie.

111
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:45,115
You think maybe we
should get a second opinion

112
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,960
before we start removing
our child's organs?

113
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,149
That's an effective
use of taxpayers' money.

114
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,282
I'm actually off this week.

115
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,761
I'm guessing you don't have a family.

116
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:09,332
Most people have enough going on
in their lives that they don't have

117
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,735
to personalize every slight.

118
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,887
This isn't personal.

119
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:13,819
Not anymore.

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,120
My head of oncology had to shut down.

121
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:20,211
My entire staff are afraid to
make a move without covering their ass.

122
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,592
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

123
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,824
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized?

124
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,818
- His entire practice ruined?
- No.

125
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,161
So you just don't care?

126
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,956
This is how I get what I want.

127
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,356
I put pressure on people.

128
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,682
And if it doesn't work on Wilson,

129
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,082
it'll work on you.

130
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,108
You punish the innocent.

131
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,214
None of you are innocent.

132
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:51,048
Not one of you.

133
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:55,179
Not one of you has told me the truth.
about Dr. House.

134
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,873
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

135
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:01,688
No, the pills distort reality.

136
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,848
He is an addict.

137
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,912
He's not out robbing a liquor store or--

138
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,278
No, he's treating people.

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,303
He needs to find a different
way to cope before he kills somebody.

140
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,543
If he hasn't done that already.

141
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,390
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

142
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,509
It should be dealt
with by doctors, not by--

143
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,637
Well, it's not being dealt with
by doctors. Doctors are covering it up.

144
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,692
The whole point of
the criminal justice system

145
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,533
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

146
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,114
With all due respect...

147
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,418
you have failed.

148
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:54,239
Sorry. Didn't know you
wanted your kid dead. Although,

149
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,413
for a couple of G's I
could still make it happen.

150
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:59,644
- Who the hell are you?
- I am complete stranger

151
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:02,341
who apparently cares more about
whether your kid dies than you do.

152
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,842
- You're Dr. House.
- You've seen my stage show.

153
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,260
She's not dying. She has pancreatitis.

154
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,726
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

155
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,189
And do what, burn sage?

156
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,658
I want you to do the surgery.

157
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,162
My father had gallstones.
They were totally harmless.

158
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:18,195
Alice had one bad one, but it passed.
For all we know this is over.

159
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,402
And for all we know she
could get sick again tomorrow.

160
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:23,203
Then I'll take her to her pediatrician.
She's six, Rob.

161
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,378
She shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.

162
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,634
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

163
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,523
You're the doctor. I'm the mother.

164
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:34,216
I outrank you. Live with t.

165
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,502
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

166
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:45,242
It's like people like
this who killed Copernicus.

167
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,053
- Galileo.
- Either way.

168
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,016
And they just locked Galileo up.

169
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,836
They killed his spirit.
Nobody likes a showoff.

170
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,084
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has
a dad who's willing to see reason.

171
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,901
Reason as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

172
00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,088
Their doctor.

173
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,929
Your Honor, I've had no
opportunity to consult my attorney.

174
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,898
There's no time.

175
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,771
- All I want is a second opinion before
- No time!

176
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,968
Your testimony is their child will die

177
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,473
if I don't grant this motion right now.

178
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,534
Am I under oath?

179
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:13,872
Let's say yes.

180
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,850
My testimony is that
this child might

181
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:18,695
die if you don't grant
this motion right now.

182
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,695
Literally no time for a second opinion.

183
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,406
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

184
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:25,614
- Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?
- She's not a specialist in this area.

185
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:26,915
Her opinion is worthless.

186
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,396
Dr. Cuddy,
what do you think of Dr. House?

187
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,425
Is he as big a jerk as I think he is?

188
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:33,906
Bigger.

189
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,507
But he knows what he's talking about.

190
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,511
Got a page.

191
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,113
She's complaining about her stitches.

192
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,289
Nurse just said that's
completely normal. Did you get

193
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,536
- the test results for the gallstones?
- Any minute now.

194
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,902
No time for a second opinion
but the test takes three--

195
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:15,853
My skin hurts.

196
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,796
I know I no longer have
the right to demand it,

197
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,793
- but could you please take a look?
- Sure.

198
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:24,272
She's pissed, now she's just
looking for things to go wrong.

199
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:28,196
You're right, I'm so petty I hope
she dies so it vindicates my opinion.

200
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:34,781
I didn't mean that, sweetie.
Mommy was being sarcastic.

201
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,755
She's a few years away from
grasping sarcasm, don't you think?

202
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:38,706
Guys.

203
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,881
I already gave you that number.

204
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:55,482
Simple surgical procedure turns
a little girl into The English Patient.

205
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:56,433
What gives?

206
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,792
Must be allergic to something
we used in the surgery.

207
00:11:58,793 --> 00:11:59,743
Cameron.

208
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,153
C-a-m-e-r-o-n.

209
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,319
This is my office. I'm talking.
There are people here who work for me.

210
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,053
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

211
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:09,354
Tritter froze my account.

212
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:12,567
They're checking theirs.
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

213
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:16,372
Call Wilson's lawyer. He'll tell
you exactly how and why you're screwed.

214
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,093
This kid has no history of allergies.

215
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,571
You've gotta talk to Tritter.
You gotta make this go away.

216
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,301
Yeah, great plan.
The man's obviously open to reason.

217
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,385
Well, here's the plan. We do nothing.

218
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,338
We wile away the time
diagnosing the patient.

219
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,321
The stones were calcium bilirubinante,
pigment stones.

220
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,803
Which are non-conclusive.

221
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,074
Kid presented with low-grade fever,
mild anemia.

222
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,753
That plus the stones
indicate bacterial infection.

223
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:41,386
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash.

224
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,865
And doing nothing is not a plan.
It's specifically a lack of a plan.

225
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,920
We cut into her belly. Bad boys escape.

226
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:53,177
They swarm over, colonize the wounds,
and... ka-plow! Vesicular rash.

227
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,689
Allergic reaction is 100% more
likely with or without a history.

228
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,576
Fever and anemia could've
been symptoms of pancreatitis.

229
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,262
Hello?

230
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:03,888
Thank you for your help.

231
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,299
They froze my accounts.

232
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,800
- Thank you for your help?
- It's not her fault.

233
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,793
He hasn't gotten to mine yet.

234
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:14,458
I'm gonna withdraw and much as
I can as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.

235
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:17,132
Do a scratch test. Check for allergies.

236
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,551
When it comes up negative,
start broad-spectrum antibiotics.

237
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,846
Bullies bully. They don't
get a reaction, they lose interest.

238
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,254
No go do what I ask before
I stick your heads in toilets.

239
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:40,623
- How'd Otter get here?
- Daddy got him last night.

240
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,925
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00. How'd you get it?

241
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:47,543
I drove over there. I knocked
for about ten minutes. And then I

242
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:49,396
I begged.

243
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,836
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

244
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:02,357
- My tummy hurts.
- Ginger ale?

245
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,050
Yeah?

246
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:07,898
- I'll take over.
- Be right back.

247
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:17,802
He's already been really good at
the big romantic gestures, but ask him

248
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,882
to do the dishes or show
up for a meal on time or drive her--

249
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:22,942
Almost done here.

250
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,924
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

251
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,371
Passively-aggressively
you gave up your practice.

252
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,422
I have clinic hours.

253
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:50,468
Now, you're passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

254
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,218
with a big sign around your neck saying,

255
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,626
"Wilson doesn't have enough
cash for the cafeteria."

256
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,434
You know, before Lenny
Bruce died of a drug overdose...

257
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:02,197
If you're gonna confront me
with everyone who ever abused narcotics,

258
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,178
I think I'm gonna have
to get something to read.

259
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,872
. ..he was arrested
on obscenity charges.

260
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,824
He went through a series
of arrests and trials

261
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,983
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

262
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:12,560
He became obsessed with
his own legal problem.

263
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,060
And his act turned into long,
humorless rants about fascist cops

264
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,702
and the violation of his rights.

265
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:21,453
I get it, I get it.
I need to change my nightclub act.

266
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,595
You think more props?

267
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,076
House, scratch test is getting results.
A lot of results.

268
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,902
How could she be allergic to everything?

269
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,063
She can't be.

270
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:49,602
It has to be an infection.

271
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,825
You see a positive allergy
test and decide it's infection?

272
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,276
The bacteria got into
the scratches in her back.

273
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,758
Infections radiate.
That shape of this isn't--

274
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,921
- Eat this.
- I don't feel like eating.

275
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,030
- It'll make you better.
- A sandwich?

276
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,062
- Magic sandwich.
- There's no such thing--

277
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,763
Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?

278
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,210
Amazing how she didn't
go into anaphylactic shock.

279
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:29,001
That's diagnostically ridiculous.

280
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,371
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

281
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:35,022
If she is allergic, antibiotics
could cause a massive systemic reaction.

282
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,154
If she's allergic, but she's not.

283
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:43,014
Chase, you're right. The shape indicates
allergy. The tests indicate allergy.

284
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,928
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts

285
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,903
doesn't mean she's not
allergic to lidocaïne or--

286
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:51,105
Chase, hang the bag!
You can grow a backbone tomorrow.

287
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:54,268
No, I'm not giving my daughter
drugs that could shut her system down.

288
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,219
You know what else shuts down systems?

289
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:57,873
Death.

290
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,600
Sorry.

291
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,427
I can't let you do this.

292
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,087
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom

293
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,413
who is willing to see reason.

294
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,174
You were in here yesterday

295
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:14,925
telling me her father's
guardianship was best for her.

296
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:18,320
I honestly figured I'd
get a different judge today.

297
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:22,742
- You agree with Dr. House now.
- Now my kid actually is sick.

298
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:25,153
- She was sick yesterday.
- Her pediatrician doesn't know

299
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,008
what's wrong with her,
says House is the best.

300
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,939
She loses guardianship.
Then, House is a hero.

301
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,764
- It's got nothing to do with me deci--
- Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.

302
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:35,266
- This lawyering thing is easy.
- You shut up too.

303
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,386
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time and mine.

304
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:43,499
Since her parents can't or won't agree,

305
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:47,755
I'm awarding temporary
guardianship to a doctor

306
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:51,874
who will place the health
of the child above all else.

307
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,425
I don't think Dr. House is capable--

308
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:54,897
- Dr. Cuddy.
- Yes, Your Honor.

309
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,873
No, I was finishing my sentence.

310
00:17:58,562 --> 00:17:59,752
The kid's all yours.

311
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,559
3:00. Give me the pills.

312
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,318
I don't even know this kid. How am I
supposed to decide what's best for her?

313
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,549
Fine, I'll choose. I'm gonna
side with the angry doctor's opinion.

314
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,500
Give me my pills.

315
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:15,836
We're not gonna go broad-spectrum. If
there's any chance that she's allergic--

316
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,695
- There is no chance.
- Of course there's one.

317
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,372
- I'm appealing.
- No, you're not.

318
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,595
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

319
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,621
Not gonna be enough.
We need to go broad-spectrum.

320
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,301
It kills bugs. That's what you want.

321
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,030
We'll go with metronidazole.

322
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,793
You don't have to testify
he's broken any laws.

323
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,914
Though I'm sure you could.

324
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,354
Just how many pills he takes in a day.

325
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:42,754
Because I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't, uh,

326
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,455
have that many legitimate prescriptions.

327
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,449
I really hope no one dies while
I'm sitting here not talking to you.

328
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,367
I--I had a, uh--

329
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,831
I had a buddy at Trenton PD

330
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,555
do some digging.

331
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,045
Your brother locked up for drugs.

332
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,080
Your own flesh and blood,

333
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,140
and you don't even visit.

334
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,300
But your boss practices
medicine on drugs,

335
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,150
time to start lying to the cops.

336
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:18,262
If I run out for coffee, will
I get back before you make your point?

337
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,361
You, um, you testify...

338
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:26,114
I can make sure that
Marcus goes free on parole

339
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:29,468
in less than two months.

340
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:33,904
My brother and I...

341
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,842
We grew up in the same home.

342
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:41,356
But...

343
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,175
I made something of myself.

344
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:46,723
He didn't.

345
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,782
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk,

346
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:52,524
you'd think you never
committed any crimes yourself.

347
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:57,784
You and Dr.
House. You are both cold bastards.

348
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,510
You don't give a
damn about your brother,

349
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,304
and you can't stand House.

350
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:09,447
But I do expect you to take this deal

351
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,061
because you hate hypocrisy more.

352
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,372
House has had a thousand chances.

353
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:17,678
You had two chances.

354
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,212
Why is your brother stuck at one?

355
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,319
Well, if she was allergic to this
antibiotic, we would've seen it by now.

356
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:34,220
I think we are out of
the woods as far as that goes.

357
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,706
Guess they occasionally get one right.

358
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,453
You're gonna be glib about this?

359
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,698
- You almost killed her.
- I made a choice.

360
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,641
The same choice you made yesterday.
Only when I make it, I'm an imbecile.

361
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,551
Every decision you
have made has been wrong.

362
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:48,575
When this over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

363
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:50,711
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

364
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:53,183
Because it's not just
about the past two days.

365
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:56,218
Like you have the hotline on
what's best for Alice. She loves me.

366
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,293
She never does her homework when she's
with you. She never brushes her hair--

367
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:02,494
Her heart's racing. Pressure's rising.
The two of you, get out.

368
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,572
I'm her mother. You can't just--

369
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,950
You fight. She has an anxiety attack.

370
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,760
The two of you are making her worse.

371
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:13,002
Get out and don't come back.

372
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,243
How's the kid doing?

373
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:23,232
Much better as of about two hours ago.

374
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:24,852
You got any money for lunch?

375
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:26,661
If you like parsley and croutons.

376
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:28,881
Tritter finally froze my accounts.

377
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,282
- Really?
- You surprised?

378
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,263
Why wouldn't he?

379
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,573
I figured if he was singling you out,
you must've done something different.

380
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:35,574
What, like talking?

381
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:38,825
Yeah, and now that he's frozen
your accounts, you probably will.

382
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,364
You need the cash, right?

383
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,156
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

384
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,157
He does freeze my accounts, I'm guilty.

385
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:46,534
Is Alice having some procedure done?

386
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,536
- She's fine. She's resting.
- Where?

387
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,098
In her room,
where you're not supposed

388
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,155
I was just at the window.
There's no one in there.

389
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:53,856
Her backpack wasn't there either.

390
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,193
You don't think her father could've--

391
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,145
Call security.

392
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,447
- Get a gurney.
- She's stiff. She can't move.

393
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:13,476
I don't know what happened.
I mean, she seemed fine.

394
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:16,697
Help her, please.

395
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:25,910
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

396
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,918
Muscle rigidity is almost
exclusively neurological.

397
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,317
Neuroaxonal dystrophy.
She's the right age.

398
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,227
Except that her liver's starting
to shut down. No dystrophy would--

399
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,876
Metronidazole.
Great idea. Let's not go broad-spectrum.

400
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,251
Let's not take any chances
of actually curing her.

401
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,809
House, can you focus on the case?

402
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,531
No! Because I'm in pain.

403
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:46,218
Because you think that compromise
is the answer to everything.

404
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,290
I need more pills.

405
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:50,024
Muscle rigidity plus liver
involvement means Wilson's.

406
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,330
No, no corneal ring. No mental changes.

407
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:53,559
Then what?

408
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,297
I need more pills!

409
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:03,163
- No, you are on a reasonable--
- What the hell does "reasonable" mean?

410
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:09,221
Keep it quiet.

411
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:12,903
Her B.P. reacts to stress,
and yelling is not gonna--

412
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:16,572
If you think that I'm not in pain,

413
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,355
then don't give me anything.
Keep me away from the aspirin.

414
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,076
But If I'm in a buttload of pain,
I need a buttload of pills.

415
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:25,131
Fine. You need more pills.
You're not getting them.

416
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:27,217
You can have all the aspirin you want.

417
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,619
I say we draw straws.
Loser drives down to Trenton,

418
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,326
scores him an eight-ball.

419
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,407
- Which one of you gave her an aspirin?
- What?

420
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:45,881
Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome,

421
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,582
which doesn't make any
sense unless she took aspirin.

422
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,158
Rob?

423
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,463
No way. She's a kid.
I've read the 800 warning labels.

424
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,559
I'm not even angry.
I just want her to be okay.

425
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,295
She's lying. She's angry.
Because you kidnapped her kid.

426
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:58,046
She'll be angrier if the kid dies.

427
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,589
- I didn't.
- One aspirin

428
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,246
combined with a pre-existing
infection is all it takes

429
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,940
- to set off an attack.
- I'm not lying.

430
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,291
Well, sure,
you've certainly earned our trust.

431
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,722
Where was Alice the
night before she came in?

432
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:12,443
With me. Well, at my house. I went out.
She stayed with a babysitter.

433
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,378
- Where were you?
- None of your business.

434
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,574
You hired someone that
might've poisoned our daughter.

435
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:21,098
- She's 15. She's very responsible.
- Is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?

436
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:24,322
Or just some kid from down the
street who needed 20 bucks for lip gloss

437
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:25,673
and couple of Tiger Beats?

438
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:30,060
Put your kid on charcoal hemoperfusion.

439
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:31,986
Shouldn't we see what
the babysitter has to say?

440
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:34,721
I know what she's gonna say.
She's gonna lie to save her business.

441
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:35,672
I need more pills.

442
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,262
We are gonna use this
machine to clean your blood.

443
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:49,863
It goes out of you and through
a filter like the filter in a fish tank.

444
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,870
It's kind of cool actually.

445
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,314
I'm scared.

446
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,589
It won't hurt.

447
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:06,873
It takes a while,

448
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:08,402
so it'll be boring.

449
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,600
But it won't hurt.

450
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,770
It's gonna make you better.

451
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,286
They hate each other, don't they?

452
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,066
We're never gonna be together again.

453
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:24,277
Well, you never know.

454
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:36,589
You gonna break out the rubber hoses,
the bright lights?

455
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,556
I'm not gonna testify just
because I have to borrow lunch money.

456
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:40,468
I know.

457
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,044
Women don't give up guys that

458
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,080
they're in love with.

459
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:46,085
I'm not in love with House.

460
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:49,451
The guy is unhinged and unethical.

461
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:52,249
Does what he wants
with no concern for others.

462
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:53,542
But you stand by him.

463
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,959
It can't just be loyalty and respect.

464
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:57,568
No.

465
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,719
I'm a girl,
so I must be in love with him.

466
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:01,496
Not because you're a girl.

467
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:03,602
Because ten years ago

468
00:26:04,744 --> 00:26:08,361
you got an "A" in calculus
until you ratted yourself out.

469
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,564
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

470
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,921
- Because you married a man--
- Don't go there.

471
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:20,653
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

472
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,389
House has changed you.

473
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,738
Do you think it's
all been for the better?

474
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:41,786
How's it going?

475
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:43,491
- Boring.
- Told you.

476
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,102
So far, so good. Just like five
minutes ago, ten minutes before that.

477
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:48,799
What's the matter?

478
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,176
She must've thrown a clot.

479
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:59,477
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the O.R.

480
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:01,732
You said it wouldn't hurt!

481
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,194
- Found it.
- She's burning up.

482
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:16,380
- Give me a sec.
- Foreman, she is on fire.

483
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,821
- Almost there.
- Get me some cooling blankets now.

484
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:19,772
Right away.

485
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,190
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

486
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,006
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

487
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:28,003
You really had to flash
your private stash in front of me?

488
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,729
You find it easier to
lie for me if it's more subtle?

489
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,970
Fine.

490
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,491
Your told your associates
that I had frozen your accounts.

491
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,594
- Yes.
- Smart lie.

492
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:48,576
You figured they'd think there was
a reason that you'd been singled out.

493
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:49,527
Like that

494
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:52,523
you had agreed to testify against House.

495
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,780
Yeah, I assume that's why you did it.

496
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:58,136
You have a reputation

497
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,903
as a bit of an opportunist.

498
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:03,439
You already gave your boss
up once from what I've heard.

499
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,454
To save my job.
He goes down now, I lose my job.

500
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:09,583
You lose your job, you fin another one.
You get fired...

501
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:12,996
Chances don't look so hot.

502
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:16,084
- Why would he fire to me?
- Because you rolled on him.

503
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,485
- I haven't rolled on him.
- I think you will.

504
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,772
And he's gonna think you already did.

505
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:25,155
As far as he knows, my accounts
are frozen just like everyone else's.

506
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:29,074
In 24 hours, all three of you
will have access to your accounts again.

507
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:30,687
- Why would you--
- See,

508
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,769
if I was looking at this

509
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,632
as an outsider,

510
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:37,351
I would say

511
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,367
it was because Detective Tritter had

512
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,704
what appeared to be a very
pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.

513
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:53,384
Yeah.

514
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,351
The two of them

515
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,263
appeared to be

516
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,725
working together.

517
00:29:07,252 --> 00:29:09,622
How the hell are there
no ice packs in the O.R.?

518
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,836
Clot's out. Ice packs aren't gonna hold
her for long. Where are the blankets?

519
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:15,637
In the E.R., they're dealing
with a four-car collision.

520
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:18,352
We need to cool this kid
down before her brain melts.

521
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:23,692
What are you doing?

522
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,744
She got a major dose of heparin
to thin her blood for the procedure.

523
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:30,475
Could've induced thrombocytopenia.

524
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:34,034
That's unlikely. The charcoal
would've absorbed a lot of the heparin.

525
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:35,591
She's been anemic.

526
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,856
- Could be a primary blood disorder.
- Or we never cured the infection.

527
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:41,616
Are you saying she never had Reye's?

528
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:43,847
We just put that little
girl through excruciating pain.

529
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,390
The pain wasn't House's fault.
Even if the clot was a reaction

530
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:50,091
- to what we gave her we still had--
- I don't need you to cover my ass!

531
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:51,915
What I need is my Vicodin!

532
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,158
Two pills every six hours.
Like I'm on an allowance.

533
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,360
She's a given a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

534
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,860
What the hell? Why don't we
get a plumber in here, ask his opinion?

535
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:05,181
Hey, Cuddy, you know any
rodeo clowns who can weigh in--

536
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,281
Where the hell is she?

537
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,684
Look at her arm.

538
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,581
- I told you it was an infection.
- We fixed the infection.

539
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:26,219
Well, apparently not.
I asked you for broad-spectrum.

540
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,870
You put her on the bare minimum.

541
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:31,415
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom because you suck at it.

542
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,827
What's good about this rash?

543
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,398
Good guesses, but no.

544
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,460
It's on parts of her
body that we haven't touched.

545
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:03,735
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out of consciousness.

546
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,956
But it's not a reaction to anything
we did. Her mojo is off the table.

547
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:09,265
Which means?

548
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,091
Oh, so close!

549
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,299
Means that thanks to
Cuddy's candy-ass approach

550
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,960
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

551
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,888
This thing has grown horns and fangs.

552
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:27,572
We gotta figure out what species it is.
Go in with a spear to the heart.

553
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,479
Okay, you guys are sulking.

554
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:36,773
I don't really care why, but apparently
I can't do my job without finding out.

555
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:40,638
- Tritter released our bank accounts.
- Horrible, horrible news.

556
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,437
Wow, I'm glad we didn't let that fester.

557
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:46,747
If she did have Reye's, then it
could be varicella. They're associated.

558
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,348
He released our money.
You do know what that means.

559
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:51,205
The correct question is

560
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:54,260
"how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?"

561
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:56,593
Rickettisal pox causes rash,
fever, and muscle pain.

562
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:59,836
Pain, not paralysis. Rocky Mountain
spotted fever on the other hand.

563
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,498
Rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.

564
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,489
- And I didn't say anything to Tritter.
- Neither did I.

565
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,041
Maybe he wants us to
think that one of us talked.

566
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:08,960
- It worked.
- You were with him.

567
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,811
- We were all with him.
- We weren't laughing with him.

568
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,025
Maybe he just gave up.

569
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:16,694
Start the kid on chloramphenicol
for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

570
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,864
- Can we talk?
- Nope.

571
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,454
- I really think--
- Either you screwed me

572
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:27,388
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and you want applause.

573
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:28,939
Either way I'm not interested.

574
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:43,098
Busy.

575
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,336
You okay?

576
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,640
Yeah, sure.

577
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,092
What I meant by "are you okay?" is

578
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,091
what the hell did House do?

579
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:55,691
- Nothing.
- What did he say?

580
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:59,908
I've seen House be rude a thousand
times, usually to achieve something.

581
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,691
I have never seen him
be mean just because he can.

582
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,201
Seriously?

583
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,183
- What did he say?
- Nothing. Doesn't matter.

584
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,207
Well, I've seen House be
rude to you a thousand times,

585
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:15,975
but I've never seen it get to you.

586
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:16,926
People think

587
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,871
House has no inner censor.

588
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,486
But the fact is he holds himself back,

589
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,536
because when he wants to hurt, he knows

590
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,692
just where to poke a sharp stick.

591
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:33,677
I have been trying to get pregnant,
and House knew.

592
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,383
He told me I would fail as a mother.

593
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,923
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

594
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:44,845
I've had three separate implantations.
The first two never took.

595
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:47,987
The last one I lost.

596
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:50,336
I'm sorry.

597
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:51,809
You didn't fail.

598
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,980
Those where physical events.

599
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,408
A little girl is...

600
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,559
scared and in pain.

601
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,415
I was awkward,
terrified of doing the wrong thing.

602
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,441
- That's normal. That's--
- I didn't hug her.

603
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:13,134
I didn't even reach out and hold her
hand. I told her it was gonna be okay.

604
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:14,872
She needed reassurance.

605
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:17,307
I told her her folks
might get back together.

606
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,948
When I see people with their kids,
it's so natural.

607
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:29,930
It's like they have an instruction
book imprinted on their genes.

608
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,531
Maybe I just didn't get a copy.

609
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,458
Maybe my wanting
to be a mother is like a

610
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:38,795
tone deaf person wanting to sing
opera or a paraplegic who wants to--

611
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:46,516
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking in the right spot.

612
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,064
Chloramphenicol isn't working.

613
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:21,313
- What dose did you give her?
- Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.

614
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:25,647
We always end up there.
Just getting a jump on it.

615
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,145
I doubled her up.

616
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,192
The infection's morphed.

617
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:34,815
- It's moved into her muscle sheath.
- Necrotizing faciitis?

618
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,144
That's impervious to drugs.

619
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,027
The only treatment...

620
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,385
is to cut away the infected area.

621
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,463
- So we amputate.
- Arm and leg?

622
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:49,620
We can't cut a six-year-old kid
in half without a confirmed diagnosis.

623
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:54,038
Moves too quickly and we waited too
long. We don't have time for a culture.

624
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,063
We can at least observe her for a few
hours. Confirm the rash is spreading.

625
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,913
It spreads, she dies.

626
00:36:00,312 --> 00:36:02,391
You're talking about crippling her.

627
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,463
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

628
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:09,120
Right! She's six! She's cute!
She can't have flesh-eating bacteria!

629
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:10,757
It's just wrong!

630
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,170
Let's cure her with
sunshine and puppies.

631
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:17,165
Cute kids die of terrible illnesses.
Innocent doctors go to jail.

632
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:20,971
And it because cowards like you
won't stand up and do what's required.

633
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,128
You can sit around and moan
about who's the bigger weakling.

634
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,468
I'm gonna go do my job.

635
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,731
What kind of quality of
life will she have without--

636
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:48,932
Great thing about life.

637
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:50,917
It's got qualities.

638
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:53,914
And if we can't agree?

639
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,631
I don't know.

640
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,845
He's yelled at us before.

641
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,971
Because he thought our theories
were dumb. Not because our theories

642
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,399
- were sending him to jail.
- He's going through withdrawal.

643
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,887
Could be causing mild paranoia.

644
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,925
It'll pass,
we just have to suffer thought it.

645
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,198
We never ruled out allergy.

646
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,165
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

647
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,326
We cut open her belly.
She got a rash on her belly.

648
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,004
We did a scratch test on her back.
She got a rash on her back.

649
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,690
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be a coincidence--

650
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,341
Too late to be playing
differential games, isn't it?

651
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,749
Get that thing away from me.
I don't want to get burned.

652
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,753
Laser pointers don't burn you, genius.

653
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:31,612
- Skin, no. Retina, yes.
- You don't trust my aim?

654
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,617
Maybe you should cover any sensitive--

655
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,009
He was wrong about the puppies.

656
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,349
House,

657
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,875
you gotta stop the surgery.
She doesn't have necrotizing faciitis.

658
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:50,685
Oh, good.

659
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:54,090
She's got erythropoietic protoporphyria.
She's allergic to light.

660
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:56,198
It's genetic,
either parent could've carried it.

661
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,438
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

662
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:01,409
She gets worse every time
she goes under surgical lights.

663
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,930
- Dad takes her outside--
- Liver's shot too.

664
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:06,805
- She swallow a flashlight?
- Stop the surgery.

665
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,160
- Get the hell out of my way.
- No, I'm--

666
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:17,612
Light damages the blood cells.

667
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:20,683
The damaged blood cells
contain protoporphyrin.

668
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:23,146
The protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

669
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,805
That's why the liver's shutting down.

670
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:55,531
Stop.

671
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,523
How can she be allergic to light?
She's never had this problem before.

672
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:06,476
The negative reaction starts at birth.

673
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,119
It reaches critical
mass around this age.

674
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:13,355
Her blood cells create
chemicals in reaction to light.

675
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,305
When they reach the liver,
it tries to filter out the bad cells.

676
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,696
The chemicals damage the liver,

677
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:22,113
and one byproduct is gallstones.

678
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,158
So she'll just keep getting worse?

679
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:27,496
EP can be managed.

680
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,821
We'll give her beta-carotene.
She's gonna need special light bulbs

681
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:34,085
and filters on the windows. She's
probably gonna need to be home schooled.

682
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:35,586
Her life will be complicated,

683
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:37,524
but she will live.

684
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,092
How do you get something like this?

685
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:42,110
- It's genetic.
- So one of us...

686
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:48,928
Both of you must be carriers.

687
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:55,773
She's gonna want to see
you when she wakes up. So...

688
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,144
don't screw it up.

689
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,236
So, what's new?

690
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:33,810
- House missed one.
- That's happened before.

691
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:35,411
He nearly maimed a little girl.

692
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:37,681
I got it right.

693
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,601
And I told him, and it didn't matter.

694
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,695
Chase, you solved one. You helped a
patient. That better be enough for you.

695
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:50,503
Beckett was gonna call his
play "Waiting for House's Approval" but

696
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:51,754
decided it was too grim.

697
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:52,949
Trust me.

698
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,281
I'm not waiting anymore.

699
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:38,961
I'm gonna need 30 pieces of silver.

700
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,464
