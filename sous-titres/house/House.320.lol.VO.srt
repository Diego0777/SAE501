1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
step around, gather around.

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:05,701
Let me show you a way to make a little
easy money. Understand what I'm sayin'?

3
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:08,687
These are the blacks, don't follow them.
Follow the Queen... know why?

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,561
'Cause she's red, and that
means she is hot! Find the Queen.

5
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:13,805
The first of the day is free to play.
Who wants to play?

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,894
You look interested, my man.
You want to step on up?

7
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,200
Come on, now, who wants to play?
What about you, sweetie?

8
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,001
You're cute, come on up.
Cute girls win money all day.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,140
You look lucky, now.

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:25,083
Follow the Queen, here we go.
Follow the Queen, follow the Queen.

11
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,477
She ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this Queen is for you.

12
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,448
Which one is it?
Which one is it?

13
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,829
- It's right there.
- Right there?

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,637
Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what, takes a woman

15
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,790
to know a woman, takes a lady
to find a Queen.

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,784
There you go...

17
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:42,174
Want to double up?

18
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,105
We gonna chance it, we gonna chance it.

19
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,921
All right, here we go.
All you gotta do is find your Queen.

20
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,351
You will not win again.
You will not win again.

21
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,333
All right, here we go...
find your Queen.

22
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:55,083
Find your Queen.
Where is she?

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:57,124
Boom...
can you find her?

24
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:59,095
- Right there.
- This one?

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,696
Oh, my gosh, she is killin' me.

26
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,236
She is taking all my rent.

27
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,499
Anybody else want to get behind
the good-luck girl?

28
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,509
I can do it.

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,082
You can do it?
You're next.

30
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,717
Give me a chance to get my money back

31
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:11,641
or I'm gonna be out
here sleeping on the street.

32
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,244
Ready? This is the last time.
I'm not messin' no more.

33
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,807
You're taking all my money, girl.
Here we go.

34
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,991
This is your last chance.
Follow the Queen, follow the Queen.

35
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:21,633
Where's she at?
I'll show you one time.

36
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,420
There she is, boom, boom, boom.

37
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:24,814
Pick a card.

38
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,233
Uh, I can't decide.

39
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,829
What do you mean?
Just pick a card, just make a decision.

40
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,801
I can't decide.

41
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,390
Any card will do.
Left, right, center?

42
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,030
I don't... I don't know.

43
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,973
- Do you want the right?!
- I don't know.

44
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,139
The left?
The center?

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,090
I don't know. I...

46
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,999
Move out the way,
let somebody else play then.

47
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,505
I can't decide.
I... I can't.

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,533
- You want to flip a coin for it?
- What's wrong with me?

50
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,261
Scariest 30 seconds of my life.

51
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:34,608
I couldn't do anything. It's
like I couldn't move inside my head.

52
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,941
It's called abulia, the inability
to make a decision or exercise will.

53
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:40,804
Is it gonna happen again?

54
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:43,619
It's part of a T.I.A....
a Transient Ischemic Attack.

55
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,851
Blood was cut off to a
section of your frontal lobe.

56
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,314
- Is that like a stroke or something?
- A little.

57
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,289
What drugs have you taken recently?

58
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,154
No drugs.

59
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,246
Toxins are another possibility.

60
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,878
You might have been exposed
to something at work, for instance.

61
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,438
No real job right now.

62
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,355
Exposure can build up over
time and lie dormant for a while.

63
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,834
- What was your last job?
- Pet store.

64
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:08,227
- Exotic pets?
- Tropical fish.

65
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,479
- And before that?
- Unemployment.

66
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,333
And before that

67
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,906
I sold subscriptions on the phone.

68
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,317
And before that, unemployment.

69
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,387
Before that I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

70
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,619
Before that, unemployment.

71
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,922
Before that, I walked dogs.

72
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,613
And before that...

73
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,976
Loss of free will.

74
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,583
I like it.

75
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:39,750
Maybe we can get Thomas
Aquinas in for a consult.

76
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:41,765
What caused the T.I.A.?

77
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,032
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

78
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,153
Could've dissolved.
Most likely came from her heart.

79
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,334
We should do a bubble study.

80
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,833
Clots are unlikely in a
29-year-old who's not on the pill.

81
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,891
It's probably a vaso-spasm
caused by drugs.

82
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,492
I don't think so.
She goes from job to job.

83
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,504
Maybe there's come kind of A.D.D. here.

84
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,594
Help us pinpoint where
the neurological...

85
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,990
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

86
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,325
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

87
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,212
then gets fired and gets high.

88
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,979
I still don't think it's drugs.

89
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,620
Did you check for infection?

90
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,104
LP showed nothing.
No fever, white blood count is normal.

91
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,355
Could be toxic exposure.

92
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,467
You're the one always
saying it must be drugs.

93
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:16,598
You figure he's a minority,
she must be stoned?

94
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,032
- You know that's not what I...
- She seems like a nice girl.

95
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,057
You haven't met her!

96
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,562
She was pregnant at 15, dropped out of
high school. She's a real overachiever.

97
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,747
Come on, cut her some slack...
her baby died of SIDS.

98
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,936
This isn't some romantic story
about a nice girl scarred by tragedy.

99
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,305
She's a drug-using scam
artist scarred by tragedy.

100
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,933
On the other hand,
her tox-screen just came back.

101
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,014
She's clean.

102
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,296
You're wasting my time.
He's waste...

103
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,567
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson want money?

104
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,266
I am no longer paying alimony.

105
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,327
She wanted her independence,
so she got her Realtor's license.

106
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,236
Market's doing badly, she wants money.

107
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:54,937
The market's doing badly,
she's moving into a condo.

108
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,264
- She wants...
- She wants me to take Hector.

109
00:04:58,793 --> 00:04:59,743
Pool boy?

110
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,513
Dog.

111
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,019
No longer interested.

112
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,470
We got him on our honeymoon.

113
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,439
So I'm, like, the other parent.
But I can't take him.

114
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,710
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

115
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,734
I asked Cuddy to a play Thursday.

116
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,502
Oh, you... okay.

117
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,817
She said she was busy.

118
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,084
And you didn't believe her, so

119
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,116
you bribed a janitor,
broke into her computer,

120
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,025
checked her appointments...
- I asked her as a test.

121
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,279
What would you have
learned if she'd said yes?

122
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,330
A lot about bondage.

123
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:34,881
She's busy for me, but not for you.

124
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:38,232
She's not interested in the playquaplay,
she's interested in you.

125
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:42,226
No, I'm not getting sucked
into the vortex of your insanity again.

126
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:45,277
Don't pass me notes in class,
don't tell me to ask her to the prom.

127
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,934
You cannot see her socially.
You're leading her on.

128
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:51,058
I'll consider that,
after I take her to the Hockney exhibit.

129
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,275
On Thursday.

130
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:54,863
See, she is busy.

131
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,810
It's not a date.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,773
She enjoyed the play.
I enjoyed her enjoying the play.

133
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,315
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

134
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,198
So all this enjoying

135
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,023
is an act of charity?

136
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,327
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

137
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,479
What's life without the
ability to make stupid choices?

138
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:20,858
She needs her free will.

139
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:24,339
Find out why her brain froze before she
can't decide to take her next breath.

140
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,479
You find the toxins,
you run the bubble study.

141
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,265
You won't find anything,
but I'll get the office to myself.

142
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,665
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the internet.

143
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:32,937
Doesn't download itself.

144
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:37,849
Eric... Eric!

145
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,790
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

146
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,074
- Dr. Chase, how are you?
- Good.

147
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,246
- You're lucky you caught us...
- I'll meet you outside.

148
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,071
Hey, Dad.

149
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,105
Uh, I've gotta go.

150
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,412
Why are you here?
Everything okay?

151
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:55,603
Good as ever.

152
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:58,362
We're staying at
a hotel down the street.

153
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,121
You didn't bring Mom with you?

154
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,609
It's gonna be her 60th
birthday in a few days.

155
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,764
I know...
we talked about it on the phone.

156
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,415
You said you couldn't come home.

157
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:11,416
- You didn't have to come.
- You haven't been home in eight years.

158
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,561
She should see you...

159
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,822
while she still knows who you are.

160
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,320
Dad, I've talked to her on the phone.

161
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,194
She only knows who I am...

162
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,116
sometimes.

163
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,655
Sometimes...

164
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,599
is important.

165
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:38,738
So what's up with your dad?
Didn't know he was gonna be in town?

166
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,689
No.

167
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:45,069
A building this old,
there could be toxic exposure anywhere.

168
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,181
Asbestos, mold, the coloring
agents in the old wallpaper.

169
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,743
Or it could be drugs.

170
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,332
I thought we ruled out...

171
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,886
Clean tox-screen means
drugs didn't cause the T.I.A.

172
00:07:56,887 --> 00:08:00,198
Drugs can be laced with toxic
substances. Arsenic, rat poison.

173
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,134
The drugs wash out of her system,
the toxins stick around.

174
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:05,203
Exposure could come
about any number of ways.

175
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,416
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

176
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,367
Absolutely, except for the crack pipe.

177
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,232
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

178
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,564
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

179
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,681
Your dad asked you out for dinner?

180
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,688
I'll do the tests.

181
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,534
You're stuck with your family.

182
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,348
You like Hockney?

183
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,275
You heard about that.

184
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,828
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

185
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,183
That's a trick question.

186
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,819
Yes, but you have
no idea how it's a trick.

187
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,702
I like art. I'm open to new things.
What's the problem?

188
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,104
You're going to a gallery to see
Venezuelan pictures that don't exist,

189
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,051
but you won't go to a play with me.
Why?

190
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,967
House, why is my social
life suddenly red hot?

191
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,174
One minute I'm mushing
along with the huskies, as usual,

192
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,885
and suddenly it's global warming.

193
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,716
You think you saw somebody
else pick up a toy from the sandbox,

194
00:08:58,717 --> 00:08:59,986
and suddenly you want it.

195
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,466
Is that why you said no?

196
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,260
Maybe I just want a friend,
and I thought Wilson was a safe choice.

197
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:08,304
I'm not safe?

198
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,062
Cool.

199
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,554
James Wilson is never the safe choice.

200
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,032
We're going to a gallery,
we're not getting married.

201
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,233
Sure, you say that now.

202
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,562
He always marries 'em in the end.

203
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,503
Is that Eric?

204
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:36,070
Eric!

205
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,310
Oh, baby, baby.

206
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:45,232
I wanted to find that picture
I took at your high school graduation.

207
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:46,310
I had it re-framed.

208
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,219
It's in one of these suitcases,
but I don't know...

209
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,924
You could show it to me later.

210
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,143
Your father wants to
know if you've been praying.

211
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,996
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

212
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,203
But I only want to know if you're happy.

213
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:06,859
Sure, I'm okay.

214
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:10,610
- You like it here, you have friends?
- Yeah, everything's great, Mom.

215
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,460
That's why I brought the picture for
you. I remember when you were little,

216
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,735
you liked to look in the back
of the math book because you knew

217
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,621
even though it made no sense then,

218
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,587
by the end of the year,
you'd understand it all.

219
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,112
That's why you brought the picture?

220
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,911
You wanted to look ahead
to see how far you'd go.

221
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,330
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might like to look back

222
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,457
to see how far you've come.

223
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,643
It all makes sense now, doesn't it?

224
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,337
That isn't mine.

225
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,711
It was in your closet.

226
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:50,200
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

227
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,788
You might want to let him
know he's got arsenic poisoning.

228
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,491
We should get a sample of
his hair so we can see the extent...

229
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:58,442
But I don't do...

230
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,070
I don't do drugs.

231
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,439
Get a crash cart in here!
Respiratory arrest!

232
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,338
Are you sure it isn't from the arsenic?

233
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,746
Dr. Foreman said I was poisoned.

234
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,279
Your hair showed only a trace amount.

235
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,082
Not enough to damage your lungs like
this. We need you to stay still now.

236
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,314
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

237
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,840
Also, I just wanted to let you know,
should you change your mind,

238
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:37,894
I'll be available.

239
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,908
Aren't you getting
tired of hearing me say it?

240
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:45,487
I have no intention of going
out with you, of having sex with you...

241
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,709
of doing anything with you except work.

242
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:51,684
We don't have to make a big deal about
it. I just thought I'd let you know.

243
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,836
I've decided Tuesdays
would be a good day to do that.

244
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,802
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

245
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,940
You were looking for something,
and I happened to be...

246
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,455
It's fine.

247
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,118
No need to go on about it.

248
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,585
I'm dancing through the lung bases.

249
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,055
- We need to put this behind this.
- Understood.

250
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,478
- But you keep bringing it up.
- You're the one who's still talking.

251
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:20,443
Look, I'm not demanding anything
from you. I'm not following you home.

252
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,820
I've got no expectations.

253
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:25,589
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week is hardly stalking.

254
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,236
There's a mass...

255
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,108
just outside the lingular.

256
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,816
Biopsy shows there are white blood
cells in the walls of the blood vessels.

257
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,091
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

258
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:45,112
It's gotta be autoimmune...
something lymphocytic.

259
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,080
The white blood cells
are attacking her own body.

260
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,984
Only question is
what kind of autoimmune?

261
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,833
- It doesn't matter what kind.
- It always matters what kind.

262
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,655
- Treatment's always steroids.
- Treatment is always boring.

263
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:55,605
Diagnosis...

264
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,633
Okay, it's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

265
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,427
It's gotta be Giant Cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

266
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:03,567
It's affecting the smaller blood
vessels. Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

267
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:05,587
I'll start her on steroids.
It's affecting...

268
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:06,825
Yeah, got it.

269
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,957
- Start her on steroids.
- Good idea.

270
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:13,544
Told you it was boring.

271
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,257
- I gotta go out.
- Why?

272
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:17,845
Wilson's got a date.

273
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,687
It's got 15-foot ceilings,
it's an open floor plan.

274
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,475
You know, I can't believe you called me.

275
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,991
Hey, I need a condo.

276
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:32,389
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

277
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:36,304
Wow, you remember where
our first date was?

278
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,718
I didn't think you
were paying attention.

279
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,818
Really?
He's my best friend.

280
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,133
Our first date was in Boston.

281
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,965
Not quite as close
to here as I remembered.

282
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,969
- But we're not here to talk about him.
- Absolutely not.

283
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,135
Wait till you see the kitchen.

284
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,480
All-granite countertops.

285
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,049
Since I wasn't paying attention
back then, what was it like dating him?

286
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,137
So this is Hockney?

287
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,349
No.
I don't know what happened.

288
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,207
I'm sure you don't.

289
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,406
I never knew your
tastes were so eclectic.

290
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,877
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

291
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,270
I thought it was May 20th.

292
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,857
Okay, my bad.

293
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,634
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

294
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:27,585
N- not that this is a date, obviously.

295
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,428
I was just thinking...

296
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,929
he's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now, and

297
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:39,028
they're kinda peaceful.
And you're always so busy.

298
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,590
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

299
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,590
Oh, it was never a date.

300
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:51,317
I was coming off a bad relationship,
and he said we could go out as friends.

301
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:54,252
You know,
just go see plays, go to a museum.

302
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,457
- I didn't think you liked Trenton.
- Love it.

303
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:01,310
So he'd say it's not a date,
but then he'd jump you.

304
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:02,472
Oh, no, he meant it.

305
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:07,829
James Wilson, carefully calibrating
his level of protectiveness for your

306
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,750
individual needs.

307
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,026
Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?

308
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,126
No.

309
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,357
It was very endearing.

310
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,379
He really just wanted to be a friend.

311
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:19,157
So I jumped him.

312
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,699
The bedroom's through here.

313
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,419
That's such a bad idea.

314
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,645
There is no way that won't
cause damage to the large intestine.

315
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:31,951
Are you keeping us here to torture me?

316
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,928
- Is that a bicycle pump?
- That's what I'm saying.

317
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,896
It's like walking into a sticky trap.

318
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,650
Once you're the focus of
all that attention, it's addictive.

319
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:47,137
This unit's kitchen
has got a chef's oven.

320
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,503
I cook a lot.
Go on.

321
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,423
It's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

322
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,306
He's just so "knight
in shining armor," you know?

323
00:15:56,897 --> 00:16:00,500
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

324
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,159
But by then, you're hooked.

325
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,012
Hey, do you think that you
could talk to him about taking the dog?

326
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:11,541
He's the only one that
Hector really gets along with.

327
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,419
Hey, we're here to talk real estate,
not Wilson.

328
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:21,663
So you're saying if you'd actually had
sex before you connected emotionally,

329
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:25,007
you'd have gotten over him.
- Oh, yeah. It seems weird, right?

330
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,551
'Cause sex with James... it's fantastic.

331
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,454
Nobody works harder to
give a woman what she wants.

332
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,239
It's got six burners.

333
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,017
- The chef's oven.
- Right.

334
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,191
How you feeling?

335
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:51,948
That wasn't my crack pipe.

336
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,798
You told me.
Are you tired?

337
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,439
I just took a hit off it a couple times.

338
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,519
What's wrong with having a little fun?

339
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,765
Your personal life
is none of my business.

340
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:07,785
- You don't like me, though, do you?
- That's your imagination.

341
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,343
I've seen every kind of drug abuse.

342
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,094
No offense, but you don't
even stand out in the pack.

343
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:15,336
I'm betting you got money
the same place you got attitude.

344
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:19,648
You know, people who quit drinking,
and people who lose weight,

345
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:22,226
they think they're better
than the people that couldn't.

346
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:25,451
And because you got out of the projects,
you think that anybody

347
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:27,296
who didn't

348
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:30,699
is weak and stupid.
- I'm not judging you.

349
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,084
Take a breath.

350
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,270
The only difference between me and
you is that I made some bad decisions,

351
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,099
and you made some good ones.

352
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,682
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

353
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:44,606
Stop doing drugs, stop having fun.
Go back to school and get your GED.

354
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,532
Yeah, where's the money coming from?

355
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,007
The system's not set
up for people like me.

356
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:51,604
What are you staring at?

357
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,219
Your eyes.

358
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,957
There's yellow in the sclera.

359
00:17:58,852 --> 00:17:59,902
Her liver's failing.

360
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,162
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead in the next 48 hours.

361
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:05,033
We should increase
her immunosuppressants,

362
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,168
and target more specifically,
add methotrexate.

363
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,463
Let's do more of what's not working.
This is not an autoimmune disease.

364
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,452
Her white blood cells are attacking
her body. That's autoimmune.

365
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,196
First brain, then lungs, now liver.
All getting worse and all in two days.

366
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,742
It's moving too fast.

367
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:22,642
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

368
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,988
It's rare even by our standards,
but it fits her symptoms.

369
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,693
Explains why the
steroids aren't working.

370
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:30,297
- Poor fingernail growth.
- A lot of people have bad fingernails.

371
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,763
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems shutting down.

372
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,946
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

373
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,423
She needs total body radiation.

374
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,362
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

375
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:41,617
Running those immuno-chemistries could
take a week. She'll be dead by the time.

376
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,496
That doesn't make radiation any safer.

377
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,902
Okay, suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

378
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,447
Suppose it's an autoimmune disease.

379
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,360
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

380
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,987
It suppresses the immune system,

381
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:55,988
which is what we're trying
to do with the steroids anyway.

382
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,715
I don't usually put out on
my first date, but I've gotta say

383
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,182
that is a rad move.

384
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:04,079
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

385
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,696
The patient is not too thrilled with me.

386
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:09,797
I'll get her consent.

387
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:14,805
Foreman's got a personality issue,
so you're gonna step in?

388
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,762
A patient doesn't like Foreman.

389
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:18,123
I'm interested.

390
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:27,022
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility
of damage to the lungs, infertility.

391
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,755
All possible side effects of radiation.

392
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,090
Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?

393
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,175
He thinks he's better than he is.

394
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:39,793
How good is he?

395
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,089
I don't know.

396
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,193
Can we get back to what's wrong with me?

397
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:46,581
There's a small possibility
of leukemia sometime in the future.

398
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,230
Hardly worth mentioning.

399
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,162
You can't say that he
thinks he's better than he is

400
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,863
if you don't know how good he is.

401
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:56,767
- No one's as good as he thinks he is.
- I am.

402
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:58,986
You might also get cataracts.

403
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,618
Sign here.

404
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,039
I don't know.

405
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,062
You're telling me how dangerous this is.

406
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,263
We're saving your life.

407
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:08,889
We're that good.

408
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:10,739
Sign there.

409
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,007
I can't decide.

410
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,562
Would you rather

411
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,485
a pencil or a pen?

412
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,957
Who's the better James Bond,
Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?

413
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,728
Now, see, that's not even a decision.

414
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,829
It's happening again.

415
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,170
I can't...

416
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,094
I can't...
I... can't...

417
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:02,491
Up her blood thinners
and get her down to radiology.

418
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,547
The attack will be over in 20 minutes.

419
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,326
Then she'll want to sign this.

420
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,156
Bonnie called last night
to talk about the dog.

421
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,374
Your name came up.

422
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:25,229
Good Lord, how do you still have teeth?

423
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,580
She's the worst Realtor in New Jersey.

424
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:29,961
What is this, escalation?

425
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:32,709
I go out with Cuddy,
you hook up with my ex?

426
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:35,029
I don't even know what
that's designed to do.

427
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,980
You're an addict.

428
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,453
I'm saving you from yourself.

429
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,713
By condo shopping?
Thank you.

430
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:43,374
If I can figure out
where you keep going wrong,

431
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,248
then I can nip this
Cuddy thing in the bud

432
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,599
before she becomes
the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.

433
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,070
Yes, I was worried there
was no way to stop that train.

434
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:52,862
You have to have sex with Cuddy.

435
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,333
Wait... to stop the train?

436
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,916
Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?

437
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,657
Yeah, she also said that if she'd
slept with you before she liked you,

438
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,639
then it would have made it easier
to handle when you turned into the sorry

439
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
bastard who left her alone.

440
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:21,422
I told her you were wasting her time,
by the way.

441
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,073
You think that's gonna stop her?

442
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,430
The woman's the worst
Realtor in New Jersey.

443
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:28,861
How do you feel?

444
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,946
Weak.
Sleeping a lot.

445
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,593
That's normal after radiation.

446
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:33,944
Deep breath.

447
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,074
A little queasy too.

448
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:41,441
When I feel sick to my stomach,
I always want vanilla ice cream.

449
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:42,824
It's soothing.

450
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:45,138
It's best to stick with liquids for now.

451
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,230
I'm getting a murmur.

452
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:53,005
Oh, my arm.
It's hurting me!

453
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:54,715
Take it off!

454
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,118
Pain is the issue.

455
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,665
Just the pressure of the BP
cuff was enough to start her screaming.

456
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,689
That's not cancer.

457
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,455
It sounds like...

458
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:19,482
Sounds like she's septic.

459
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:24,957
A lot of things can cause pain.

460
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:26,696
How much pain?

461
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,741
Too much.

462
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:33,768
It's not cancer.

463
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,329
It's not autoimmune.

464
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:39,113
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

465
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,736
But she had no fever, LP was clear.

466
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:45,717
Do an echo to confirm it's in the heart.

467
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:52,188
And then I'll tell our
patient that we just killed her.

468
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,369
I'll tell her.

469
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,967
You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

470
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,263
- I'm busy.
- Well...

471
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:14,543
But if you have half an hour
a little later this afternoon,

472
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:17,021
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

473
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,805
- It hasn't been on the market yet.
- I'm off the market for condos.

474
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,128
James was right?

475
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,117
I never had the teeniest
chance of selling you anything.

476
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:28,318
Of course he was right.

477
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:32,330
Wilson doesn't stop giving good
advice just 'cause you're divorced.

478
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,331
He's compulsive about remaing
on good terms with his exes.

479
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:44,712
Do you want to know
why I named that dog Hector?

480
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,105
No, let's keep it a mystery.

481
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:50,450
Because even when he was a puppy, he was
the worst-tempered dog we'd ever seen.

482
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:54,483
He was supposed to be house trained.
He'd pee on the carpet every morning.

483
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,725
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

484
00:24:58,017 --> 00:25:02,202
"Hector does go rug" is
an anagram for Dr. Greg House.

485
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,789
That's how early in
the marriage I resented you.

486
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,327
Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

487
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,520
James at least had the decency
to feel guilty when he hurt me.

488
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:11,963
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

489
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,511
I didn't even marry you, cleverly
hoping to avoid moments like this one.

490
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:18,477
You always needed him,
and he was always there for you!

491
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:20,591
If you keep yelling,
I think you'll owe me sex.

492
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:23,500
You knew he had a wife waiting
at home... you didn't care.

493
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:26,701
I'm not saying you broke up
the marriage, but you didn't help.

494
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,918
First, "Hector does
go rug" is a lame anagram.

495
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,764
You want a better one for Gregory House?

496
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:38,328
"Huge ego, sorry."

497
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,873
Second, find a new career.

498
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,194
You're never gonna sell anybody
if you let them control the agenda.

499
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:45,384
Third, I don't owe you anything...
I'm not Wilson.

500
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:48,235
I'm not gonna buy a condo
just to make you feel better.

501
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,170
- You okay?
- Yeah.

502
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,671
Tell me how to do this.

503
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:04,368
House says people thank you after...

504
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:05,435
It's not typical.

505
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:09,666
I already killed this woman.

506
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,237
All I can do now is
not make any more mistakes.

507
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:21,337
First of all,
stop thinking you can minimize the hurt.

508
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,324
A lot of people are
afraid of the word "dying."

509
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,199
If you pussyfoot around it,
she is not gonna read your mind.

510
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,790
- Okay.
- No, it's not.

511
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:33,297
When you look in her face, you're
gonna feel the instinct to temporize.

512
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,483
- Crush it.
- Yeah.

513
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:37,545
Then wait.

514
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,111
Give her time to process the news.

515
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,913
Let her know you'll be
with her through all of it.

516
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,423
Wait till she's done thinking,
till she meets your eyes again.

517
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,786
Then, if you feel it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

518
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,976
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

519
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:58,521
Let her know she's still
connected to another human being.

520
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,758
You've got this down to a science.

521
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:03,542
You're freaking out.

522
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,862
- I told you...
- Give her what she needs.

523
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:08,815
What she doesn't need is
a doctor who's not there with her

524
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:10,397
because he made the wrong call.

525
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,387
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

526
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,379
I won't let her see it.

527
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,170
Let her see it.

528
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,132
How come no mask?

529
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:34,994
We think...

530
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,810
you have an infection.

531
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,007
Didn't the radiation work?

532
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,742
It did what it was supposed to do.

533
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:48,975
You're dying.

534
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,259
What...

535
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,470
you mean, like,
things are bad, and someday I'm gonna...

536
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,335
How much time?

537
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:00,889
How much time?

538
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,401
- We can't know exactly.
- A year?

539
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,759
Less than a year?

540
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,673
Less than 24 hours.

541
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:11,226
I don't understand.

542
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,438
Why are you saying this to me?
You trying to scare me?

543
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,593
Why would you do that?

544
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:17,673
I'm sorry, it's true.

545
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:22,834
How bad is this cancer?
Yesterday you thought I had a chance.

546
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,438
You don't have cancer.

547
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,149
You came in with an infection.

548
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:31,757
- We didn't catch it.
- What kind of infection?

549
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:33,057
Doesn't matter.

550
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,191
The radiation was the
worst thing we could've done.

551
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:41,649
We destroyed the part of
your body that was fighting it off.

552
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:43,405
It spread to your heart.

553
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:44,919
Then give me drugs.

554
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,916
They have drugs for infections.

555
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:49,124
Antibiotics work with the immune system.

556
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:52,466
But your immune system is
nonexistent because of the radiation.

557
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:55,279
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

558
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:58,383
People have heart
transplants all the time.

559
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,408
It wouldn't help.

560
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,041
The infection is everywhere.

561
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,818
There's nothing anybody can do.

562
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:21,833
I'm so sorry.

563
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,697
We've called your grandparents.

564
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:33,700
Get the hell away from me!

565
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,302
Get out!

566
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:16,811
I think it's broken.

567
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,409
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

568
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,818
We were wrong too.
Steroids wouldn't have helped her.

569
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,534
I didn't not help her.
I actually pulled the trigger.

570
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,731
There's nothing left for you to do.

571
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:31,059
- One of us could go home with...
- You're trying to make me feel better.

572
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,028
Yeah.

573
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,145
I killed a woman.
Don't you think it's appropriate

574
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:36,609
that I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

575
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,055
It won't help her.

576
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:44,609
- Where is he?
- He went to the ICU.

577
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:51,832
What are you doing?

578
00:30:52,714 --> 00:30:54,114
Prepping for an aspiration.

579
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,906
We still don't know what infection...

580
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,177
- It's not gonna help her.
- It's not gonna hurt her.

581
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:00,367
- Well, it is, but it's not gonna...
- No.

582
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,077
It's just gonna take a few minutes.
Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus.

583
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:05,218
You really don't care.

584
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,267
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

585
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:09,392
- She's gonna be dead because...
- What?!

586
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,225
What did we screw up, what did we miss?

587
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:16,962
I need to know.

588
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:19,695
You'll have to wait.

589
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,938
We're moving her back to her room.

590
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:34,019
Patients who've had total
body radiation have to stay in ICU.

591
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,397
ICU isn't gonna help her.

592
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,436
Let's give her some privacy.

593
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:50,972
What do you want?

594
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,211
Want to see if I'm dying on schedule?

595
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,929
Or do you want me to tell you
it's all right... I'm okay with it?

596
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,325
I'd like your forgiveness.

597
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:05,067
I don't expect it.

598
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:11,831
Good, 'cause this isn't like you ran
your cart into mine at the supermarket.

599
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:13,604
No.

600
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,741
Your grandparents haven't arrived yet.

601
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,691
If they don't make it on time,

602
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:22,838
is there anything you
would like me to tell them?

603
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,139
I never really knew them.

604
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,601
You got any friends you want me to call?

605
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:31,618
It's the middle of the night.

606
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:36,091
They're not the kind of friends
you ask to help you move, never mind

607
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,260
watch you die.

608
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:41,821
I never did much.

609
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:44,895
No kid to leave behind.

610
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:50,076
When I go,
the world's not gonna be any different.

611
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,793
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

612
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,331
You were right...

613
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:38,234
about me.

614
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:40,206
Yeah, which time?

615
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:42,541
I, uh...

616
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:46,913
I had a problem with you.

617
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,961
But you were wrong too.

618
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:55,554
I've made some bad decisions.

619
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:58,474
Stole cars,

620
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,125
robbed houses.

621
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:01,933
Killed a woman.

622
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,617
But then I got another chance.

623
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:13,647
I left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

624
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:18,330
But some part of me I can't get rid of
always thinks

625
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:20,949
if I'm not the smartest,

626
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:23,085
if I'm not the first,

627
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,007
everywhere I go,

628
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:28,936
they'll figure out I'm
not supposed to be here.

629
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,119
They'll send me back.

630
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,163
You know that's not gonna happen.

631
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,609
You're out.

632
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:38,318
I'll never be out of there.

633
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:45,348
When I came home that last
Christmas I was in college,

634
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,491
it was like

635
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:49,242
the rooms

636
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,933
felt so small.

637
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,713
I was suffocating.

638
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:59,187
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying good-bye,

639
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,489
my mom put her arms around me.

640
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,570
That was...

641
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:11,428
that was the last
time I ever felt at home.

642
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,947
I only put distance...

643
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,850
between you and me because
I know there isn't any.

644
00:35:27,808 --> 00:35:29,331
You were right about me too.

645
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:37,392
That stuff about the system
being against people like me.

646
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:38,976
I know it's crap.

647
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:43,707
I mean, it's true, but it's also crap.

648
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:48,847
I just wasn't ready to try again.

649
00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:52,913
But I always thought I was young,

650
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:55,945
I had time.

651
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,262
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

652
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,206
No.

653
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:53,375
- Yeah?
- Time of death 3:35.

654
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,701
Do whatever you want.

655
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,046
You wanna go get drunk?

656
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,038
No, thanks.

657
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,889
I've got paperwork.

658
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:36,998
Listen, I don't...

659
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:38,989
I don't know what I believe,

660
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:43,413
but sometimes I need to think there's
something out there paying attention.

661
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:49,275
So when I can't talk to anybody, I talk
to God and pretend somebody's listening.

662
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,203
We were all wrong, you know?

663
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,790
Even House was wrong.

664
00:37:58,512 --> 00:37:59,462
I know.

665
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,936
I got your consent.

666
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,446
Her bra hook.

667
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:53,923
What?

668
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,744
She scratched herself with her bra hook.

669
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,621
That's how the infection got in.

670
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,496
Staph aureus.

671
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,914
She died from a simple staph infection?

672
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:19,670
That and some bad decisions.

673
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:28,874
I'll be outside.

674
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,185
Go home,

675
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,565
have a few drinks,
go to sleep, get up tomorrow,

676
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:50,576
and do it all over,

677
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:52,282
only better.

678
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,412
If you need absolution, go to a priest

679
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,126
or give alms to the poor.

680
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,537
Whatever ritual comforts you.

681
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,404
I killed her.

682
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:07,842
Yeah, me too.

683
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:12,438
This wasn't, "Oh, I should
have thought of that idea sooner."

684
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,238
This wasn't messing up a dosage.

685
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:18,456
We see a disease rushing
down on someone like a train,

686
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,961
we can't always get them out of the way.

687
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,650
This wasn't that.

688
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:26,811
No.

689
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,323
And you'll do it again.

690
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,307
For a lot of doctors,

691
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,688
this would be a once
in a lifetime mistake.

692
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:42,937
But we're not a lot of doctors.

693
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:47,181
We must've saved more patients
than the guy down the street.

694
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,934
A few of the ones that he'd save
by doing what everyone else does,

695
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,073
we will lose.

696
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,790
So you're giving me numbers.

697
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,536
'Cause they don't lie.

698
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,724
I can't forgive you, Foreman...

699
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,341
because there's nothing to forgive.

700
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,221
What did you tell him?

701
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,929
That guilt is irrelevant.

702
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,474
You want to get something to eat?

703
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:30,919
Can't.

704
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,791
Got a dog waiting at home.

705
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:48,383
What's wrong?

706
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:53,308
I did something bad, Mom.

707
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,244
I hurt somebody.

708
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,093
It wasn't your fault.

709
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:03,265
It was.

710
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,737
Then I forgive you.

711
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,203
I forgive you.

712
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,410
I can see from your face...

713
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,730
you'd never hurt anybody on purpose.

714
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,532
Do you know who I am, Mom?

715
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,470
It's Eric.

716
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:38,802
Of course.

717
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,397
My little boy's name is Eric.
