1
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,338
You're not gonna make this easy,
are you?

2
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,789
Unfortunately,
as much as I admire your spirit...

3
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:21,716
Ca ne change rien.

4
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:36,986
Subject anesthetized with
0.5 cc's of sodium pentobarbital.

5
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,361
Transfected with human
hepatic cancer cells,

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,992
underwent six rounds of
intra-abdominal treatment with ES-22.

7
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:51,446
Vertical incision
through the rectus sheath

8
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,734
opens the abdominal cavity.

9
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:57,886
Incision extended into the-thorax.

10
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:07,717
Liver appears normal in color.
No apparent scarring or...

11
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,082
Damn it!

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,330
Cancerous tumor still
present on the right lobe.

13
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,314
1.12 centimeters in diameter.

14
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:22,272
No reduction.

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Transcript: ydy.com - Synchro: jh26

16
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,490
71 years old,
cancer research specialist.

17
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,008
Minor tremors,

18
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:44,345
localized melanoma removed two years
ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe.

19
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,601
Also, disregard the facial lacerations.

20
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:49,406
They're creepy,
but unfortunately irrelevant.

21
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:51,938
Don't you want to know why?

22
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,968
You have your cane.

23
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,250
No, why the lacerations are creepy.

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,713
He was about to dissect one
of his lab rats when he collapsed.

25
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:02,564
The little vermin seized the day, so
to speak, and went medieval on his ass.

26
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,678
- What? My fly open?
- So the pain's returned.

27
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,181
There was no pain, he was unconscious.

28
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,166
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

29
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,167
- We're talking about you.
- Obviously. I'm obviously not.

30
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:18,369
What is it with you people?
I don't use the cane, you're shocked.

31
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,305
- I use the cane...
- We're just concerned.

32
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,412
About the wrong person. I can breathe.

33
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,604
Ezra Powell,
on the other hand, is gonna die.

34
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,317
- The Ezra Powell?
- Researcher?

35
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:29,490
- The guy who wrote that textbook?
- Not that textbook, the textbook.

36
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,795
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

37
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,533
I admire lots of doctors.

38
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,583
Of course, most of them look a lot
better in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

39
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,197
but seeing as they can all breathe...

40
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:42,408
Oxygenation is through the floor,
and lungs are full of fluid.

41
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,509
Gotta be his heart.
Could be amyloidosis.

42
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:48,341
Or his lungs, probably from years
of inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

43
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:52,092
- Not the lungs, chest x-ray's clean.
- So's his EKG, it's not his heart.

44
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,203
We're being too nice!

45
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,922
Outside the hospital, he can't breathe,
inside the hospital, he can.

46
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,140
Because we help. At least,
enough to screw with our test results.

47
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,041
Source of the problem's
either in his heart or his lungs.

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,568
So all we gotta do is stop helping.

49
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,172
Put a little pressure on him,
and see which gives out first.

50
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,764
At 71, we get his heart
or lungs to give out,

51
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,452
we might not get 'em to give in again.

52
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,372
That's why we're gonna
do it in a hospital.

53
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,073
Put him on an incline treadmill,
and do a stress EKG.

54
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,084
So much for the admiration.

55
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,617
Let's get you started.

56
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,967
I'll turn your oxygen up.

57
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:32,952
I-I worked with Williams on the

58
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,375
first protocol for this machine.

59
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,248
Everyone still uses it.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,577
Except for Williams.

61
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,422
He died four years ago.

62
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,180
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,045
He was 84.

64
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:45,534
He died parasailing.

65
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,059
He was always an idiot.

66
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:52,858
You okay?

67
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:56,738
Hang in there, you know
the protocol's only a few minutes.

68
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,720
His heart rate's flat.

69
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,085
We don't get it past 130,
we're not gonna see anything.

70
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,887
And if he falls and breaks a hip,
we're not gonna see anything either.

71
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,318
Except an increase in
our malpractice insurance.

72
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:12,248
I figured House might
go back to the pills, but

73
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:15,576
if he's using his cane,
he's right back to where he was before.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,550
Maybe even worse.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,550
Luckily, he'll handle it in a stoic,
grown-up fashion.

76
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,459
He'd never take it out on us.

77
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:27,997
I can't.

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,943
I've-- I gotta stop.

79
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:31,996
Just a little longer.

80
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:40,147
Heart rate's only 90,
I'm gonna increase the incline.

81
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:44,573
I gotta stop.

82
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,853
I-I've gotta get off.

83
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,493
You're doing great,
just a little faster, okay?

84
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,044
I--I don't need a cheerleader,

85
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:51,345
I need oxygen.

86
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,394
Stop. This isn't working.

87
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,393
His heart rate barely got above 90.

88
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:05,160
He can't breathe,
there's too much fluid in his lungs.

89
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:06,111
Really?

90
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,047
He's got fluid in his lungs?
Whatever are we gonna do?

91
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,174
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

92
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,977
Put him on a treadmill, and
run him like one of his rats on a wheel.

93
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,379
He can't run, he can hardly walk.

94
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,080
That's 'cause he's
not trying hard enough.

95
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,575
If he was, his heart rate would go up.

96
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:20,573
Exercising with a lungful of
your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.

97
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,557
They don't call it
a stress test for nothing.

98
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,213
- Do it again.
- He's drowning!

99
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,374
Then pull him out of the pool,
and do it again.

100
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,971
I'm assuming this isn't
your idea of a long-term solution.

101
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,609
We need to get rid of the fluid in your
lungs so you'll be able to do the test.

102
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,460
To see if it's my heart or my lungs.

103
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:42,725
Exactly.

104
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,111
My money's on both.

105
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:48,384
I've been in and out of
the hospital for the past year.

106
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,534
I'm old, I'm sick.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,590
I'm getting older, and sicker.

108
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,797
Not a very interesting
differential, but--

109
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm in.

110
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,113
You don't need a $400 handbag.

111
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:14,130
It's kinda hard to check your throat
when you're flapping your gums around.

112
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:15,081
Oh, sorry.

113
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,839
But it's for the fall formal.

114
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:20,834
He doesn't care if it's
for the presidential inauguration.

115
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:23,241
But I'm using Marissa's old dress.
It's free.

116
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:25,206
Yeah, you know what else is free?

117
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,670
Roof over your head, the food you eat,
your phone, your computer.

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,417
How long have you been congested?

119
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,447
A week, ever since
we got back from Fresno.

120
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:35,048
Fresno? That's in France, right?
See the Parthenon?

121
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,222
Uh, California.

122
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,905
I've got no appetite,
I'm aching all over, I'm weak.

123
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,804
- Does that hurt?
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,066
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

125
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,319
Totally.

126
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,890
I'm gonna take that giggle as a no.

127
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:55,737
Fever, aches,
weakness, loss of appetite.

128
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,002
Been having any anal
sex with IV drug users lately?

129
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:00,617
Of course not, I'm married.

130
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,659
- Do you think he might've been--
- No!

131
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,343
It's probably a rhinovirus.

132
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,709
What's that?

133
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,035
Cold.

134
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,453
Take this four times a day,

135
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,591
and stay off airplanes.

136
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,244
They're flying cesspools.

137
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,083
You dropped something.

138
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:25,596
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

139
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:29,952
Yes?

140
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,377
He's too old and weak.

141
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,832
Yeah, this is way, way better.
This'll work.

142
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:46,903
Please, just try.

143
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:49,113
There are 20 words to describe

144
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:50,998
chest pain.

145
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,063
Burning,

146
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,014
squeezing,

147
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,455
stabbing, tearing.

148
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:56,968
Each one diagnostically useful.

149
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,605
For that, you have to thank Dr.
Powell's textbook.

150
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:04,992
But there are no words to describe
degrees of what he's feeling right now--

151
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,157
shortness of breath.

152
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,097
If he had worked on those issues,
there would be.

153
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,571
'Cause he would never have
given up until he had an answer.

154
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:14,586
This isn't working.

155
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:19,988
Dr. House.

156
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,389
Please don't get up.

157
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,017
I'm sure you're very busy,

158
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,754
so I'm just gonna try
and speed things up a little.

159
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,207
Is that epi? That's not the protocol.

160
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:31,152
No, the protocol is what
you tried to do and failed...

161
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,599
each time.

162
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,602
Up over 100.
Now we're getting somewhere.

163
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,847
How's it look, Foreman?

164
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,910
No EKG changes.

165
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,086
- Then we push harder.
- House, you're gonna kill him.

166
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,037
No, he's right!

167
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,486
Let him do it.

168
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,748
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

169
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:52,699
He can't breathe.

170
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:58,498
130.

171
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,030
That's our magic number.

172
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,563
Nothing here. Foreman?

173
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:04,724
Still no sign of blockages.

174
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:07,858
Which means it's not the heart.

175
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,260
So it must be the lungs.

176
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,341
See? Wasn't so hard, was it?

177
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,870
No! Just give me the
rest of the epinephrine.

178
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,320
Test is over,
it's okay, we're gonna stabilize you.

179
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,271
No!

180
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,145
No, just let me die.

181
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:27,815
- You're not gonna die.
- Yes, I am.

182
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,456
We'll find a treatment.

183
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,663
I don't wanna live like this.

184
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:35,675
Please.

185
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,221
I'm begging you.

186
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,369
Kill me.

187
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,039
He says no more tests, he wants to
die and he wants us to help him do it.

188
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,535
And I want to play a little game I like
to call block my spike with misty may.

189
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,912
He's thought this through,
it's not an impulsive decision.

190
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:55,764
Neither is mine. He's depressed.

191
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:57,582
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

192
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,201
He's seen all the tests we've seen.

193
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:02,486
Even if we figure out what's causing the
lung damage, it's too late to reverse it.

194
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,527
You can't know that without
knowing what's wrong.

195
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,639
- It's his call.
- So, what do we do?

196
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:09,119
Put a plastic bag over
his head and get it over with?

197
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,477
No, we give him a
syringe full of morphine.

198
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,345
Every doctor I've ever
practiced with has done it.

199
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:19,117
They don't want to, they don't like to,
but that's the way it is.

200
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,076
I haven't, I won't.

201
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,091
I couldn't do it either.

202
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:24,154
You just said we should
respect his decision.

203
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:26,605
Respect it doesn't
necessarily mean we honor it.

204
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,577
Right. It just means we talk about it.

205
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,136
At some point, "do no harm" has to
mean allowing nature to take its course,

206
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,904
not stubbornly standing
in the way of it.

207
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:38,592
Sticking a metal syringe into a plastic
IV line and pumping in a lethal dose

208
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:41,143
of morphine is not letting
nature take its course.

209
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,940
Not according to
the state of New Jersey.

210
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,799
So it's better we allow him
to slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,857
Whose side are you on, senator?
First respect his wishes,

212
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,274
then invade Iraq, then get
the troops home... make up your mind.

213
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,942
Certainly a lot of interesting
things to consider.

214
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:58,086
Stress EKG rules out the heart.

215
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,440
Which means something's gotta
be attacking his lungs.

216
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:02,503
Mycoplasma or strep pneumo.

217
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:05,254
The problem is,
it's too late to do anything about it.

218
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:09,363
- We could try levofloxacin.
- Coming up with a new treatment

219
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:12,832
isn't gonna do us any good unless
we convince him it's worth trying.

220
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:13,788
Come on,

221
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:16,252
he's old, sick, tiny.

222
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,603
We can do whatever we want to him.

223
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,832
What happened?

224
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,191
I don't know.

225
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,503
He must've fallen out of
bed and got the nasal cannula

226
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,722
- wrapped around his neck somehow.
- Ezra, what are you doing?

227
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,459
I don't want to live hooked to machines.

228
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,769
Too we-- too weak to wipe my own ass.

229
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:46,152
Why would you want to wipe your own ass,
when you could have someone do it for you?

230
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:47,508
You're wasting your time.

231
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,046
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

232
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,446
No, all services rendered
on a first come, first served basis.

233
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,525
I won't consent to any more tests.

234
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,461
And if anyone tries
to so much as touch me,

235
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,179
I'll press charges for assault.

236
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,329
Okay, well, you heard the man.

237
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,230
He wants everyone to leave him alone.

238
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,660
Why don't you go first?

239
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:13,513
Get out!

240
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:23,806
You came to me.

241
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,379
I didn't come to you.

242
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:28,758
I figured you'd have the
guts to do what had to be done

243
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,421
if it came to that.

244
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,266
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

245
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,850
Breathe.

246
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,928
You're gonna have to exhale sometime.

247
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,046
- Stop!
- House, you're hurting him.

248
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,353
And you're hurting me.

249
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,790
Fine.

250
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,286
You don't want to help us,
we don't help you.

251
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,728
Your lungs slowly fill with fluid.

252
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,485
You gasp to catch every breath,
but never can.

253
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:04,054
Every breath is petrifying.

254
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,158
It'll be slow,

255
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:07,765
painful,

256
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,221
torturous.

257
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,669
We don't choose our birth.

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,340
And we don't choose our death.

259
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:18,914
What if you could?

260
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,265
How 'bout we make a deal?

261
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:23,887
You give me one more day.

262
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,161
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

263
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,778
I'll help you die.

264
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,336
House.

265
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:34,578
24 hours.

266
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:38,491
C'mon, it's not gonna kill you.

267
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,518
Old guy, lungs, fluid, go.

268
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,934
- You cannot help him kill himself.
- Of course I can,

269
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:53,380
Chase says we do it all the time.

270
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:55,391
- Cuddy's not gonna let you.
- Enough!

271
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:57,594
You don't want me to kill him, fine.

272
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,732
Here's a big shock.
I don't want to kill him either.

273
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,565
How do I not kill him?
By you guys doing your job.

274
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,882
We have 24 hours to figure
out what's wrong with him.

275
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,147
Tick-tock, tick-tock!

276
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,874
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria in his blood.

277
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,746
- That's gonna take longer than 24h.
- Not if I spin down the sample.

278
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,697
Separate off the buffy coat,
then gram stain for bacteria.

279
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:20,720
Great, do an amylase, d-dimer,
c-reactive peptide, get a urine,

280
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:23,210
and do a bronchial
sputum while you're at it.

281
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,696
You, check his home and
lab for radiation and toxins.

282
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:28,647
- And do a bone marrow biopsy.
- All of that in 24 hours?

283
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,988
Nah, whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

284
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:49,447
You guys look like crap.

285
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,541
- What do you got?
- Purple dye on my fingers.

286
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,147
- What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?
- Don't have the results.

287
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,157
What?
What have you been doing all night?

288
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,058
Jell-o shots and wild sex, what else?

289
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,125
There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

290
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:04,526
We still have some cooking,
but so far nothing.

291
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,573
Nothing in the urine.

292
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,874
The lab was clean enough to
do surgery in because, well, they do.

293
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,921
There was no sign of viruses
or fleas on any of the rats.

294
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,091
Yeah?

295
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,883
Who?

296
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,357
Well, tell her to call a clinic.

297
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,915
Then tell her to leave a message,
and I'll get back to her.

298
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,217
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

299
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,603
- Who's that?
- Your protégé?

300
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,271
What are these?

301
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:30,504
Dictation tapes, he records everything.

302
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:31,169
Why?

303
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,438
- Because he's a diligent researcher?
- Or he's losing his memory.

304
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,839
Lot of people dictate their notes.

305
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,415
Yes, we could assume that,
and we'd have nothing.

306
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,952
Or we could assume it's a symptom,
in which case,

307
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,253
whatever's in his lungs
is also in his brain.

308
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,655
Unless you got something more promising.

309
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:49,095
- I'll go get an MRI of his head.
- Keep testing until you find something.

310
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,296
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

311
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:57,093
It's been a long time
since I took an anatomy class,

312
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:01,432
but I'm pretty sure you're moving
farther and farther away from my lungs.

313
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,419
Running out of places to look,
aren't you?

314
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,481
Doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.

315
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,739
Mm, no, not for six more hours.

316
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,535
- You want us to fail?
- No.

317
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:12,906
But you will.

318
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,740
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia.

319
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:28,023
- He a drinker?
- Not according to the history.

320
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,358
Which means, yes, he drinks,

321
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,276
which gives us a nice, mundane
explanation for the acellularity.

322
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,363
Or he's telling the truth. Which
means fungus is still on the table.

323
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,014
But your entire view of
human nature gets destroyed.

324
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,300
Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

325
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,128
Bad news fast.
Good news, you can take your time.

326
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,892
Head's clean, you were wrong,
his faculties are intact.

327
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,843
Too bad.

328
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,730
If his brain was addled, we wouldn't
have to listen to anything he says.

329
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,091
Hand me the 10% KOH.

330
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:55,192
It's 4:00, we have nothing to tell him.

331
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:58,137
Then we have no reason to talk to him.
Still haven't ruled out fungus.

332
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,433
Yep, we have, no bugs, no hyphae.

333
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,625
Okay,

334
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:06,232
next procedure.

335
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,485
We sneak in,

336
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,921
turn back the clock.

337
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:15,687
Whole team.

338
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,863
- Must be bad news.
- Nope.

339
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,878
Bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

340
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,805
It's not good news,
but there are some treatments.

341
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:29,531
- We have to draw some blood.
- What about my breathing?

342
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:33,756
Associated hyperviscosity syndrome gummed
up the blood vessels in your lungs.

343
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:37,180
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.

344
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,384
Mm, we call him Dr. Idiot.

345
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,102
There's no M protein in my urine.

346
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:43,546
Odd presentation.

347
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:48,138
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't--
doesn't believe it either.

348
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,679
- Just give me 12 more hours.
- We had a deal. No more tests.

349
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,284
Fair enough.

350
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,099
Gimme six more hours.

351
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:05,566
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

352
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,155
You a man of your word or not?

353
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,258
No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.

354
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:10,322
Fine.

355
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:11,674
Then discharge me.

356
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,829
My lungs will slowly fill with fluid.

357
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:19,004
I'll gasp to catch every breath.

358
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:20,785
But never can.

359
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,101
Every breath will be petrifying.

360
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,424
It'll be slow,

361
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:25,593
painful,

362
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:26,552
torturous.

363
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,012
You're really gonna
let me die like that?

364
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:12,703
- Where you going?
- Nowhere!

365
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:33,635
Everybody who can walk
should get outta here.

366
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:37,305
- You can't do that.
- Can't do what?

367
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,291
Administer a prescription painkiller
to a patient who's in pain?

368
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:42,657
Go.

369
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:45,385
Make sure somebody sees
you downstairs in the cafeteria.

370
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,636
I can't let you do this.

371
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:51,015
Either I die in pain, or I just die.

372
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:52,502
That's

373
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:54,372
what the argument is here.

374
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,113
No, it's about whether you die,
or we murder you.

375
00:21:57,135 --> 00:22:00,997
What's gonna happen here is that someone
is getting a buttload of morphine.

376
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:03,693
I'm not sure exactly who at this point.

377
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,199
I can't be a part of this.

378
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:48,574
Thank you.

379
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,346
I always wondered

380
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:56,097
exactly what was on the other side.

381
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,533
Nothing.

382
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,265
What are you doing?

383
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,409
Getting a laryngoscope.

384
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,967
- Don't just stand there, help.
- But you told him--

385
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,568
It was something I like to call a lie.
Bad, I know.

386
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,998
But it's way further
down the list than murder.

387
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:58,278
Unconscious,

388
00:23:58,886 --> 00:23:59,956
no more whining.

389
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,629
Keep testing him.

390
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,030
Go get a ventilator.

391
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,369
I can't do this all night.

392
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:15,995
We can legally assume

393
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,350
that he'd consent to whatever a
reasonable person would consent to.

394
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:22,633
And a reasonable person
would obviously consent

395
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:26,405
to being put in a coma against their
will just to satisfy your curiosity.

396
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,590
I try to kill him, you're mad.

397
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:30,474
I don't kill him, you're mad.

398
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:33,429
- All he wanted was some dignity.
- Were you in that room with him?

399
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,480
Was he wearing a tux while
he was choking on his own plasma?

400
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,356
Keep doing the tests.
Take your time, do it right.

401
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:41,733
Go.

402
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:42,684
Get to work.

403
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:45,139
Wait!

404
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:52,938
Cameron, why'd you do these cuts
so far down on this MRI of his head?

405
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,899
I wanted to get his
brain stem and his c-spine,

406
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,754
make sure his diaphragm
wasn't paralyzed.

407
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:59,555
You also caught the top of his lungs.
There's scarring.

408
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,625
You do know that you can't
really pierce me with your stares?

409
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:09,008
Lung scarring, along with the bad bone
marrow, points to an autoimmune disease.

410
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,209
- Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
- Or lupus.

411
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:13,310
He can kill himself
after we get him better.

412
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,255
Start him on an IVIG for the lupus,
and get a colonoscopy.

413
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:17,706
Lupus could be hiding there.

414
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:26,108
I can't do this.

415
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:31,467
Drama queen.

416
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:34,529
Descending colon's clean.

417
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,590
Moving into the sigmoid.

418
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:41,714
Sure could use a little
more help around here.

419
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,442
She's doing what she believes in.

420
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:47,143
Yeah, if she was acting on principle,
she'd be in here trying to stop us.

421
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,925
All she's doing is running away
from the principle so she won't have

422
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:52,889
- to feel uncomfortable facing it.
- And if you were acting on principle,

423
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,167
you would've called the cops when
you thought House was killing the guy.

424
00:25:56,328 --> 00:25:57,500
You better hurry up.

425
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:58,854
Why?

426
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,758
I don't think she's gonna have
a problem deciding what to tell Cuddy.

427
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,170
O² sats 89 and dropping.

428
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,514
I thought you were only supposed
to put on a pound a week during

429
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,693
- your last trimester.
- I'm not pregnant.

430
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:21,792
I heard about your little
stunt with Dr. Powell.

431
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,444
Not really a stunt.
More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.

432
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:26,754
- A lie.
- Okay.

433
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:29,195
Lying is sometimes good, right?

434
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,296
Like when you're trying to teach someone
a lesson about humility or something.

435
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:34,831
All I'm trying to do is save his life.

436
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:37,905
He's not gonna learn anything. I just
thought the same principle might apply.

437
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:38,864
It does.

438
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:41,157
I could've just let him die.

439
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:43,344
Not gonna get sued
for keeping him alive.

440
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:44,295
Well, we could.

441
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:46,548
We completely disregarded his wishes.

442
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,647
Do you want me to disagree with you?

443
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,847
- Want me to yell at you?
- It is comforting.

444
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:53,591
We're doctors.
We treat patients, we don't kill them.

445
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,006
How right you are, Dr. Cuddy!

446
00:26:57,007 --> 00:27:00,107
We also don't pad our bills,
swipe samples from the pharmacy,

447
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:03,149
or fantasize about the teenage
daughters of our patients either.

448
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,838
True, better be true, and you're a pig.

449
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,968
I'm sorry about your leg.

450
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:13,828
Yeah, we really should spend
some time talking about that.

451
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:17,228
The IVIG made him worse.
O² sats plummeted.

452
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,195
So we know it's not lupus.

453
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:22,265
What else could it be?

454
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,003
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

455
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:26,824
Gonna need an open
lung biopsy to confirm.

456
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:30,621
So now we're gonna operate on the guy?

457
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:34,056
Unless you've invented a new
way of doing an open lung biopsy.

458
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:40,214
When you searched Dr. Powell's office,

459
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,055
did you find a copy of the january
1967 Massachusetts medical journal?

460
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:45,238
Why?

461
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,539
I just figured,
if you're not doing any work,

462
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:49,877
you might like something
to pass the time.

463
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,182
Centerfold's a killer.

464
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,489
How's your leg?

465
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:08,657
It hurts.

466
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:11,289
It's gonna keep on hurting.
You're gonna keep on asking?

467
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,240
How's Ezra Powell?

468
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:15,596
Resting comfortably.

469
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,018
Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.

470
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,480
I hate practicing
medicine in high school.

471
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:24,131
He's not asking you to help him
kill himself. He's just asking for help.

472
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:27,261
- The disease will kill him.
- I know what he was asking for.

473
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:29,447
- I just said no.
- You've done it before.

474
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:30,398
Plenty of times.

475
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,558
To patients that I knew were terminal.

476
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:35,455
Oh, give me a break. This
has nothing to do with saving a life.

477
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,606
You just can't bear the
thought of a patient dying

478
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,526
before you've been
able to figure out why.

479
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:42,633
If we're gonna keep refusing
to cure patients just to rein in my ego,

480
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,476
then we might start to have a
little problem with patient recruitment.

481
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,127
Worried about meeting
your one patient a week quota?

482
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:50,302
I'm a cripple, remember?

483
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:52,589
Accommodations must be made.

484
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:03,824
Wedge of left lobe isolated

485
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:05,688
and removed.

486
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:08,919
Clamp.

487
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,590
Why'd you have me look up that article?

488
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:15,918
Didn't you find it interesting?

489
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,903
He injected newborn babies
with radioactive agents just to see

490
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,302
- if they hadurethral reflux.
- He was curious.

491
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,788
He didn't even tell their
parents he was doing an experiment.

492
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:25,894
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

493
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,855
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?

494
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,360
He ignored the rights
of a few to save many.

495
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:32,672
So you're okay with what he did.

496
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:34,174
Doesn't matter what I think.

497
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,558
It's what you think that's relevant.

498
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:40,762
Because if I think less of him,
I'll help you more?

499
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:44,682
You're wrong.

500
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:48,617
The fact that a patient did
bad things doesn't change anything.

501
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:51,518
He still deserves to have
some control over his own body.

502
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:53,992
If he had control of his own body,
he'd be dead.

503
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,303
Some control. We can withhold
treatment without killing him.

504
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,688
No, you can't!

505
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:03,488
You either help him live, or you help
him die. You can't have it both ways.

506
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,021
I guess it's not IPF.

507
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:16,924
Or maybe he'll die right now,
and make everything easy for all of us.

508
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,659
- Heart rate's fast.
- BP's low.

509
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,770
No breath sounds on the right side.
He's dropped his right lung.

510
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:32,521
Air's building up in his chest,
compressing his heart.

511
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,886
- Heart rate's decreasing.
- BP's stabilizing.

512
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,659
What are you doing?

513
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,779
Withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side, but not the right.

514
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,599
Those are just reflex arcs.
He's under anesthesia.

515
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:25,384
Or he's lost sensation in some places.

516
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,143
Or the hypoxia from
the arrest stunned his CNS.

517
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,182
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

518
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,133
We can't do that while he's in a coma.

519
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:37,413
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer
and check his deep tendon reflexes.

520
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:40,564
Won't work. He needs muscle
relaxants to be on the ventilator.

521
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:43,316
Only one more way to tell.
Pupillary reflexes.

522
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:45,027
All that tests is the brainstem.

523
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,812
See, I was right. Only one way to tell.

524
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,613
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

525
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,883
I just said we can't
do that while he's in a coma.

526
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:51,834
So wake him up.

527
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,061
Don't go towards the light.

528
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,795
You'll fall and break your hip.

529
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:36,934
What's happening?

530
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,148
You took a little nap.

531
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,027
I know

532
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,149
I told you I didn't want--

533
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:49,229
Sorry, a little deaf in one ear.

534
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:51,867
Your bone marrow was hypocellular.

535
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,116
Ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis.

536
00:32:55,572 --> 00:32:58,222
But it looks like it could
be attacking your nerves.

537
00:32:58,762 --> 00:32:59,962
So this is all a waste.

538
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:02,361
Huge failure.

539
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:05,344
Impossible.

540
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,488
You're Gregory House.

541
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,410
We need to attach some
sensors to your skin.

542
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:13,207
- No.
- Look, we can't do what you want.

543
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:16,260
We've assigned a nurse to
watch you so you can't do it either.

544
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,065
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

545
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:21,382
- No, I want to be discharged.
- You can't be discharged.

546
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:24,142
- You've got two chest tubes in.
- Then take them out.

547
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:27,637
Oh, get over yourself.
The ventilator puffed up your lungs.

548
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,636
You'll be fine for a few hours.
Just let us run the tests.

549
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,617
Okay.

550
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:38,348
But first, let's clean you up a little.

551
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,697
Does that feel nice?

552
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:46,054
- What are you trying to prove?
- Just cleaning him up.

553
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,255
What does it look like?

554
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,462
Pay no attention to
the man behind the curtain.

555
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:56,011
Get out!

556
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:58,316
Okay, I'm going already.

557
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:00,732
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

558
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,802
- Okay, so you got me curious.
- I was right.

559
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,745
Whatever is attacking his
lungs is attacking his nerves.

560
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,499
You got that by splashing
ice water on him?

561
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,506
No sensation in the left leg, abdomen,
right arm. Technology's overrated.

562
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,360
That means the clean MRI of
his brain means it's just affecting

563
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:19,237
- the peripheral nerves.
- And bone marrow.

564
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:21,041
Kawasaki's would explain
the kidney failure.

565
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,945
- Or lymphoma.
- Or sarcoidosis.

566
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,461
All potentially treatable.
Question is which.

567
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,731
We need to catch the
little bastards in the act.

568
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:31,276
- What's the largest organ?
- Skin.

569
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:32,618
We need to get a piece.

570
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:34,632
Sure, we'll just

571
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,498
wait until he leaves his room without
his skin, sneak in, and take a piece.

572
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:42,005
I want you to get a
skin sample for a biopsy.

573
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,868
And I want to get a foot
massage from Johnny Damon.

574
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,886
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis are all treatable.

575
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:52,659
And it could be 100 other things
that aren't treatable. You've no idea.

576
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,610
But you do.

577
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:55,229
You know everything.

578
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,140
- I didn't say that I--
- Exactly!

579
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,637
You can't decide if we're
helping or hurting him.

580
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:01,894
If he's good or bad.

581
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:04,979
Or if you want paper,
plastic, or a burlap sack.

582
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:08,321
Do your damn job.

583
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:12,646
I'm not gonna lie to him.

584
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,576
Fine, tell the truth.

585
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,013
Just get me a pound of flesh.

586
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,429
What do you want?

587
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,389
House wants to biopsy your skin.
He sent me to get it.

588
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,831
Ah, and you agreed.

589
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:38,846
I had nothing to do with putting you in
a coma, or any of the subsequent tests.

590
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,047
Which brings us to now.

591
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,144
I read some of your articles.

592
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:44,195
There were a lot of them.

593
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:49,117
1967 Massachusetts medical journal.

594
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:54,226
You radiated babies, just like that.
No forms, no questions, nothing.

595
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:56,815
Who knows how many cancers you caused?

596
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:58,543
I don't know.

597
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,826
What I do know is we
discovered techniques that

598
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:06,010
prevent fatal kidney failures
in hundreds of thousands of other kids.

599
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,485
- You're not sorry.
- I don't regret what I did.

600
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:11,489
Informed consent,

601
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:12,765
patient rights

602
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:14,579
holds back research.

603
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,921
What the hell are you doing?

604
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,479
Informed consent is
holding back our diagnosis.

605
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:26,958
Good for you.

606
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,756
Finally standing up for something.

607
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,580
Acting on what you believe.

608
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,490
Dr. House?

609
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:42,244
How are you?

610
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:46,093
- Not as good as you think I am.
- Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.

611
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:49,067
My dad just lost his medicine. He had
to come back for another prescription.

612
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:50,018
Yeah, right.

613
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:52,363
He's moving it on the street, isn't he?

614
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,172
Yeah, my dad, the meth kingpin.

615
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:59,641
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

616
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:02,747
I plan to.

617
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:04,582
In a couple of years.

618
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,847
I was just calling to say thank you,

619
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:11,375
and to tell you how impressed I was. You
diagnosed my dad by just looking at him.

620
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,608
Felt his glands too.

621
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,178
Oh, there's my dad. I gotta go.

622
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,377
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, and

623
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:24,063
you really don't have to wait
a couple years to return my calls.

624
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,014
Just six months.

625
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,430
Till I turn 18.

626
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:40,335
It's not Kawasaki's either. What's next?

627
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:43,250
- Congo red.
- Amyloidosis?

628
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:45,743
What the hell else
would I mean by Congo red?

629
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:46,711
It's not on the list.

630
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,447
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

631
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:51,566
An abnormal protein is building
up inside the cells of his body,

632
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:54,101
shutting down his organs, one by one.
Explains everything,

633
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:56,805
the infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow, kidney failure.

634
00:37:56,806 --> 00:38:00,140
We rejected amyloidosis because it
didn't fit the first symptom we found.

635
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,692
- It would affect his heart.
- It did.

636
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:04,797
- It wasn't on the stress test.
- We didn't push him hard enough.

637
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,348
Add the stain, let's find out.

638
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,821
Congo red added.

639
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,480
Change the polarization
of the light already.

640
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,506
That means it should be treatable.

641
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,668
- How the hell did you pull that out of
- Not out of mine.

642
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:27,865
I had a muse.

643
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:31,752
Oh, god.

644
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:34,903
Protein type AA.

645
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:55,596
- Dr. House--
- You have amyloidosis.

646
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,831
It's in your lungs,
kidneys, bone marrow, and brain.

647
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,007
Why should I believe you now?

648
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:10,191
If I was lying,

649
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,824
I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA.

650
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:15,943
It's terminal.

651
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:19,944
Congratulations.

652
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,163
You got your answer.

653
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:44,923
Fresno by night.

654
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:50,320
Six months and counting.

655
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:00,393
Ezra Powell passed away last night.

656
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,956
But I'm sure you
already knew about that.

657
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:04,967
Nope. I just got in.

658
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:09,456
The nurse charted at 2:00 AM he was
stable. Breathing labored, but regular.

659
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,509
Then at 2:30, he suddenly stopped.

660
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,307
You know anything about that?

661
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:14,291
If I did,

662
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,437
would you really want to know?

663
00:42:30,285 --> 00:42:31,309
I'm proud of you.
