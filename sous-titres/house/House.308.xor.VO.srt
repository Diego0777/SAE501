1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,750
Now I'm gonna kill you!

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,063
Uh, I need a refill.

3
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,666
- You've already had three.
- So what? They're free.

4
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,417
I got a birthday. Get it yourself.

5
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,441
No wonder he doesn't get any tips.

6
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:22,774
All right...

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,366
who's ready to sing the Ralphy's
rump us birthday rump shake?

8
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:37,999
let's sing, let's ride let's bling,
let's slide it's time for Ralphy

9
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:44,784
we'll dance, eat cake and do
the rump shake it's time for Ralphy

10
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:45,868
Are you okay, man?

11
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:53,851
You okay?

12
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:03,176
It's time for Ralphy--

13
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:10,951
Okay, all right.
Let's get you in the back. Come on.

14
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:12,602
It's gonna be okay, kids. Sorry!

15
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,044
Got a heartbeat.

16
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,492
Jack? Jack?

17
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,533
- I need you to step back.
- He's my brother.

18
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,614
Jack! Wake up!

19
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:30,419
Call your parents, tell them
to go to Princeton Plainsboro hospital.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,469
Our parents died.

21
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:33,683
He's all we've got.

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,150

23
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:12,022
I was not parked illegally.
I-I live here.

24
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,717
Love note from detective Tritter.

25
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:20,234
Heart attack.

26
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,733
His cath was clean and echo
showed no structural abnormalities.

27
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:26,745
Fatigue, night sweats,
weight loss preceded the heart attack.

28
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,675
18-year-old kid, suddenly
an orphan and a single father of two.

29
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,586
Party of five! Powerful stuff.

30
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,401
The O.C. of its day.

31
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:37,569
Stress explains everything
except the itchy feet.

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,482
Athlete's foot covers that.

33
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:41,518
Waiters work 12 hours
a day in old sneakers.

34
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,896
Hmm, good idea.

35
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,159
Ignore the symptoms. Makes our job easy.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm not ignoring a symptom.
I'm explaining a symptom.

37
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,941
kid's been hanging over a toilet,
despite antiemetic therapy.

38
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,565
Persistent vomiting could indicate
increased intracranial pressure, tumor--

39
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,916
Sure. Heart problems.
It's gotta be the brain.

40
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,365
Thank god there's a
neurologist in the room.

41
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,468
Right. It's the feet.
If only I were a podiatrist.

42
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:05,515
Probably caught an intestinal
virus from one of those feral kids

43
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,595
running around. Repeated vomiting
causes an electrolyte imbalance,

44
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,651
which leads to an arrhythmia,
which leads to the heart attack.

45
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:12,812
And itchy feet.

46
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:14,385
Nope.

47
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,617
That's it? Nope?

48
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,705
- I've said too much already.
- This isn't a game, House.

49
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:21,284
No, it's not. But it could be.

50
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,746
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

51
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,978
- If you know the diagnosis, why don't--
- How are you gonna learn to swim

52
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,513
unless I take off your floaties and
throw you into shark-infested waters?

53
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,201
You can’t know what's wrong
after a 30-second perusal of his file.

54
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,400
Apparently you can’t.

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,300
Now, what's a game without rules?

56
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,327
No, tag-backs, no biting.
You get one test each.

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,080
And the clock runs until lunch.

58
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:47,816
If I'm right, he'll still be alive.
If I'm wrong, this is a very cruel game.

59
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,037
You're late. I charge for the
time you were supposed to be here.

60
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:55,798
Tritter towed my car. He's
frozen my assets. He's on a crusade.

61
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,033
You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

62
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,050
You're linked to their
suspect and his activities.

63
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:05,001
I'm not Pablo Escobar’s evil henchman
cruising into Miami in a cigarette boat.

64
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,418
I'm a physician who prescribed
vicodin to a pain patient.

65
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,113
This police report you faxed me says
they found 600 pills in his apartment.

66
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,563
- You prescribed those?
- He's in chronic pain.

67
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,265
- This is obviously an abuse of power.
- Is that a yes or no?

68
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,618
Patients build up a
tolerance over the years.

69
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,038
Perfect motive for
him to forge those scrips.

70
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:22,807
- I still don't have an answer.
- What, are we, like, role playing?

71
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,367
Yeah. And you suck at it.

72
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,688
Which is really unfortunate, because

73
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,258
you’re pretending to be you.

74
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,676
I gotta get to court.

75
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:32,006
Michael told me you could
help me get my car back.

76
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:35,243
Yeah, divorce lawyers usually know
the ins and outs of drug enforcement.

77
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:38,234
You want your car back, you're gonna
have to give the cops what they want.

78
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:41,411
Thanks. Usually people feel
helpless in these situations.

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,130
Dr. House is probably going to jail.

80
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,667
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along with him.

81
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,588
House was on this page when he got
that annoying” I’m such a genius" look.

82
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,195
- What's there?
- Patient history.

83
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,732
He's 18. Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

84
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,547
How close am I?

85
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,700
Quit drugs when his parents died.
Quit smoking.

86
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:07,403
House didn't mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

87
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,776
Which means he didn't want
to give reasons. Which means,

88
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,977
I must have been close.

89
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,531
I'm thinking bacterial.

90
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,524
I'm doing a blood culture.

91
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,836
- I am doing an MRI.
- It there was a tumor,

92
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:22,700
intracranial pressure could cause
his brain to herniate before lunch.

93
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:25,682
- Same thing with your stress test.
- Which is why I’m ditching it.

94
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,983
- What are you doing instead?
- Not telling.

95
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,654
Seriously--you playing his game?

96
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:32,515
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

97
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:34,873
Anybody else sick at work?

98
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,074
I had a stomach ache before him.

99
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:40,528
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

100
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,254
My brother's in the hospital.

101
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,943
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

102
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,699
Your brother cares if
you finish your homework.

103
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,531
Can I be your imaginary friend?

104
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,840
He's a doctor.

105
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,697
How are the feet? Still itch?

106
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:10,043
Is that important?

107
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:11,371
I don't know.

108
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:12,676
Is it?

109
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,847
What kinds of drugs you into?

110
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,626
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

111
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,834
No, it's okay.
I don't keep secrets from them.

112
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,153
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

113
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,104
Clever.

114
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,425
Admit the past. Deny the present.

115
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,729
I'm clean. I'm raising two kids. It'd
be pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?

116
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,202
But confiding in an
eight-year-old is okay?

117
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,816
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

118
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:36,767
Yeah.

119
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,712
Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

120
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,574
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

121
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,614
They lie because they
got something to hide.

122
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,565
Look at him,

123
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,205
sitting there doing nothing,
and he's still lying.

124
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,306
We don't lie to Jack.

125
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,482
- Spelling test you failed and forgot
- No.

126
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,433
- Math test?
- No.

127
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,967
Fight with the kid sitting next to you?

128
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,226
He doesn't sit next to me.

129
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,138
- The other one's probably having sex.
- I am not!

130
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,539
Yet. When you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

131
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,676
- Colder.
- I'm not playing.

132
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,449
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

133
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,125
How much dope did you smoke?

134
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,191
- Does he have to be here?
- No. Ignore him.

135
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,682
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

136
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,096
What about the cigarettes?

137
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,595
How did you quit? Gum, patch, hypnosis?

138
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,243
He went from two packs to nothing,
cold turkey.

139
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,117
Or we could just make small talk.

140
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,375
You still seeing that nurse in pedes?
I just don't think she's right for you.

141
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,376
You need someone...

142
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,558
detached, calculating, ambitious.

143
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,755
You need yourself in a skirt.

144
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,125
Jack, he asked you a question.

145
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,667
I didn't really quit.

146
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,435
I just sort of lost taste for it.

147
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:00,084
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

148
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:03,790
He's still puking, and he
had a heart attack and itchy feet.

149
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,117
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

150
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:12,938
Ice cold.

151
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,912
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

152
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,963
was caused by a spasm in
the vessels surrounding your heart.

153
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,283
Let me know if anything feels...

154
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,078
unusual.

155
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,512
If the problem's around my heart, why
did that other doctor look at my brain?

156
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,063
Yeah, why did that other
doctor look at his brain?

157
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,230
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities as we can.

158
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:42,007
So because you think the spasm

159
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,429
caused his heart attack,
you're gonna induce another spasm.

160
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,959
Did you consent to this?

161
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,139
Everything's under control.

162
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,836
Tests are gonna identify which arteries
are affected so we can repair them.

163
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:56,187
Your meds don't seem to be
doing anything. So either you're wrong,

164
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:00,058
or his system hasn’t been
pushed enough to set anything off.

165
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,175
You wanna get back home, right?

166
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:14,070
I mean, you're probably already falling
behind with the housework, the bills.

167
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,471
How many sick days do you think
you'll get before they replace you?

168
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,790
Heart rate's up, but nothing else.

169
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,136
They can't fire me if I'm sick.

170
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,718
Right, you’re irreplaceable.

171
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,052
Who else would they find
qualified to dance with a rodent?

172
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:31,634
How can you even support your family?

173
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:35,427
What happens when those kids grow out
of their clothes, when they get sick?

174
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:36,435
Still no spasm.

175
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,393
They'll take those
kids away from you, Jack.

176
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:43,394
Maybe I should bring them in here right
now so that you can kiss them good-bye.

177
00:09:43,755 --> 00:09:45,455
Can't you see his heart is fine?!

178
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:48,539
Stop torturing him!
What kind of doctor are you?

179
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,641
Wonderful, thank you so much. Okay, bye.

180
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,783
- You're just getting here?
- Buses suck.

181
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,734
- Where's your car?
- It's a hostage.

182
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:02,046
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

183
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,316
- You're not going to.
- Is that a question or an order?

184
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,400
Any sort of conviction
will cost House his license.

185
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,710
Which will cost this hospital.

186
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,932
Relax, I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

187
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,309
I told my lawyer to
tell Tritter to go to hell.

188
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,260
Marco!

189
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,213
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

190
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:21,205
Sorry, Dr.
Wilson. I was trying to call you.

191
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:22,859
- Where's your phone?
- In my car.

192
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,828
My patients, on the other hand,
are here and needed their medications.

193
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:28,884
I'm sorry, I can’t.
Your DEA number’s been suspended.

194
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,109
Why so sad?

195
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:37,406
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

196
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:40,828
Oh! That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

197
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,062
Blood culture was negative for bacteria.

198
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,571
Positive for hepatitis A?

199
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,619
Hmm, I wonder who could
have ordered that extra test.

200
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:52,892
Must be somebody who
knew what persistent vomiting,

201
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:55,274
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

202
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,858
Hep A doesn’t explain the heart attack.

203
00:10:56,859 --> 00:11:00,339
No, but as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier, puking does.

204
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,249
And hep A explains the puking.

205
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,162
If this had been real
life instead of just a game...

206
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,310
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

207
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,364
Who's gonna prescribe my vicodin?

208
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,565
Yes, well, that’s why I'm here.
This is a disaster for you.

209
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:20,261
Relax. Tritter's just getting desperate.

210
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,941
He's got no real evidence.
He's trying to squeeze you into ratting.

211
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:25,092
I'm not gonna let
him squeeze my patients.

212
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,164
They'll be fine.

213
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,668
Most of your cancer
medicine sucks anyway.

214
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing

215
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,034
till this is straightened out.

216
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,119
Suddenly this doesn't
seem nearly as dramatic.

217
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,315
Go pump IVIG into the kid.
Cure him and get him out of here.

218
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:44,645
Hep A?

219
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:46,748
No.

220
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,903
"Chase,” blood test for bacteria.

221
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:53,263
"Foreman, M.R.I." too stubborn to check
the lungs. Cameron, nice try. No spasm".

222
00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:00,404
"But the princess sat and sat and sat".

223
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,410
Pretending not to listen,

224
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:09,537
pretending to write in her
journal with the flowers on it.

225
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,864
Pretending she didn't like stories about
eight-year-olds who save the world.

226
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:15,786
I'm 11.

227
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,642
Which is why you can
no longer save the world.

228
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:19,377
- I'm eight.
- Yeah.

229
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,087
We're all completely dependent on you.

230
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,238
- Mornin'!
- Mornin'.

231
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,391
Good news.

232
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,259
We can take you off the IVIG.

233
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,130
The hep A has cleared your system.
You'll be good to go by tomorrow.

234
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,292
How do you think I got it?

235
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,876
It could have been contaminated food.

236
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:37,023
It could have been from
cleaning bathrooms at work.

237
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,244
Or it could have been...

238
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,290
Don't worry. They've heard it all.

239
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,203
Anilingus is a common way.

240
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,940
You should just tell
the people that you've dated

241
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:48,741
they should get themselves checked.

242
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,117
Don't worry, I've been too busy chasing
after these guys to go spelunking.

243
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,068
You're gross.

244
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,139
I think.

245
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,201
- Does your arm hurt?
- Arm's fine, bro.

246
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:01,852
- Then why is it bleeding?
- It's not, it’s...

247
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,116
Raise your arm above your head.

248
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,192
Your ear.

249
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:11,133
And your nose.

250
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:22,505
High PT and PTT on Jack's
blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.

251
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:24,196
So...

252
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,710
we cure the hep A...

253
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:29,357
and something else pops up. Interesting.

254
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,991
What infections cause DIC?

255
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:35,923
You okay?

256
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,415
I hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

257
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,269
Shall we discuss what causes DIC,

258
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:44,215
or shall we just send the
kid back to his miserable life?

259
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,816
- He's not miserable.
- Right.

260
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,540
He's thrilled that his parents
are dead and his life is over.

261
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,716
The restaurant's probably teeming
with e.coli, eikenella, and strep.

262
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:54,371
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty and the party, and--

263
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,980
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool every day.

264
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:58,565
Jack's the only one who got sick.

265
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:00,528
Kid's got tattoos, piercings,

266
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,329
and probably some nasty
little girl loaned him the hep A.

267
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,438
Could have also given
him syphilis or gonorrhea.

268
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,318
- I need one of you.
- Take Cameron.

269
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:08,719
Your idea was dumb, anyway.

270
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:13,325
Chase, I need you to head back to
that cesspool and get me the kid's puke.

271
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:17,453
Foreman, do an LP, and have Cameron
run down that potty/party theory.

272
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,140
Why don't I just test him?

273
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:23,031
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

274
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,532
The amount of vomiting that kid did,

275
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,634
wouldn't be enough toxins left
in this system to show up in his blood.

276
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:37,144
Since he vomited into the
toilet here instead of on somebody,

277
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,895
that restaurant is our
only source of essential vomit.

278
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,979
And you couldn't say
that in front of Foreman?

279
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,296
No, I couldn't say
this in front of Foreman.

280
00:14:45,723 --> 00:14:46,673
I need a refill.

281
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:49,666
Detective Tritter knows
about the scrips I wrote before.

282
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,117
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

283
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,379
- Does anyone fall for that argument?
- Write the scrip.

284
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,716
No.

285
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:00,358
One prescription isn't gonna make you--

286
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,257
we both know it’s not gonna be just one.

287
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,687
I'd rather lose my
job than lose my license.

288
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:18,859
Daniel Silvers, prostate cancer,
needs filgrastim, two-week supply.

289
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:24,292
Andrea Donavan, breast cancer,
just needs her refill of her megestrol.

290
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,483
- You're not writing.
- You want me to write?

291
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:29,768
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually,

292
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,862
yeah, probably somebody's
gonna want something written down.

293
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,450
- I haven't met these people.
- I have.

294
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,753
- I've diagnosed them and everything.
- I know.

295
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,070
I know, I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

296
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,303
Just my diagnosis.

297
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,350
These are gonna be my prescriptions, I--

298
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,135
They're my patients! My prescriptions.

299
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,086
My name!

300
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:52,304
That Tritter will read on the scrip.

301
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,185
He wants to make you miserable. You
don't think he’s gonna ask questions?

302
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:02,955
Is there anything Jack does that
no one else does? Any special duties?

303
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,379
No, we got lots of bussers.

304
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,571
What kind of cleaning
products do you use?

305
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,594
We got a bunch of kids running around
sticking everything in their mouths.

306
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,123
So we can't use anything toxic.

307
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:15,705
That's it.

308
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:16,754
Monday's trash.

309
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:26,252
So there's no one who can maybe...
help get the bags out?

310
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,489
Sorry, short-handed.

311
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,551
I can tip.

312
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:34,079
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke is in a blue
trash bag with the wrapped gifts. But

313
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:36,438
if you find spaghetti,
that's the wrong vomit.

314
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,930
How much longer do I have
to stay on this medication?

315
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,748
I mean, I'm nauseous all the time.

316
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,647
Maybe I should go back on the tamoxifen.

317
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,437
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

318
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:58,838
- I'm reluctant to make a change.
- I can't play with my daughter.

319
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,769
Or pick her up from school. I can
barely get up and tuck her in at night.

320
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,470
There's got to be something else.

321
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,448
Who is she?

322
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:09,355
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

323
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,720
She's a student?

324
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:13,537
No, I'm a doctor.
I'm assisting Dr. Wilson today.

325
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,968
Why, do you think he
got my diagnosis wrong?

326
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,376
- No, I'm sure--
- No, no.

327
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,111
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

328
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:22,968
You think he got my meds wrong?

329
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,664
- No, it's just--
- No.

330
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:26,199
Then why is she here?

331
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,887
What are you doing now?

332
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:37,581
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's spinal fluid.

333
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,373
- Where's Will?
- School.

334
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:43,535
Is that gonna hurt?

335
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,306
It's gonna help us figure
out what's making him sick.

336
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,384
- Shouldn't you be in class too?
- Teacher work day.

337
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,626
For you, but not Will?

338
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,975
Yeah, it didn't make sense to me either.

339
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:57,745
Can I help?

340
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:02,866
Well, I guess it's quicker than
calling a nurse. And a truant officer.

341
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,761
Here, grab his shins.
Push his knees up towards his chest.

342
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,022
Now hold him there tight.

343
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,801
This all nurses do?

344
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,822
My boss doesn't trust
'em to do anything else.

345
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,969
Is he gonna die?

346
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,917
No.

347
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:30,334
No one's gonna die.

348
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,060
In the whole world, ever?

349
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:33,243
That's so great.

350
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,115
- Well, I meant--
- I know what you meant.

351
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,374
But I also know bad things do happen.

352
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,361
My dad always had a few
drinks when they went out.

353
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,711
Always said he’d be okay to drive.

354
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:50,141
Until he wasn’t.

355
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,721
I would just like
some warning this time.

356
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,323
We're nowhere near anything
like that happening right now.

357
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,459
Okay?

358
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,969
Let's scoot him back over.

359
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,056
What was that?!

360
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,839
What'd you do?

361
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:21,581
- You broke his rib?
- I barely touched him.

362
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:23,184
Which means--

363
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:25,729
- Found it.
- Fix it.

364
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:29,720
Osteomyelitis. Means the
infection's spread to his bones.

365
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,814
Which means it's either
bacterial or viral, and that--

366
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:38,063
I hired you to take away the pain.
Is there some confusion?

367
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,412
You ever thought about using
your cane on the proper side?

368
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,613
Yeah, that's the issue.

369
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,048
Friday night, my cane suddenly
noticed it was on the wrong side.

370
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,396
- Can you score me some vicodin?
- No.

371
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,500
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which--

372
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,951
How long till the cultures--

373
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:57,031
Why do you only do
that when I'm talking?

374
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,726
You gotta rest your shoulder.

375
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,315
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

376
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,173
- Nice cane.
- If I know what you mean?

377
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:21,435
- Chase, you can stop doing that.
- I'm almost finished.

378
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:22,892
He's got osteomyelitis.

379
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,758
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

380
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,692
And...

381
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:31,194
you can stop too. Syphilis.

382
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,835
- You sure?
- Read the printout.

383
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,719
He's also positive for eikenella.

384
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,784
One of you two screwed up.

385
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:47,984
- No.
- Not a chance.

386
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,937
Or this kid is a lot
sicker than we thought.

387
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:54,639
Finish that test.

388
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,767
It should be impossible to
get two right answers to one question.

389
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:00,068
Is it okay to have three?

390
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:02,635
Apparently.

391
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,176
He's positive for botulism too.

392
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,981
So...

393
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,780
we knock down one infection
and three more pop up.

394
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,228
I think this game is rigged.

395
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:25,873
Jack? Somebody help!

396
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,472
We've managed to clear all
three infections out of his system.

397
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,655
But now he's having
seizures every few hours.

398
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,356
He's gotta be immuno-compromised.

399
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:35,331
No, white count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

400
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,726
If he's not immuno-compromised,

401
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,614
why is he acting like
he's immuno-compromised?

402
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:39,856
What do the seizures tell us?

403
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,518
Nothing, there were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

404
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,369
non-focal neuro-exam,
no electrolyte imbalance, nothing.

405
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:49,623
What do unexplained seizures and
really sick 18-year-olds have in common?

406
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,024
You thinking trauma?

407
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,118
I'm thinking drugs.

408
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,935
He's an admitted user.

409
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,046
Drugs trashed his immune system.

410
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,017
Tox screen was clean.

411
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:02,425
Clean tox screen means there’s
no drugs in his blood or urine.

412
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,388
There could still be drugs trapped
in his fat cells from the good ol' days.

413
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:09,457
If they're in his fat,
why would they be affecting him now?

414
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,108
A keen observer would notice that
he's had some digestive issues lately.

415
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,689
His weight loss could have

416
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:18,015
burned off fat cells and released
the drugs back into his system.

417
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,616
There's no way to know. It's
impossible to test fat cells for drugs.

418
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:24,754
It's not impossible to
make him lose more weight.

419
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,559
You want us to starve him so
we can drive him into another seizure,

420
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,557
and maybe a heart attack,
just so we can run another tox screen?

421
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,508
That'd be cruel.

422
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:34,531
Just sweat it out of him.

423
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:40,882
I haven't touched a thing
since the night my parents died.

424
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,535
Drugs stay in your system a long time.

425
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,237
I was high...

426
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:55,284
the night the cops came
to tell us what happened.

427
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,835
You know the first thing
I did when they told me?

428
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:04,327
I laughed.

429
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:09,618
I'm not the person I was when they died.

430
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,287
I wish they could see that.

431
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,490
Well, I'm sure they’re watching,
and I'm sure they’re proud.

432
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:21,242
That's what Will's guidance
counselor keeps telling him.

433
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,370
What do you tell him?

434
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,410
I tell him it's crap.

435
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,639
Our parents live on in our memories,
but they don't live on.

436
00:23:39,882 --> 00:23:40,832
Jack?

437
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:41,809
Hold him still!

438
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,065
- Don't break his arm.
- We'll fix it.

439
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,316
We need to get a sample.

440
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,206
House.

441
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,879
Bad news.

442
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:55,034
Look at you.
Couldn't have sent Cameron down here

443
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:58,027
to this air-conditioned
hallway to deliver the bad news?

444
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,410
Jack seized again, but his
blood was clean. Completely drug-free.

445
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:05,254
So he just happened to have a seizure
at the exact time that we stuck him

446
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,175
- in a sauna?
- It's not a coincidence.

447
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:10,976
He's still seizing every few hours,
whether we stick him in a sauna or not.

448
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,022
Oh, my god!

449
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:14,222
Why are you using that?

450
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:17,315
I've had it for years.

451
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:18,886
No, that's--

452
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:22,331
that's gonna make your shoulder hurt.
You need one of these.

453
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:24,436
He's a... doctor.

454
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:28,093
- Is he still infection-free?
- I'm sure not for long.

455
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,476
My point being that something other than
those infections caused these seizures.

456
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:33,540
That means there’s something
in his head. Scan him.

457
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:34,491
We scanned him.

458
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:38,401
Well, that was then. This is not then.
Kid keeps changing. Scan him again.

459
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:39,603
Where is Cameron?

460
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,301
I'm not writing you a scrip for vicodin.

461
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,106
I've only got two pills left.

462
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,083
Cut 'em in half. Then you'll have four.

463
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,153
You're prescribing for Wilson. Wilson
prescribes for me. Write up a scrip.

464
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:52,898
You know you have a problem.

465
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,849
Yeah, it's got a badge and everything.

466
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,471
- You're taking too much--
- Fine! You’re right.

467
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,009
What's the correct amount?

468
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,060
Write up a scrip for the correct amount.

469
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:03,272
No answer?

470
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:05,904
That's 'cause we're
having the wrong debate.

471
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,819
This has got nothing to do with
my problem and everything to do with you

472
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,607
avoiding a problem. You're afraid
that if you write me a prescription,

473
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,996
- you're gonna wind up like Wilson.
- Of course I am.

474
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,254
Tritter wants to win by giving pain.

475
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,425
Do you really want to be a part of that?

476
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:24,465
As a doctor, how do you do that?

477
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,099
Here.

478
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:34,698
This'll tide you over.

479
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:37,657
Keeps the edge off my PMS,
it will do wonders for you.

480
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,854
Why are you looking at my head again?

481
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,125
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

482
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:50,662
I'm not gonna get better.

483
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:53,008
Am I?

484
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,433
We'll know more after the test.

485
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,077
I've gotta find out who
can take care of Will and Kama.

486
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,078
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

487
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:06,887
You'll be home, yelling at them and
kicking their butts before you know it.

488
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:18,732
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

489
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,905
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

490
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:21,906
Brain stem's clean.

491
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,250
- Nothing in the midbrain.
- What's that?

492
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,219
The frontal lobe, upper-right quadrant.

493
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,014
I don't see anything.

494
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,472
There.

495
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:33,639
It's tiny, but...

496
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:35,137
I think it's a tumor.

497
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,688
That size should be excisable.

498
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:39,827
- Why didn't we see it earlier?
- Oh, god.

499
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:42,867
Axial view, there's another one.

500
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,546
Bring up the next slice.

501
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,567
They're everywhere.

502
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,245
Jack's brain is riddled with tumors.

503
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:56,584
You know what he's doing?

504
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:59,252
- Moaning?
- Setting up play dates.

505
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,316
Wow, what a guy! Theories?

506
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:03,995
The obvious one. Brain cancer
destroyed his immune system.

507
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,755
Left him wide open for these infections.

508
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:06,706
House...

509
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:07,799
you're pathetic.

510
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,402
You'll analyze anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses.

511
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,025
But this kid's got some strength,

512
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:16,047
and all of a sudden there's no time
to talk about anything but the medicine.

513
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,640
He's teaching prepubescent
kids that truth matters,

514
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,832
god does not, and life sucks.
I like him.

515
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,935
- Treatment?
- We need to start him on radiation.

516
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,222
And destroy whatever's
left of his immune system.

517
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:27,270
And safe his life!

518
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:30,836
I know the notion of
self-sacrifice is foreign to you.

519
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:34,079
You wanna think he’s sacrificing
himself because if one person can do it,

520
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,680
then maybe the world isn’t the cold,
selfish place you know that it is.

521
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,966
Radiation could kill him. Alternatives?

522
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,332
There aren't any. We saw the tumors.

523
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:45,706
We could choose to
say they aren't tumors.

524
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:47,097
They're just pus.

525
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:49,522
Which would explain why
they weren't there yesterday.

526
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:52,834
It can't be an infection. He got IVIG,
broad spectrum antibiotics--

527
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,554
Exactly. It creates
a perfect world for fungus.

528
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:58,475
Moves in,
gets married, has little fungi.

529
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:02,481
If you're wrong about the fungus, you're
wasting what little time he has left.

530
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:04,655
Not a big sacrifice. His life sucks.

531
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:09,257
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle in the kid's head.

532
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:12,540
If you suck out a liquid, then I'm
right, and we haven’t answered anything.

533
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,924
If you suck out a solid, you're right,
and no more worrying about play dates.

534
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:24,015
Okay, fine. I'll father your child.

535
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,450
First, you gotta write
me a vicodin prescription.

536
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,562
- Just so I'd get through the foreplay.
- How many days you have left?

537
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:33,375
Ah, I could probably get
through maybe... next minute or so.

538
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:37,223
And your coming to me means
your lackeys actually stood up to you--

539
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:40,095
- I'm impressed.
- Yes, their cowardice is inspiring.

540
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,190
Well, you should be thanking them.

541
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,368
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

542
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,169
that you intimidated underlings
to feed your addiction.

543
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,240
I hate writing thank-you notes.

544
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:52,022
Would it be weird if
I asked Cameron to write them?

545
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,365
You're hooking me up?

546
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,190
Unfortunately, if I cut you off,

547
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,020
it'd give the cops evidence that
you don't really need the pain meds.

548
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:01,181
I knew that cleavage was a smoke screen.
You're a genius.

549
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,941
- You can't lift your arm.
- You can't pee standing up.

550
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:06,892
Gimme.

551
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,075
You been doing physio?

552
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:09,579
Maybe you pulled--

553
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,773
Yeah, been training
for pants off dance off.

554
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:12,548
Gimme the scrip.

555
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,449
Your shoulder problem isn’t physical.

556
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,979
Well, we'll find out
if you ever give me the--

557
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,795
what's new? What’s different?

558
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:22,351
Any big changes in your life recently?
A fight with the wife, maybe?

559
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:23,792
It's good.

560
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:27,284
Means your shoulder’s a human being.
It's a start.

561
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,313
I'm right, right?

562
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,209
Yeah. Just not about me.

563
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,254
I was right, right?

564
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,983
They were abscesses from
a fungal infection. Aspergillus.

565
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:51,534
But we still have no idea why.

566
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,340
Our kid's immune system
has a factory defect.

567
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,980
- It's genetic.
- It can't be genetic.

568
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:59,294
He'd have been getting
infections since he was an infant.

569
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:00,601
Not if he grew up in a bubble.

570
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,313
Or if he grew up on Mars.
No germs there, either.

571
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,123
I don't mean a literal bubble.

572
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:08,969
A sweet, suburban bubble where mommies
and daddies protect their children.

573
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,242
They die, bubble bursts.

574
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:13,679
Continuing emotional trauma
triggers a genetic illness.

575
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:15,024
Question is, which one?

576
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,700
The infections he's contracted
narrow down the possibilities.

577
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:21,424
Hep A indicates a
problem with his B cells.

578
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:23,768
Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?

579
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:26,548
- Eikenella.
- Points to a complement deficiency.

580
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:30,489
- I have a patient. I need--
- Not now!

581
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:32,932
- I'll go.
- You'll stay.

582
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:35,293
- Patient's dying.
- So is mine.

583
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,760
Not in the next hour.

584
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,349
What does the syphilis tell us?

585
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:43,204
What does it tell us?

586
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,610
It could mean chronic
granulomatous disease.

587
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:50,501
And the aspergillus is a T-cell issue.
Common variable immunodeficiency.

588
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:54,457
Genetic testing's gonna take time.

589
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,433
Given the rate he's
picking up infections--

590
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,783
why don't we turn it into a race?

591
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,521
Little late to be playing games with us.

592
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:02,439
- Not you guys. The infections.
- What infections?

593
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,097
The infections we’re gonna give him.

594
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,551
The only way to cure
me is to make me sicker?

595
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:13,921
Each of the four possible genetic
conditions is most susceptible

596
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,578
to different types of infection.

597
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,130
What's that?

598
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,342
This is a cocktail of serratia,
meningococcus, cepacia, and rhinovirus.

599
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:28,309
Whichever germ gains the most
ground plants the flag of its leader,

600
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:29,727
gives us our answer.

601
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,091
How are you gonna know
which one gains the most ground?

602
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:35,277
Well, now, that’s the fun part.

603
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:39,545
See, if the meningococus is king of the
hill, you get to have another seizure.

604
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:42,469
The serratia will shut down your lungs.
If it's cepacia,

605
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:46,096
you'll have a heart attack.
If it's the rhinovirus, you'll sneeze.

606
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,991
Can't all be dramatic. We good?

607
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:53,928
- Hell, no.
- Well, the alternative is we guess.

608
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,118
And there's a three out of four chance

609
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,769
that your little brother and sister
will get to cry over another coffin.

610
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,452
Did you study fractions in school?

611
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:03,846
We good?

612
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,371
This test isn’t exactly FDA approved. So

613
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,972
let's just keep it
our little secret, okay?

614
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:30,507
Little orphan Annie and Oliver
Twist slept in our hallways last night.

615
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:31,858
Are they singing?

616
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,091
They're children. They need a guardian.

617
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,401
Couldn't find a babysitter.

618
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:38,549
On account of not being
able to make any phone calls,

619
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:40,175
on account of not being able to breathe,

620
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:42,544
on account of his lungs
filling up with serratia.

621
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:44,395
He has chronicgranulomatous disease.

622
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:46,672
Game over. Our work is done.

623
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:50,398
Then he's gonna keep getting sick.
You gotta call social services.

624
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,717
Bone marrow transplant would
reboot his whole immune system.

625
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:56,462
He'll be healthy enough to
win miserable daddy of the year.

626
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,301
So see if one of his kids is a match.

627
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,202
My kids are already testing his kids.

628
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:03,803
Will's a match.

629
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:05,483
You tested him?

630
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,237
I never consented--

631
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:09,148
It's just a blood draw.
There's no danger.

632
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,779
To the testing. What about the surgery?

633
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,830
The risk for Will? It's next to nothing.

634
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:20,126
What if I don't do it?
What are my other options?

635
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,360
Your immune system
can’t fight off the germs

636
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:26,627
we all come into contact with every day.

637
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:30,351
Now that we know, we can use
more targeted medications. But...

638
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:33,783
you'll still get sick all the time.

639
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:37,687
- You'll be in and out of hospitals--
- But I'll live.

640
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:44,747
Jack...

641
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,549
your lifespan will
be substantially shortened.

642
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:54,438
And you'll be too sick to care
for your brother and sister anymore.

643
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,418
You shouldn't have pressured him into--

644
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:58,819
- There's no pressure.
- He's eight years old!

645
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,178
You tell him his brother’s
dying unless he helps,

646
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,502
- what do you think he's gonna do?
- He wants to help you.

647
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:04,646
He has no idea.

648
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:08,661
It's like you asked him to
let me play with one of his toys.

649
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:11,849
This is surgery. He could die.

650
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:13,446
He'll be fine.

651
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,648
But you...

652
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,920
you're gonna have a hard time
protecting him like this if you're dead.

653
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:24,765
I'll do it.

654
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:29,029
When Will's 18,
and can decide for himself.

655
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,259
Noble.

656
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:39,682
Moronic.

657
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:42,906
It's a synonym.

658
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,320
Why can't you accept he
wants to protect his brother?

659
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,892
Has to protect his brother.
He doesn't want to.

660
00:35:48,987 --> 00:35:51,737
He wants to run screaming
from protecting his brother.

661
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,066
You're a hypocrite.

662
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,761
Evidence is everything.

663
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:01,672
Truth is all that matters.

664
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,875
Except when it comes to people.

665
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:08,598
Everything we've learned
about this kid says you're wrong.

666
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:11,086
But you can't accept that.

667
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:13,551
It's easy to reject the diagnosis.

668
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:16,478
Not so easy to reject your misanthropy.

669
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:20,179
Because then you'd have
to give people a fighting chance.

670
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:21,971
And that...

671
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,052
scares the crap out of you.

672
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:27,171
Okay.

673
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:31,079
Let's get some evidence.

674
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,165
It's your lucky day.

675
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,908
I just found another donor
in the registry. A perfect match.

676
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:45,874
We can do the transplant,
no danger to the rug rat.

677
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,569
You just have to sign here.

678
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,776
Unless there's another
reason you don't want it.

679
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:54,987
There's a chance I'd die.

680
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:56,858
A chance you'll be cured.

681
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:00,107
Maybe you don't want that, either.

682
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,228
Maybe hanging out in a hospital and
getting waited on hand and foot reminds

683
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:07,879
you of what life used to be like
before you were forced to play Mr. Mom.

684
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:09,575
I don't like being sick.

685
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:12,167
But you don't want to be healthy either.

686
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:14,257
This is your way out.

687
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,759
Guilt-free.

688
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:19,454
I said I'd do it when Will's 18.

689
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,356
When he's able to take care to himself.
Without you.

690
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,175
Jack...

691
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,400
your brother and sister need you.

692
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:30,321
I know! I know every second
of every day that they need me.

693
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,072
But I'm too young to be their dad!

694
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,557
Good for you.

695
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,060
Don't pretend you’re surprised.

696
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:09,305
Wanna go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

697
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,198
Come on. Mail can wait.

698
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:16,497
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

699
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:17,885
I'm shutting down my practice.

700
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:18,836
Oh, good!

701
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:20,760
‘Cause I was afraid you might overreact.

702
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,451
I can't just ask my patients to wait

703
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:25,194
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won’t let her come out and play!

704
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,995
- I kept you waiting for maybe an hour.
- Three hours!

705
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,179
- Did anybody die?
- Not this time.

706
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:32,804
Cameron's available now.

707
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,496
Use her all you want.

708
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,274
Oh, so now's a better time
for me to have my life taken away?

709
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,975
- It fits into your schedule better?
- Oh, poor you.

710
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:43,407
- You think if you suffer loudly enough
- You committed a crime!

711
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,154
What do you want me to do,
turn myself in?

712
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,241
Yes! Do something! Go in!

713
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,989
Show some remorse!
Tell Tritter you'll get some help!

714
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,048
I don't need help!

715
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,431
House, get out of here.

716
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,820
Get out of here.

717
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:02,958
You are not gonna make me feel guilty
about what Tritter is doing... to us.

718
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:05,885
You already feel guilty.

719
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:08,213
Your mysterious shoulder pain

720
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:11,906
isn't coming from your cane.
It's coming from your conscience.

721
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,219
That used to be enough.

722
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,935
Despite all your smart-ass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn. This time...

723
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:24,805
you were either gonna help
me through this, or you weren't.

724
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:26,502
And I got my answer.

725
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,689
Who's gonna drive me to school?

726
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:46,004
Help me with my homework?

727
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,239
There'll be a mom where they take you.

728
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:51,956
A real mom.

729
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:53,738
Someone who can cook.

730
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:01,367
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to see you guys.

731
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:48,692
You said you’d make him better.

732
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:51,393
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,894
Thank you for not telling them.

734
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,010
You're a good kid.

735
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:12,582
Three months from now...

736
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:14,683
six months from now...

737
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,350
you'll be visiting them.

738
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:19,738
And you won't be able to say good-bye.

739
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,429
You're gonna know you screwed up.

740
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:27,264
You'll take his bone marrow.
And you’ll take them back.

741
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:31,826
And they'll be a burden and a pain.

742
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,958
And your life will...

743
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,123
never be what it was supposed to be.

744
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,217
But you'll be proud of yourself.

745
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:44,086
Your parents...

746
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:46,777
they'll be proud of you.

747
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:51,404
I don't think so.

748
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,787
It's what I wanna believe.

749
