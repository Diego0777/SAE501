1
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,969
Yo, yo! Turn that back on.
Put it back on!

2
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,097
Don't look at me, 'cause
you know I didn't do it. All right?

3
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:41,816
You better have put fresh batteries
in that thing, like I told you.

4
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,440
I did, Sarge, right when you--
when you gave it to me, I-I did.

5
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,391
I put 'em in.

6
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,076
Well, then, hit it or something.

7
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:49,827
Otherwise, y'all are gonna
have to listen to me sing!

8
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:25,996
Here.

9
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:29,901
All right, don't panic.

10
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,080
Don't shoot us,

11
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:32,838
and don't die.

12
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:35,055
You got it, G?

13
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,060
Up and at 'em.

14
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,233
You're supposed to be in clinic duty.

15
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:06,466
Yeah, like I can sleep down
there with all the crying and coughing.

16
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:08,768
Here.

17
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,019
Ex-Marine.
Thinks he has Gulf War Syndrome.

18
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,452
- There's no such thing.
- So he's been told.

19
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:17,991
It hasn't stopped the unexplained
fatigue, rashes, and joint pain.

20
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,143
And just so you know, he's the
nephew of a benefactor I owe a favor,

21
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:24,808
so you're gonna take this
case whether you like it or not.

22
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,709
Why wouldn't I want to take the case?

23
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,127
The guy's tired and sore.

24
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:31,552
It's gonna be chapter one in my--

25
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,321
Don't panic.

26
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:39,782
Don't shoot us.

27
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,459
Don't die.

28
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,134
You know him?

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,566
Never met him before in my life.

30
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:51,737
Okay, well, you're about to.
He's on his way here.

31
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,484
Get your ass up and get your
team together. You have work to do.

32
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:09,923

33
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,794
- That's amazing.
- No, it's not.

34
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,051
It's not?

35
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,002
I can play the harmonica with my nose,

36
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:49,241
make a penny come out of a child's ear--

37
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,242
or any other orifice, for that matter--

38
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:55,019
given the right circumstances, can
bring two women to simultaneous ecstasy.

39
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,520
The right circumstances being

40
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,847
their agreement to bill
you on the same credit card.

41
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,848
And what I absolutely cannot do is dream
about someone I've never seen before.

42
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,340
Well, just because you don't understand
it doesn't mean it can't happen.

43
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,291
True...

44
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,516
it can't happen because it can't happen!

45
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:14,898
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

46
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,651
Right, just some other
guy who looks exactly like him.

47
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,818
No, you imagined some generic Marine,

48
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:24,286
then you placed his face in
the dream after you saw the picture.

49
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:27,220
Sort of a coincidence
mixed with a little déjà vu.

50
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,756
There's no record of him
ever coming into the clinic.

51
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,677
So I must have seen
him before somewhere else.

52
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,728
Fine, you've known him since Cub Scouts.

53
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,932
A more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed, but why?

54
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:41,130
I'm guessing you're longing for either
a renewed relationship with your dad...

55
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,608
or a new relationship
with one of the Village People.

56
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,459
He was in the Navy, not the Marines.

57
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,505
I thought your dad was in the Marines.

58
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:51,858
The guy in the Village People.

59
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,957
Actually, he's only in the
Navy when they sing "In the Navy."

60
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,658
The rest of the time,
he's just in generic fatigues.

61
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:00,563
What?

62
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,597
You brought it up.

63
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,052
- You didn't flush.
- I didn't pee.

64
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,321
Male. 34.

65
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,311
Just got out of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

66
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,638
Admitted complaining of chronic fatigue,
joint pains,

67
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:20,987
intermittent rashes, and sore throats.

68
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,830
- Thinks he has Gulf War Syndrome.
- Why is he here instead of the VA?

69
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:27,871
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to avoid fellating

70
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:31,072
who doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis
of "nothing's wrongatosis."

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,362
The VA's right. There's no
such thing as Gulf War Syndrome,

72
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,814
especially in veterans who've
never served in the Gulf War.

73
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:40,695
Different war, same place. Whatever
was there in 1990 is still there.

74
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,746
What's there can send
you home in a pine box,

75
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:45,391
but it can't get you sick three
months after you've gotten home.

76
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:48,957
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about their symptoms?

77
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:53,261
You send 700,000 people on vacation to
Hawaii, some are gonna come back sick.

78
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,954
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.

79
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,587
He's right. The studies all
show the same pattern of symptoms

80
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,440
in veterans who were sent
to the Gulf and those who weren't.

81
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,634
That's it? You believe her but not me?

82
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,148
Stick to your guns, Chase.

83
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,272
Just 'cause there isn't a
single unifying symptom doesn't mean

84
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:10,160
there isn't something going on. It
could just affect everyone differently.

85
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,311
You think this guy
has Gulf War Syndrome?

86
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,267
'Course not.

87
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,127
He's depressed,
and he's looking for a disability check.

88
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,957
Most likely because he's just
realized that knowing how to barter

89
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,408
for sex in six languages
and open a beer bottle

90
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,183
with your eye socket are
not the most marketable skills.

91
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,304
- Why'd you take this case?
- Because a good scientist

92
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:29,155
continually questions his
own theories and assumptions.

93
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,667
- Cuddy's making him.
- Now I'm making you.

94
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:33,384
Do a full physical.

95
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,748
Recheck his blood for HIV,
Hep C, malaria, schistosomiasis,

96
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,437
and "T strain" A. baumannii just
to make sure the VA's dotted their Is.

97
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:43,017
And find out every hospital
and clinic he's ever visited,

98
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,918
every city he's ever lived in, and...

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,660
whether he's ever been on TV.

100
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,274
TV?

101
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,195
Problem could be neurological.

102
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,466
Everyone knows TV rots your brain.

103
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,266
It's usually the worst on
my palms and the bottoms of my feet.

104
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,731
I get these black dots all over.

105
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,242
- I don't see anything.
- It comes and goes.

106
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,974
You sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises?

107
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,605
I know the difference
between a rash and a bruise.

108
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:14,422
Sometimes it's harder than you
realize to distinguish between the two.

109
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:16,132
You obviously exercise.

110
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,005
My problems aren't
caused by my workouts.

111
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:21,306
But you do work out, and by
the look of you, pretty strenuously.

112
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,537
That's not usually the case
with patients whose principal complaint

113
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:26,077
is chronic fatigue and joint pain.

114
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,478
I was in the Marines for 12 years.
I'm used to doing PT every day.

115
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,629
Just because I can push through
the pain doesn't mean it's not there.

116
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,497
We're not saying we don't believe you.

117
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:35,548
The hell you aren't.

118
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,297
We just need to be specific
about what exactly the problems are.

119
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,751
I sleep ten hours a night,
but I feel tired all the time.

120
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:47,780
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

121
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:51,281
My knees and hips feel like
someone poured sand in my joints.

122
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,770
I get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

123
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:57,321
Sometimes, they're cold. Other times,
feels like my blood is boiling.

124
00:07:58,698 --> 00:07:59,648
Specific enough?

125
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,899
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it--

126
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,044
Gulf War Syndrome,
Iraq Fever, or just Crappy Sickness X.

127
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:12,256
I just want someone to figure
out what it is so they can cure it.

128
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,953
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

129
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,898
none of the other symptoms he's
complaining about are currently evident.

130
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,840
Besides low potassium probably caused
by him over hydrating after working out,

131
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,292
his blood work's all normal.

132
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:28,052
Low potassium could also probably
be caused by the experiments or vaccines

133
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:31,554
in anti-chemical warfare pills
he was given before he deployed to Iraq.

134
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:34,541
Not to mention the fact that whole
country's littered with hundreds of tons

135
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:37,116
of radioactive shrapnel
from depleted uranium munitions.

136
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,805
Did you go to medical school in France?

137
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,545
There's no trace
of uranium in his urine.

138
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,725
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

139
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,876
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

140
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,806
Has he ever done any modeling?

141
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,410
We forgot to ask.

142
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,882
We should send his urine to the U.
of Leicester. There's a professor

143
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,686
there who's developed a more advanced
screening technique for uranium.

144
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,422
If the levels are
too low for us to detect,

145
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,714
they're way too low to cause any damage.

146
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:01,261
Where you goin'?

147
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,634
This way.

148
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:06,717
Did you find out about any
television or other media exposure?

149
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,535
Do you really care? Or are you
just trying to waste hospital resources

150
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,556
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

151
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:12,539
Of course I care.

152
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,768
What a horrible thing to say.

153
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:18,116
Do a LexisNexis search.
Get a copy of his credit report.

154
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:21,248
Before or after we tell him
to eat a banana and discharge him

155
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:23,249
with a psych referral?
- I say before.

156
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:26,153
And I say in-between,
give him a polysomnogram.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,034
Sleep apnea can cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

158
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:31,905
Find out where he went to summer camp.

159
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,069
Are you okay?

160
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:40,259
Yeah, it's just a little
too much coffee this morning.

161
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,190
Were we...

162
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,641
walking you to the bathroom?

163
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,332
I wish.

164
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,464
Wilson was just in there.

165
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,791
These guys know what I'm talking about.

166
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,952
That's his third REM cycle,
and his breathing's completely normal.

167
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:58,143
There's obviously nothing
wrong with his sleep pattern.

168
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:00,985
If it's not uranium,
it's gotta be some other sort of toxin.

169
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:01,936
Or nothing at all.

170
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:05,303
You really think there's something
wrong, or do you just want Foreman

171
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,272
to be wrong?
- Both.

172
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:08,849
Well, it's not his sleep pattern.

173
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,899
If you really think it's a toxin, you
can do a liver biopsy in the morning.

174
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,160
We can't leave.

175
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:16,119
If we don't monitor the whole test,
House won't accept the results.

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,714
- He'll just make us do it over.
- It doesn't take two doctors

177
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,365
to monitor what's clearly
gonna be a normal polysomnogram.

178
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,620
Oh, so you want me to stay?

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,026
You're the one who thought
there was something wrong.

180
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:28,944
- I never said it was a sleep disorder.
- You wanna flip for it?

181
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,591
Just go.

182
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,722
Oh, come on.

183
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,621
Don't be a baby.

184
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:40,372
Fine.

185
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:42,163
I'll stay.

186
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,528
You know what we could do.

187
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,613
- Here?
- Why not?

188
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,911
We're surrounded by empty
rooms with beds in them.

189
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,254
- Yeah, and video cameras too.
- So we turn 'em off.

190
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,270
That's all I need is House
or Foreman walking in on us.

191
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,306
We have the keys.

192
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,240
No.

193
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,728
- What if he wakes up?
- All right.

194
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,201
Suit yourself.

195
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,272
Damn it!

196
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:28,525
Hello? Is anybody out there?

197
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,798
I think there's a problem in here!

198
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:37,879
What's wrong?

199
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,626
What do you mean, what's wrong?
You don't smell that?

200
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,727
Nothing smells, John.

201
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,487
Are you kidding me? It's disgusting.

202
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:45,888
How long have you thought--

203
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,343
Wait.

204
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,601
Open your mouth.

205
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,287
Smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,670
What's going on?

207
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:02,943
Good question.

208
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:41,586
What?

209
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,137
You were wrong about
the "nothing's wrongatosis."

210
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,998
You can fake fatigue and joint paint,

211
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,749
but you can't fake bacterial
vaginosis in your mouth.

212
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:49,850
Where's his mouth been?

213
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,901
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone in over a year.

214
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,223
Selfish bastard.

215
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:57,744
Because he hasn't been with anyone
since his last girlfriend dumped him

216
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,673
and after he deployed
to Iraq the second time.

217
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:00,723
Selfish bitch!

218
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,279
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes,
and any other endocrine abnormality.

219
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:06,421
Could be autoimmune;

220
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:09,577
Sjoegren's decreases salivary flow,
creates a hospitable home for bacteria.

221
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,448
No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.

222
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:12,899
Who was his last girlfriend?

223
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,353
Yeah, we'll... get right on that.

224
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,820
Chronic fatigue, joint pain, and
opportunistic infection spells cancer.

225
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,512
Probably lymphoma.

226
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,887
We should biopsy his tonsillar
and submandibular lymph nodes.

227
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,442
Right about cancer.
Wrong about lymphoma.

228
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,775
Unless you're simply hiding the
fact that his lymph nodes are swollen.

229
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,487
Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary
glands. He's got parotid cancer.

230
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:37,464
And see if you can get to
the truth about who he's been dating.

231
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:41,065
No way a Marine goes a year without
getting some blood on his bayonet.

232
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,111
It's not an STD. You just said--

233
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,180
Just do it.

234
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,362
The antibiotics should
at least relieve the infection,

235
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:52,713
also reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

236
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:53,798
Not soon enough.

237
00:14:58,947 --> 00:14:59,897
All right.

238
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,893
You're gonna feel a little burn.

239
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,985
You know, I never even dipped.

240
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:08,460
Chewing tobacco. Practically
everyone in my unit did but me.

241
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,544
I was so paranoid about cancer.

242
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:14,283
Well, if it's parotid cancer,

243
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,249
it's very treatable if diagnosed early.

244
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:22,133
My mom had cancer. Which is
why I know that diagnosing cancer early

245
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:24,432
means before there's
any serious symptoms.

246
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:33,003
Certainly tastes like a
pretty serious symptom, you know?

247
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,274
We'll know more after the test.

248
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:39,136
If he was just trying to mess
with Cuddy for wasting his time,

249
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,094
this would have stopped

250
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:42,452
as soon as the patient started
exhibiting actual symptoms.

251
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,781
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

252
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:46,306
Or is he wasting our time?

253
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:49,647
You think he's got a medical reason
for asking for the guy's credit report?

254
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,598
I don't.

255
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,407
Where were you two when the guy woke up?

256
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,552
Uh, we just-- stepped out for a second.

257
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,181
To do what?

258
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,437
To... get a coffee.

259
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,145
We'd been up most of the night.

260
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,162
He's just pushing to make
sure we have a complete history.

261
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:10,263
Obviously, we're missing something,
or we'd have the answer.

262
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:13,308
You didn't have any
coffee when you came back.

263
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,396
All right, already.
We confess, you caught us.

264
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,556
We snuck into one of the
sleep lab rooms to have sex.

265
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,182
We shouldn't have done it
while working,

266
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:22,990
and we're sorry. Now can we move on?

267
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,976
House'll do Wilson before you do Chase.

268
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:33,001
No, you would do House
and Wilson before I do Chase.

269
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,515
Now can we get back to work?

270
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,059
She did me once.

271
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:39,434
She was stoned!

272
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,574
Biopsy's inconclusive.
I'm gonna do a sialogram

273
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:57,057
while we wait for the results
from the additional blood work.

274
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,058
No hurry. Probably nothing
we can do at this point anyway.

275
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:01,560
As long as the cancer hasn't spread.

276
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,732
He's spitting stink.

277
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,029
You should focus on the living.

278
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:07,395
I need a prescription.

279
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:10,171
I just wrote you a prescription.

280
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:12,328
For Vicodin. I need alfuzosin.

281
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:13,962
No, you don't.

282
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,406
Have you figured out
where you met your Marine?

283
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,404
What?

284
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:21,747
Oh, that.
Haven't really thought about it.

285
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,619
I can't pee.

286
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,882
- You can't remember him, can you?
- I can't pee.

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,624
So stop taking the Vicodin.

288
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,014
- I wanna pee and not be in pain.
- Why don't you go to sleep?

289
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,085
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

290
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:38,400
Maybe you'll dream about him again.
Maybe he'll give you an address.

291
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:39,901
I haven't peed in three days.

292
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,803
I read that REM sleep is the
brain's way of working out problems.

293
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,759
Very useful.
Did you hear what I just said?

294
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,029
Yeah, you lied because you want
to avoid talking about your obsession.

295
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,980
I'm not obsessing.

296
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,417
- Why don't you just ask him?
- I haven't peed in three days!

297
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,368
You'd be dead.

298
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:56,542
- I'm not counting intermittent drips.
- You'd be in agony.

299
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,719
I passed agony yesterday around 4:00.

300
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,143
His mother,
brother, uncle, and best friend

301
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,644
all confirm he hasn't
had a date in over a year.

302
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,369
Which means it's not an STD.

303
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,804
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

304
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,478
What did you want me to tell him,
the truth?

305
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:35,524
No.

306
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,860
You didn't have to be so convincing.

307
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:40,152
Don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

308
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,906
This is getting out of control.

309
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,474
Don't pout.

310
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:49,953
Our patient woke up with an infection
while we were getting our rocks off.

311
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:52,808
Do you want to stop?

312
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:54,877
No.

313
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,546
But, uh, I don't want
to get caught either.

314
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,771
You think I do?

315
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,828
You certainly didn't go out
of your way to keep the volume down

316
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:04,629
when we were in the sleep lab.
- I couldn't help that.

317
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,683
Why would I wanna get caught?

318
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,047
Maybe you wanna give
House a reason to be jealous.

319
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:14,764
I'm over House.

320
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:19,322
All this is is uncomplicated sex.
Don't try to make it more than that.

321
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,023
I'm not doing it at work anymore.

322
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:23,547
Fine.

323
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,594
Wanna go grab some lunch?

324
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,411
I think the pill is the way to go.

325
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:46,063
We haven't had a condom break yet,
thank God, but it's bound to happen.

326
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,105
Especially the way we've been doing it.

327
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:50,910
On a bed of nails?

328
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,891
No. He's not kinky. He's just...

329
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:55,769
insatiable.

330
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,744
I can barely make it
to any of my morning classes.

331
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,791
- You smoke?
- No way.

332
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:05,165
Stop it!

333
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:07,291
Sorry.

334
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:12,446
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

335
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,419
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

336
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:21,495
- You have OCD?
- Duh. Can't you tell?

337
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,283
Any other compulsions besides
drinking massive amounts of water?

338
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,711
No, that's it, thank God.

339
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,140
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

340
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,077
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

341
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,675
Yeah, every couple of hours.

342
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,710
Well, then your therapist is an idiot.

343
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,873
Unconscious people don't have OCD.

344
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,594
They can,
however, have diabetes insipidus.

345
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:43,625
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

346
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,285
Different kind of diabetes. This
kind is caused by a banged-up pituitary.

347
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,339
You're obviously more
of a lover than a fighter.

348
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,390
I'm guessing either a car accident or...

349
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:54,327
you cracked your skull
on the balance beam.

350
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,710
How'd you know?

351
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:01,000
Easy. Nice ass, no boobs.
You got palms like a longshoreman.

352
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,370
Wait here. You need a CAT scan.

353
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,494
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry,

354
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,590
just means you'll be taking
two hormone supplements instead of one.

355
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,935
Okay, this time you're
gonna feel a little pressure.

356
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,886
We're injecting the contrast material.

357
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,692
- Could you turn up the music?
- Sure.

358
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:32,774
Looks pretty good so far.

359
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,388
Still can't hear it that well.

360
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,231
Can you hear it now?

361
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,459
John, can you hear me?

362
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,383
Still no... relief?

363
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:57,953
I got relief.

364
00:21:58,558 --> 00:21:59,747
Just got no pee.

365
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,257
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

366
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,730
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

367
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:06,681
What's going on?

368
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,309
He's got cancer, all right.

369
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:12,706
But it's not in his salivary glands.
It's in his brain.

370
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:14,917
And it's bad.

371
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,775
At least six tumors, maybe more.

372
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,961
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

373
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:25,654
Death is probably next.

374
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,131
No way he could have
grown all these in a week.

375
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,813
They can't be older.
The VA couldn't have missed all these.

376
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:36,264
Maybe they didn't miss them,
just mixed 'em up.

377
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:39,136
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

378
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,420
Maybe.

379
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:45,045
But it means some poor sap's getting his
melon sliced at the VA for no reason.

380
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,246
And this poor sergeant's gonna
be dead by the end of the week.

381
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,325
Where have you two been?

382
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,149
Lunch. Why, what happened?

383
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:56,858
Wilson's found some fast-growing,
elusive, or magic brain tumors.

384
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:58,435
What'd you find?

385
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,826
Nothing. He's telling the truth.

386
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:03,457
- About what?
- About everything.

387
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,349
Where he's lived, who he's dated.

388
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,780
Besides forgetting to
mention his dad's shin splits,

389
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:11,020
his granddad's nose bleeds
and to return a few rented DVDs,

390
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:13,189
everything he's told us has checked out.

391
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,223
You have them researching your dream?

392
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,856
No. I have them researching my patient.

393
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,172
You had a dream about a patient?

394
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,046
This poor guy's brain
is riddled with tumors,

395
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,997
and you're checking his credit report?

396
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,403
Come on. I need you guys.

397
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,353
- Where are you going?
- To do my job.

398
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:34,972
He's not your patient.

399
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,420
He is now. Go home and go to sleep.

400
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:40,358
Maybe you'll dream the
cure to late-stage brain cancer.

401
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,650
How is he?

402
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:52,726
He's dead.

403
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:54,523
Oh... God.

404
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:56,545
At least, he will be in a few days.

405
00:23:58,658 --> 00:23:59,708
The question is why?

406
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,441
The only explanation is
that the VA hospital screwed up.

407
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:06,296
There was definitely no mix-up.
I had them recheck.

408
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:07,485
Yes.

409
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,867
Why would a government
agency lie to cover up a mistake

410
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,690
that might have caused the death
of a guy they'd been trying to kill

411
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:16,241
for the last two years anyway?
- They didn't lie.

412
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:21,784
- Did you just take two Vicodin?
- No. It was an antidepressant.

413
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:25,765
I was told to take two every
time you walked into the room.

414
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:31,013
The VA scan of his brain. No tumors.

415
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:36,662
Yes, this is proof positive that someone
didn't have tumors in their brain.

416
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,541
You see that bright
spot below his left orbit?

417
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:42,803
That is a titanium pin your
patient had inserted 20 years ago.

418
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,960
Unless you think the VA
happened to mix up his scans

419
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:49,263
with someone who had the exact same pin,
they didn't screw up.

420
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:55,105
You paged us?

421
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,643
Why didn't you send his urine
to Leicester like I told you?

422
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,070
Because you told me not to.

423
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,586
Why did you choose that
moment to listen to me?

424
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:07,573
You think depleted uranium might
have something to do with his tumors?

425
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:10,224
Radiation's the only thing
that would make tumors grow that fast.

426
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,791
High doses of radiation.

427
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,583
Even if he ate depleted uranium
bullets for breakfast, he still would

428
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:17,754
have been exposed to less radiation than
we've given him in the last two days.

429
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:20,801
Do it anyway.
And you, call his uncle back.

430
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:25,299
Find out if he ever brought his nephew
to any hospital parties or fundraisers.

431
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,245
No. Not until you give me a reason.

432
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,158
Because... I'm your boss.

433
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:33,415
A rational reason. Or at
least admit that you don't have one.

434
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,839
I've got a full bladder,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

435
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,302
But you are, apparently,
afraid of discovering something

436
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,403
you can't rationally explain.
- Shut up!

437
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:43,273
Do what you're told.

438
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,842
Cuddy and Wilson may not
have to listen to me, but you do.

439
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,761
What the hell was that all about?

440
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,712
I don't care.

441
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:58,892
Which is why I didn't feel the need
to ask him eight personal questions.

442
00:25:58,893 --> 00:25:59,903
I'm over him.

443
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,559
Just making an observation.

444
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:10,222
All right, ready whenever you are.

445
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:11,732
I'm ready.

446
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,006
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

447
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:23,479
I don't see it.
You sure you got the right coordinates?

448
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:25,735
Yeah, she's in the right place.

449
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:30,019
Go 10 millimeters above
the AC-PC line on the Z access.

450
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:31,831
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

451
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,462
It's not there anymore.

452
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,257
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

453
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:39,208
Yeah, I'm sure.

454
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,830
It's not there.

455
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:44,632
It disappeared.

456
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,655
Six tumors don't just disappear.

457
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,030
Unless they were never
there to begin with.

458
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,681
- The VA didn't screw up.
- Maybe someone else did.

459
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:53,891
Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.

460
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:56,540
I saw the tumors. There was no mix-up.

461
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,170
Maybe there's something wrong
with the portable imager in the O.R.

462
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:01,948
Something that would cause it
to show brain tissue in perfect detail

463
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,899
but completely miss neoplastic tissue?

464
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,626
Then they were never
tumors to begin with.

465
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,779
I told you, I saw--

466
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,839
I know, you saw something
that looked like tumors. We all did.

467
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,534
We were all wrong.
Well, maybe he doesn't have cancer.

468
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:16,258
Maybe he has a brain infection
that's causing multiple abscesses.

469
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,460
- That miraculously healed.
- No, they were healed

470
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:21,202
by the antibiotics we're giving
him for the vaginosis in his mouth.

471
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:24,403
If it's an infection,
why didn't it show up in his blood work?

472
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,331
I don't know. Yet.

473
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:29,122
Dr. Wilson, we have a problem.

474
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:31,261
What did you do?!

475
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:33,182
I can't feel my legs!

476
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,612
What'd you guys do?

477
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,408
John, calm down. We didn't even operate.

478
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:38,631
Could it be a residual effect--

479
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:40,810
- I can't move my legs!
- It's not the anesthesia.

480
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,761
John, John, we're gonna
figure out what's wrong with you.

481
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:45,832
First we need to know one thing--

482
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,059
Have you ever appeared in any pornos?

483
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:56,725
Chronic fatigue. Sore throats.
Rashes. Putrid discharge in the mouth.

484
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:59,252
Multiple abscesses in the brain.
Hearing loss.

485
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,717
And last,
but not least, lower limb paralysis.

486
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,189
He's certainly given us plenty of clues.

487
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,949
- It's gotta be some sort of infection.
- That's miraculously improving

488
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,766
in his brain but getting
worse in his ears and legs?

489
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,916
Could be an infection and cancer.
Neoplastic Syndrome could depress

490
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:18,205
his immune system and
cause the other symptoms.

491
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,756
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

492
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:22,555
the lymph nodes that aren't swollen,

493
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:25,150
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

494
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:28,751
And what are you gonna base your
theory on-- his favorite restaurants?

495
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:33,465
I was right. He's excreting
depleted uranium in his urine.

496
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:37,153
We should start him on an IV
infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate.

497
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,171
- It's not depleted uranium.
- You're the one--

498
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:42,059
Who asked for the test when we
were thinking cancer. We no longer are.

499
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,502
Depleted uranium doesn't
just cause cells to mutate.

500
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:47,806
It can cause cell death as well.
- Not spinal cord cells. At least,

501
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:51,098
not until the dose is high enough
to kill all his other cells first.

502
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,599
So you're saying the radioactive
uranium in his urine is irrelevant.

503
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,869
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

504
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,987
This hospital is filled with radiation.

505
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,873
The issue is not where
it is but how much there is

506
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:06,115
and what damage that amount
could cause in someone's spinal cord.

507
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:08,716
And as I already stated quite clearly--

508
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,241
Got it. We're all idiots.
What's your theory?

509
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:13,639
- Gimme your keys.
- Why?

510
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,990
You ever tried riding a motorcycle
with a distended bladder?

511
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:23,079
Keep him on antibiotics. Check
his hearing and paralysis every hour.

512
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,135
So you basically want us to do nothing.

513
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:28,726
No, I basically wanna do nothing.
I want you to keep him on antibiotics

514
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,177
and check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

515
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,729
Wait, you can't go home now.

516
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,909
Actually, I have to go home now.
It's two days past my bedtime.

517
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:41,117
- House, he needs your help.
- And I need sleep.

518
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:44,810
Hey, it's the brain's
way of working out problems

519
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,058
that the conscious mind can't
solve during the day, remember?

520
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:02,320
No. Nothing.

521
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:08,232
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

522
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:18,063
No, we're not. We should start treatment
for the uranium toxicity like you said.

523
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:19,792
- But House--
- Isn't here.

524
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:26,097
If House wanted to
be involved in the case--

525
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,449
If he wanted us to start this treatment,
he would have told us to do it

526
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,775
the last time you brought it up.
- You have a better idea?

527
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,826
- No.
- Then we're going with Chase's.

528
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,877
Tell him not to get the lines tangled.

529
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,437
The infusion is slow.
We can't have any kinks in the line.

530
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:29,938
I went to medical school too.

531
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,215
Keep your arms on your body,
above your heart.

532
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,208
I can't feel my stomach!

533
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:47,131
I don't feel that.

534
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:49,445
I don't feel anything!

535
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:52,744
Paralysis is ascending. If it keeps
going, we're gonna need a respirator.

536
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,085
What? What are you saying?

537
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:55,036
Can you breathe?

538
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:00,619
No.

539
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:02,605
Not yet.

540
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,858
So, where were we?

541
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:56,312
- You have a nice night?
- No.

542
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:00,352
The paralysis is ascending.

543
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:02,905
The last check,
it was nearly to his diaphragm.

544
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:05,275
- Tells us something.
- Means it's getting worse.

545
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,471
Worse is something.

546
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:08,548
Also tells us it's not the uranium.

547
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:12,076
Did we think it was?

548
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,496
We started him on sodium bicarb to try
to flush the uranium out of his system.

549
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:19,647
Great. Now the fact that
he's getting worse tells us nothing.

550
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,155
Never thought it was uranium.

551
00:34:21,156 --> 00:34:23,603
For all we know, the uranium
treatment is what's making him--

552
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,792
A sodium bicarb infusion
wouldn't have any effect on--

553
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:28,972
On what? Kind of hard to say
what it wouldn't have an effect on

554
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:30,674
if you've no idea
what's there to affect.

555
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,522
- We had to do something.
- Well, next time...

556
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,718
go with something that
has a chance of working.

557
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,669
Like what?

558
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,415
You come up with some brilliant
idea while you're warm and cozy

559
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,340
in your bed at home?
- We need more information.

560
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:42,698
How much more information
could you possibly want?

561
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,928
We have a medical history going all
the way back to his great-grandparents.

562
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,254
A non-medical history going--
- It's not enough.

563
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,335
It's all we're gonna get.

564
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:54,889
Wanna bet?

565
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,117
Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?

566
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,375
Don't look at me. I was home in bed.

567
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,467
- What's wrong?
- He's unconscious.

568
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,061
His skin has lost all color,
and his BP and hematocrit are plunging.

569
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:12,525
He was only on the sodium bicarb--

570
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:13,403
He's bleeding out.

571
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,218
He can't be.
There's no blood in the bed.

572
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,314
Fine, he's bleeding in.

573
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,449
There's no sign of bruising
or internal hemorrhaging.

574
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,143
Paralysis must have
reached his diaphragm.

575
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:21,683
He's not able to oxygenate his blood.

576
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:24,569
He's not able to do it
because he doesn't have any left.

577
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,136
- There's no evidence--
- It's the only thing that would explain

578
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:29,669
- There's no reason for blood loss.
- There has to be a reason.

579
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,651
He needs a transfusion.
Get me 4 units of O negative. Stat!

580
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:34,244
Let's elevate his feet.

581
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,604
He doesn't need a transfusion.

582
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:38,299
Nobody asked you.

583
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:40,235
In fact, why are you even here?

584
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:42,136
Because, obviously, you need my help.

585
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,232
Get out.

586
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:46,023
House, his blood obviously
didn't just vanish into--

587
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:49,675
What the hell is this?

588
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,533
Somebody must have spilled something.

589
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,884
Somebody else should
be getting me 4 units...

590
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:56,498
What the hell is that?

591
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:03,899
It's a urine catheter collection
bag with a rip in it--

592
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,550
what the hell does it look like?

593
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:11,986
What?

594
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:15,912
It's just urine. It's sterile.

595
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:20,612
No one's getting me blood.
Why isn't anybody getting me blood?

596
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:21,765
You're bleeding.

597
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,492
House, are you all right?

598
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:30,272
Why are you even here?

599
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,173
I'm always here.

600
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:36,346
No, you're not.

601
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:40,230
There's a reason. There has to be.

602
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:17,733
So. Where were we?

603
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:22,227
- You have a nice night?
- Yes, I did, thank you.

604
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:24,621
I'm guessing better than our patient,

605
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:27,129
probably due to his
BP and hematocrit plunging.

606
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:29,226
How'd you know?

607
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:41,362
The answer was staring
right at us the whole time,

608
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:45,061
as plain as the nose on our faces.
Or the nose on his face.

609
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:47,126
What's going on? What'd he say?

610
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,428
No hairs, and cauterization scars.

611
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:51,855
Which means?

612
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:55,768
- He had it cauterized.
- How could you know that?

613
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,080
Just makes sense.
Undoubtedly done to stop the same

614
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:01,829
childhood nosebleeds
that plagued his grandfather.

615
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:02,919
Undoubtedly,

616
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,363
because they were both born with
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.

617
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:07,184
What's he saying?

618
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,495
I'm saying you've got a genetic disease
that's destroying your capillaries.

619
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,167
That no one in his family's
ever been diagnosed with before?

620
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,657
Not surprising,
since the most common initial symptoms--

621
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:17,011
skin rashes and nose bleeds--

622
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:20,462
are often written off as the
result or minor trauma or dry weather.

623
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:24,663
But they can also be the result of
his arteries and veins merging together.

624
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:28,207
He obviously has AVMs.
AVM near the spine caused the paralysis.

625
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,290
AVM in his lungs prevented
his blood from being filtered.

626
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,783
Dirty blood caused
the joint pain, fatigue,

627
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:36,168
and the infections
in his mouth and brain.

628
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,713
Nothing that a few
surgeries won't clear up.

629
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,970
Get MR angiograms of the aforementioned.

630
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,071
The Marines weren't
hiding anything. He was.

631
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,151
Or at least he forgot to
mention his bloody tissue issue.

632
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,714
What's going on? What'd he say?

633
00:38:57,338 --> 00:39:00,338
Oh, looks like solving the
case solved your other problem.

634
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,315
There is no medicine like happiness.

635
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:03,977
Except maybe, laughter.

636
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,017
Or rubber tube shoved up your urethra.

637
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,481
You cathed yourself?

638
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:13,411
Actually, it's not that bad after
the first, I don't know, 9 or 10 inches.

639
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:16,444
The cath relieved the spasm,
and I'm good as new.

640
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:20,034
Of course, just a minor spasm,
and the muscle you've been using

641
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:23,472
multiple times a day without
any problem for the past 45 years.

642
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,295
Not a major side-effect

643
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,849
caused by the overuse of
a particular narcotic pain-killer.

644
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,708
Yeah, that was my thought too.

645
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,995
So,

646
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:36,492
no reason to think about cutting back
on your use of that particular pill.

647
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:37,544
Thanks god.

648
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:39,898
Actually it was a triple
dose of the good stuff

649
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,947
that allowed me to finally
get to sleep and solve the case.

650
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,058
Pills made all my dreams come true.

651
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:48,497
You really got your
answer in your sleep?

652
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:52,144
Yeah, one in my sleep,
the other one I got in the shower.

653
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,782
I've been thinking about you,

654
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:03,794
you lied.

655
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:09,694
I didn't lie, I simply chose not
to share completely irrelevant facts.

656
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,375
Like the fact that you lied?

657
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:14,412
No wonder I couldn't place his face.

658
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:17,472
You were pratically swallowing
it on the dance floor.

659
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:18,494
I was not.

660
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:20,058
Talk about the cool uncle,

661
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:23,051
he donates the money,
the nephew gets the right off.

662
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,609
Of course by right off,
I mean, he gets to put your ankles--

663
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,260
This is exactly why I didn't mentioned
our one date over two years ago.

664
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:32,911
Because of my T-shirt?

665
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:35,978
Because you are an obnoxious ass.

666
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,577
Because you would have
spent the whole time--

667
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,528
That's very smart,

668
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,897
because this way I spent my whole
time completely focused on the patient.

669
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,375
How did you even remember him? We
were only at that party for like 10 min.

670
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:47,876
Is that some new health plan?

671
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,469
Service the dean of medecine,
you get free healthcare for a year.

672
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,780
Why are you smiling?

673
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,353
You remembered him because
he made out with me.

674
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:01,267
I'm good with faces.

675
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:03,928
So this plan, is it open to anyone?

676
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:06,354
You're lousy with faces.

677
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,214
Don't make this about me.
This is your humiliation.

678
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,716
So how much for private room coverage?

679
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:13,634
Get over me.

680
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,180
Give me a break. You hired me--

681
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:20,190
'Cause you're a good doctor who couldn't
get himself hired at a blood bank.

682
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:21,159
So I got you cheap.

683
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:24,980
You gave me everything I asked for
cause one night,I gave you everything--

684
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:28,115
Stop staring at my ass
when you think I'm not looking.

685
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:30,990
Showing up at restaurants
where I happen to be on a date

686
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:33,284
and fantasizing about me in the shower.

687
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,791
That ship sailed long ago, House.

688
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:38,023
Get over it.

689
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:43,798
If you're still referring to your ass,
I think that "super tanker sailed"

690
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,596
would be the more precise metaphore.

691
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:23,494
Sorry, I was looking
for an extra large trashcan.

692
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,299
Since when does he clear anything out?

693
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:50,711
