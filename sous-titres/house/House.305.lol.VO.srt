1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810
here you go.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,840
That fried crapwill kill you.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,800
See?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Time to make the donuts.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,740
Hands in the air!Right now!

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,460
Get up!Move out here, let's go!Move it!

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,930
Purses and wallets on the counter!Right now!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
Your watches, your jewelry.Take it all off!

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,220
Get the girl,get the girl.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,760
We're moving to the back room.Let's go!

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,330
Let's go! Move it!

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,470
Go on!

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,280
Not you.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,920
Hey, hey!

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,330
No, no.She's staying right here.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,010
You're not gonna do this.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,170
Whoa, kid.

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,440
No, no.Jeremy, please.Just do what they say.Please.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,190
Okay, okay.

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,600
Move!

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,930
Son of a bitch!You thought
I was gonna let you hurt my wife?

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,230
Hey, mister!Your wife.

23
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,570
What did he do to her?

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,300
Nothing.

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,700
Tracy!

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,370
<font color=#38B0DE>House Season 3 Episode 5</font>

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,830
20-year-old, married african american female.

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,230
Couldn't breathe.Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,920
Children?

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,360
You think pregnancy would explain--

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,210
it explains the marriage.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,810
Who the hell gets marriedat 20?

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,490
I'm guessing people in love.

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,390
Show me a 20 year-old who's not in love.

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,120
You get married at 20,you're gonna be shocked

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
at who you're living with at 30.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,710
it's not allergies,negative on all the skin tests.

40
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,650
Four days on antihistamines and steroids--

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,070
--who's he talking to? --What?

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,270
It's got an ass.

43
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,130
Technically,that makes it a "who."

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,920
New nurse in peeds.

45
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,010
Wendy something.

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Swelling just started to go down--

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,980
seen her here before?

48
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,300
Couple times.

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,280
I tried following her home,but she gave me the slip.

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,040
Swelling's--

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,130
Think that's funny

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,360
ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane.

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,160
Are you serious?

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,470
There was a point to iT.Wendy, this is house.

55
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,620
Something about not getting too "uppity" with normal folks who walk good.

56
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,750
You're everything I'd heard.

57
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,420
Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,640
Why so rude?

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,900
You've sprinted through three bad marriages

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,360
into an affair with a dying patient.Now a naughty nurse?

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,400
How many more failed relationships are we both

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,990
gonna have to deal with before you learn to love yourself?

63
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,310
And I mean that in the literal way.

64
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,900
It's amazing how you can not only know it's a relationship,

65
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,250
but that it's a bad relationship based on nothing but...

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,970
nothing.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,030
I know you.

68
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,730
I'm not with her.Not even trying.

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,350
You're lying to me.

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,690
That's interesting.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,050
Well, as long as it's interesting.

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,030
Swelling is--

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,320
why is she hanging out here?

74
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,230
Anyone interested in what happened with the swelling?

75
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,150
She's in peeds.

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,280
It's the next wing over.

77
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,480
If you're wondering if wilson's dating her, ask wilson.

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,450
clearly he did.And wilson denied it.

79
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,590
And house doesn't believe it.

80
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,390
It's gotta hurt.

81
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,710
That's why it pays to have more than one friend, house.

82
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,630
If he's not hitting that,why is she here?

83
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,520
Because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot.

84
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,840
Swelling took four days to resolve.

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,150
Patient has unexplained,intense abdominal pains.

86
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,490
So explain them.

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,040
Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy.

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,830
Anybody know her?Know her story?

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,760
Up and at 'em.They did a laparotomy.

90
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,730
Liver, bowel, gallbladder,appendix--all clean.

91
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,660
Belly pain plus throat swelling.

92
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,260
She was in some sort of assault, right?

93
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,480
Simple neck trauma.

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,840
It says no one touched her neck,and
if they did,it would resolve by now.

95
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,900
Didn't need to touch her.Some guy coughed on her, right?

96
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,690
He's in jail and he's completely healthy,

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,300
except for the broken head he got from the beating he took.

98
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,270
There's pot on her tox screen.

99
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,010
Salmonella from the pot would explain the stomach pains.

100
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,910
It's a stretch.She'd have a fever.

101
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,580
She's on steroids for the swelling
therefore no fever.

102
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,330
And the smoking explains the throat.

103
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,510
Sorry, take it back.

104
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,240
That's a stretch.

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,650
Got a better idea?

106
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,580
Then stretch away.

107
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,890
Start her on fluoroquinolone for the salmonella.

108
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,330
I was waiting two hours out there.

109
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,740
Fascinating.

110
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,370
Have you considered a career as a memoirist?

111
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,130
Let's see it.

112
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,490
You don't introduce yourself?

113
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,150
Sorry, I thought you were waiting two hours,

114
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,600
didn't know you wanted to chat.

115
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,660
Hi, I'm greg.How about that local sports team?

116
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,450
It's not an infection.

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
How can you tell without--

118
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,190
you want me to touch you?

119
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,690
It's your private place.

120
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,980
You're chewing nicotine gum
which causes dehydration

121
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,430
which causes wear and tear.

122
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,770
Try a lubricant.

123
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,670
Or foreplay if you're cheap.

124
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,070
Just take a swab and get it tested, okay?

125
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,810
Sorry.

126
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,790
I already met this month's quota of
useless tests for stubborn idiots.

127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,440
You're rude.

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,080
Wow, you're like a detective, or something.

129
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,710
And you're smart.

130
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,570
And you're funny.

131
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,090
But you are bitter,and you're lonely.

132
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,710
So you treat everyone around like they're idiots.

133
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,920
And you get away with it,

134
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,210
'cause of your cane.

135
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,810
Please stop.

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,550
It's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears.

137
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,830
But you're not actually getting away with it.

138
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,730
Last nurse you made fun of

139
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,040
she probably slipped some crap into your coffee.

140
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,730
Nah, I asked forde-crappinated coffee.

141
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,770
Treat people like jerks

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,200
you get treated like a jerk.

143
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,800
Thank you.

144
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,910
Bend over.

145
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,620
You kidding me?

146
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,550
If you have an infection,you'd have a fever.

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,530
You're chewing nicotine gum

148
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,050
which messes with the weather in your mouth

149
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,500
so I need to vacation elsewhere.

150
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,100
and wait till I put the thermometer in.

151
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,900
You break it, you bought it.

152
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,210
Leaving early today.

153
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,760
You ever get that thing where

154
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,300
you're sure you forgot something,

155
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,650
but you can't figure out what?

156
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,520
Guess it can't be that important.

157
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,400
Salmonella is a bacterial infection
at you can get from pot plants.

158
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,920
Causes stomach pain.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,060
And my throat?

160
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,000
The thinking is it's an inflammatory reaction to the smoking.

161
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,260
How much would you need to smoke

162
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,820
for your throat to go nuts like that?

163
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,310
Most cases, a lot.

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,750
We don't smoke a lot.

165
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,290
Let's just start the treatment.

166
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,150
Think we're liars as well as druggies?

167
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,700
actually, I'm wondering if you'd mind
getting her a cup of ice chips.

168
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,830
You're not gonna get any different answer from her.

169
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,500
No, no.He can stay.

170
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,790
No offense,but this place is scary.

171
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,290
I feel better when he's around.

172
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,590
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

173
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,540
We don't do a lot of drugs.

174
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,560
I need to know your answers aren't being pressured.

175
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,830
look, if you think the antibiotics are a good idea,

176
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,150
you can give them to me.

177
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,080
Okay.

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,910
Worst case scenario,it'll help us rule out a few things.

179
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,600
He's a good guy.

180
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,860
He just has a hard time holding in his emotions.

181
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,640
You don't have to apologize for me.

182
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
That mean you're gonna do it for yourself?

183
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,120
I got nothing to apologize for.

184
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,710
he's young.

185
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,980
Itchy.

186
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,860
allergic reaction to the fluoroquinolone.

187
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,720
We should switch to a different antibiotiC.

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,370
Why?

189
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,580
We can't treat the salmonella unless--

190
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,830
salmonella?That was a total stretch.

191
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,750
Man, why does that sound so familiar?

192
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,310
You think it's 'cause I said it an hour ago?

193
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,730
Then it was a dumb thing to say.Now it's smart.

194
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,030
She's got the rash,

195
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,880
so we know she's unusually susceptible
to allergic reactions.

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,210
So that's what brought her in.

197
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,130
Probably the peanut butter in her sandwich.

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,330
Stick test was negative for peanuts.

199
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,240
That's because you foolishly tested
her while she was lying down.

200
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,910
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?

201
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,280
I think that requires exercise.

202
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,040
When her throat closed,they'd just got done eating.

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,380
Not evencompetitive eating.

204
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,500
And getting robbed.

205
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,550
Always gets my heart rate up.

206
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,360
Give her the same food she ate at the diner

207
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,390
and stick her on the treadmill.

208
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,220
Better yet,put a gun to her head
threaten to rape her.

209
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,390
You don't think I'm gonna get a response?

210
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,500
No.

211
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,630
You're on.50 bucks.

212
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not betting on a patient's--

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,250
100 bucks.If you say so.

214
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,480
Tracy, I'm increasing the speed a little.

215
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,650
My stomach really hurts.

216
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,150
Jeremy!You out there?

217
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,530
Talk to me!

218
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,540
You're doing great.

219
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,920
Isn't this enough?

220
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,630
I'm not getting anyallergic response yet.

221
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,120
Come on.Shut it off.

222
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,330
we don't complete the test,

223
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,740
my boss will just come down here and do it himself.

224
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,120
You do not want that.

225
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,210
she's in pain.Look at her.

226
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't want to have to ask you to leave.

227
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,640
You're gonna ask me to leave?Are you kidding me?

228
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,210
This is my wife.You guys aren't helping her.

229
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,200
You're just hurting her.

230
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,140
What? You guys have all this equipment in here

231
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,270
and you're not doing anything.

232
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,090
You guys can't figure out what's--

233
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,760
ow, it hurts!

234
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,670
Where?

235
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,830
In my stomach.And my chest.

236
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,390
It's foreman.Get me a wheel chair.

237
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,700
he's as sick as she is now.

238
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,190
told you it would work.

239
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,450
Worked on the wrong patient.

240
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,300
We could spend all day arguing right or wrong.

241
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,640
Give me the 100 bucks.

242
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,710
We didn't bet.

243
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,640
We could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not.

244
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,170
Give me the 100 bucks.

245
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Come on, foreman.Pay up, he won.

246
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,960
Or we could just never finish the ddx.

247
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,230
Husband's test showed no mi.

248
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,550
No aortic dissection.It's not his heart.

249
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,100
It's just non-specific chest and abdominal pain.

250
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,090
So, psychosomatic?Panic attack?

251
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,660
Pain persisted after he got lorazepam and morphine.

252
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,510
Whose locker is that?

253
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
Mine.

254
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,990
Chest,stomach, throat.What does it all mean?

255
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,910
We're in the nurses'locker room.

256
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,860
I know that.

257
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,120
That is so annoying.

258
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,130
Wilson's girlfriend's left her stuff in my locker again.

259
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,300
Great, I hadn't committed any felonies yet today.

260
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,100
Relax. You know who they're gonna blame.

261
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,530
House, you wanna mess with wilson, no problem.

262
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,100
But you got no reason to screw around--

263
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,290
can we get back to the medicine?

264
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,060
Okay.

265
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,770
Why assume one disease?

266
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,290
His chest, her throat.

267
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,600
So it's just a coincidence that they
both got crippling stomach pains.

268
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,350
Wow, they really area great couple.
So much in common.

269
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,500
One blue shoe.What do you think that means?

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,010
It means you're insane.Wilson's not dating her.

271
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,610
You feeling luckier?

272
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,130
Does it matter what I answer?

273
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,580
200 it is.

274
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,810
If they're married and caught the same disease,

275
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,310
then it means they--

276
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,050
Brochure to a jazz festival in the poconos this weekend.

277
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,110
Wilson likes jazz.Foreman, pay the man.

278
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,910
Four, five, six novels.No music.What does that mean?

279
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,010
She's literate.

280
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,710
It means she spends her leisure time
reading, not listening.

281
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,690
She'd only wanna go watch jazz

282
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,120
if the other person wanted to go.

283
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,470
She has a martyr complex.Issues of inferiority.

284
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,140
Married couple.Same disease.

285
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,060
They either got it from each other
or in the same place.

286
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,050
Infectious or environmental.

287
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,950
All we have to do is check out parasites,viruses,

288
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,200
bacteria,fungi, prions,radiation, toxins, chemicals,

289
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,280
or it's internet porn related.

290
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,430
I'll check the internet.

291
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,600
You guys cover the rest of the stuff.

292
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,420
If they can live here without killing each other,

293
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,170
they must really be in love.It's tiny.

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,590
How come it's taking you so long to search it?

295
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,390
Box of condoms in his jacket.

296
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,550
I know you're poor now,but buy your own.

297
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,670
She's on the pill.

298
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,910
Why would he need condoms?

299
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
No, put that back.

300
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,060
Why?

301
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,400
We show that to house,

302
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,200
he'll just call the guy a cheating bastard.

303
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,450
Look how he is with wilson.

304
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,270
He'd be right.Could be an std.

305
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,530
One that doesn't give them any
symptoms in their sexual organs?

306
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,020
They never mentioned anything.

307
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,450
Maybe they're embarrassed.

308
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,780
What else could it be?

309
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,900
You think they just like the sexy feel
of latex against their genitals?

310
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,180
Maybe the wife just wantsto be extra cautious.

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,540
Come on,you really believe that?

312
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,180
--Yeah. --Good.

313
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
Then I'm sure you'll have no problem convincing house.

314
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,050
--That cheating bastard. --He loves her.

315
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,120
Right.

316
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,370
I bet he told you that she's the love of his life.

317
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,080
People lie, I get it.

318
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
But they don't go up against two armed gunmen

319
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,690
to save someone unless they really--

320
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,490
there's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink

321
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,230
or work in the salt mines.

322
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,470
They're idiots.

323
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,740
20-year-olds fallin and out of love

324
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,370
more often than they change their oil filters,

325
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,890
which they should do more often.

326
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,810
Sorry.Ridiculous of me to draw a conclusion
based on actually observing them.

327
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,890
Should have just depended on your
misanthropic view of human nature.

328
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,830
gonorrhea explains all their symptoms.

329
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,080
Fitzhugh-curt is syndromefor her belly pain,

330
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,490
costochondritis and bladder infection
for his chest and abdominal pain.

331
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,210
Good.

332
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,430
Now go rub their lying,cheating privates with a cotton swab.

333
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,500
Why would you want to look at her?

334
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,540
Is this because of the condoms?

335
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,860
You found them in his jacket,figured
he was hiding something from me.

336
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,930
I thought I was pregnant last month.
Kind of freaked me out.

337
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,980
I'm way too young to have kids.

338
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,630
So you just wanted to be extra cautious.

339
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,360
Wish one of ushad figured that out,stuck to his guns.

340
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,380
We're still gonna check you both.

341
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,970
She's the only girlfriend I've ever had.
She's the love of--

342
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,940
please don't say it.

343
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,350
I can't say I love my wife?

344
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,490
We're still gonna test you.

345
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,540
What is it, I'm white?

346
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,140
Yeah, that's it.

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,350
Jeremy, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

348
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,800
Everybody thinks they're so liberal,

349
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,060
but I see how they look at us.

350
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,340
White and black.

351
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,920
Especially black.

352
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,770
I'm sorry, trace,but it's true.

353
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,610
Great.Prove us all wrong.

354
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,390
No scarring,no purulent discharge
and the naats were negative.

355
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,490
They don't have an std.

356
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,410
What's that you say?

357
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,460
You got a problem with interracial couples?

358
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,960
Thank you, chase.

359
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,170
No.Any of your shorties ever been whities?

360
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,100
Not sure I understand your ghetto slang, dr. House.

361
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,340
How many black women have you dated, by the way?

362
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,560
I don't care about color.

363
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,070
As long as they can help me breed a superior race.

364
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,950
Yeah, my exes have usually been black.So what?

365
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,040
It's not a racial thing.It's cultural.

366
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,580
I have more in common with them.

367
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,100
Like i assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.

368
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,000
Sorry, you're right.

369
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,250
That kind of prejudiceis totally fine.

370
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,860
The abdominal painis getting worse.

371
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,420
We've had to up their morphine twice.

372
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,270
Take the wife off the steroids.

373
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,100
If she spikes a fever,we'll know it's an infection.

374
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,880
If she doesn't,it's environmental.

375
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,840
He got off easy.

376
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,630
I almost gave him a colonos copy.

377
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,150
That was one of the stupidest things you have ever done

378
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,200
and there is heavy competition for--

379
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,600
what are you doing?

380
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,900
only ate half your breakfast.

381
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,520
Feeling a little sick this morning?

382
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm not pregnant.They burnt my omelet.

383
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,180
You need to apologize to this guy.

384
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm a man of principle.

385
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,440
I don't care how much time and money
it costs you to defend me.

386
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,810
He wants to kill you.

387
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,510
No empty coffee cups.Off the caffeine.

388
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,540
Good for baby.

389
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,040
Cups are in the other waste basket,baby's in your mind.

390
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
You can berate patients all you want

391
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,250
shoving objects into their rectums is assault.

392
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,910
Pay attention to me.

393
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,170
Sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you.

394
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,010
Can't ignore that rapidly expanding
first trimester ass, though.

395
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,110
Sometimes an assis just an ass.

396
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
You are not always right,house.

397
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,380
Apologize to the guy.

398
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,960
What are you doing here?

399
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,330
Stay away from my son.

400
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,930
How did you find us?

401
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,130
Stay away from that girl.

402
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,690
Leave him alone!

403
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,680
What happened?

404
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,090
She's dreaming.She started yelling.

405
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,420
You're breaking jeremy's arm!

406
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,820
No one's hurting him.

407
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,420
Baby, it's me.It's jeremY.

408
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,270
Tracy, tracy.

409
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,770
She's okay.

410
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,330
Baby, it was just a bad dream.Everything's okay.

411
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,950
Tracy.

412
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,600
Tracy?

413
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,960
It was an acutdelirium.

414
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,330
Well, she's talking, right?

415
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,090
I mean,she's coming out of it.

416
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,720
She's not really talking.

417
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,090
Just making sounds.

418
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,150
Okay, when is she gonna come out?

419
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,100
jeremy...

420
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,000
she's in a coma.

421
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,820
so her vitals are pretty stable.

422
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,760
But her response to stimuliis getting weaker

423
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,040
which means the coma is getting worse.

424
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,070
Her brain is slowly shutting down.

425
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,100
Can I see her?

426
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,290
We're getting some more images to
check for masses or infections.

427
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,310
I'll increase your morphine.

428
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,030
Her hallucination.

429
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,010
If you knew what it was

430
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,900
would that make any difference?

431
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,490
Medically, I mean.

432
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
Not usually.

433
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,620
Some cases, the form of a hallucination can

434
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,770
tell us what part of the brain is being hit.

435
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,620
I think it was about my dad.

436
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Your...your dad was breaking your arm?

437
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,720
He was a drunk,pill-popping racist.

438
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,180
He caught me sneaking into her house when we were 13.

439
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,900
She lived next door.

440
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,640
He broke my arm and threatened her.

441
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,100
We ran off when we were 16.

442
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,300
You still in touch with him?

443
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,100
Killed himself a couple of years ago.

444
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,900
It's not medical,I just thought blacks were the racist ones.

445
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,740
some generalized edema throughout.

446
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,850
And areas of increased signal
here, here, here,and here.

447
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,130
Damn.All over her brain stem.

448
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,950
Could be plaques,maybe hyperdensities from the edema.

449
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,580
Or tumors or anything.

450
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,520
We add brain involvement
to the chest,stomach, throat.What do we got?

451
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,390
Didn't spike a fever when we took off the steroids,

452
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,610
so it's not an infection.

453
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,590
Leaving environmental.What flavor?

454
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,050
Environmental doesn't make sense either.

455
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,780
If it's a toxin, we'd see it in their livers.

456
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,830
None of the neighbors are sick, no co-workers--

457
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,950
they both got it.

458
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,920
Means infection or environmental
and since it's not an infection...

459
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,760
what if they didn't both get it?

460
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,120
Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong,

461
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,340
and it's two different diseases.

462
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,030
Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.

463
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,420
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.

464
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,160
Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.

465
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,400
Fire fighters and residents of pine tar forests?

466
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,440
I did see these two putting out that
blaze in the pine barrens.

467
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,640
If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes

468
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,510
it has environmental causes.

469
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,150
We just don't know all of them yet.

470
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,010
Husband's chest.

471
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,990
He has slightly enlarged hilar lymphnodes.

472
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,370
Sarcoidosis explains almost all of their symptoms.

473
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,350
Including her getting worse off the steroids.

474
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,410
Doesn't explain his throat swelling.

475
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,670
That's what "almost" means.

476
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,310
90% of sarcoidosis cases have lung scarring.

477
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,150
Oh, 90?

478
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, "almost."

479
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,170
Fine.

480
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,000
Consult a specialist.

481
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,970
If this is more dating advice...

482
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,680
love to gossip,but I got work to do.

483
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,280
This sarcoidosis?

484
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,760
It's pretty non-specific.

485
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,290
Could be granulomas,could be plaques.What's this?

486
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,440
Oh, oh.You stole wendy'spersonnel file?

487
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,700
In a way, aren't we all guilty of bribing the

488
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,980
janitor to take her file and give it to me?

489
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes, i take my share of the blame.

490
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,930
But society's--

491
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,500
first of all,I'm not dating her.

492
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,390
She is so wrong for you.

493
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,680
You know, she filed a form so the hospital
would take extra withholding.

494
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,880
Who does that?

495
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,120
She's much too cautious for me.Point taken.

496
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,060
I'll--I'll start dating her,

497
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,190
so I can break up with her and start dating a stripper.

498
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,770
You're a miserable jerk who can't stand to be alone.

499
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,630
I didn't try to break up your marriages.

500
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,180
You did that yourself.

501
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,950
My marriages were so crappy
I was spending all my time with you.

502
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,820
Your real fear is me having a good relationship.

503
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes.It keeps me up at night.

504
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,770
That, and the loch ness monster
global warming, evolution,

505
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,770
and other fictional concepts.

506
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,490
Although, big romantic weekend in the
poconos could change everything.

507
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,100
You don't mean...no.

508
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,080
I don't think it's sarcoidosis.

509
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,140
He says it's sarcoidosis.

510
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,290
Start them both on methotrexate

511
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,470
and if you're wrong?

512
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,950
If wilson's wrong...

513
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,060
we'll biopsy her just to be sure.

514
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,120
Her brain stem?

515
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,710
Brain damage is not only possible, it's likely.

516
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,810
Good point.

517
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,960
Let's biopsy something safer.Like her shoes.

518
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,150
The husband,he'd have to give consent.

519
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,410
He can't right now.

520
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,450
Why? This guy write with his stomach?

521
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,050
He has a conflict of interest.

522
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,660
It's not his brain we're cutting open.

523
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,130
But he still gets all the benefit.

524
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,570
He'd do it just to save himself.

525
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,840
Or save her.

526
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,480
She's the love of his life,remember?

527
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,650
He never said that.

528
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,470
She needs a guardian ad litem.

529
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,150
I can't let you do this.

530
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,250
How are you gonna stop me?

531
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,400
Call cuddy?

532
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,150
Cameron's right.There's a conflict.

533
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,330
No, there isn'T.

534
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,440
Not unless one of them wants to die a horrible painful death.

535
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.

536
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,420
In a couple days.

537
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,430
Will the guardian convince the disease to
hold offeating her brain

538
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,530
so we can get the legalities worked out?

539
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,840
I just don't want some plaintiff's lawyer owning my hospital.

540
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,330
Legalities help.

541
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,950
Speaking of which,did you get your thermometer back yet?

542
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, we had a nice chat.

543
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,300
Did you know he's a rotarian?

544
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,890
Listen, she'll die without the biopsy.

545
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,670
I need to cover the hospital's ass.

546
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,290
You're too biased.

547
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,900
I send you in there, you'll steam roll over him.

548
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,210
Something goes wrong,he'll sue us
for not disclosing the risks.

549
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,960
Then have wilson talk to the husband.

550
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,800
Wilson kills people left and right
no one ever sues him.

551
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,970
Fine.

552
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,160
But only if you apologize to the clinic guy.

553
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,590
Probably better to just let that couple die.

554
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,170
I don't care if you mean it

555
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,850
just do it.

556
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,380
Unfortunately, we don't see any way around a biopsy.

557
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,280
We'll do all we can to minimize any damage.

558
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,220
no.

559
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,080
The methotrexate isn't showing any effects yet.

560
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,450
You could both be--

561
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,690
she's brilliant.

562
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,250
All in college while working full time.

563
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,040
I can't do that to her.

564
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,810
And if you both die?

565
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,780
You think she'd want that?

566
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,600
Do it on me instead.

567
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,780
It's not in your brain.

568
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,810
It will be.

569
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,980
It's the same disease, right?Do it then.

570
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,000
She could die before you show the symptoms.

571
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,590
Then stop treating me.

572
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,540
great job.

573
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,170
Why didn't you just shoot him in the head?

574
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,220
Hold on.That gives me an idea.

575
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,480
You know what could save this couple?

576
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,060
Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

577
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,940
They're dead.

578
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,600
Yelling at you might prevent you
from screwing up like this again.

579
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,140
I didn't screw up.I did my job.

580
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,620
Your job was to get me the biopsy.

581
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,450
No, it was to present the patient with his options.

582
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,540
Two options:Biopsy or no biopsy.

583
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,180
He chose a third,no treatment.

584
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,360
How do you even do that?

585
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,920
Remember when you used to just weave
elaborate conspiracy theories about my love life?

586
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,500
Those were such good times.

587
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,330
How much morphineis the husband on?

588
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,610
We can't increase it anymore.

589
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,330
His respirations are depressed.

590
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,890
Increase it?

591
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,190
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

592
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,130
Cold turkey the sucker.

593
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,550
Uh... no.

594
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,300
Good point.

595
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,520
Did I ask you guys to follow me?

596
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,400
no.

597
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,660
Which made us nervous.

598
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,410
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

599
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,570
Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.

600
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,240
No.

601
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,450
You do understand it's not really a puppy.

602
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,390
It's naloxone.

603
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,810
An opiate-blocker?

604
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,830
He'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire.

605
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,590
That's pretty unethical even for you.

606
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,680
How is that unethical?It'll lead to a diagnosis.

607
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,770
It's leading to the torture of the husband on the off-chance

608
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,400
he'll allow a procedure on another person.

609
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,560
Which will lead to a diagnosis.Didn't I just say that?

610
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,440
give it up.

611
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,330
Foreman and cameron are too ethical
and I'm too scared of getting sued.

612
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,320
Fine.

613
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm just gonna...

614
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,950
find some place safe to hide this.

615
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,510
So I won't be tempted to use it.

616
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,140
You're not doing it either.

617
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,270
What, are you gonna run for it?

618
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,810
If they die now,they'll never be able to grow old

619
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,970
and tired of each other.

620
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,980
We can't baby-sit house all day.

621
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,080
I'll tell cuddy to put a nurse by his room.

622
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,720
Damn it.

623
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,260
Atropine?

624
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,520
What happened to--?

625
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,580
He knew we'd stop him.

626
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,550
He stuck both of them in his pocket.

627
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,650
That's actually pretty clever.

628
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,030
Guess I can't use that trick again, huh?

629
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,440
Oh, my stomach!

630
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,390
It was a pretty smart plan, jerry.

631
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,140
But I'm on to you.

632
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,770
There's only one good reason to kill the biopsy.

633
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,450
You poisoned your wife,

634
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,360
and you don't want the coppers to get wise.

635
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,200
No!

636
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,340
Oh, all right.

637
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,750
Then you're just a moron.

638
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,900
Biopsy me.

639
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,120
Only if this thing hits your brain,you moron.

640
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,500
And I can't stress that "moron" part enough.

641
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,030
You're killing your wife.

642
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,970
She is the love of my life.

643
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,970
careful--

644
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,920
once she's dead and you're on wife number two,

645
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,030
you're gonna feel real guilty about saying that.

646
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,510
Feel that?

647
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,940
Get used to it.

648
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,830
Pain's gonna get a lot worse.

649
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,890
No, it won'T.

650
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,610
Morphine just isn't working right now for some reason.

651
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,910
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the meantime.

652
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,190
It'll work again soon.

653
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,480
Wanna bet?

654
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,570
I don't care about the pain.

655
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,110
I need to be in pain

656
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,500
because I have to get worse.
Means you can dothe biopsy on me.

657
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,140
Dude, she's in a coma.

658
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,780
Who are you trying to impress?

659
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,000
I'd die for her.

660
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,690
Give up.

661
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,900
Or we can wait for him to get all grown-up and cynical.

662
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,970
I was just gonna call you.

663
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,480
I need a court order to biopsy this woman's brain.

664
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,280
Speaking of litigation...

665
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,950
michael tritter.

666
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,740
You know dr. House.

667
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,590
You guys can talk here.

668
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,330
I don't want to sue you.

669
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,490
Good.

670
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,320
I wanna beat the crap out of you.

671
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,770
Less good.

672
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,140
And I'll tell you why.

673
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,920
You're a bully.

674
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,930
And bullies,they don't back down.

675
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,100
Until they run into someone stronger and meaner.

676
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,610
But you'll accept an apology.

677
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,100
Yes.

678
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,420
Not really a recipe for sincerity.

679
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm not looking for sincerity.

680
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,350
I'm looking for humiliation.

681
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,510
Something that will make you think twice

682
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,520
before you treat the next patient like crap.

683
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,660
Here's what's gonna happen.

684
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,790
You go brag to your friends about

685
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,490
how you made the big nasty doctor poop in his pants.

686
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,870
I get cuddy off my back by telling her
that I humiliated myself.

687
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,130
Here's the catch

688
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,260
We're both gonna be lying.

689
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,630
I'm not apologizing.

690
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,100
If anything, you deserved a bigger thermometer.

691
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,260
What's wrong?

692
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,250
Jeremy's worse.

693
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,650
Then that's what's right.

694
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,190
Cut the stubborn jerk's head open and take a slice.

695
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,250
It's not his brain.

696
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,750
Lactic acid's up to 39.

697
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,270
His intestines are rotting.

698
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,740
This isn't sarcoidosis.

699
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,990
Well, he'll get his wish.

700
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
He's dying.

701
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,300
It's just not in a way that's gonna help his wife.

702
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,510
coma's worse.She's losing response to stimuli.

703
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,040
He's vomiting blood, and his lactic acid's 45.

704
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,170
He's gotta have ischemic bel.

705
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,910
So what?

706
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,350
Well, let's see,

707
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,500
lack of blood flow is causing his guts to die

708
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,810
which will cause him to die,

709
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,690
unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine

710
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,140
and reattach the ends--I don't know.

711
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,020
Seems worth a mention.

712
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,880
Why does he have it?What does it tell us?

713
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,140
Small cell vasculitis?

714
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,730
Good, now let's hear it again,

715
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,270
but this time with a more environmental or infectious feeling.

716
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,730
Or, like I said before,it might
not be environmental or infectious.

717
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,710
He has vasculitis. She has porphyria.

718
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,680
Belly pain plus hallucinations:Classic symptoms.

719
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,110
Could even cause a coma.

720
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,610
Fine.

721
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,720
Start her on hematin for porphyria.

722
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,610
What about him?

723
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,210
Take out the dead bowel.

724
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,430
That's all we can do.

725
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,270
And biopsy it.

726
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,720
If foreman's right,it might save him.

727
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,800
If foreman's wrong,dead bowel might save both of them.

728
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,410
Bowel's not dead.

729
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,680
unless he's been tossing down frosty
cans of lactic acid,the bowel is deaD.

730
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,620
What we're looking for is a reason it's dead.

731
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,690
Bowel's not dead.

732
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,770
Just general swellingand edema.

733
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,320
High lactate was probably from stress.

734
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,890
We just sliced him openfrom chest to pubic bone for nothing.

735
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,480
Nothing is something.

736
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,870
Forget the ischemia.

737
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,770
Add the edema and swelling.

738
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,260
Probably fromcutting him open.

739
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,070
Probably, not definitely.

740
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,650
Okay, back to the beginning.

741
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,800
What did we talk about?

742
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,700
Anything.I wanna hear it all again.

743
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,910
Allergies.Doesn't fit at all now.

744
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,080
stds--maybe we got the wrong one.

745
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,520
What about syphilis?

746
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,490
Neurological symptoms--he wasn't cheating on her.

747
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,280
Yeah, yeah,"love of his life."

748
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,770
Don't you have to wait until he's dead

749
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,250
before you make that determination?

750
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,790
She's his only girlfriend ever.

751
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,970
They grew up next door,

752
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,010
they ran off together as teenagers.

753
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,490
Sarcoidosis--we only ruled it out

754
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,300
'cause we though the had ischemic--

755
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,450
why did they run off?

756
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,440
What difference does--

757
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,100
kids talk about running off.How many do it?

758
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,400
What was the reason?

759
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,180
they were trying to escape his
evilpill-popping,racist dad.

760
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,340
You would've liked him.

761
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,830
We should do another biopsy--

762
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,170
how do you know the dad was racist?

763
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,690
He beat up his son for dating a black girl.

764
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,770
I extrapolated from that.

765
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,700
You see racism everywhere.

766
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Maybe he just didn't like this black girl.

767
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
it's not sarcoid.We would have seengranulomas in his--

768
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,630
she has pretty eyes.

769
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,820
Forget infectious.

770
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,070
Forget environmental.

771
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,320
Defective dna is keeping them from making a critical protein.

772
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,310
Hence the fluid buildup.

773
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,410
It's the throat, stomach,chest and brain.

774
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,610
Angioedema?

775
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,650
Hereditary angioedema.

776
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,670
Symptoms fit perfectly.

777
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,350
It's an incredibly rare disease.

778
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,760
They both would have to have a parent--

779
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,720
is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair?

780
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,120
Or that these two have green eyes?

781
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,030
you're not saying...

782
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,360
they're not brother and sister.

783
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,410
Ew. God, no.

784
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,830
That would be sick.

785
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,350
Half-brother and sister.

786
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,080
Different moms.

787
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,260
Dad must have had an affair with her mom.

788
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,030
That's why he flipped out when the kids started dating.

789
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,150
He had it himself.

790
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,150
Probably why the pills.

791
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,290
We don't know for sure.

792
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,650
Testing for hae or paternity is gonna take a day.

793
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,160
She doesn't have a day.

794
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,650
Start treating and see what happens.

795
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,550
Any change?

796
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,090
Her response to stimuliis still just as weak.

797
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,750
I almost hope she stays in a coma.

798
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,590
That's sweet, cameron.

799
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,520
I'd like to avoid shattering both of their lives.

800
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,440
You don't think dying will do that?

801
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,260
It's just her oximeter.

802
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,500
Tracy.

803
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,330
Tracy.

804
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
She's awake.

805
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,600
Oh, god, baby.It's gonna be okay.

806
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,540
awesome!

807
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,830
Can I tell them?

808
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,170
We've obviously got to let them know what's wrong.

809
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,150
But the cause,the brother-sister thing...

810
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,610
good plan.

811
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,360
You just got to keep them away from...

812
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,040
doctors, the internet,

813
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,430
and anyone who's nota total moron.

814
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,020
Tell them.

815
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,780
Yesterday,he was willing to die to save her.

816
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,640
We've got to give them time to recover.

817
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,380
He might be a little vexed that

818
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,190
you kept letting him hump his sister in the meantime.

819
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,000
Tell them.

820
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,480
Unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union

821
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,330
the chances of serious complications are minimal.

822
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,370
Noble of you to take that risk.

823
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,530
Tell them or I will.

824
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,720
--so we just need to take these pills.
--Twice a day.

825
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,040
Angioedema's very treatable.You'll be fine.

826
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,510
So, what?

827
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,480
We, like, caught this from each other?

828
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,820
No.

829
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,290
It's a condition you both always had.

830
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,340
The onset of symptoms are sometimes caused by stress or trauma.

831
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,620
The incident at the diner.

832
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,110
So we got it as kids?

833
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,090
It's, um...

834
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,480
it's a genetic disease.

835
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
It's not--

836
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,970
there's no good reason two unrelated people would get it.

837
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,870
We think you guys should take a dna test.

838
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,050
How can we be related?

839
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,800
We think you have the same dad.

840
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,080
We don't know for sure until we do the tests.

841
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,840
Oh, god.

842
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,160
Your father...

843
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,750
no, no.

844
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,010
This can't--this can't be true.

845
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,120
Yeah, yeah--jer, jer, I'm lighter--

846
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
you know, I'm lighter than both my parents.

847
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,340
And our eyes.

848
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,530
Everyone always talks about how we have the same eyes.

849
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,470
You're not really siblings.

850
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,700
We have the same father!

851
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,770
You didn't fight in the backseat on car trips.

852
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,720
You didn't change each other's diapers.

853
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,170
You guys just...

854
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,300
met and fell in love.

855
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,470
The--the way you feel--

856
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,950
that...hasn't changed.

857
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,270
hey foreman,can you wear the beeper
for a couple of hours this weekend?

858
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,650
What?

859
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,430
We just destroyed two people's lives.

860
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,890
I'm not allowed to run errands anymore?

861
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,680
I'd like to see some sign that it affects you,

862
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,850
or that you recognize it affects other people.

863
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,490
So are you gonna wearthe beeper or not?

864
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
Sorry, I can'T.

865
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,040
You just want to punish me.

866
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,670
I'm busy.

867
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,620
With what?

868
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,600
I'm going out of town.

869
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,840
Where are you going?

870
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,880
Foreman...

871
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,650
you're not missing a blue shoe, are you?

872
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,730
Come--

873
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,550
you can't bet when you know the answer before hand.

874
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,420
We could spend all day arguing

875
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,640
whether you can bet when you know the answer before hand.

876
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,310
Give me the 200 bucks.

877
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,160
What?

878
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,490
Hey.Hey.

879
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,510
You okay?

880
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,560
I was just wondering.

881
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,420
You really like jazz?

882
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,000
I love it.

883
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,770
Are you lying?

884
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,700
I'm lying.

885
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,700
I want to spend time with you.

886
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,010
Is that so terrible?

887
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,180
No.

888
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,210
Maybe we shouldn't walk out together.

889
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,020
People see us leaving...

890
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,330
they gotta find out sometime.

891
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,220
Let me just meet you at your place.

892
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,350
She got her own room.

893
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,450
She just...needs some time alone.

894
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,130
You want me to hang out here a bit?

895
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,230
If you've come to return the thermometer, don't bother.

896
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,220
I've moved on.

897
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,120
If you'd actually read my chart,

898
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,670
you'd have known that I'm a cop.

899
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,190
You were going 40 in a 25 zone.

900
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,830
Oh, come on.

901
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,510
This isn't because I was speeding.
This is because I'm latino.

902
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,290
License, registration,proof of insurance.

903
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,750
Sorry.Cool jacket.

904
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,710
Only pockets for important stuff.

905
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,030
That's a shame.

906
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,230
50 buck ticket.

907
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,420
Is that your way of beating me up?

908
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,810
Or is that just the price for sticking something in you?

909
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,120
You took a pill while you were...
examining a patient.

910
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,430
That's serious addictive behavior.

911
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,740
I'm betting that you're holding right now.

912
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,240
I wasn't weaving,I'm not drunk.

913
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,250
You've got no reason to--

914
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,000
pupils dilated.

915
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,790
Appeared to be under the influence of a narcotic.

916
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,600
Would you mind turning around, please,

917
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,120
putting your hands behind your head?

918
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,060
Does that polite crapever work on people?

919
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,930
Most people...realize there's only one answer.

920
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,220
You got a prescription?

921
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,610
I'm a cripple who works in a hospital.

922
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,740
You don't think I can get a valid prescription?

923
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,650
Arrogant son of a bitch like you?

924
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
I bet you didn't bother.

925
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,190
You are under arrest...

926
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,450
for possession...of narcotics.

927
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,610
You have the right to remain silent,

928
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,020
which you should take advantage of for once in your life.

929
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,380
If you give up the right to remain silent,

930
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,580
anything you say can and will be used against you...
