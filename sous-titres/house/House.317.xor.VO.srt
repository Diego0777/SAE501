1
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:09,973
You've got this whole thing wrong, Emm'.

2
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,468
It's the rock star whose supposed to
be late, not the rock star photographer.

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,254
Sorry, morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

4
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:19,002
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

5
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,253
Come on. It's good luck.

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,574
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

7
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:31,446
So what do you think?

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,430
Uh, I think people aren't gonna get it.

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,003
Oh, come on. All-American Rejects.

10
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:41,434
Juxtaposing a classic image of
Americana with modern pop culture, you.

11
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:45,729
Oh, yeah,
everyone loves a good juxtaposition.

12
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,283
My fans were born in the '90s.

13
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,799
You know what? You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

14
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:53,682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:56,115
- Love the Rockwell thing.
- I thought so.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,890
Okay, kill the house lights, let's go.

17
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,742
Hang on. Hang on. Hey,
who's in charge of the backdrop? Naomi?

18
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:11,199
- Yeah?
- What's wrong with it?

19
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:14,445
Well, the words are completely jumbled.

20
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:16,513
What?

21
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:19,138
- You can read that?
- Of course.

22
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,410
- You okay?
- No. Oh, God.

23
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:24,652
I-- I could be having a-- a--

24
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,046
What's-- what's the mnemonic?

25
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,756
F... F is for face. Is my smile crooked?

26
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,472
What are you doing?

27
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:36,770
A... A is for arms. Arms...

28
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:39,923
You should really sit down.
Can somebody get her some water?

29
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:41,659
S is... S is speech.

30
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,644
I'm slurring... I'm slurring?

31
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:48,456
F-A-S-T.

32
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,816
T is time.

33
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:52,612
Hurry, somebody, uh...

34
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,887
Call 911, tell them I'm having a stroke!

35

36
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,712
Hi, I'm Dr. House.
My boss says you're important.

37
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,503
Personally, I don't get what's so hard

38
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,512
about making Scarlett
Johansson look pretty.

39
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:49,153
Arms out in front of you. Your palms up,
like you're holding a pizza.

40
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:50,587
Close your eyes.

41
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,203
It's so easy,
you should consider a career change.

42
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,415
Probably make a lot more money.

43
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,009
Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear?

44
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,152
Yes.

45
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,596
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine.

46
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:04,625
Yeah.

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,843
He didn't mention your pronator drift.

48
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,860
- What's that mean?
- It means Mackman is an idiot.

49
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,441
- May I?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,111
So.

51
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,207
You take thousands of photos of someone,
but only one has to look good.

52
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,468
Kinda the opposite of my business.

53
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,157
It's not about looking good.
People are always hiding things.

54
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,408
I just keep shooting until
I can see what's really inside them.

55
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:30,438
My eyes okay?

56
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,389
Eyes are gorgeous.

57
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:36,337
Vessels don't look so hot.
Microaneurysms predict further strokes.

58
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,004
This is gonna happen again?

59
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:40,355
Unless I can figure
out the underlying cause.

60
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,827
Puff up your cheeks.

61
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:45,781
You should be able to keep the air in.

62
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:47,667
It means there's weakness
around the mouth.

63
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,656
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

64
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:50,607
Oh, my, uh,

65
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:53,945
baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

66
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:57,931
He once told me the FAST mnemonic
could save my life one day, so...

67
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,255
Interesting pet name.

68
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,701
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

69
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,078
He's gay.

70
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:05,742
Just a sperm donor.

71
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,079
-So when you--
- You turned him for a night?

72
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,767
Just straight for one date?

73
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:11,747
Okay.

74
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:15,900
He took a magazine
and a cup into my bathroom.

75
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,493
Man after my own heart.

76
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,656
Different magazine, obviously.

77
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:22,456
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

78
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,150
My lackeys will be in to do some tests,

79
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,869
take some more blood,
and empty your catheter bag.

80
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:36,563
Not a moment you'll want to cherish.

81
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:41,473
This is definitely different.

82
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,814
It looks almost like...

83
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,842
He's caring.

84
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,337
Find anything else in the
patient's folder? Like a diagnosis?

85
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,795
Urinalysis revealed excessive
protein and red blood cells.

86
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,059
Chem panel showed a
creatinine level over 2.5, so.

87
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,310
First she strokes,
now her kidneys are shutting down-- why?

88
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,699
Ultrasound showed no tumors or stones,
no signs of fetal distress,

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,850
no urinary tract obstructions.
- BP is fine, no preeclampsia.

90
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,199
Any of you guys ever
been to the Galapagos?

91
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:18,109
Was our patient there?
Dengue fever, avian pox, even West Nile.

92
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:21,861
- No, I'm looking for a vacation spot.
- That mean we get vacation?

93
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,454
How would that differ
from your current status?

94
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,300
- You're gonna do what, relax?
- Visiting family.

95
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,826
My uncle's a giant turtle.

96
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,854
What if the kidney failure came first?

97
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,428
Kidneys could've caused the stroke,
not the other way around.

98
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:35,619
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm saying it threw a clot.

100
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,996
Early symptoms of kidney failure
are nausea, vomiting, ankle swelling.

101
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,859
She could've mistaken
it for morning sickness.

102
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,158
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than the kidney.

103
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,254
Echo was normal. History indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

104
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,586
No, but if one were
to read the history closely,

105
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,965
one would notice that
she had six cases of strep.

106
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,044
In her throat. That's the
one about ten inches above the heart.

107
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:57,631
Let me rephrase.
Six cases of untreated strep.

108
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,369
She was prescribed antibiotics.

109
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,984
No one takes them all. They
stop when they start feeling better.

110
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,439
All strep is untreated strep.
What happens when strep goes untreated?

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,785
It leads to rheumatic fever.

112
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,418
- Which leads to... Cameron?
- Mitral valve stenosis.

113
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,227
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... kidney?

114
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,923
No. Kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.

115
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,445
We'll go look at the heart.

116
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,506
It'll be easy to find.

117
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:23,906
It's the big red pumping thing
about ten inches below her throat.

118
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,139
That was weird.

119
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:29,561
- He was the way he always is.
- Which is weird.

120
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,073
- Very still, Emma.
- Sorry.

121
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,610
No problem.

122
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,828
He caught us with your hand up my shirt.
He's gotta have a reaction to that.

123
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,633
You think that's what the vacation is?

124
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:43,352
Yes. The pain of losing
you is obviously forcing him away.

125
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:45,323
Coronal slice appears normal.

126
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:49,170
There's no way House just lets this
slide. He's gotta be planning something.

127
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:50,921
Maybe he just doesn't give a crap.

128
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:52,884
Sagittal slice is clean.

129
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,668
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

130
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,161
He knew we were there,
and he wanted us to know that he knew.

131
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,530
Or you wanted him to know, now he does,

132
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:01,796
and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

133
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:03,276
Right there.

134
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,708
Transaxial slice,
calcified mitral valve.

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,268
Barely. That's not
big enough to throw a clot.

136
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,919
Obviously it is, because it did.

137
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,702
House was right.

138
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:14,872
A valve in your heart is narrowed.

139
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,663
It caused the clot
which led to your stroke,

140
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,587
and the reduced circulation
caused the problems with your kidneys.

141
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,359
And this'll fix it?

142
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:26,796
The balloon will force the
valve back open. And you'll be fine.

143
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,778
Can I do this without a sedative?

144
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:31,555
It's very mild,
there really is no risk to the fetus.

145
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:34,126
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

146
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:37,432
We won't allow it to decrease
anywhere near dangerous levels.

147
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,117
- Thank you.
- You're both gonna be fine.

148
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,398
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

149
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,944
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

150
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,702
Start threading the catheter.

151
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:07,928
No, I don't want a layover in Frankfurt,
Taipei, Singapore, or London, Ontario.

152
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,653
That's why I asked for
a direct flight to Phnom Penh.

153
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,054
How hard is it to not land?

154
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:15,955
Does it matter what I answer?
Then fine, I'd be delighted to hold.

155
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,076
What's new?

156
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,661
Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?

157
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:19,896
It's her job. What's new?

158
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,562
Good news is Emma's heart is fixed.

159
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:24,849
Bad news is it's not her underlying
problem. Her kidney's are still failing.

160
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,215
You're vacationing in Cambodia?
You gonna unwind in the killing fields?

161
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,198
Nope, gonna catch me a fish this big.

162
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:33,402
Mekong giant catfish,
weighs over 600 pounds.

163
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,168
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

164
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,324
That's why it's my
last chance to catch one.

165
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:40,953
If the mitral valve had been properly
fixed, the kidney should be getting

166
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,010
better. Which leads us to the conclusion
that you screwed up the procedure.

167
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,322
Or you screwed up the diagnosis.

168
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,745
The mitral valve thickening
was so small, it probably wasn't

169
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,920
the cause of the kidneys or the stroke.
Probably never would've been a problem.

170
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,281
She needs dialysis,
and we need a new theory.

171
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,208
There are only a few possibilities.

172
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,856
Patient's pregnant, could be
preeclampsia. We eliminated it before--

173
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,557
Check for proteinuria
and low platelets-- what else?

174
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,081
Hypoperfusion, the fetus is
basically a parasite stealing nutrients,

175
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,927
minerals, blood.
- Put her on telemetry.

176
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:11,115
Or the pregnancy's irrelevant.
Could be infection, sepsis, HUS/TTP.

177
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,494
A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

178
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,262
Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down

179
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,126
and clog up the small
vessels in the kidneys.

180
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,156
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

181
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,885
That's it, has to be one of those five.

182
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,295
You know what would be even better?

183
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,519
If we could narrow
it all the way down to one.

184
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,281
Thank you for holding.

185
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:32,045
We are experiencing extremely high call
volume. Thank you for your patience.

186
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,860
She's 0 for 5.

187
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,946
Either the differential was wrong,
or she's faking it.

188
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,516
Kidney failure has to be precipitated--

189
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,350
By one of the five
we've already ruled out.

190
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:51,861
The body only has so many
ways of screwing with the kidneys.

191
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:52,795
The labs must be wrong.

192
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,846
We did the labs. No one else had access.

193
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,571
That's not quite true.

194
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:07,495
You put all your patients through this
many tests, or just the important ones?

195
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,700
We wanted to explore
all the possibilities.

196
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:15,977
And?

197
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,609
We've eliminated all the possibilities.

198
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:21,217
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

199
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:22,968
Your body is functioning properly.

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,910
So why are my kidneys failing?

201
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:27,932
The other body isn't.

202
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,087
There's something wrong with the fetus.

203
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,636
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

204
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:48,912
Mom's body is like an
intricate German metro system.

205
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,899
All the trains run on time.

206
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,168
When she gets pregnant, it's like
a new station opening in Dusseldorf.

207
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:58,513
Bunch of rookies running things,
bound to be mistakes.

208
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:00,705
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

209
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:03,271
Before you know it, trains
are backed up all the way to Berlin,

210
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:05,625
and you got a bunch of
angry Germans with nowhere to go.

211
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,474
And we all know that
ain't good for the Jews.

212
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,945
Who are the Jews in this metaphor?

213
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,837
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

214
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,264
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth, very sick baby, or,

215
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:18,434
on rare occasion, a time bomb
that kills Mom while it's dying.

216
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,318
Good news is,
we fix the fetus, Mom gets better.

217
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,170
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

218
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:27,389
I've read the outcome of mirror
syndrome is almost always unfavorable.

219
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,179
Unfavorable...
is that doctor speak for dead baby?

220
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,176
You think she'll be less
upset if you phrase it nicely?

221
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:37,725
We can tell her the truth, that she'll
be fine as soon as we diagnose a person

222
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,250
who weighs about one pound.

223
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:42,657
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.

224
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,629
If only there existed giant machines
that could look through human skin.

225
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,758
Mirror syndrome has a
limited number of known causes.

226
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,662
Tachyarrhythmia,
fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma--

227
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:53,963
All of which are fixable.

228
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,436
Which would be un-unfavorable, right?

229
00:11:56,437 --> 00:12:00,922
Could also be trisomy 13, Ebstein's
anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen's vein--

230
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,773
Then Dr. Storm Cloud rained
all over the differential and

231
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,591
killed the beautiful little baby.

232
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,970
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix, so let's start there.

233
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,682
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look at the fetus' heart?

234
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:16,156
It was in the range, but blurry.
The fetus was moving all over the place.

235
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,407
So we need another scan.

236
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:20,297
Yeah, we'll just ask the
fetus to lie very, very still.

237
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,986
No need. I'm going to paralyze it.

238
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,272
You want to paralyze Emma Sloan's baby?

239
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,498
Let me guess. Cameron?

240
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,947
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

241
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:35,748
No, Cameron had concerns.
Chase just agreed with her

242
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,848
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass to her love rug.

243
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,184
They're sleeping together?

244
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:43,685
If by sleeping together you
mean having sex in the janitor's closet.

245
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,713
Here?

246
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,323
No, the janitor's closet at
the local high school. Go, Tigercats!

247
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,947
Do you have one of those camera phones?

248
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,292
'Cause I got a MySpace account.

249
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,543
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

250
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:57,894
Oh, come on, let's gossip some more.
I'm sure she's into bondage.

251
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,341
Paralyzing a one-pound
baby risks damaging--

252
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,877
Not paralyzing the thing risks
not getting a clean MRI of its heart.

253
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:07,578
Which we need to save its life,
which we need to do to save Emma's life.

254
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:12,061
- You're gonna need to get her consent.
- That shouldn't be too hard.

255
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,161
Sign here or you and your baby both die.

256
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:16,846
I'm going with you.

257
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:19,828
Oh, good.

258
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:23,922
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

259
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,189
The injection goes
into the umbilical cord.

260
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,033
The baby won't feel a thing.

261
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,492
Fetus.

262
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:32,932
I'm lowering expectations.

263
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:34,890
It works here and on dates.

264
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,211
The benefits outweigh the risks,

265
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,762
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

266
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:44,013
Must be easier to hear you
might die than your baby might die.

267
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:49,954
But if there's anyone I would trust
to save my baby, it would be Dr. House.

268
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,589
Fetus.

269
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,203
Hold this.

270
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,019
Dr. Cameron. The MRI results back?

271
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,883
The fetus' heart is structurally sound.

272
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,314
The problem's with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

273
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:34,223
Let me see.

274
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:36,403
Bladder's so engorged,
it's taking up the whole torso,

275
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:39,310
squeezing all the other organs. There's
no room for the lungs to develop.

276
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,213
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

277
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,978
We can fix that by inserting a shunt.
I'll give Emma the news.

278
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:45,629
Are you... taking over the case?

279
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,220
House won't care. He has his diagnosis.

280
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,223
Dr. Cameron.

281
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,634
Dating Chase...
can only end in one of two ways.

282
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:57,790
House told you?

283
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,295
You get married and live happily
ever after, or somebody gets hurt

284
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,210
and you two can't work together,
and I have to fire somebody.

285
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,824
I would hate to see my personal
life become such a burden to you.

286
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,398
I'm telling you this for your own good.

287
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,942
I assume you're gonna do the same
with Chase for his own good.

288
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,393
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

289
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,375
There's only room for one.
Though I could scooch over.

290
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:35,505
- My social life is my social life.
- Couldn't agree more.

291
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,530
What goes on in the privacy
of a janitor's closet is

292
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:39,564
nobody's business except--

293
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,442
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

294
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,296
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

295
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:46,025
- What are you doing?
- Trying to avoid altitude sickness.

296
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,813
Couldn't score a direct
flight to Cambodia,

297
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,230
so I've decided to scale Argentina's
infamous Mount Aconcagua.

298
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,288
Perfect, except for the
fact that you can't walk.

299
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,512
There's a tribe of Mocovi Indians
who actually carry the elders--

300
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:59,209
- You're insane.
- I'm an insane genius.

301
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,965
Set the chamber to low
pressure instead of high.

302
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,558
Thinner air builds up extra red
blood cells, creates new capillaries.

303
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:09,007
Few more days in here, I can
save myself six weeks in base camp.

304
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,044
Where's my MRI?

305
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,359
There's a blockage in the urinary tract.

306
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,381
Simple terms, your baby can't pee.

307
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,426
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

308
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:21,549
Well, can you fix it?

309
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,455
We can insert a small tube in
the baby's bladder that makes the urine

310
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:28,405
come out straight through his
belly for the duration of the pregnancy.

311
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:31,888
The bladder decompresses, and the
lungs will be able to develop normally.

312
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,439
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

313
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,468
First we just have to do a test

314
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:39,741
to determine whether the baby's
kidneys are functioning properly.

315
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,142
A- and what if they're not?

316
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:45,015
If they're already too damaged,
then there's really nothing we can do.

317
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:48,355
If this doesn't work out,
you can always try again.

318
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:54,635
I miscarried twice when I was married.

319
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,910
After the divorce, I tried in vitro,
like, four times before this.

320
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:00,956
I'm 42.

321
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,310
Maybe it's, uh, just not meant to be.

322
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:12,494
What are you doing?

323
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,809
You're trying to be me,
so I thought I'd try to be you.

324
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,877
- You don't have the cleavage for it.
- But I have a much tighter ass.

325
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,428
You think every day should be
naked Thursday, or is that an oxymoron?

326
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:25,956
Let me see the results
of the bladder tap.

327
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,057
They aren't back yet.

328
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,919
- They're gonna be inconclusive.
- You think my diagnosis is wrong?

329
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,569
Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid
should be low. Mom's level is fine.

330
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:35,873
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

331
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,827
Could just mean we caught
the obstruction early.

332
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:39,705
Either way,
your tests will be inconclusive.

333
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:42,737
The urine you collected has been sitting
in that fetus' bladder for weeks.

334
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:46,123
And as my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

335
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,987
Fine, then I'll do another tap.
Just as useless.

336
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,816
Old urine drops down from the
kidney right after the first tap 'cause

337
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:56,418
it's all backed up. Bladder tap number
three will give you the freshest pee,

338
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,413
and it's when you'll find out if
this fetus has even a fighting chance.

339
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:02,370
Thank you. I'll run two more taps.

340
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:05,429
Since when does the Dean
of Medicine run bladder taps?

341
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,721
- She's an important patient.
- Because she takes pictures?

342
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,357
Or because she's you?

343
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:14,335
A woman in her 40s. Single.

344
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,512
Using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

345
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,709
And you wanna make sure she succeeds,
so you'll still have hope.

346
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,450
Can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

347
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:30,178
- It's your file.
- I don't want it.

348
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:32,295
Then why did you
just say all that stuff?

349
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,289
To humiliate you.

350
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,101
- You're taking the case back.
- I don't want it.

351
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:38,142
Your diagnosis is right.
I wanna go on vacation.

352
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:40,543
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

353
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,309
Good news.

354
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:50,598
The fetus' urine had appropriate
levels of protein and electrolytes,

355
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,149
so his kidneys aren't damaged.

356
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:57,494
We're gonna put the shunt in,

357
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,534
your baby's lungs should
have more room to grow,

358
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,235
and your symptoms should go away.

359
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:05,094
But he'll still need
surgery after he's born?

360
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,795
That's when we'll remove
the blockage in the ureter.

361
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,048
You'll be the only mother
on the planet who appreciates

362
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,816
the value of a wet diaper.
- Hey, could you hand me that?

363
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:16,363
I'm keeping a visual memory
book of this entire surreal process,

364
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,368
and this is the best
part of the story so far.

365
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,781
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

366
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:22,913
When did you take this?

367
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:27,016
Oh, she did the second bladder tap.
You should keep it.

368
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,768
Oh, I see her all day at work,
I don't need it.

369
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,314
Maybe you wanna see her after work.

370
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:35,577
I'm right, right?

371
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,441
I saw the way you look at her.

372
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,101
Thanks.

373
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,394
Shunt is in the right position.

374
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,991
The bladder's starting to decompress.

375
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:06,118
No infection.

376
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,844
Did House say anything else? About us?

377
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:14,839
I thought you didn't care about his
reaction. Trying to make him jealous?

378
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,085
I like my job.

379
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,469
He can't fire you just
because we're together.

380
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,320
We're not together,
and House can do whatever he wants.

381
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:26,047
How's my baby?

382
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,074
Doing just fine, Emma. So are you.

383
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:29,853
My stomach is killing me.

384
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,133
That's not her stomach.

385
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:36,054
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

386
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:40,641
What is it?

387
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:45,705
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

388
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:50,666
Figures. I just booked
my trip to Johnston Strait.

389
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:53,707
I thought you were climbing
mount whatever in Argentina.

390
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,531
Apparently I'd have to live
with the Mocovi Indians for 20 years

391
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,015
before they'd consider me an elder.

392
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:00,436
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead.

393
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,819
- No legs required.
- Can't leave yet.

394
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,317
Liver failure puts her
case back in the unsolved pile.

395
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:08,306
Increased AST,
ALT, and her bilirubin's off the charts.

396
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:11,637
Even fetuses lie.

397
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:18,091
We diagnosed a lower urinary
tract obstruction because we saw one.

398
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,403
What if that's not the whole story?

399
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:25,135
What if the little
bugger is hiding something?

400
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,045
Real reason for the mirror syndrome.

401
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,230
Have we looked under its bed?
Have we checked its diary?

402
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:35,376
If it's not GU, it could be the heart.
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

403
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,209
- There were no structural problems.
- Lungs.

404
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,697
We won't be able to get a good
look until they develop. Weeks.

405
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,329
- He's not gonna last weeks.
- What do you wanna do?

406
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,228
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one surefire cure.

407
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:47,297
Deliver the fetus.

408
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:50,152
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

409
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,067
Fetus.

410
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,385
Semantics make you feel better?
Pretend it's not a person?

411
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:54,991
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

412
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,861
Can it take pretty pictures?

413
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,941
Who wants to tell her?

414
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:10,554
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

415
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,389
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

416
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:17,564
Well, can't you deliver him?

417
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:20,822
Put him on a respiratory machine
till-- till you figure out what's wrong.

418
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:21,773
We can.

419
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:23,211
It won't matter.

420
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:27,772
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away from being viable.

421
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:31,923
Oh, well, I'll suffer through
this for two more weeks, then.

422
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:37,634
You're on dialysis for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

423
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,978
They don't make dialysis for your liver.

424
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,395
You're not gonna make it two more days.

425
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,537
I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.

426
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:56,480
It's killing you.

427
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,173
I'm not having an abortion.

428
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,790
It's not a baby. It's...

429
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,216
a tumor.

430
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,230
I understand dying for a cause,

431
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,707
sacrificing your life
so your child might live.

432
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,295
But that's not the choice here.

433
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,044
Either it dies, or you both die.

434
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:24,391
Or you fix him, and we both live.

435
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,841
I can't fix it.

436
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:33,281
- I'm scheduling a D and C.
- I won't consent.

437
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:39,143
So I guess you have
two days to figure it out.

438
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:50,779
Her kidneys are almost irreparable.
She's developed severe DIC.

439
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,458
You have to force her to terminate.

440
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,168
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed the baby's lung development?

441
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:58,653
No, I dropped an anvil on its
chest to prevent lung development.

442
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,321
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race one fetus at a time.

443
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:05,213
Give the lungs more time to
expand so you can see inside them,

444
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:08,141
see if they're the problem.
- My real patient is dying.

445
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,896
Very quickly. Like, I wouldn't
advise her to buy any green bananas.

446
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:14,464
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

447
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:15,913
Removing it is an instant cure.

448
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,728
You're not gonna get
Emma to see it that way.

449
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:19,234
She's probably already named the baby.

450
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,061
Read him books,
had conversations with him.

451
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,012
- You get it.
- She'll listen to you.

452
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,012
No.

453
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:28,124
You let this woman refuse to terminate,
you're helping her commit suicide.

454
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,626
As her doctor,
my recommendation is against suicide.

455
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,470
If the baby had a doctor,
I think she would recommend

456
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,017
exhausting all possibilities
before taking its life.

457
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,718
- Then she'd be an idiot.
- Too bad she's your boss.

458
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,841
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

459
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:43,833
It isn't.

460
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,025
If we assume she doesn't
have mirror syndrome,

461
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,660
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna help her liver at all.

462
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,423
We eliminated all other possibilities.

463
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:54,561
The fetus is hydropic and in distress.
Emma's kidneys and liver are failing.

464
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,013
The diagnosis is solid.

465
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:01,413
The ass-kisser won't agree with you.
You must be even wronger than I thought.

466
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,449
Fine.

467
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,166
Let's assume she had mirror syndrome,

468
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,797
but we fixed it when
we fixed the baby's bladder.

469
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:11,757
That means that her failing
liver would be completely unrelated.

470
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,359
If it is, we can fix it.
And we don't have to terminate.

471
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,836
So her theory is that
our patient's liver problems

472
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,955
were just a giant coincidence.

473
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,605
It's not a surprising coincidence.

474
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,656
Pregnant women can
develop liver problems.

475
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:28,430
If this is the case,
we can actually do something here.

476
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,238
Don't you guys think
that's worth exploring?

477
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,339
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

478
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:35,494
Thank you.

479
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:36,989
Brown-noser.

480
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,286
Viral hepatis, HELLP syndrome.

481
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:45,096
Oh, look, sticking up for your
girlfriend. Who says chivalry's dead?

482
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,403
He's not joking?

483
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:50,319
Be patient.

484
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:54,064
She's going through all of us,
she'll get that jungle fever eventually.

485
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,635
I'm not going through anyone.

486
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:57,337
You love him?

487
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:00,345
This can probably wait until
after you biopsy Emma's liver, right?

488
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:02,196
We can't, her platelets are too low.

489
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:06,043
Once we pierce her liver, it'll be
next to impossible to stop the bleeding.

490
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:10,485
Come in from above. Instead of
going straight in through her abdomen,

491
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,573
go in through the veins in her neck.
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

492
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:18,736
If the liver starts to bleed, it'll
bleed right back into her own veins.

493
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,218
Why don't you start your vacation now?

494
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,249
Threading the guide wire through
the right internal jugular vein.

495
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,200
So...

496
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,009
The sleep lab?

497
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,217
You and Cameron not sleeping.

498
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,203
How serious is it?

499
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,207
It's nothing.

500
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,067
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

501
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:55,130
- Then why are you doing it?
- Are you kidding?

502
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,531
Approaching the inferior vena cava.
Slow down.

503
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,202
You better not hurt her.

504
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,513
- She already has a big brother.
- She does?

505
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:06,770
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

506
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:09,171
I'm not protecting her,
I'm protecting myself.

507
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,743
A heartbroken, lovesick Cameron...

508
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,514
would be even more
unbearable than she is now.

509
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,274
You're through the hepatic vein.

510
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,225
Firing the needle.

511
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,400
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

512
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:24,617
Fetus' heart rate just dropped to 50.

513
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:29,252
- We've got contractions.
- Pre-term labor.

514
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:30,692
Start a terbutaline drip.

515
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,019
We were able to control the
pre-term labor with tocolytics.

516
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
The contractions have subsided for now.

517
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:48,065
And the liver biopsy was negative.
This is definitely mirror syndrome.

518
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,294
- Her baby's doing this to her.
- We're out of options.

519
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,007
Did the biopsy cause the pre-term
labor or did it happen on its own?

520
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,185
It doesn't make a difference.

521
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:57,617
Pre-term labor can be a new symptom.
New information gives us new theories.

522
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:59,673
- Isn't that how it works?
- Not in this case.

523
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:03,320
Her body's trying to do what you refuse
to. Get the baby out and save itself.

524
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:05,522
Patient's transaminases
are ten times normal.

525
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:07,642
Her liver's on the verge
of shutting down completely.

526
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,623
- A torch test could--
- We don't have time for more tests.

527
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,570
We have to terminate or she'll die.

528
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:15,756
Then let's work faster.

529
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:19,408
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you hope real hard.

530
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:21,603
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

531
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:24,386
The only organ we haven't been
able to look inside is its lungs.

532
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:25,814
The problem must be in there.

533
00:28:25,815 --> 00:28:28,789
We haven't been able to see
inside because they're underdeveloped.

534
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,630
We've already got
her on corticosteroids,

535
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:31,864
but it'll take weeks for them--

536
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,661
Then let's drown
them in corticosteroids.

537
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,784
Multiple courses,
speed up their development.

538
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:38,896
Giving the baby more than one course
will suppress adrenal gland function.

539
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,928
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

540
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,145
- Worse than death?
- Emma's already on tocolytics.

541
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,224
The combination could
put her into pulmonary edema.

542
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,602
You'll just kill her faster.

543
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,139
It's the only chance we
have to see inside those lungs.

544
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,090
We're just gonna have to make the baby
better faster than we make Emma worse.

545
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:57,014
Come on, this is the kind
of thing House does every day!

546
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,515
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

547
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,131
I'll do it myself.

548
00:29:10,673 --> 00:29:13,498
- Anybody gonna stop her?
- Stopping the madness is her job.

549
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,499
Somebody's gotta be Cuddy's Cuddy.

550
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:26,406
Nurse!

551
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:32,901
Pulmonary edema?

552
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:34,352
Who tattled? Doesn't matter.

553
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:37,990
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses of corticosteroids.

554
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:38,941
Gee, thanks.

555
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,839
It's time to terminate.

556
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,343
- That's not what she wants.
- Look at her.

557
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:47,638
She didn't want to be an incubator for a
dead baby, but that's what you've done.

558
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,110
Either get me a laryngoscope or get out.

559
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:33,801
You were right.

560
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:35,654
You were all right.

561
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,275
Now the mom's lungs are shutting down.

562
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,470
She's dying faster than
the baby's lungs are developing.

563
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,878
I had to stop the corticosteroids.

564
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:46,455
Have you spoken to the family?

565
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:48,624
The only family she's got is that baby.

566
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,480
Well, he's biased.

567
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:55,251
- What do you think House would do?
- House wants to terminate.

568
00:30:55,942 --> 00:31:00,202
I mean if he didn't. If he shared my
position, what do you think he would do?

569
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,022
He wouldn't share your pain.

570
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:03,636
He'd be objective.

571
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,221
Right.

572
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,916
- He would prioritize his problems.
- He'd terminate.

573
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,986
He wouldn't be afraid of screwing with
her lungs if there was a bigger issue.

574
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:16,027
There is no bigger issue.
She needs her lungs.

575
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:18,619
Not right now.
She's already on a respirator.

576
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:22,419
The machine is breathing for her.
I can do whatever I want to her lungs.

577
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,481
If you're playing catch in the living
room and you break your mother's vase,

578
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:28,005
you may as well keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

579
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:31,347
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe without that vase.

580
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,673
I'm putting her back on corticosteroids.

581
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:41,322
It worked.

582
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,696
What worked?

583
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:45,197
I got the baby's lungs to expand.
We should be able--

584
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:47,448
Cab's on its way.
I have to finish packing.

585
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:53,490
I have a whole new appreciation for
what you do. How hard it is to believe

586
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:55,855
when everyone around you
is telling you that you're wrong.

587
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:57,285
Helps to know they're idiots.

588
00:31:58,162 --> 00:31:59,512
Do you think I'm an idiot?

589
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:01,582
You're not objective.

590
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:05,187
But you're not an idiot.

591
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,398
These lungs are still two
weeks away from being viable.

592
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,599
- But big enough for a diagnosis.
- These tissue buds are new.

593
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:17,299
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

594
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,007
or diaphragmatic eventration.

595
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,995
I was thinking bronchogenetic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

596
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:23,819
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

597
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,225
What about--

598
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,005
Move.

599
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,470
I thought you started your vacation.

600
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:41,253
Somebody had to save
our boss' rotundus ass.

601
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,500
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

602
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:45,828
Small buds in the lungs could indicate--

603
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:48,018
Thanks, got that multiple
choice all worked out.

604
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,295
Question is, how do we pick between A,
B, C, D and none of the above?

605
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,693
Portable MRI's in her room.
We could get a current image--

606
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:56,959
Fetal lungs are so tiny, an
MRI won't give us the details we need.

607
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,876
What would we do if this
patient were not just a tadpole?

608
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:03,878
- Say it was an actual person.
- He... is a person.

609
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,272
Thanks for playing along.

610
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,404
Pretend it's a one-pound adult.

611
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,847
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

612
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,996
How would we get a better
look at what's in the lungs?

613
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:15,747
- Transesophageal echo.
- Can't access its esophagus.

614
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,558
High-resolution CT
could give us a clearer--

615
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,678
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

616
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:22,942
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

617
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:25,398
You're not me. Collaborate.

618
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,891
A ventilation perfusion
scan would be next.

619
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,971
How do we get a fetus to breathe
in a radioactive isotope? Idiot.

620
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,607
If it were really a person
and we had no other options,

621
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:39,408
we'd do an exploratory surgery. Cut
into its chest and have a look around.

622
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,690
Let's do that.

623
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:44,835
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

624
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:46,436
I'll put it back when I'm done.

625
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:53,050
Me again. Your friendly
neighborhood belly-squirter.

626
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:56,056
We're gonna do open fetal surgery.

627
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:59,439
We open the uterus,
cut out the fetus so we can look around.

628
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,506
I know you can't talk, so I need
you to look petrified if you consent.

629
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,654
The umbilical cord won't be cut.

630
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:09,714
During surgery, your body will basically
serve as the baby's heart-lung machine.

631
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:13,364
We find what's wrong and we fix it.
If we can.

632
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,632
Don't lower expectations
if you want them to do something.

633
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,020
She should know what she's facing.

634
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:26,336
This is incredibly dangerous.
It risks both your lives.

635
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,742
The only reason why we're suggesting it

636
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,943
is because there's
nothing else we can do.

637
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:58,472
You all here for the fetal surgery?
We are way over capacity.

638
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:01,069
Mind each other's personal space.

639
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,158
There are sharp implements in the room.
Like this one.

640
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,174
Uterus is fully exposed.

641
00:35:23,756 --> 00:35:24,706
And we're in.

642
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,930
Start draining the amniotic fluid.

643
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,736
Have you never sucked
beer out the bottom of a keg?

644
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:34,687
Where'd you go to college? Gimme that.

645
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,207
Affix the pulse ox to the palm.

646
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:13,208
Sorry.

647
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,694
I just realized I forgot to TiVo Alien.

648
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,239
Fetal heart rate good, stats are stable.

649
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:28,738
Position him for the incision.

650
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,635
All right, I see three well-defined
lesions. It's definitely CCAM.

651
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,499
I should be able to resect them.

652
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:44,773
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

653
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,064
Charging.

654
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,366
Clear!

655
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,641
I'm clear.

656
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:56,779
Looks like asystole,
paddling's not gonna do anything.

657
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,959
It's fine V-fib! I'm going again. Clear!

658
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:03,785
We're gonna lose them both. Clamp.

659
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:07,548
The surgery's not doing this to her,
the fetus is.

660
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,191
Step away, House, I'm going again.

661
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:12,692
The only way to save her is
to cut away the anchor holding her down.

662
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:15,155
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

663
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:16,986
Clear!

664
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,580
Going again. Clear!

665
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:25,889
Heart rate's returning to normal.

666
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,696
Continue with the lobectomy.

667
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:44,076
So my kidneys, liver,
and lungs are all fine? Just like that?

668
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,187
Just like that.

669
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,750
That's amazing.

670
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,527
What's amazing is how
blond your baby's hair is.

671
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:56,105
My baby?

672
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,848
You know, the thing in your
belly that tried to kill you.

673
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,799
You've never called him a baby before.

674
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:10,011
- Any pain?
- Nothing I can't deal with.

675
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:14,567
You can only get out of bed to pee,
poo, or shower. And absolutely no sex,

676
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,589
so stop flirting with me.

677
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:19,409
Sorry.

678
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,931
So this really worked? He'll be...

679
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:25,763
normal?

680
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,442
If you call being born twice normal.

681
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,261
Hey, thank you.

682
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:40,697
Don't thank me.

683
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:43,261
I woulda killed the kid.

684
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:53,388
Wanna grab a bite?

685
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,767
In a minute.
Emma asked me to bring up her camera.

686
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:58,622
I'll walk with you.

687
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,180
When'd she take this picture of you?

688
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:06,039
You look so...

689
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:08,091
I'm smiling.

690
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,398
I have a nice smile.

691
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:14,510
No, I've never seen you like this.
She got you to...

692
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:16,314
glow.

693
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:18,226
What were you doing?

694
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:20,752
What'd she say to you?

695
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,117
I always glow.

696
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,666
Need you to take a look at something.

697
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,592
- I'm off the clock.
- Just open it.

698
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:51,068
First class ticket to Vancouver Island.

699
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:52,040
Shoot!

700
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,291
It's the wrong envelope.

701
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:00,239
- I think it's great.
- Yeah?

702
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,019
Who doesn't like Canadians?

703
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:04,530
It's big. You're-- you're

704
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:07,594
trying to have a life.
You're trying to enjoy yourself.

705
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:10,884
- You didn't need to apologize.
- I'm not, I told you why I'm--

706
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:11,835
You screwed up.

707
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:13,846
I saved a life. I saved two lives.

708
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:19,201
You let your maternal instinct get the
best of you and nearly killed 2 people.

709
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,690
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

710
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:26,675
You do what you did, mom and
baby both die 9.9 times out of 10.

711
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,544
Sometimes .1 is bigger than 9.9.

712
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,437
No, it's smaller.

713
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:35,200
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is, always will be.

714
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,063
Well, not for Emma.

715
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:38,993
And not for her son.

716
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:43,033
Now go away. And be happy.

717
