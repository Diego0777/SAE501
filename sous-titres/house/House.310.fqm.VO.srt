1
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,025
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,526
And a happy go to hell.

3
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:44,988
What's he doing here? Is he with you?

4
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,101
Detective Tritter and I...

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,580
we worked out a deal.

6
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,607
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

7
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,477
I told him I didn't
write those prescriptions.

8
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,230
I spoke with the DA.

9
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,540
He agreed to two months in a rehab
facility in exchange for a guilty plea.

10
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,519
Get out of my office.

11
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,879
- No jail time.
- Right.

12
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,057
I should get locked up
in some place I don't belong

13
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,907
in order to avoid getting locked
up in some other place I don't belong.

14
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,415
I got you on forgery and fraud.
Enough drugs to--

15
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,086
No sanctions to the medical board.

16
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,349
And you get your car
back and your bank accounts

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,260
and your precious tumor-ridden patients.

18
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,516
- I did this to help you.
- Next Christmas, buy me a sweater.

19
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,319
You punched out an employee.

20
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:33,138
You nearly cut a little girl in
half because you were too strung out--

21
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:34,259
I was in pain!

22
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:40,970
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

23
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:43,621
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

24
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,354
- But you just selfishly--
- Knock it off.

25
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:49,680
Look, I don't care why Dr.
Wilson is doing this.

26
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:53,214
And right now,
it makes no difference to you either.

27
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,315
You need to deal with the
reality of your current situation.

28
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,693
You want to stand on principle,
you end up in a cell.

29
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,584
And you end up never
practicing medicine again.

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,141
So you've got two choices.

31
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,170
Your principles

32
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:08,348
or your life.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,240
Get out of my office.

34
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:26,086
The DA put a clock on the deal.

35
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,855
You've got three days to decide.

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,300
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26

37
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,555
House! Just give me a minute.

38
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,492
- You're afraid of the pain.
- You're not?

39
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,898
You can still have pain meds in rehab.

40
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,131
-Tramadol, gabapentin--
- Those don't work.

41
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:23,442
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

42
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:25,913
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

43
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,418
Fine, run to Cuddy.

44
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,668
You don't think she's
gonna support me on this?

45
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:39,461
Well, the stitches are healing nicely.
There's no sign of infection.

46
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:44,817
Sorry.

47
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,764
Just need her for a tiny moment.

48
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,043
Small favor.

49
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,448
Pills.

50
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,690
- Who's the wit?
- Doctor.

51
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,234
Don't worry. I'll be firing him soon.

52
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,050
Wait in my office.

53
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,558
Incision looks just
big enough for a chest tube.

54
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:05,545
Collapsed lung?
Someone mistake you for a piñata?

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,464
Delightful. Usually we just
get the elf jokes this time of year.

56
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,659
No on trauma.

57
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,018
Negative PPD.

58
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:16,646
What flavor dwarfs are you guys?

59
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,650
My daughter and I both
have cartilage hair hypoplasia.

60
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,969
Think you can make a pun out of that?

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,657
Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive.

62
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:28,080
She's got a bit of a short fuse,
isn't she?

63
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,255
It's a bleb. Wait in my office.

64
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,385
Bleb's not a diagnosis. It's an evasion.

65
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,240
We'll schedule an MRI to make sure.

66
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:37,361
But a certain number
of these cases are idiopathic.

67
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:41,366
Let me translate that into Tolkien for
you guys. Means Dr. Cuddy's got no idea

68
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:44,213
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped like a balloon.

69
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:45,164
You think you do?

70
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:50,101
Give me her chart. And my pills.

71
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,426
Santa needs us.

72
00:04:58,354 --> 00:04:59,754
Did you get that looked at?

73
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:01,968
I'm fine.

74
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:07,224
Great. I just admitted a cartilage
hair hypoplasia dwarf. 15 years old--

75
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,534
What are you gonna do?

76
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,390
I thought I'd get your theories,
mock them, then embrace my own.

77
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,254
The usual.

78
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:14,555
Wilson told us he ratted.

79
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,247
Your choice of verb, I take it.

80
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,078
It's appropriate. He betrayed you.

81
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,701
And you should take the deal.

82
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:26,624
Unexplained lung collapse and anemia.
Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic.

83
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:29,981
"Cuddy" and "idiop" being
the relevant parts of that sentence.

84
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,299
Well, I'd say TB,
but Cuddy's already ruled it out.

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,412
Then you'd be just
as big an "idiop" as her.

86
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:35,851
Don't you people know your dwarves?

87
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,949
There are over 200
varieties of dwarfism,

88
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,642
each with different
medical complications.

89
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,458
You can't expect us to be
intimately familiar with all of them.

90
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,909
- The sick dwarves sure expect you to.
- Cartilage hair hypoplasia.

91
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,864
They have compromises immune systems.

92
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,114
Gold star for Cameron.

93
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,721
For extra credit, explain to
the special needs section of the class

94
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:55,127
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

95
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:58,144
A PDD involves planting a
fragment of TB under the skin to see

96
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:01,456
if the immune system recognizes it.
Because of a compromised immune system,

97
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:03,742
our patient could have
TB but not recognize it.

98
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,143
The little people love you.

99
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,286
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

100
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:15,123
Gallium is a radioactive isotope.
It travels through your veins

101
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,524
allowing us to see any bright
spots that might indicate infection.

102
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,092
I'm 4'1". That's 1.5 canes in metric.

103
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,629
You don't look a day over four feet.

104
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,908
I saw in the file that
her dad was normal-sized.

105
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:31,964
It's average-sized.

106
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:34,394
Compared to you, I'm sure it was huge.

107
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,075
So did he have a fetish,

108
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,926
or did he just fall in
love with your long-legged soul?

109
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:42,083
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

110
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,132
Seems like you're
the one with the fetish.

111
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,562
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

112
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:50,120
- Did you stand on a table?
- House.

113
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,273
Pretty much he lay flat and spin me.

114
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:55,815
Mom!

115
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,732
So, Abigail,
you want to hop up on the table for me?

116
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,529
That's gonna be tough.

117
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, let me give you a boost.

118
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,512
Stop treating her like she's five.

119
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,751
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

120
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,729
Mom, it's okay.

121
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,299
I was just trying to be helpful.

122
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,026
She also hates Jews.

123
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,880
I've dealt with worse. Being different,
you get used to people's idiocy.

124
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,837
Still beats the hell out
of actually being an idiot.

125
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,561
What?

126
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:32,088
Care to go for a spin?

127
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:40,766
What the hell were you thinking?
You didn't think ratting out

128
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:44,167
this hospital's best doctor
merited checking with your boss first?

129
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,334
I didn't rat him out. I got him a deal.

130
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:48,704
- Which he'll never take.
- He will if we--

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,007
How long have you known House? Did you
think he'd suddenly become reasonable?

132
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,528
I made the deal. It's done.
You can either keep yelling at me,

133
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,485
or you can help me
avoid a complete disaster.

134
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,781
It already is gonna
be a complete disaster.

135
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:01,632
He's not gonna take the deal.
He's gonna go to jail.

136
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,107
Because he's a child. He's too stubborn.

137
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:08,004
When a child misbehaves, what do you do?
You take away something he loves.

138
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:09,953
We can't take away his Vicodin.

139
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,554
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

140
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,802
And we tell him the only way to
get the pills back is to take the deal.

141
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,193
- He won't be able to function.
- That's the point.

142
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,144
You gonna explain that to his patient?

143
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,296
What choice do we have?

144
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,258
Gallium scan shows no
bright spots of any kind.

145
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,234
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

146
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,305
There's no bright spots because
the whole thing's too bright.

147
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,406
Except for the liver.

148
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,068
The tech overexposed the image a bit,
but it's nothing.

149
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:43,445
The liver looks fine.

150
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,589
Could be lung cancer.

151
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,150
Tumor causes structural damage.
Lung caves in on itself.

152
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,551
Also explains the anemia.

153
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:51,464
Doesn't explain the
liver problem, though.

154
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,773
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

155
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,438
You guys look at
the liver on this thing?

156
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,197
- There's no liver problem.
- Seriously, look at the liver.

157
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:00,028
- There's nothing there.
- Why not?

158
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,520
- Because there's nothing wrong.

159
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:04,634
Every organ in the scan
is lit up like a 100-watt bulb.

160
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:08,578
Except for her liver,
which is hovering around 60 watts.

161
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,305
And not one of them good 60-watters,
but an energy saving--

162
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:14,115
You're saying her liver's shutting
down because the lighting is off?

163
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:15,736
You just don't want a cancer diagnosis

164
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,514
because then you'd
have to deal with Wilson.

165
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:21,918
Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis.
Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.

166
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,566
House, we need to talk.

167
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,302
Not taking the deal. Glad we talked.

168
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:28,186
Ultrasound her liver.

169
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,156
Sit down.

170
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:31,843
Stand up.

171
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,401
Your turn.

172
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,077
House, you're off the case.

173
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,841
Your treatment privileges are suspended
until you accept Tritter's deal.

174
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,697
Well, I'm obviously
not gonna take the deal

175
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:42,711
just so I can have the
fun of treating a dwarf.

176
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,977
So I assume there's more to this threat.

177
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,140
I'm also cutting off your Vicodin.

178
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,279
That could work.

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,822
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

180
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,112
This is not lung cancer.

181
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,261
We'll find out as
soon as we MRI her lungs.

182
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,387
You're gonna come begging
me to save this girl

183
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,588
long before I come
begging your for pills.

184
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:08,418
I hope not.

185
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,789
For everyone's sake.

186
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,366
- This is wrong.
- Cutting House off?

187
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,760
Might not work, but it's not wrong.

188
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:23,403
Bone windows looks clean.

189
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,460
Abigail,
we need you to hold still, okay?

190
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,572
Can I come out?

191
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:32,359
Just hang in there two
more minutes and we'll be done.

192
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,317
Okay.

193
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,383
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

194
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,664
Cuddy's bending the rules to
get a patient to do the right thing.

195
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,254
- Who'd work for a doctor like that?
- And the ends justify the means?

196
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,655
If the ends involve
us keeping our jobs, sure.

197
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,886
Lung parenchyma is clean. No masses.

198
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,560
It's not lung cancer.

199
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,348
Abigail, you okay?

200
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:03,335
House was right. Her liver's failing.

201
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:06,781
Endoscopy confirmed the vomiting
was cause by variceal bleeding.

202
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,849
Bloodwork also confirms
House's hypothesis--

203
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:12,888
I get it. House was right.
It's the liver. Let's move on.

204
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,680
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

205
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,949
- Schistosomiasis, the parasite--
- There's no eosinophilia.

206
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:22,032
- Cirrhosis could explain--
- Could be a hepatoma.

207
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,377
She's 15. It's not liver cancer.

208
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:27,401
It's not unheard of.

209
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,365
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is, what caused it?

210
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:33,366
- Could be hepatitis, Budd-Chiari.
- Or drugs and alcohol.

211
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,740
If anyone has a reason to dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

212
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,164
I'll do a liver biopsy to confirm.

213
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,915
I'll search the patient's
home for drugs and alcohol.

214
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,195
Cameron,

215
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,452
you got a moment?

216
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,327
What exactly is your problem with me?

217
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,733
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

218
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:01,371
- So this is all about the case?
- What else would it be about?

219
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,441
I made this deal to help him.

220
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,030
And helped yourself at the same time.

221
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,028
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,278
I gave both of them up to help House,
and I would've gone on without them

223
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,580
if hadn't almost maimed that little
girl and if he hadn't punched out Chase.

224
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,731
Was it an easy choice?

225
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,638
Of course not, but it's right.

226
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,086
Then why wasn't it easy?

227
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,957
Because he's my friend. It's

228
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,082
- obviously complicated.
- It's complicated?

229
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:34,057
When you decided to talk to Tritter,
your life got a million times better.

230
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:35,558
How do you separate that out?

231
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,803
How do you pretend your windfall
isn't relevant to this decision?

232
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:45,161
It was the right thing to do.

233
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:48,975
You pretending your motives
are pure is why I have a problem.

234
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,320
- Where's Cuddy?
- In this drawer.

235
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:05,813
It's a rescue mission.

236
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,366
But I got it under control.
You can leave.

237
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,421
You were right about the liver failure.

238
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:15,171
Patient had variceal bleeding
which suggested cirrhosis, but--

239
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,122
Off the clock.

240
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,667
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

241
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,618
Obviously.

242
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,211
Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis.

243
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,531
But it shows sclerosing cholangitis.

244
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:28,213
Even weirder, there's no
increase in alkaline phosphatase.

245
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:31,636
Medical mystery. Sounds like
the kind of thing I'd be good at.

246
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,288
Breaking and entering. Sounds
like the kind of thing you'd be good at.

247
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,139
I take it that's where
Cuddy's been keeping your pills.

248
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,792
One theory, one drawer.

249
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:50,796
Really?

250
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:53,822
I thought you'd be all
for this "torture House plan."

251
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,373
It works, therefore it's good.

252
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:57,403
On the other hand,
I don't want to talk you out

253
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,852
of this deal by pointing out your
hypocrisy, so patient's life at stake...

254
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:05,875
Forget about the specific nature of
the liver dysfunction. It's irrelevant.

255
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,937
The dwarf's problem is global.
That's why the gallium scan was bright.

256
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:11,715
And it's gonna spread throughout
her entire body unless you stop it.

257
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,966
If that were true, more than
lungs and liver would be affected.

258
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,161
They will be.

259
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:19,517
It'll spread though the biliary
tree and hit her pancreas next.

260
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,989
Stop retracing your steps.
Get ahead of it.

261
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,240
Forget the liver and focus
on the pancreas. 'Cause after that--

262
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,536
Actually, after that doesn't
really matter what it hits

263
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:29,900
because pretty much all
roads lead to a dead dwarf.

264
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:34,234
I get why you don't want to go to rehab.

265
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,870
But only an idiot goes
to prison for being stubborn.

266
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:40,960
Only an idiot stands
between Ahab and his whale.

267
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,096
Move.

268
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,669
Sorry.

269
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:03,653
Santa's got gifts.

270
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,828
Olive oil wasn't in the kitchen.
It was in the medicine cabinet.

271
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,228
Home remedy for ear infections.

272
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,611
Ear infections are fairly
typical among CHH dwarfs.

273
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,028
Or it's a symptom.

274
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:15,497
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

275
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,398
Or House is wrong and it's a symptom.

276
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,355
Laxatives.

277
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,960
I don't think they were used
to maintain her girlish figure.

278
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,761
Again, intestinal problems are common--

279
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,262
Again, it might be a symptom.

280
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,728
And glucosamine suggests
chronic joint pain--

281
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,534
Who ordered the Alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency test?

282
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:32,758
I did.

283
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:34,754
You think the problem's in her pancreas?

284
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:37,503
Well, I think it will be. I think we
need to forget about the liver.

285
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,574
We just forgot about the lungs.
Now we need to forget about the liver?

286
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,575
We need to stop retracing our steps and

287
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,095
get ahead of this thing.

288
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:47,589
House, you've tanned.

289
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,309
You don't think I could've
come up with this?

290
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,260
Did you?

291
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,365
You suspended House because
it'd be dangerous having him in charge,

292
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,395
but getting his opinion--

293
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,723
I'm sure he gave you that opinion

294
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,978
simply because he was
worried about the patient.

295
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,969
Just because House wants his
pills doesn't mean his theory is wrong.

296
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,820
No, the test results mean that.
Your test was negative.

297
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:07,809
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

298
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,665
Do an ERCP to check the
liver for bile duct cancer.

299
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,881
Just because it wasn't Alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.

300
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:15,961
You needed an organ. He needed a fix.

301
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:20,337
He'd have made up any story for a pill.
You didn't give him anything, did you?

302
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:21,288
No.

303
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,115
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

304
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,528
Unfortunately, that pain and lack of

305
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,664
bruising is typical
of a zygomatic break.

306
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:39,807
That sounds bad.

307
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,118
Bones are aligned properly. Which
ER did you go to after the car accident?

308
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,219
Princeton Plainsboro.

309
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,332
Here's my discharge slip.

310
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:49,574
Okay.

311
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,983
Gonna get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

312
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,440
I tried that, and it makes me nauseous.

313
00:16:55,995 --> 00:17:00,114
There's a drug called gabapentin which
is good for certain kinds of pains.

314
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:02,291
Great, 'cause I haven't slept in days.

315
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:05,272
Gabapentin's not really
gonna help with the sleep.

316
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,670
Is there something else you can give me?

317
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,096
Vicodin's your best
bet with sleep issues.

318
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:14,888
Thanks so much.

319
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,520
Unfortunately, our policy forbids
prescribing opiates to new patients.

320
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,993
How can a clinic have
a rule against relieving pain?

321
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,136
Just with opiates. We find
that it helps weed out drug seekers.

322
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,473
You think I'm a drug seeker?

323
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,630
- I'm not saying that.
- Then give me the Vicodin.

324
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,219
- I can't.
- Because you think I'm a drug seeker.

325
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,793
- I just said I didn't.
- No,

326
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:35,603
you said that the policy
was to stop drug seeking.

327
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:38,770
Then you said I'm not a drug seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

328
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,271
I'm sorry. That's the policy.

329
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:45,184
Gabapentin works on nerve damage.
You're prescribing it for a broken face.

330
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,552
Might as well hand out
Band-Aids for a severed carotid.

331
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:48,503
You're a doctor.

332
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:49,982
Not by this clinic's definition

333
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:52,433
since I'm neither a
moron nor a mindless drone.

334
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,646
- Security.
- Forget it.

335
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,198
I'll throw myself out.

336
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,764
That tube is going all
the way down to my liver?

337
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:06,926
Don't worry. You'll be sedated.

338
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,715
Sometimes doctors have to do
things that make people uncomfortable

339
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,692
- to help them.
- But we always want

340
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:16,536
to respect the patient's wishes
and not shove things down their throats.

341
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,482
Foreman.

342
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,203
You haven't given her the sedative.

343
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,154
No.

344
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:26,609
Abigail!

345
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,665
Abigail!

346
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:29,839
She's unconscious.

347
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:31,703
Check her airway.

348
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:34,798
Airway's clear.

349
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,384
- Her breath smells fruity.
- Diabetic ketoacidosis.

350
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,703
Hang an insuline drip at .1 migs
per kig per hour. Pancreas is failing.

351
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:44,592
You ready to call House yet?

352
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,621
You were right.
The patient's pancreas is failing.

353
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,459
Told you you'd come begging me for help.

354
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,910
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent--

355
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:04,909
Give me my pills or lose an arm.

356
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,025
- The girl is dying.
- So give me my pills.

357
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,326
Take the deal and I will.

358
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,194
You'd rather kill this
girl than give me my pills.

359
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,457
I would rather lose one patient now

360
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,668
than the dozens we will
lose while you're in prison.

361
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:25,400
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy grieving mother.

362
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,233
What if we sacrifice this
girl and House still goes to jail?

363
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,362
I'd feel bad. Can we get on with this?

364
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:39,114
House correctly predicted the spread.
Means we've got a global systemic

365
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:42,737
illness affecting lungs,
liver, and pancreas so far. Ideas.

366
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,000
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ systems.

367
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,070
Histiocytosis usually
starts in the brain,

368
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:49,606
then moves to the internal organs.

369
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,950
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

370
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,712
Exocrine function is normal.
Hodgkins lymphoma.

371
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,413
It's a systemic cancer which
her dwarfism predisposes her to.

372
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,405
- Any ideas that aren't cancer?
- Cancer fits.

373
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,220
Autoimmune fits better. We should
treat her with prednisone for lupus.

374
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,545
That'll spike her blood
sugar and put her back in a coma.

375
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,778
It's much safer just to
run a double-stranded DNA test.

376
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,821
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

377
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,682
One of you is probably right.

378
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:13,123
Why don't we hold the sniping
until we find out which?

379
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:17,371
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma. You guys,
run an antibody test for lupus.

380
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,755
Because of your daughter's dwarfism,
we've had to pick a higher entry point

381
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:29,051
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

382
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:30,995
So why not do the lupus test first?

383
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:34,772
In the interest of time, we think
it's best to proceed on both fronts.

384
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,673
You have no idea what's
wrong with my daughter.

385
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:40,574
- We have several theories.
- What does Dr. House think?

386
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,609
He's-- He had to go home sick.

387
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:46,389
My daughter may be dying,
and he's gone home with the sniffles?

388
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,312
He's not--

389
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,551
He was the only one who seemed to
have any idea what was wrong with her.

390
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,102
He better be really damn sick.

391
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,151
He is.

392
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:00,464
Unless you got Vicodin, go away.

393
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,511
House, it's me. I, uh--

394
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,468
Oh, God.

395
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,337
- I don't have--
- No pills,

396
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,323
no egg nog.

397
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,675
What happened to your arm?

398
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,300
Cut myself.

399
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,426
Wilson was wrong about lymphoma.

400
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:31,311
Kid's not losing any weight,
no night sweats.

401
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,486
- Cuddy send you?
- No,

402
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,359
she doesn't trust
me not to give you pills.

403
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,868
Is she right?

404
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,900
House, these cuts are straight in a row.

405
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,334
You did this on purpose.

406
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:50,869
Cutting releases endorphins.
Endorphins relieve pain.

407
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,022
You gonna get me some pills?

408
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:55,354
No.

409
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,436
Then you can leave.

410
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:00,690
No constitutional symptoms means--

411
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:04,136
Soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.

412
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,950
You really think she's gonna fold?

413
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,295
Autoimmune fits better than cancer.

414
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:19,960
But lupus loves kidneys,
usually attacks them first.

415
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,447
- Kidneys are fine, right?
- Yeah.

416
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,565
Take the deal.

417
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,519
You can survive without Vicodin.

418
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:31,178
After you were shot,
you stayed clean for months.

419
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,316
Yeah, I wonder if it had something
to do with the absence of pain.

420
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,643
Leave that. I want to be able to pour
alcohol on it so I can distract myself.

421
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,344
Then you can rip off the bandage.

422
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,857
- Kid been sick lately?
- There's a history of ear infections.

423
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:55,504
Say Abigail's immune system

424
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,807
is like a shy guy in a bar.

425
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,526
And the ear infections,

426
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,719
they come in and try to coax him to--

427
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,645
To hell with the metaphor.

428
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:10,338
You get the point, right?

429
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,198
Nerd gets drunk. Trashes the bar.

430
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:16,173
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by a minor infection.

431
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:19,050
Factor in her age,
elevated sed-rate, anemia...

432
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:21,667
It's Still's disease.

433
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,687
You start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

434
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:30,889
Stop this.

435
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:33,313
Please.

436
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,650
What'd he say?

437
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,633
Still's disease.
It's chronic, but manageable.

438
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:03,706
A diagnosis that's virtually
unconfirmable. And with a treatment

439
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:06,907
that's more dangerous than
what we were considering for lupus.

440
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,975
- How bad is he?
- Are you asking because you care,

441
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,926
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

442
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,887
- Both.
- He's detoxing.

443
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,620
In agony.

444
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:19,918
He started cutting himself.

445
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,264
But he's still House.

446
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:27,787
I'll order the treatment.

447
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:52,346
Your plan isn't working.

448
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:54,520
Two days down, one to go.

449
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,795
Figured I'd show you
how much it isn't working.

450
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,268
Yeah, clearly the drugs
have no hold on you.

451
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:08,549
We both know that my pride far surpasses
my instinct for self-preservation.

452
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,180
You want to redeem yourself?
Give up now.

453
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,105
And you'll go to jail.

454
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,583
I've done nothing wrong.

455
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,394
And you'll go to jail.

456
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,674
Which makes this

457
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:24,532
your last chance to do me a
kindness before ruining my life forever.

458
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:28,715
The nausea's bad this time.

459
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:35,872
You can write me a scrip for
metoclopramide so I can stop puking.

460
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,590
They'd give me that in rehab.

461
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,819
Then you should go to rehab.

462
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,070
I have a patient.

463
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:03,668
I'm so sorry for your loss.

464
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:06,369
I know it's little solace,
but he went without pain.

465
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,097
Well, look on the bright side.

466
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:17,526
At least you don't have to go by Mrs.
Zebalusky anymore.

467
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:20,014
That's gotta be a relief.

468
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:23,225
- You know this man?
- I'm sorry. He's sick--

469
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,417
Did you hear my diagnosis on the dwarf?

470
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:27,063
Still's disease.

471
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:29,486
Did you even consider
those ear infections,

472
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,687
or you just wrote
it off as a dwarf thing?

473
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:33,337
You sure he's dead?

474
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:35,456
Dr. Wilson sometimes misses things.

475
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:39,221
Trying to embarrass me in front of
grieving widow crosses lines that even--

476
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,751
Right! I'm pathetic.

477
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,532
I'm strung out, I haven't slept,

478
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,083
puking every hour,
and I still out-diagnosed you.

479
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,499
But I'm supposed to
let you decide what's best--

480
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:51,754
Please leave.

481
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:55,169
Sorry.

482
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,690
I'm done.

483
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:09,906
You didn't come in here just to embar-
rass me. You could do that any time.

484
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,572
Stealing Oxy from a dead man.

485
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:15,838
Yeah, you don't have a problem.

486
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:31,289
How's the girl?

487
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,520
Much better.

488
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,583
House was right.

489
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,830
It happens.

490
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,327
I thought we could handle this.

491
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,893
Still's disease never crossed my mind.

492
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,873
Don't beat yourself up.
I didn't get it either.

493
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,755
I feel like a mob informant.

494
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:03,988
You wanna go inside?

495
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,867
Got a cafeteria in there, right?

496
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,625
I can't testify.

497
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:14,488
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

498
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:18,016
House has hurt plenty of people,
you included.

499
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,445
He saves lives.

500
00:28:20,102 --> 00:28:21,802
People that no one else can save.

501
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:23,428
And

502
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,814
no matter how much of an ass he is,

503
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:26,852
statistically

504
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:29,454
House is a positive
force in the universe.

505
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:32,428
The pills let him do that.

506
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:36,235
Vicodin does not make House a genius.

507
00:28:36,362 --> 00:28:39,706
Whatever he does on the pills,
he can do off.

508
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,928
He's just not willing to try.

509
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:46,867
I won't testify against him.

510
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:50,293
Then we'll subpoena you.

511
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:54,249
And your previous statement
will be read into evidence.

512
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,793
And you will be charged with
interfering with an investigation.

513
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,073
And you will go to jail.

514
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:08,940
Again, statistically,

515
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,198
better me than him.

516
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:12,347
Statistically...

517
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,995
the two of you will be in jail.

518
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,328
Dr. Cameron, come quick.
There's something wrong with Abby.

519
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,711
Couldn't be too severe.
Her cardiac alarm didn't go off.

520
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,512
It's not her heart. She's bleeding.

521
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,220
Picking up a scrip, under Zebalusky.

522
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:12,970
This is, uh, Dr. Wilson's patient.

523
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:14,586
Yeah.

524
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:16,484
Wilson's busy right now.

525
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:21,240
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying in agony
on account of his metastic lung cancer

526
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,327
and not having the
pills to relieve that agony

527
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:26,311
because of some moron pharmacist.

528
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:29,646
Sign the book.

529
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:59,757
Bleeding wasn't a ruptured eardrum,
ear infection, or bleeding disorder.

530
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,418
Her heart rate's climbing.
Blood pressure's dropping.

531
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,769
She's on the verge
of a multi-system failure.

532
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:08,257
Head CT was clean.
Means it's not a neurological problem.

533
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,970
- Basically we have nothing.
- Cancer is still on the table.

534
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:13,682
Spinal fluid was negative for lymphoma.
What other--

535
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,714
Leukemia.
We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.

536
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,528
None of the blood
tests suggest leukemia.

537
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,535
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

538
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:22,036
Unless a small clot
lead to a pulmonary infarct.

539
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:24,023
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

540
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,110
It respond to steroids,
which we've given her.

541
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,344
And she got better for a while.
We stopped it too soon.

542
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,350
Because she crashed.

543
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,109
All we're doing is bouncing back
and forth between cancer and autoimmune.

544
00:31:33,944 --> 00:31:35,144
We're going in circles.

545
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:43,842
Give me half an hour.

546
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,861
Can I have a French fry?

547
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:57,552
Get your own.

548
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,060
You took the last ones.

549
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:02,400
What's wrong with you?

550
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:04,200
I got spinal muscular atrophy.

551
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,208
Guess it's not contagious.

552
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:11,197
Nice bear.

553
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,364
It's a dog.

554
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:17,983
It's not Still's.
Steroids helped until the patient

555
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,236
started bleeding
from the ears and mouth.

556
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,387
That's a bear.

557
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,795
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

558
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:27,755
You win. You can have Vicodin.

559
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:31,208
Words have set meanings for a reason.

560
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:34,026
If you see an animal like
Bill and you try to play fetch,

561
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:36,277
Bill's gonna eat you
because Bill's a bear.

562
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:37,993
Are you on something?

563
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,300
You got your hands on pain meds.

564
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:44,768
Bill has fur, four legs, and a collar.

565
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,345
He's a dog.

566
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,937
It's between cancer and autoimmune.

567
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,508
See, that's what we
call a faulty syllogism.

568
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,721
Just because you call Bill
a dog doesn't mean that he is...

569
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,069
a dog.

570
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,644
We gotta x-ray our patient's leg.

571
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:10,808
Her leg looks fine.

572
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:12,461
Weird, huh?

573
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,281
Why aren't you detoxing?

574
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:15,685
Will power.

575
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,520
What--what--

576
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:19,889
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

577
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:21,995
Did you just take a pill?

578
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:23,724
No.

579
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:27,501
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal growth plates?

580
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:30,500
It's impossible.
We must be missing something.

581
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:32,587
How many pills have you taken?

582
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:36,567
Not nearly as many as I'm gonna take.
Forgotten how delicious they were.

583
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,570
I didn't give them to him.

584
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:41,021
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

585
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,441
We were missing the fact that

586
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:45,692
just because we called her
a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf.

587
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,865
Everyone assumed she
was because of her mother.

588
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,968
There's not test for CHH dwarfism. So

589
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,609
she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

590
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:56,720
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism, then

591
00:33:57,025 --> 00:34:00,872
her short stature must be
caused by growth hormone deficiency.

592
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,919
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland.

593
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,970
And based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

594
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,903
So what connects a
long-term pituitary issue

595
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,534
with problems in the lungs,
liver, and pancreas?

596
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,734
Oh, you guys and your bickering.

597
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:14,693
Cancer versus autoimmune.

598
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,765
Obviously you think it's something else.

599
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,525
Nope. I think it's both.

600
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,630
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

601
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:25,531
Also known as, "you got your
cancer in my autoimmune" disease.

602
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:28,649
The immune component responded
to the Still's treatment

603
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,448
lead to the short-term improvement.
The cancer portion didn't.

604
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,481
We dismissed this earlier because
there were no neurological symptoms.

605
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,226
Yeah. It's not your fault.

606
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,319
The only neurological
symptom was her height.

607
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,845
Who could've noticed?

608
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:52,696
This is your pituitary gland.

609
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:55,652
And this is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

610
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,819
No pituitary equals no growth
hormone equals about that much.

611
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:02,155
She's not a dwarf?

612
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,570
Just hormonally challenged.

613
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,630
What about my mom?

614
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:08,326
Your mom's the real deal.

615
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,500
But you're just a tiny little poser.

616
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,526
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

617
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,968
a cascade of the same
cells that made the granuloma.

618
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:18,246
They attacked your lungs,
moved down to your liver,

619
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,142
then hitched a ride
over to your pancreas.

620
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:23,012
We can nuke them with
a mild course of chemo and then

621
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,191
remove the granuloma.

622
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:26,914
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

623
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,585
Let me see if I can make this clear.

624
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:33,484
This pill represents...

625
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,666
a pill.

626
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:38,947
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

627
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:42,482
We deposit the pill in the month.

628
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:50,938
You may never be tall
enough to play in the WNBA,

629
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,539
but you'll be able to
post up your mom no problem.

630
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:56,512
What if I don't take the pills?

631
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,529
What if you remove the thing in my head

632
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,887
and give me the chemo,
but not the pills?

633
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:03,692
Would I still get better?

634
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,841
Your body needs growth hormone
from lots of things. Like...

635
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:08,870
to grow.

636
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,701
I like who I am now.

637
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:13,783
Nobody your age likes who they are now.

638
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:15,037
I do.

639
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,352
You like needing help when
you want something off a high shelf?

640
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:22,995
Not being able to press an
elevator button above the eighth floor?

641
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:25,547
Having to smell ass every
time you stand in line?

642
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,140
You don't need growth hormone. It's
just your ticket out of the freak show.

643
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,088
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

644
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:48,614
without making her feel
that her life isn't worth living?

645
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:49,815
I'm trying to help her.

646
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:53,431
- You're trying to make her taller.
- Not too tall.

647
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,246
Just tall enough to wipe her own butt.

648
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:02,637
- Are you high?
- Higher than you.

649
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:07,366
If my daughter doesn't want to choose
the easy path, I won't force her to.

650
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,014
Then you're a lousy mom.

651
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:12,968
- You want your daughter to be a freak.
- We're not freaks.

652
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:16,391
- You want her to overcome adversity.
- Yes.

653
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:17,731
Then why stop at height?

654
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:21,475
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interesting she'll be then.

655
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:23,374
Being little is not the same as--

656
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:27,583
You and I have found out that
being normal sucks 'cause we're freaks.

657
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:31,987
The advantage of being a
freak is it makes your stronger.

658
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:35,282
Now, how strong do you
really want her to have to be?

659
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,995
Tell her what you have to tell her.

660
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,147
Tell her you lied.

661
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Even if you didn't.

662
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,676
This is who you were supposed to be.

663
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:57,839
You hate normal.

664
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,835
It's not that simple.

665
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,799
If I grow,
I'll fade into the background.

666
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,194
I'll be boring.

667
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,738
We'll get you a funny hat.

668
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:17,604
You could never be boring.

669
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:21,763
You want me to be like everybody else?

670
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,707
I want you to have what I can't.

671
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:48,757
Abigail agreed--

672
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,708
Abigail agreed to take growth hormone.

673
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:53,532
Who's Abigail?

674
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,310
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

675
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:57,971
Oh, good.

676
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,584
Then the growth hormone makes sense.

677
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,714
- Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, I know.

678
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,171
Deal expires tomorrow.

679
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,834
You have plans for tonight?

680
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:13,535
You worried I'm gonna
be popping more pills?

681
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,333
Thought you might
prefer people over pills.

682
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:47,935
Hey, Mom.

683
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:52,216
I guess you guys are
already up at Aunt Sarah's.

684
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,172
I'm sure Dad's in the egg nog

685
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:59,655
and you're probably suffering
through another dried out turkey.

686
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:09,363
Just wanted to say Merry Christmas.

687
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,404
Are you okay?

688
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:42,655
I called three times.

689
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:58,696
I'm ready to take the deal.

690
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,254
Well, that's off the table.

691
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:07,604
- The clock doesn't expire until--
- Got new evidence.

692
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,639
We don't need Wilson anymore.

693
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,627
The thing about addicts is, uh...

694
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:16,456
no matter how smart they are,

695
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,083
they are dumb when it comes to drugs.

696
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:23,778
So, uh, I've been keeping
an eye on the pharmacy log.

697
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:27,828
Seems some patient
of Wilson's named Zebalusky

698
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:29,515
managed to

699
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:31,907
pick up his Oxy prescription

700
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:33,392
after he died.

701
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,826
Jesus walks, huh?

702
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:52,382
Merry Christmas.

703
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
