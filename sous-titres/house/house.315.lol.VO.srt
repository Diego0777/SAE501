1
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:05,216
I can't do this button.

2
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:07,127
Oh, you almost got it.

3
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:08,376
Almost got it.

4
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:15,063
The sound...

5
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:18,639
Of the people talking.

6
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:26,674
- It's A flat.
- Is it? Well.

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,361
Look how smart you are, huh?

8
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:31,975
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

9
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:52,602
Thank you. I am proud to introduce
my son to you, Patrick Obyedkov.

10
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:56,183
25 years ago,
Patrick was in the fourth grade.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,712
A good student, played Little League.

12
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,597
And then there was the accident.

13
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:05,398
And here we are...

14
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,874
Raising money for people with
similar neurological disabilities.

15
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:12,178
I hope you enjoy the concert.

16
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:23,118
Are you all set?

17
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,911
All set.

18
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:04,902
He's never missed a note.

19
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,745
Something's wrong.

20
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,899
Patrick, what is it?

21
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,359
My hand,

22
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:24,987
it hurts.

23
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:26,175
Let me see it.

24
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,697
Oh, Papa!

26
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,046
What's the emergency?

27
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,982
35-year-old savant,
dystonia in his left hand.

28
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,733
He paged us at 5:00
in the morning for that?

29
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,207
I'm going back to bed.
Dystonia's not life-threatening.

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,801
- Clonazepam will take care of it.
- He's already on Clonazepam.

31
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,907
For seizures he has from
a bus accident when he was ten.

32
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,713
Then we treat with benztropine.

33
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,850
- What's up?
- 35-year-old savant, dystonia.

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,310
I'm going back to bed.

35
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:12,844
Where are you going?

36
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,996
Bathroom. It can wait.

37
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,763
There is no case, House.

38
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:20,145
Even if dystonia was some big
medical mystery, it's not this time.

39
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,923
You're not intrigued as to how
a perfectly healthy ten-year-old boy

40
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:26,381
with no prior musical training gets
into an accident on his way to school,

41
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,594
can suddenly play the piano?

42
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:30,495
Do we have to solve a 25-year-old
case before breakfast?

43
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,784
- You two shower together?
- No!

44
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,552
Double negative, it's a yes.

45
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:37,687
Savantism is just one of those things.
It's inexplicable.

46
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:40,872
Just because it's inexplicted,
doesn't mean it's inexplicable.

47
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:41,879
I want new labs.

48
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:45,435
CBC with platelets, chem panel,
thyroid and adrenal function tests.

49
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,387
- For what?
- I don't know.

50
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,879
Raise your left hand.

51
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:55,758
That's your right hand.

52
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,611
What are you looking for?

53
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:02,712
Just wanna make sure whatever
happened doesn't happen again.

54
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,202
- Push up.
- Push up.

55
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,494
He repeats what people say.
It's a compensation mechanism.

56
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:11,295
He knows he's supposed to say something,
so he repeats what he just heard.

57
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,384
That's good, shows he's engaged.

58
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,882
Spine's okay. All right.

59
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,395
Now stick out your
tongue like this, copy me.

60
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:20,566
You have a big tongue.

61
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,009
I know, it's funny, but copy me.

62
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,464
There was construction on Radcliff.

63
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:37,615
So I had to get out of the car and,
and walk in high heels for over a mile.

64
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,279
Radcliff? What was the cross street?

65
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,131
Does it matter?

66
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:44,711
I don't know,
I'm not the one who brought it up.

67
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:45,725
Tie this off.

68
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,004
Nice and tight.

69
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,723
Does this have anything
to do with my foot?

70
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,873
You have a blister. You don't
waste a doctor's time with a blister.

71
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,951
You waste a doctor's time
with more important things.

72
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,673
Like the sewer that's
being vented out of your mouth.

73
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:05,624
My breath?

74
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,361
If you could stop doing that,
we'd all be grateful.

75
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:11,362
- I can't stop breathing.
- No, but you could stop puking.

76
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:13,537
- I don't--
- Your lips say, "no,"

77
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:16,701
your gnarly fingers say, "blegh!"

78
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,240
It's good to go.

79
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,135
It's a shame.

80
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,973
You do look cute that thin.

81
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,995
Motor cortex looks good.
Everything checks out.

82
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,450
- What tests did you run?
- Full battery of neurological--

83
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,611
I need this blood checked
for cholesterol and glucose levels.

84
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:39,205
- Patient had a foot problem.
- Different patient.

85
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,079
- There was no one else in there.
- You're using the wrong equipment.

86
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,383
Dr. Foreman,
I thought we were being discharged.

87
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:58,334
I'm Dr. House.

88
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:01,654
On the off chance that Dr.
Foreman didn't mention it,

89
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,255
I have something of a gift too.

90
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,120
Come on.

91
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,031
- Your turn.
- My turn.

92
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,283
Does this have anything
to do with his hand?

93
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,532
It might.

94
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:42,491
Okay, Patrick, close your eyes.

95
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:44,886
What's this?

96
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,573
- D, G flat, A flat, B, C--
- Yeah, all right, all right.

97
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,545
He's good. Can we let him go?

98
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:54,322
He's great. He's staying.

99
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:04,448
Call radiology.

100
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,191
I need a functional MRI of his brain.

101
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,740
- fMRI's not gonna show trauma.
- I'm not looking for trauma.

102
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,611
I wanna see the music.

103
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,207
See the music.

104
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:23,154
Well, that's dull.

105
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,864
You think fMRI's gonna show a big arrow

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,450
pointing to a flashing
sign saying "savantism"?

107
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:33,264
Would be hugely helpful. Somehow,
he's been rewired as a music specialist.

108
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,077
I wanna know how that happens.

109
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,162
He has access to parts
of the brain that you don't.

110
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,816
His brain's doing nothing.

111
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,936
It looks like any jerk listening.

112
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:45,134
He's not a savant at listening.
He's a savant at playing.

113
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,957
Well, listening and playing are
two different neurological processes.

114
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Turn off the music.

115
00:08:56,727 --> 00:09:00,069
Patrick, I want you to
pretend that your leg is a piano.

116
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,721
My leg's not a piano.

117
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:04,801
I know, that's why I said "pretend."

118
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:06,823
The kid's a moron.

119
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,961
Keep your head still, use your fingers.

120
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,566
Cool, huh?

121
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,176
- His heart rate rose.
- Emotional response?

122
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,714
Then why is there no
activity in the limbic system?

123
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,765
Unless there's a problem with his heart.

124
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:46,344
Do an echo to confirm.
Then scrub up, he's gonna need surgery.

125
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:50,522
Wasn't dystonia.

126
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:55,162
He's got a heart condition that caused
the arteries in his arm to constrict.

127
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:58,163
Do you have any idea why
House would want to go to Boston?

128
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:01,043
- The chowder?
- Plane tickets, this Friday.

129
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,969
I opened his mail.

130
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:07,445
I heard there's an opening at Harvard
for Division Chief, Infectious Disease.

131
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:11,334
Well, ambition's not one
of his more prominent traits.

132
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,406
- Although...
- What?

133
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,907
Well, he was testing
blood in the clinic.

134
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,263
Don't think it was a patient's blood.

135
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,729
- Why, it was green?
- No, he was checking for routine stuff.

136
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:26,682
Makes sense if he's looking for
basic medical clearance for employment.

137
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,711
I'm going home.

138
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,688
- No, you're not.
- He could show up any minute.

139
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,140
Not with a savant to obsess about.

140
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:51,068
I'll take in here.
Bedroom's down the hall.

141
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:52,663
You've been here?

142
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,780
Where else would the bedroom be?

143
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,401
Come with?

144
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,531
You're scared of him catching
us breaking into his home,

145
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,465
but you're not scared of
him catching us doing it in his bed?

146
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,069
If I'm gonna get fired anyway...

147
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:11,946
Almost at the heart.

148
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,642
No bleeding.

149
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:16,321
And... done.

150
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:21,521
Heart rate's 160, it's accelerating.
He's at 210.

151
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,104
He's in supraventricular
tachycardia. Paddles!

152
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:25,996
Charging.

153
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:27,996
Clear!

154
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,703
We're wasting our time!

155
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:33,659
His high school yearbook.

156
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,479
Unless you think he's going to
Boston to attend a high school reunion,

157
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,870
put it back and let's get
out of here before he comes home.

158
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,108
- He's not smiling.
- I wonder if he has teeth.

159
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,203
- What's the area code for Boston?
- 617, why?

160
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,246
Massachusetts General. May I help you?

161
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:56,830
Did you think you could steal Dr.
House without a fight?

162
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,013
Steal him for what?

163
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:00,138
Quit jerking me around,
I know he's coming out there.

164
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,347
We're not looking to hire him.

165
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,319
He's called you six
times in the last month.

166
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,669
We're not looking to hire him.

167
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,117
You think if you keep repeating it,
I'll start believing you?

168
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:09,648
Dr. Cuddy, there's nothing
else I can say. I'm sorry.

169
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,636
If he's not coming
there for a job interview,

170
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:18,737
he's either coming to your hospital for
a social visit or cause he's a patient.

171
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,328
Is it a social visit, Dr. Medick?

172
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,636
I can't stand House.

173
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:28,682
Neither can Dr. Kupersmith.

174
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:38,887
What's up?

175
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:43,567
Do you know a Dr. Kupersmith in Boston?

176
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,639
Yeah, he's an oncologist.

177
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,090
What's up?

178
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,584
- What's his subspecialty?
- Brain cancer.

179
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,684
What's going on?

180
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,853
He doesn't look sick.
He should have symptoms.

181
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:06,270
Blurred vision,
headaches, confusion, clumsiness.

182
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:10,203
Depends on how far along the cancer is,
what kind, how aggressive.

183
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:11,753
He didn't tell you.

184
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,051
House is House.

185
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:18,144
He's no different than
anyone else with cancer.

186
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,300
Once you tell,
then every conversation is about that.

187
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,713
Cardiac arrest means we were wrong.

188
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,595
- There was a heart problem.
- But no vasoconstriction!

189
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:31,496
The heart problem couldn't
have caused the hand problem.

190
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,301
Unless the bleed happened suddenly.

191
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,512
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia,

192
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,553
less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

193
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:41,767
Scope him above and below.
If that doesn't work, gut him.

194
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:45,872
You can't sedate him?

195
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,992
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

196
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,802
- You look mad, Pop.
- No.

197
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,054
No, I'm not mad, I promise you.

198
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:57,853
It's just that, um, the doctor
has to do something to you and it's,

199
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:58,957
and it's gonna hurt.

200
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,763
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

201
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,537
- Make you better.
- What's wrong with me?

202
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:05,915
Well, they don't know.

203
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:12,164
Patrick, don't you worry,
everything is gonna be great.

204
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,257
All right, here we go, Patrick.

205
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,208
You wanna hurt me.

206
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,055
Okay, open. Like this.

207
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,745
You just look at me.
And everything is gonna be okay.

208
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:26,243
Look at me.

209
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,453
- Patrick, over here.
- Oh, Daddy!

210
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,869
Yep, it's okay. It's okay, really.

211
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:38,732
I just spoke to Cuddy,

212
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,523
she can't confirm whether House
is applying for a job in Boston.

213
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,105
Yeah, I'm late for a--

214
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,900
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

215
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:02,927
That's pretty.

216
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,506
I wrote this when I
was in junior high school.

217
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,833
I could never figure out what came next.

218
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,135
Then dimwit came up with this.

219
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:21,652
It's good.

220
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,920
It's perfect.

221
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,433
I could set up a tower on
the roof during a lightning storm.

222
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,584
Help you switch brains
with your patient.

223
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,727
Then you would be the brilliant pianist

224
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:39,215
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer from his friend.

225
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,243
It's nothing.

226
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,266
- You need to talk about it.
- You need to talk about it.

227
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,974
At least let me look
at your medical file.

228
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:49,957
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

229
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:51,862
- Who else knows?
- No one.

230
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:53,482
And cancer isn't nothing.

231
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,784
Sorry, didn't mean
to offend your specialty.

232
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,999
- Why didn't you come to me?
- Stein's good.

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,235
Stein's in Africa
for the next six months.

234
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:04,341
He's given me at least six months. I'll
go to Boston, I'll get the treatment.

235
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,982
Everything'll be fine.

236
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,917
No need to talk about it.

237
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,122
You're right,

238
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,730
surgeon found a bleed behind the
kidney in the retroperitoneal cavity,

239
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:14,929
but no reason for it.

240
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,847
No cancer, no ruptured arteries...
So bleeding explains the symptoms,

241
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,362
but we've got no explanation
for the bleeding.

242
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:26,058
And while they were closing him up,
Patrick had a grand mal seizure,

243
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,459
which makes no sense, since
he's on an anti-convulsant medication.

244
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,906
- You told him.
- No, I didn't.

245
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,145
I...

246
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,526
only told Cameron.

247
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,560
Okay. You guys have cleverly
deduced that I have cancer.

248
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,866
You have no right to know.
You have no business knowing.

249
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,310
We'd like to run some blood tests.

250
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,773
As soon as you work up our patient,
who is not me!

251
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,936
We just want to make
sure you weren't misdiagnosed.

252
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:04,412
I wasn't, let's move on.

253
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,627
We're just asking for a couple of vials.

254
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,251
Why not?

255
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:11,290
Okay, we're going to proceed
as if I'm perfectly healthy.

256
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,492
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

257
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:14,771
You don't know anything!

258
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,798
Except, hopefully,

259
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:20,028
how a patient on anti-convulsant
medication has a seizure.

260
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,939
Anti-seizure meds don't prevent them,
they just make them manageable.

261
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,014
According to the surgeon's report, this
one wasn't even close to manageable.

262
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,387
Means the question isn't
why is he having seizures,

263
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,438
it's why are his seizures getting worse?

264
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,492
- What's changed?
- His brain, it's gotten worse.

265
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,790
So we make it even worser.

266
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:40,118
We take him off
anti-convulsant medication.

267
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,476
He'll seize even more. Multiple
seizures can seriously damage a brain.

268
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:44,927
Dude can't button his shirt.

269
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:46,897
How much more damaged
we really talking about?

270
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,313
Stronger seizures will light
up different parts of the brain

271
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,091
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

272
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,740
Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.

273
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,124
- PET scan done?
- No.

274
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,666
You come for my feelings?

275
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,356
'Cause I left them in my other pants.

276
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:13,075
This is a letter  of recommendation.
I'm applying for a job at Penn.

277
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,673
Thank you for writing your own.

278
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,037
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

279
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:25,388
Thank you for signing it.
Saves me having to fake your signature.

280
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:35,955
Stay away from Weiss.

281
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,406
He cries with his patients.

282
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,501
Holds their hands as they die.
He won't like you.

283
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,636
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

284
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,803
I thought you'd find it appealing.

285
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:53,958
20 seconds.

286
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:55,628
Pretty good.

287
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,881
For what?

288
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,582
Time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

289
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,803
You really wanna leave?

290
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,815
If you're not here,
there's not much point in staying.

291
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:09,766
I'm not dead yet.

292
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:19,202
What are you doing?

293
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,570
I know this must be a turn-on for you.

294
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:05,521
Little whorish to kiss and stab.

295
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:07,424
You kissed back.

296
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:10,320
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

297
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,942
Actually, no woman should
die without knowing the feeling.

298
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,979
All we need is a
few drops of your blood.

299
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,972
Foreman and Chase's lips are not gonna
get so close now that I know your plan.

300
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,725
There's a nurse downstairs about
to risk his job to steal the blood

301
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,982
you drew from yourself yes--
- I'm patient number 020406.

302
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,690
In the record room under
the name Luke N. Laura.

303
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:29,722
There's a whole vial of blood there.

304
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:32,558
Along with CT scans,
MRIs, CSF-- everything you need.

305
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:39,154
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

306
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:51,350
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

307
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,285
extending into the temporal lobe.

308
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:55,853
That's inoperable.

309
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,659
What kind of time does he have?

310
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,090
He's got a year.

311
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,062
Nurse!

312
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,537
There's a consent from
Boston for the cancer drug trial.

313
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:19,894
Any description of the
process of previous trials?

314
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,499
- Yep.
- Any chance it'd work?

315
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:24,154
- No.
- It's not even designed to work.

316
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,529
Why would he--

317
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,439
It's designed to treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

318
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,790
He doesn't seem depressed.

319
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,377
Okay, let's assume that I am dying.

320
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:38,267
Which I specifically
told you not to assume.

321
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:41,644
Could we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

322
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:45,255
Whereas this kid,
PET revealed several more hot spots,

323
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,348
but they're non-specific.
- How can you focus on him?

324
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,113
It's the only way I can cope.

325
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,613
PET also showed a left
brain that's working hard.

326
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:56,516
- Harder than the right?
- Wouldn't be worth mentioning otherwise

327
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,744
Bleeding in the brain.
Blood would irritate the lining,

328
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:00,695
might cause the seizures to get worse.

329
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:04,485
Yes, he needs an angiogram to look
at the vasculature inside his brain.

330
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:07,286
We'll get right on it,
as soon as we're finished here.

331
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,730
Don't get up. I got it.

332
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,312
You're busy. Continue.

333
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,446
You know what my
team is doing right now?

334
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:22,809
No.

335
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:26,352
They're trying to figure
out what's wrong with me.

336
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:28,703
- What's wrong with you?
- Thanks for asking.

337
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,503
- They found out that I'm dying.
- That's sad.

338
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,916
- Everyone's dying.
- That's sad.

339
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,719
Meteor lands on my head tomorrow,
it's all academic.

340
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,021
I told them to leave me alone,
but did they?

341
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,146
- D- Did they?
- No, that one was rhetorical.

342
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:48,640
No, they did not.

343
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,748
What the hell were you
before you hit your head?

344
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,908
Hell is a bad word.

345
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,240
So's ass and bitch.

346
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:03,225
I could probably rattle off 50 much
more complicated and disgusting ones,

347
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:05,481
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

348
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:08,533
Do you like your life?

349
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:10,688
What life?

350
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,232
Your life.

351
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:14,916
Playing the piano, going on tour.

352
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,851
Scoring girls left and right.

353
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:18,620
I don't like girls.

354
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:20,871
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

355
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,361
I like the piano.

356
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:28,797
What's wrong?

357
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:34,518
Dr. Peter Hayes? This is Eric
Foreman at Princeton Plainsboro.

358
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,652
You're doing a signal transduction
inhibitor clinical trial.

359
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,185
What kind of results have you been--

360
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:42,016
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

361
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:45,105
Bye, Pete!

362
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,484
They've got another
trial going on at Duke.

363
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:54,329
15% extend their
lives beyond five years.

364
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:57,965
- If you're positive for protein PHF--
- Stop trying to save me.

365
00:23:58,629 --> 00:23:59,579
I'm fine.

366
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:04,476
MRA confirms small collections
of blood throughout the white matter

367
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:07,698
of Patrick's right hemisphere. Mind
if we chat about that for a few moments?

368
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:11,386
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer, or autoimmune disease.

369
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,525
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

370
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,808
His EEG was non-specific.
Where are you gonna biopsy?

371
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:16,759
Everywhere.

372
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,305
Sure, just put on a blindfold
and play pin the tail on the brain.

373
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:22,850
He's bleeding into his brain.
He's dying.

374
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,676
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

375
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,015
and hope you hit the right spot.

376
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:28,994
Well, I'm only gonna
take little tiny pieces.

377
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,061
- Until what?
- Till I find the problem.

378
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:32,012
Or you kill him.

379
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:34,128
No, I'll keep going even if I kill him.

380
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,362
Then he's screwed.

381
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,480
Thanks for the chat.

382
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,508
What if

383
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,288
we do the EEG from inside his brain?

384
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,033
I'm actually a little insulted.

385
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,077
You were supposed to spend
the last hour worrying about me.

386
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,328
It's risky and invasive.

387
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,587
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

388
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,388
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

389
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,439
External EEG could get confused if there
are multiple structural abnormalities.

390
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,645
If we perform the EEG inside the skull,
it could show us where to biopsy.

391
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,886
Brilliant. Go. Do.

392
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:23,937
- I'd also like to talk to you about--
- This is gonna be personal, isn't it?

393
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:24,888
Yeah.

394
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,442
We use a small drill
to get inside the skull.

395
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,108
- There's bleeding inside?
- Yes.

396
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,372
As long as we have 12 holes,
we can surgically implant the electrodes

397
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,465
under the meninges against the brain.

398
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,901
And it's either cancer
or autoimmune disease?

399
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,720
Sorry. Yeah.

400
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:05,459
Which one is better?

401
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:09,154
Neither.

402
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:44,335
- Where do we cut?
- We don't.

403
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,163
I need to say something.

404
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:50,854
- Something personal.
- Yeah.

405
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:55,288
And I can't leave because you've
got something interesting in that file.

406
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,239
Sorry.

407
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,979
You're an arrogant ass who makes
it impossible for anyone to like him,

408
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:08,476
by punishing people who don't deserve--

409
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,777
Can we get to the "but"
part of this speech?

410
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:12,786
But I like you.

411
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:17,151
No, you don't. You're just
reacting to the perception of my death.

412
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:20,162
You need to put things in order.
Fear of guilt--

413
00:27:20,163 --> 00:27:21,113
Would you shut up?

414
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:22,476
See? I annoy you.

415
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:26,381
Now are you gonna give me the results,
or are you gonna...

416
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:32,486
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

417
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,548
Which means it's autoimmune.

418
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,699
No, it also showed his entire
right hemisphere is brain dead.

419
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:49,234
So... while you guys were worrying
about me, half this kid's brain died.

420
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:53,496
The only solace you should take
from this is the fact that it didn't.

421
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:56,610
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to the in-brain variety,

422
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,154
but it's not gonna miss brain death.

423
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,174
- He's gotten worse.
- Not that much worse.

424
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:03,553
Respiration is depressed, seizures
are increasing, one every five minutes.

425
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,998
Not that much worse.

426
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,576
He can still talk, and he's left-handed,

427
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:09,407
which means speech is in the right side.

428
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:12,821
You don't know how Patrick's
brain reorganized itself 25 years ago.

429
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:16,354
What if the right side
is just a little dead.

430
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,442
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

431
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:22,699
You're just looking for a puzzle
to distract you from your own situation.

432
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.

433
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,717
What'd you find out?

434
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,495
Is he gonna be okay?

435
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,798
- I'm sor--
- Yes!

436
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,780
- What's this?
- Piano.

437
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:44,351
What's this?

438
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:51,803
- He's obviously lost use--
- Shut up.

439
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:15,225
Music is a global process.
Can't play the piano with half a brain.

440
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,741
What's it mean?

441
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:22,684
It means the right side
of his brain has always sucked.

442
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:25,283
It means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

443
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:27,184
- Wow, then it's autoimmune.
- Yeah.

444
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,093
Question is, what do we do about it?

445
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,419
Most likely ones we can fix.

446
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,271
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu, or Sarcoid.

447
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:35,021
I'll start treatment.

448
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,486
Not what I was talking about, but yeah.
You do that.

449
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,334
Your turn?

450
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:49,657
Do you have to do that?

451
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:53,898
You mean cheapen everyone's
attempt at a human moment

452
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:56,649
by identifying the real
calculations that go into it?

453
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,801
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I do.

454
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,353
I'm sorry you're dying.
I'm gonna hug you.

455
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:04,581
Anything to say?

456
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:08,564
Well, if you're considering
grabbing my ass, don't start anything...

457
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,109
you can't finish.

458
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:16,506
Well, as long as we're just
standing here, do you mind if we work?

459
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,157
How's the kid's treatment going?

460
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,463
- Are you crying?
- No.

461
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:26,889
Respiration rate's up.

462
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:29,462
Seizures are calming down.
It's all good.

463
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,642
Not for what I'm gonna do next.

464
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,693
But there is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

465
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:39,068
Only if he wants to remain
a four-year-old who wets his bed.

466
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,159
There's nothing else for him.

467
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
There's better. Thanks for the hug.

468
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,977
It's the middle of the night.
You knew I'd be asleep.

469
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:11,532
Phone would've woken
you up just as much.

470
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,218
And I can't see what
you're wearing on the phone.

471
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:19,524
My patient with the
55 IQ has Takayasu syndrome.

472
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:21,739
Very uncommon.

473
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:24,319
Happens mostly in Asian women.

474
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,307
Takayasu is manageable with steroids,
which you already know.

475
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:30,972
So I assume you're
here for something else.

476
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:33,804
My patient also has
significant seizure problems.

477
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,305
Also manageable with
anti-convulsant medication.

478
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:38,892
Yes, and if he kept taking
his anti-convulsant medication,

479
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:41,382
he could go back on
tour and play the piano.

480
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:42,664
But...

481
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,920
a hemispherectomy would completely
stop the right brain seizure activity

482
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,273
and he would no longer need
to take his anti-convulsant medication.

483
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,924
You wanna remove half his brain.

484
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:55,905
The right half, it would
be irresponsible to remove the left.

485
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:58,406
You don't remove half
a brain and gain function.

486
00:31:58,503 --> 00:31:59,453
Not my brain.

487
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,503
But his? Who knows?

488
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:05,556
Look, let's say that I'm
the left side of Patrick's brain.

489
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,957
I'm quick-witted,
I'm charming, I'm great looking.

490
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,308
You're the right side of his brain.
You're useless, old, damaged.

491
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:12,894
We go to a bar for a drink.

492
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:16,011
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring all the hot babes,

493
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,502
but instead I'm spending
my time wiping drool off your chin

494
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,853
and making sure you
don't eat the tablecloth.

495
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:24,628
What's the father wanna do?

496
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:26,434
I don't know.

497
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:30,384
So go wake him up.

498
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:37,722
I'm so sorry.

499
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,698
- Forgot I was dying, huh?
- I'm here if you need me.

500
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,648
I need you.

501
00:32:55,903 --> 00:33:01,356
One small feel for man.
One giant ass for mankind.

502
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,065
Thanks.

503
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:06,621
Good luck in Boston.

504
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,871
Call the Make a Wish Foundation.

505
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:26,429
Dr. Foreman was just here. Seizures
have almost completely gone away.

506
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:29,457
Says we might be able to
go home in the next day or two.

507
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,513
Thank you so much.

508
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:34,773
I think we should remove
the right side of your son's brain.

509
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,659
- I thought you fixed him.
- Does he look fixed?

510
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:41,263
Right side of his brain
was keeping him walking straight.

511
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,808
Other than that, it's been
dead weight ever since the accident.

512
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,510
If we remove it,
seizures would stop completely.

513
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:50,278
But the seizures are hardly noticeable.
They don't bother Patrick.

514
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,498
But without the seizures,
the left side would have a chance to

515
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:54,594
actually function.

516
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:58,320
It could learn to do new things.
Only bummer...

517
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,382
he'd never play the piano again.

518
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,704
No, the piano is everything.

519
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:07,584
I'm not saying he'd
ever work for NASA, but

520
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:09,799
flipping burgers isn't
out of the question.

521
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,359
Well, I don't mind taking
care of him so he can play the piano.

522
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,252
No, you're actually lucky.

523
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,748
You don't have to watch your
kid grow up. You don't have to let go.

524
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,449
You trying to make this about me?

525
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:23,123
I love my son! Just the way he is.

526
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,274
He's a monkey grinder at the circus.

527
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:28,453
- He's worked hard to get where he--
- So does the monkey.

528
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:34,589
- The piano is a neurological accident.
- He has a gift.

529
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,057
I'm offering him a life.

530
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:43,571
It's up to you.

531
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,019
I've isolated the cancer
proteins in House's CSF.

532
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:01,958
'Bout time.

533
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:05,030
We can't let him go to Boston
if he qualifies for the Duke trial.

534
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,042
You wanna do it?

535
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,570
Damn.

536
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,932
He's negative for protein PHF.
He doesn't qualify.

537
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,376
What's that?

538
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,115
That shouldn't be there.

539
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,093
Hello, Papa.

540
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:22,721
Patrick, I have a question for you.

541
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:25,998
Yes?

542
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,960
Are you happy?

543
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,526
Are you happy?

544
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,140
Open up!

545
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,405
Open up, it's important!

546
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:42,062
- I've got a flight in three hours.
- You don't have cancer.

547
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,665
There was abnormal presence
of IgG and IgM indicating--

548
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,576
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing--

549
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:51,237
It's a gumma in your brain.
It's very rare not to be in the liver,

550
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,082
and I'm really glad
we never slept together--

551
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:56,786
You would've used a condom. And I don't
have syphilis. My VDRL was negative--

552
00:37:56,787 --> 00:38:00,336
We did an FTA antibody test,
the VDRL was a false negative.

553
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,376
You're not going to die!
All you need is IV antibiotics!

554
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,705
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

555
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,430
Of course.

556
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,518
You idiots.

557
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:19,066
We just told you you're not gonna die.

558
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:21,156
You should be making out with Cameron.

559
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:25,772
- You knew it wasn't cancer?
- I was sure it was cancer.

560
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:30,715
- Then why aren't you celebrating?
- Because it wasn't my damn file!

561
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,542
You faked cancer?

562
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:36,889
The real patient is
in the Witherspoon Wing.

563
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,522
Feel free to tell his wife that he's not
gonna die, but he is cheating on her.

564
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:42,180
Why would you want
us to think that you--

565
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:45,852
I didn't! I wanted the guys
in Boston to think that I had cancer.

566
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,615
I wanted the guys who
were gonna implant a cool drug

567
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:52,211
right into the pleasure center
of my brain to think that I had cancer.

568
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:54,744
You faked cancer to get high?

569
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,469
I'm going to bed.

570
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:09,081
You're right.

571
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,769
- I don't like you.
- Sure, now that I'm not dying.

572
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:33,891
I heard Patrick's
hemispherectomy went well.

573
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,325
He survived the surgery.
He's unconscious.

574
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,714
How depressed are you?

575
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:40,499
I'm not depressed.

576
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:42,893
You faked cancer.

577
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:46,037
It was an outpatient procedure.
I was curious.

578
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:48,022
Are you curious about heroin?

579
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:50,207
Not since last year's Christmas party.

580
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:55,976
I know this goes against your nature,
but can we not make too much of this?

581
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,806
You made people think
that you were going to die.

582
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,112
I didn't make them! I tried to hide it.

583
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,833
But you idiots needed
to get into my business.

584
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:11,996
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

585
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:13,919
It's ironic.

586
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,730
I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why--

587
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:20,076
Depression in cancer patients
is not as common as you think.

588
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,486
It's not the dying that gets to people.
It's the dying alone.

589
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:27,356
The patients with family,
with friends, they tend to do okay.

590
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:31,916
You don't have cancer.
You do have people who give a damn.

591
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:33,197
So what do you do?

592
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:38,168
You fake the cancer,

593
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:41,314
then push the people who care away.

594
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,786
Because they're boring.

595
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,698
Go home to your hotel
room and laugh at that irony.

596
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:56,306
Start small, House. Take a chance.

597
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,369
Maybe something that doesn't
involve sticking stuff in your brain.

598
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:01,702
Pizza with a friend.

599
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:04,864
A movie.

600
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,550
Something.

601
00:41:24,753 --> 00:41:25,703
Follow my finger.

602
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:28,993
Do you know your name?

603
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:36,603
His speech center was on the right side.

604
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:39,251
It'll be a while before he's talking.

605
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:44,019
He hasn't really done anything
except to stare off into the distance.

606
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:45,731
He'll take some time to...

607
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,437
You buttoned your shirt.

608
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,229
He looks happy.

609
