1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:03,178
My offer's withdrawn,
you can walk to work.

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,669
Got it, you're morally outraged.
Now can we get through this part
'cause the next part's awesome?

3
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:12,163
How do you rationalise
something like this? You broke
into Stacy's therapist's office...

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:12,984
Borrowed a key.

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,291
...and stole her treatment notes!

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,245
Nope! I made copies.

7
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,685
Mark is, and I quote,
[Wilson groans]

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,100
"Withdrawn, passive-aggressive,
won't communicate, like he resents me
because I can walk"

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,262
I don't want to hear this.

10
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,756
Dishes in the sink,
toilet seat up.

11
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,629
Meanwhile, she can't
stop thinking about...

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:36,499
I can't read that,
is she obsessed with
a Grey Horse? Or me?

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,511
It says she thinks
you're an annoying jerk.

14
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:41,013
It's a pet name.

15
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,009
Here's the kicker.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,578
They're not having sex?

17
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:54,735
Doctor cleared him,
but no liftoff.

18
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,525
She's frustrated
so she's doc-blocking me.

19
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:00,764
Paperwork, seminars,
meddling with my patients.

20
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,472
Great, now you've got
the proof you need. Just...

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:06,743
take those personal psych
records to Cuddy, that'll show
her Stacy's out of control.

22
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,790
You ignoring me?

23
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,492
While looking for my newspaper,
efficient huh?

24
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,421
Kalvin:
Over here!

25
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:20,051
[Sighs] Dr. Wilson,
I want you to meet my stalker.

26
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,965
Your waiting room sucks.

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,575
I am not treating you.

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,645
What, because
you're a closet-case?

29
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:29,035
Err...we're not...
err... together.

30
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,518
He is so self-loathing.

31
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,405
Well, we've got to go now,
so maybe see you after work...

32
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,927
No no no! Ah...

33
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,104
Nobody can figure out
what's wrong with me.

34
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:46,104
Well, your shirt is gaping
at the collar, means
you lost weight, you're flushed,

35
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,461
that's fever, and
you're short of breath.

36
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,314
And finally there's
the KS lesion on your face.

37
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:54,008
Means you're HIV positive,
you've progressed
to full-blown AIDS.

38
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,112
So you're sick because
our immune system is shot
and someone sneezed on you.

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
am I excused now?

40
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:02,416
Brilliant, but,
my immune system is fine.

41
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:06,515
Your concentration camp
physique begs to differ.
Get your T-cell count re-checked.

42
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,729
I've already done that.

43
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,739
They test for
T-cell lymphoma?

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,062
It was negative.

45
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:14,243
All of this will be fascinating
to an HIV specialist.

46
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,885
Now let go of my cane before
it becomes your new boyfriend.

47
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,551
Honey, I will marry it
if you would look at my file.

48
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,411
Congress says you can't, so...

49
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:28,311
[Car alarm goes off]

50
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,083
[Wheezes]

51
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,761
I didn't touch him.

52
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,062
He's going into
anaphylactic shock.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,188
2x07 - Hunting

54
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,530
Original Airdate (FOX): 22-NOV-2005

55
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,391
- Go see Stacy.
- We gave him epi, he's fine.

56
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,749
You need a lawyer,
go see Stacy.

57
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,002
You hit a patient.

58
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,560
Four words, two mistakes.

59
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,428
He's not a patient,
and I didn't hit him.

60
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,003
Of course you didn't.
Go see Stacy.

61
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,068
I didn't cause
the anaphylaxis.

62
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,651
It's probably one of
his HIV meds abacavir.

63
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,920
I'll pass that along,
make sure
the ER takes him off it.

64
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,047
Go see Stacy.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,188
You have to treat him.

66
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,649
Medically this case
is a snooze-fest.

67
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,997
AIDS plus infection.

68
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,079
You don't treat him,
he charges you with assault.

69
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,537
Just 'cause he says I hit him
doesn't make it true.

70
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:46,037
Watch, I am surrounded
by naked cheerleaders.

71
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,438
See?

72
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:51,475
Although I like my chances
of some action this morning.

73
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:55,218
I forgot
Wednesday was hooker day.
This could've waited!

74
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,698
You make me meet you
at your house,

75
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,441
your husband is
conveniently absent.

76
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,071
Mark's at physio.

77
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:05,365
I'm stuck waiting
for the exterminator.

78
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,861
I saw a rat last night.

79
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:11,537
Well, I'm surprised
your feet are touching the floor.

80
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,080
I barely slept.

81
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,658
What was Mark up to?

82
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:20,117
Memory serves,
quick climb up Mt. Gregory and
you dozed through a seal hunt.

83
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,885
Clubbing, shrieking.

84
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,427
What're you doing?

85
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,426
Sorry, it's driving me nuts.

86
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,320
You hate washing dishes.

87
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,714
People change.

88
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:38,931
I could make sure you
sleep like a baby tonight.

89
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,050
Rather take care of that myself.

90
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,320
I was referring to the rat.

91
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,830
Trenton Pests is sending a guy.

92
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,597
Mark:
What's going on?

93
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,654
It's not what you think.

94
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,856
I know it looks like
we're cleaning dishes but
actually, we're having sex.

95
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,979
We're working.

96
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,546
Wow, wish
I'd become a doctor.

97
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,597
Place would be spotless.

98
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:13,490
Take ten minutes,
cure the guy, and stop whining.

99
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,967
I give you Kalvin Ryan.

100
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,882
So flamboyant in person,
so boring on paper.

101
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:26,783
Obviously got an
opportunistic infection,
probably TB or PCP.

102
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,010
Have you read his file?

103
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,597
I started, but I found
the characters two-dimensional.

104
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,840
He went to
a HIV clinic last week.

105
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:38,991
Tested negative for
TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV.

106
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,035
It's not an infection.

107
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,170
HIV clinic.
So few patients, so much money.
Re-do the tests.

108
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:45,518
The results make sense.

109
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,723
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200,
that's strong enough
to fight infection.

110
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,176
Fine, parasite.

111
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,923
Nope, stool sample
was negative.

112
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,934
Two months ago,
he was down to 30 T-cells,
then he changed his meds,

113
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,095
his immune system rebounds,
his viral load drops,

114
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,706
everything's getting better
but he's getting sicker.

115
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,220
Face it, this might be
an interesting case.

116
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:15,501
What if his immune system
is too strong.

117
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:19,273
An auto-immune disease
with HIV, that's impossible.

118
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:23,795
His new HIV meds kicked
his system out of a sound sleep.

119
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,312
Wakes up hungry,
cranky, spoiling for a fight.

120
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,504
When it doesn't find
an active infection,

121
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,870
starts attacking
the harmless remnants
of old infections.

122
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,462
Immune reconstitution syndrome.

123
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:39,426
His meds made him
so much better,
he made himself sick.

124
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,872
- Sounds pretty...
- BORING!

125
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,616
This is so not interesting.

126
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,117
Chest X-ray and
find the old infections,
start him on steroids.

127
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:55,007
If you're wrong,
steroids will tank his immune system.
He'll get worse.

128
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,227
Now THAT would be interesting.

129
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,287
Where's the coumadin?

130
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,376
If your patient's got
a blood problem then
blood thinners aren't exactly...

131
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,492
It's for Stacy's rat.
Death by anti-coagulation.

132
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:09,704
Trying to win Stacy back
by killing an animal...

133
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,952
very caveman.

134
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,913
I don't want her back.

135
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,398
I just want her to
admit her feelings for me.

136
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:21,199
I go to Cuddy,
Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her.
Either way, I'm happy.

137
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:27,758
If you want her back,
either tell her,
or, better yet, shut up,

138
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,889
and cry yourself to sleep
like everybody else.

139
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:33,874
Hi, this is Mark Warner,
1724 Spring street.

140
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,109
Listen, you don't need
to send that guy down,
we caught him.

141
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:41,051
No, you should send the bill to
Princeton-Plainsborough hospital.

142
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,512
Attn: Dr James Wilson.

143
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,694
Yeah.

144
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,523
Your lymph nodes ren't swollen.
That's good.

145
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,945
Maybe Dr. Chase should check.

146
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,878
Sorry mate, hands full.

147
00:07:57,254 --> 00:08:00,638
He's too pretty to be straight.
You ever done any modeling?

148
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,648
Does anyone actually
fall for that line?

149
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,015
Everyday.
Why do you think
I became a photographer?

150
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:10,489
I'm guessing
you guys didn't think
about dating on career day.

151
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,211
- I love my job.
- Really?

152
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:18,652
You seem more the
'find it exceptionally satisfying' type.

153
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,379
I'm not sure
there's a difference.

154
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:24,235
Your mom died of diabetes,
how's your dad's health?

155
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,348
Last I heard,
he had cirrhosis.

156
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:34,030
Love is love,
satisfying is social validation,
fun can wait.

157
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,499
I have fun.

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,059
Yeah, she's got
some scheduled for February.

159
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,194
Chase:
Last you heard?
Your father?

160
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,226
He threw me out
when I was 16.

161
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:47,100
It's just as well, I got tired of
getting BB guns for my birthday
when I'd asked for a Barbie.

162
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,476
Dads can be real sweethearts.

163
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,758
Mmm, sensitive, AND cute.

164
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,009
He's cute.

165
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,759
It ran into that
heating vent right there.

166
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,641
Hopefully Mark's anger
will go away eventually.

167
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,967
He's not angry,
just doesn't like you.

168
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,698
Nothing unique there.

169
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,281
Didn't seem really
wild about you either.

170
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:22,683
He's fine with me.

171
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,843
He's angry.
Said so in group.

172
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,417
Of course he's angry,
he's looking at months
of painful physio.

173
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,519
[Sniffs]
He's mad at you.

174
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,528
There's no way he said that.

175
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:39,489
[Sighs]
No, but it's true.

176
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,545
He resents you
for being able to walk.

177
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,316
I've been there.

178
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:54,694
I resented you
for hell of a long time.

179
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:58,068
Past tense?

180
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,216
[Phone starts to ring]

181
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,781
Might be the hospital.

182
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,768
What!?

183
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,369
[Phone is on speaker]
Bad time? Where are you?

184
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,676
Hosue:
<i>At your girlfriend's place.
Ignore the moaning and squeaking.</i>

185
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,094
His lungs are too scarred to tell
which infection triggered
the immune reconstitution.

186
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,755
He a smoker?

187
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,378
Cameron:
<i>Yes, and possible
more than cigarettes.</i>

188
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:34,593
His tox screen came back
positive for recreational drugs.

189
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,303
House:
<i>Not surprising.
Not medically relevant.</i>

190
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,898
His heart looks
a little enlarged.

191
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:41,469
House:
<i>That's a typical
side-effect of AZT.</i>

192
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,575
House:
<i>What are Kalvin's
most recent infections?</i>

193
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,224
Toxo, CMV and PCP.

194
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,603
[Squeaking]

195
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,993
[Whispers]
Well let's assume
it's one of those.

196
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,286
House:
<i>Give him Ganciclovir
for the CMV...</i>

197
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,399
Woah,
we can hardly hear you.
Where are you?

198
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:00,136
House: <i>In a closet.</i>
Your girlfriend's other
boyfriend showed up.

199
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,045
Ganciclovir for the CMV,

200
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:09,636
Sulfadiazin for the Toxo,
Bactrim for PCP.

201
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,664
Gotta go, it's killing time.

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,642
Cameron:
Your tox screen
came back positive for...

203
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:48,519
Crystal meth
and...ecstasy.

204
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:52,363
Recreational drugs are
dangerous to begin with,
but for someone with HIV...

205
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,144
I didn't mistake them
for vitamins.

206
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,586
[Whispers]
I'm a P&P boy.

207
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,053
Party and Play.

208
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,371
Drugs and sex.

209
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,229
[Coughs]

210
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,594
You don't approve?

211
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,300
Does the sex include condoms?

212
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,844
If he's negative, sure.
If he's positive...

213
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,959
why put on a raincoat
if you're already wet?

214
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,423
You could get hepatitis
or another strain of HIV.

215
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,791
Or I could get hit by a bus.

216
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,497
AIDS isn't a
death sentence anymore.

217
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,947
I don't want to
have any regrets.

218
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,397
[Starts coughing again]

219
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,281
How long have
you been coughing?

220
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:40,548
Ah...about an hour or so.
[Coughs]

221
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,306
Try to take a deep breath.

222
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,844
[Coughs]

223
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,384
What is it?

224
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,396
I think its blood.

225
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,943
[Starts coughing again]

226
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,860
I recommend
post-exposure prophylaxis.

227
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,139
Your chances of conversion are slim,

228
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,885
but I'd like to put you
on three antiviral medications.

229
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:14,279
Finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine.

230
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:19,480
There are side-effects;
headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.

231
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:26,028
You'll be tested for HIV
in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months...

232
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,419
Very interesting.

233
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:36,042
He coughs infected blood
in Cameron's eyes and mouth,
that's interesting?

234
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:39,570
The coughing part,
not the in Cameron part.

235
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,222
New symptom,
blood vessel ruptured in his lung.

236
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,856
I closed the tear.

237
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,954
Well it takes
immune reconstitution
off the table.

238
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,868
What's it put on the table?

239
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:53,518
Its ok, she's not here.
You can skip the nice guy acts.

240
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:56,961
You know some human beings are
actually capable of human feelings.

241
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,001
My giving a damn or not
is not going to change
what happened.

242
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,040
Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.

243
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,348
No edema,
no blood in urine.

244
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,842
KS on his face could mean
KS in his lungs, with
bleeding from the lesions.

245
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,326
I would have seen them
when I repaired the tear in his lung.

246
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,078
Wegener's granulomatosis?

247
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,563
Wegener's would have
responded to the steroids.

248
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,941
Maybe you should go home,
take the rest of the day.

249
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,183
I'm fine.

250
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,058
Oh this is good,
he's pretending to care,
you're pretending not to.

251
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,928
I think we should
reconsider drugs.
Kalvin uses crystal meth.

252
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:33,276
Concerned enough
about his health to stalk me

253
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,801
while indulging in
deadly street drugs.

254
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,859
Study in contradictions.

255
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,430
Interesting.
Still not medically relevant.

256
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,963
It could be,
if his drugs were tainted.

257
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,887
They cook meth with
battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...

258
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,635
Find Kalvin's pills,
test for toxins.

259
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,515
Foreman, you're with me.

260
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,479
I need a consult
on another case.

261
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,590
You have another case?

262
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,776
It's a hip-pocket deal.

263
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,543
Patient presents
with a distinct neck tilt.

264
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,943
*****
Is he an athlete?

265
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,643
He's a regular runner.

266
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,468
Any pain associated
with movement.

267
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,610
None that he's complained of.

268
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,509
Best case scenario,
an infection in the ear or lungs.

269
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:20,539
Worst case,
brain stem tumour.

270
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,271
Should do an MRI,
CAT scan, full work-up.

271
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,327
Uhh..I don't think so.

272
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,408
No insurance.

273
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:35,752
No drugs in here.
I'll take the bathroom.

274
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:40,597
How about a drink after work?
Take your mind off what happened.

275
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:47,174
Cameron?

276
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,536
I might have HIV,
a drink's not going to wash it away.

277
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,302
There's like zero chance of
you contracting the virus.

278
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,941
Big difference between
'like zero' and 'zero'.

279
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,193
What did the infection
control guy tell you?

280
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:05,280
He was very reassuring,
kept reminding me that
the hospital covers all my medical costs.

281
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,712
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

282
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:12,137
that they'll pass it on to legal
and legal will dig up any dirt
they can trying to prove that I'm a...

283
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:16,042
drug user or tramp, and
that's why I have HIV.

284
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,589
It's not like they're going
to find anything, right?

285
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,634
Right.

286
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,108
Check this out.

287
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:26,013
Chase:
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

288
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,307
Glass is from
1930's fluorescent.

289
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:29,595
Some of the bulbs
have date stamps.

290
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,675
Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs
contained large amounts of beryllium.

291
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,501
Beryllium dust inflames the lungs,
they get rigid, patient can't breathe.

292
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:41,474
My father co-authored a paper
on acute berylliosis.

293
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:44,764
Phew! For a moment there
I thought you were smart.

294
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,175
Cameron, get a biopsy of
Calvin's lung tissue.

295
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,718
I want a spectrographic analysis.

296
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:50,668
I can handle it.

297
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,507
No reason to risk
exposing the entire team.

298
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:55,644
Then who would I torment?

299
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,377
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,651
About what happened.

301
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,882
It's best not to talk.

302
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:10,884
You're going to
feel a sharp pinch.

303
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:14,167
This actually is going to
grab a piece of your lung.

304
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,180
What were you guys
looking for at my hotel?

305
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:26,410
Your drugs. Thought maybe
you'd used toxic meth.

306
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,448
We'll know if you're exposed
to beryllium in a few hours.

307
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:34,801
Well if you're still curious, it's...
in my bag over there on the chair.

308
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,063
You brought drugs
into the hospital?!

309
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,792
Glad I wasted my time
at your hotel.

310
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,776
I told you I used,
you didn't ask me for a sample.

311
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,005
You're not pissed about this,
you're mad because
I coughed blood on you.

312
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,078
That was an accident.

313
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:54,425
Oh, would you stop being nice!
It's useless and worse, it's boring.

314
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,351
Get angry!
I had one stupid night,
I end up with HIV,

315
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,239
do you have any idea
how pissed off I was?

316
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,674
This wasn't your fault.

317
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,511
You broke into my house?

318
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:15,302
Why I had to,
Mark isn't here.

319
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,663
He has physio.

320
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,328
Oh really?
How's he doing?

321
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,309
What happened
with all the cheese?

322
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:23,865
I had to get rid of it before
Steve McQueen ate any coumadin.

323
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,245
I named your rat.

324
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,867
Steve's tilting his head.

325
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:37,581
Any neurologist will tell you
that suggests an infection
or brain stem tumour.

326
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,739
Death cures both those things.

327
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,427
Well we can't kill him.

328
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,673
If it's an infection,
it could be caused by
something in your house,

329
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,486
something that
could affect you guys.

330
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,879
Smell this.

331
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:52,991
[Sniffs]

332
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,278
- Does it smell like urine?
- Oh!

333
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:55,995
[Sniffs]

334
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,504
You missing any asparagus?

335
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:05,404
Ok, stuff these,
he doesn't get better,
then it's a tumour.

336
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,648
Then what? Chemo?

337
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,189
Steve McQueen without hair?

338
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,016
It's a blessing
he died young.

339
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,775
[Phone rings]

340
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,655
Hello.

341
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:29,058
Oh, hi honey.
I'm sorry I missed you,
yeah, I came home.

342
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:32,576
Alright, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

343
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,175
Okay, bye hun.

344
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,179
Chest hurts!
[Monitors are beeping]

345
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,499
He's a hundred and climbing,
could be an allergic reaction.

346
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,504
Neck pains are out,
must be pericardial effusion.

347
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:58,632
No wheezing.

348
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,564
Tear in his lungs
must have re-opened.

349
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,045
Kalvin, you're bleeding into
the area around your heart.

350
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,717
I'm dying?
I can't breathe!

351
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:10,298
The blood's crushing your heart,
once we remove it, you'll be fine.

352
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,372
If I die, please tell my dad...

353
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,827
You're not going to die.

354
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,955
...tell... him... sorry.

355
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,181
[Monitors are beeping]

356
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,154
Where's the blood?

357
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,348
It's clear.

358
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,946
Only one other thing
could cause this.

359
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,849
Tumour in his heart.

360
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:47,258
Wilson:
CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart
and several smaller ones in his lungs.

361
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,599
That's why his heart's
enlarged, not the AZT.

362
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,879
You ok?

363
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,873
She's fine, probably getting
bored with the question.

364
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,900
Masses in the heart and lungs,
what kind of cancer are we looking at?

365
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,181
They may not be cancerous.

366
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:00,269
This is classic
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

367
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,384
HIV positive patient
with a primary heart mass.

368
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,796
It could be sarcoidosis.

369
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,606
His lung tissue is negative.

370
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,866
Lymphoma's a death sentence,
sarcoidosis is treatable.

371
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,395
So's an ear infection,
but since he didn't test
positive for that either...

372
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,680
I wanna do the
Kveim-Siltzbach test.

373
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,147
[Splutters] Do you have any idea
how much paperwork
Cuddy is going to need signed?

374
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,244
Do it.

375
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,237
So...

376
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:34,457
how is the patient's father?

377
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:35,816
Uh...

378
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,916
Tell my dad I'm sorry?

379
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,044
Might as well wave
the red flag at a bull.

380
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:42,634
He's not coming.

381
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,488
Well it's not a tragedy,

382
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,958
dad doesn't want to see him,
he doesn't want to see the dad.

383
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:51,079
You're the only one
who wants them together.

384
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:54,148
- He asked!
- He thought he was dying.

385
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,342
Dying people lie too.

386
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,472
Wish they'd work less,
they'd been nicer, they'd
opened orphanages for kittens.

387
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:06,259
If you really want to do something,
you do it, you don't save it for sound byte.

388
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,852
What did you say when
you thought you were dying?

389
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,179
On the other hand,

390
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,402
his dad tossed him out.

391
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,475
So what's our guy
want to apologise for?

392
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,561
Everybody has regrets.

393
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,949
Cameron:
The growths in your lungs
and heart are sarcoid,

394
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,376
your body will
recognise this material

395
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,088
and we'll see
a reaction on your arm.

396
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,651
Did you really
want to see your dad?

397
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,378
Did you call him?

398
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,596
Thanks.

399
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,648
He would have come,
try to straighten me out.

400
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,694
How are you holding up?

401
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,545
- I'm fine.
- Convincing.

402
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,726
What did you do with my drugs?

403
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:06,187
The lab disposes of them
after analysis.

404
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,651
Too bad.

405
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,006
They could have
done you some good.

406
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,102
Not really my thing.

407
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,502
You know I hope
you don't have it, but...

408
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:23,114
getting HIV
might have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

409
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,288
I used to be a good boy.

410
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,335
Never wanted to
piss anybody off...

411
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:35,730
playing by the rules
makes everybody else happy.

412
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,926
Now I'm happy.

413
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,664
So you just show up
every time he's at physio?

414
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:52,584
Off course not!
Also when he's at group therapy,
or out for dinner with friends.

415
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:56,524
And when she happens
to mention to Mark
that you dropped by...?

416
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,585
You tell your wife everything?

417
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,259
It's a... process. [Sighs]

418
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:08,280
But Stacy doesn't have
any reason to hide this from Mark.

419
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,368
As far as she knows,
Mark's okay with you being there.

420
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,029
My bet is she mentions me
to Mark as little as possible,

421
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,611
'cause she thinks that he thinks
that she still has feelings for me.

422
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:19,624
And you know
why she thinks that?

423
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,836
Because she still has
feelings for you? [Elevator dings]

424
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,523
If you're right, she did tell him,
and I don't get through the door tonight.

425
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,454
But if I'm right...

426
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,294
So how long
do we stay here?

427
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,398
'Til something happens.

428
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,112
He's not going to come out
with us right here.

429
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:53,078
We are downwind, and
he seems to have hearing loss.

430
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:55,302
He's not blind.

431
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:58,818
Steve McQueen
does not run from danger.

432
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:04,209
Antibiotics on the other hand...

433
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:08,289
He ate around the pill? Smart!

434
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:11,256
Admit it, you like him.

435
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:14,603
He's alright...for a rat.

436
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,750
You wanna know
how cool he is?

437
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:23,826
His urine showed
traces of hydrogen cyanide,
formaldehyde, lead.

438
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,477
He's a smoker.

439
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,580
Your husband's been lighting up...

440
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:34,557
which is particularly stupid,
it could cause his AIP to...

441
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,743
Okay, I blow my smoke
into the vents
so Mark doesn't know.

442
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,617
I always knew it.

443
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:42,999
Bluffing!

444
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,772
You started
two weeks after my surgery.

445
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,366
Menthols, then
lights after a month.

446
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,214
Why didn't you say anything?

447
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:55,145
'Cause it helped me
monitor your misery level.

448
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:01,831
One trip outside was a good day,
upwards of six you were in hell.

449
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,045
You could have
asked me how I was!

450
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,251
I already knew.

451
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,385
Sorry you were miserable.

452
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,496
Sorry I caused you
so much pain.

453
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,916
[Clangs]

454
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:32,704
[Squeaking]

455
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:35,025
Aha.

456
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:40,751
[Music from inside the room]
[Knocks on the door]

457
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,984
Glad you changed your mind
about that drink.

458
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,448
Come on in.

459
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,440
You should get changed,
there's this new place
on campus that...

460
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:00,822
- Are you high?
- Uh huh.

461
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:06,024
I thought
you disposed of the drugs.

462
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,780
Not all of it.

463
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,574
Uhh, slow down...

464
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,092
Your pupils are dilated!

465
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:19,503
Come on Chase,
don't turn into a
good guy on me now.

466
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:56,738
You're late.
And hungover.

467
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,262
Or maybe not.

468
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,980
Why do you have a rat?

469
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:06,460
Jealous?
[Elevator dings]

470
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:13,941
Kalvin:
[Shouting] Out of my room!
Don't you dare put this on me!

471
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,100
Kalvin:
I'm not going to grovel, dad!

472
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,721
That's not what I'm asking for.

473
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,356
Like hell it isn't!
You said you didn't call!

474
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,046
Don't mind me.
Just here for the show.

475
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,721
Yeah well, there's
not going to be any.

476
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:32,378
What happened to the big apology?
Yesterday he was all
"daddy, I'm so sowwy".

477
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,650
This is none of your business.

478
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,193
You should have thought of that
before you stalked me.

479
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,670
Now I'm interested.

480
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:40,751
So what's he got to apologise for?
You're the one who tossed him out.

481
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:41,904
Now why would I do that?

482
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,800
I don't know.
'Cause it's tough to brag
to your hunting buddies

483
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,654
that your son knows
all the words of the whiz.

484
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:47,418
That's a lie!

485
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:49,287
- 42nd Street?
- Oh, tchick!

486
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:53,105
Much easier to just
get drunk and beat him.
Explains his hating you.

487
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:54,922
Also your cirrhosis.

488
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,589
Also why the more I talk,
the more you sweat.

489
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,259
What it doesn't explain, is
why he's gotta apologise to you.

490
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,029
Residual guilt for
sharing your special toy
with other boys?

491
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,152
Just leave it alone.

492
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:12,528
Just want to leave the bigot
with some peace of mind
after you're gone?

493
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:16,358
Look, this has got nothing,
and I mean nothing
to do with him being gay!

494
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,996
Now Kal brought this on himself,
with what he did to his mother!

495
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,706
He steal her signature look?

496
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,365
No, no. He killed her.

497
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,810
Kalvin lied!

498
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah, that certainly is shocking.

499
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:40,856
Mom's kidneys were failing,
she needed a transplant,
they tested Kalvin, he was a match.

500
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:45,781
He was also positive for HIV,
mom never found a qualified donor,
she dies.

501
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,909
Tragic tale.

502
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:52,790
Undercut slightly
by the rapid fire delivery
and constant movement.

503
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,502
Too much coffee
this morning?

504
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,768
He didn't kill her.
Our bodies aren't donor farms
for our parents.

505
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:01,123
It's not 1980. We know
how HIV is transmitted!

506
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:05,293
If Kalvin got HIV
through unprotected sex,
dad has every right to be pissed!

507
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:06,796
So you always use a condom?

508
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,151
Uhh... yeah!

509
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,071
Brother's
on the down-low, got to.

510
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,216
Huh, not ready for any
Foreman Juniors yet.

511
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:12,843
You?

512
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,091
Working girls are sticklers.

513
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,360
You're not going to pull Chase?

514
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,229
I'm not an idiot.

515
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,108
Obviously not.

516
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:27,621
Who doesn't sleep with
a drugged out colleague
when they have a chance?

517
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,718
Where's Wilson?

518
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,448
We got the result
for the Kveim test.

519
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,070
[Sighs]

520
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:49,483
So... I have cancer?

521
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:53,034
In all likelihood, yeah.

522
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,900
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.

523
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:01,815
And I am... dying?

524
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:09,818
We need to biopsy the tumour.
It's near your aorta so...

525
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,315
getting that sample
carries serious risks.

526
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:14,364
Is my dad still here?

527
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,503
He hasn't been in?

528
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:26,230
We'll inject a dye around your heart
to make the tumour visible on the CT,

529
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:30,389
then a surgeon
inserts a guide wire,
runs it up into your heart

530
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,956
where he takes a small piece of
that tumour so we can look at it
under the microscope.

531
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,505
Chase: Ativan
will help settle you down.

532
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,324
Why are you so calm?

533
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,581
Not coming off meth helps.

534
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:48,448
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

535
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,508
Do you think I want it to?

536
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,187
When two people have had sex,
unless it sucks,

537
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:56,893
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

538
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:59,542
And that's when
things get complicated.

539
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,048
And it didn't suck.

540
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:11,964
So now you've got to drum up
another excuse to be
around the love of your life.

541
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,318
Could hit another patient.

542
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,743
Nyah, don't like to repeat myself.
People will say I'm formulaic.

543
00:32:17,827 --> 00:32:20,301
Well that rules out
letting the rat go so
you can catch him again.

544
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:21,463
I can't do that.

545
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:24,330
Steve needs
two weeks antibiotics and
a smoke-free environment.

546
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,536
Cigarettes
aggravated his infection.

547
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,655
The rat is actually sick?

548
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,325
That thing could
infect the entire hospital!

549
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,493
Steve's infection is
not contagious to humans.

550
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,155
I'm an idiot.
How did I miss micoplasmosis?
Was that the kid's father?

551
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,344
Yeah.
Remember the black death?
Started with rats.

552
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,811
What's he doing in the hallway?
His kid getting his biopsy already?

553
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:43,958
He just won't go in the room.

554
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:46,824
Who knows what else he has?
Parasites? Bacterial infection?

555
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,898
- Kid doesn't have parasites.
- Not the kid, the rat!

556
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:51,947
Was he still sweating?

557
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:54,311
Rats only sweat
through their tails.

558
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:56,270
Not the rat, the dad!

559
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,996
Where are they from?

560
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:02,573
Err...Montana.
What's going on?

561
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,276
You were right,
it's a parasite.

562
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:06,760
Cancel the biopsy.
It'll kill him.

563
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,931
[Bangs]

564
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,785
Hey daddy, come with me!

565
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,389
Yeah, uhh...
I'm not going in there.

566
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,152
[Sighs]

567
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,671
Your son asked to talk to you.

568
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:23,632
Why is he here?

569
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,514
He wanted to talk to you.

570
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:28,666
Aha.

571
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,143
Did you two use to
hunt together?

572
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:33,274
Foxes. Did you kill foxes?

573
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:34,973
It's Montana.

574
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:38,808
Those masses in your chest
are not tumours.

575
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,421
They're parasitic cysts
from a bug called equinococosis.

576
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:46,116
Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard,
they can hunker down for decades

577
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,264
- growing, spawning,
shopping, putting on plays.

578
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,860
I've been tested
for parasites.

579
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:55,005
Okay, it's cancer.
You happy?

580
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:57,589
The cysts isolate the parasites,

581
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:00,768
keeping them from showing up
in stool samples,
even in blood tests, cardiac...

582
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,542
All right,
you don't need me for this.

583
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,666
But you've got
the same things in your liver.

584
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,905
I have cirrhosis.

585
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,122
Liver cysts have
identical symptoms
with one addition, fever.

586
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,134
Now liver cysts
we can test for.

587
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,260
Your diagnosis
could confirm Kalvin's.

588
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:20,939
So, option A,
we draw some blood...

589
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,792
No, look,
you're not touching me.

590
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,461
You see, this is
why I need you here.

591
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:30,149
I want you to tell your son that
you won't take a simple painless
blood test to save his life.

592
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:51,100
You err... never expressed
a shred of regret for
what happened to your mother.

593
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,189
Geez dad...

594
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,838
Dad:
If you'd've worn a damn rubber,
you'd've been fine.

595
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:59,021
Dad:
Could have saved her life.
You wouldn't be lying here!

596
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,257
House:
Yeah yeah yeah, I get it!

597
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:05,791
You're really mad at him
for killing himself and
for destroying everything you love.

598
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,353
I don't have time for this,
are you going to apologise?

599
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:10,413
I'm living my life
the way I want.

600
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,765
Are you going to
give me some blood?

601
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,368
Look,
if he doesn't give a damn
then neither do I!

602
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,510
Okay. Option B.

603
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,215
Why did your wife kill herself?
Did she hate you?

604
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:21,154
She was a diabetic!

605
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:23,351
You know, you don't know
a thing about my Suzanne.

606
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:27,386
Either Suzanne wanted to die,
or she was both fat AND stupid.

607
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,016
Used a twinkie instead of a gun.

608
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,164
And girls with big appetites, well
they just can't get enough of anything!

609
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:32,669
Shut up!

610
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,679
Probably nibbled on
every devil dog in the county!

611
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:35,305
SHUT UP!

612
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:38,004
Just in case I'm not
making myself clear,
I don't mean the delicious snack...

613
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:40,303
You son of a bitch!

614
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,793
Yeah? Come on!

615
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,974
Thank you,
means I can do this.

616
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,594
We're going to need
some epi in here, stat!

617
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:52,024
Are you out of your mind?!

618
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,337
You said you didn't care.

619
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,286
[Choking]

620
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,306
Notice how you can't breathe?

621
00:35:57,844 --> 00:35:59,185
Now either that's the cane,

622
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,047
or I just ruptured one of those
liver cysts we were chatting about

623
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,733
and you've gone into
anaphylactic shock,

624
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:07,771
exactly the same as your son did
when he accidentally tripped
against my friend's car.

625
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,061
I'm just SO excited
to find out which!

626
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:16,464
[Choking and wheezing]

627
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,121
I'm gonna schedule surgery.

628
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,664
Nurse: Clamp.

629
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,356
Surgeon:
Pressure's holding.

630
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,973
Two successful surgeries,
two lives saved.

631
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,356
I'm over my quota.
Can I have next week off?

632
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,629
Two family members assaulted.

633
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,433
- It was self defence.
- You baited him.

634
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,625
You're right.
I was asking for it.

635
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,547
The low-cut blouse,
the 'Do-Me' pumps.

636
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:31,871
You flooded his gut
with a parasite, he could sue.

637
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,476
Go see Stacy.

638
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,178
Okay.

639
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:44,996
That's it? Okay?
No name-calling? No squawking?
No rending of garments?

640
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:47,286
I like this T-shirt.

641
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:54,076
You lied to me.

642
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:56,711
If this is about my mom...

643
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,359
This is about your
lonely, miserable life.

644
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,275
I'm not miserable.

645
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:05,592
And as long as
there's a gay bar around,
I'm never lonely.

646
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,547
You haven't had a single visitor
except for your dad.

647
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,831
Drugs are great,
HIV freed you,

648
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,337
your dad hates you,
you're so happy.

649
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:14,878
Everything's a lie!

650
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,272
You blame yourself
for your mom's death,

651
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:20,017
you're not trying to have fun,
you're trying to self-destruct.

652
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:23,585
You wanna kill yourself?
Fine, but stop recruiting!

653
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,926
Heard you hit another patient.

654
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:38,684
Yeah, sure. Why not?

655
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:40,807
He hit me first.

656
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:43,959
Cuddy didn't mention that.
Let me see.

657
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:49,100
I'm the doctor.

658
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,285
My concern is purely legal.

659
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,763
Looks okay, does it hurt?

660
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,103
A little.

661
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,155
You need some ice.

662
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,492
There's no way that
Mark doesn't know...

663
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:11,231
about the smoking.

664
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,698
He would have
said something.

665
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:19,323
Then he hasn't been
near you in months.

666
00:39:21,499 --> 00:39:23,294
We're fine.

667
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:27,692
Can't be easy.

668
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:29,434
Stop squirming.

669
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,364
Why would you
lie about this?

670
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:41,072
I'm not lying.

671
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,522
I don't care if you're
sleeping with him or not,
but you're not, so...

672
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:46,618
I am.

673
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:48,424
You're lying.

674
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:52,964
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me too?

675
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:57,767
The only people who know
about what's going on between
me and Mark, are me and Mark.

676
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,708
I just know you.

677
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,817
And I know you.

678
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:13,179
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain unless
there's a reason to be certain.

679
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:17,011
One other person knew,
I told you I was seeing Dr. Harper.

680
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:20,996
You can easily get into her office,
you read my file.

681
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,082
You read my file?

682
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:38,489
The dishes,
the concern, the oh...

683
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:40,651
acting like a human being?

684
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,136
You have...

685
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:47,485
This whole time
you've been manipulating me?

686
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:52,759
You knew that
I had an angle the moment
I poured soap on to a scrub brush.

687
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:55,724
You could have
thrown me out,

688
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,106
or ignored me, or
found another exterminator.

689
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,348
You didn't even tell Mark
that I kept coming by.

690
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:03,282
You LET this happen
because you wanna be with me.

691
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,461
I don't know anymore.

692
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:12,090
Get out.

694
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:42,268
I'm sorry.

# Yesterday I got lost in the circus #

696
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:56,196
# Feeling like such a mess #

697
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:06,090
# And now I'm down
I'm just hanging on the corner #

698
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:11,618
# I can't help but reminisce #

699
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:21,315
# I know we all
We all got our faults #

700
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:27,600
# We get locked in our vaults,
and we stay.. #

701
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:33,017
# When you're gone #

702
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:40,389
# All the colours fade
When you're gone #

703
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:48,459
# No new years day parade
You're gone #

704
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:54,786
# Colours seem to fade #

705
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:04,005
