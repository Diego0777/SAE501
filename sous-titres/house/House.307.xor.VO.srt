1
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:35,875
What are you doing down here? I thought
you usually had lunch with Coma Guy.

2
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:38,469
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

3
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:43,513
Tell him about those Sherpas you dropped
acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

4
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,012
You stole my prescription pad,
and you forged my name.

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,080
What did you tell the cop?

6
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,481
I lied. They'd have
put you away for ten years.

7
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,848
After they took your
license to practice medicine.

8
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,995
- So everything's good, then.
- I lied to the cops.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,711
There is no case unless they can prove
that either I got the drugs illegally

10
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:03,889
or I sold them illegally.

11
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,300
I didn't do the second.
You lied about the first. Game over.

12
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,803
Yeah. Tritter's just playing.

13
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:10,669
He's gonna see how clever
you are and then just walk away.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,654
The important thing is that
you keep prescribing

15
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,085
the same amount of drugs to me,
or it'll look suspicious.

16
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:18,398
Here's another way to look at it.
Having forced me to lie to the police,

17
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:21,469
your first concern is
securing your drug connection.

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,860
Joining my father for lunch?

19
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,459
I should've called ahead for a table.

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,769
- Dr. House was just--
- Enjoying a Reuben.

21
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:35,769
It's okay.

22
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:39,802
After ten years, anything that'll
get doctors in the same room as--

23
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:42,657
What are you doing?

24
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:44,236
Nothing. What are you doing?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,950
Chips?

26
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,139
Wanna see something really cool?

27
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:03,102
I saw you leaving last Tuesday.

28
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:06,669
Practically tripped over
two guys on your way out,

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,570
but you had no problem opening doors.

30
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,133
It's called akinetopsia.

31
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,685
You can't see things when they move.

32
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,299
And since you haven't been hit by a bus,
I assume that it's intermittent.

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,827
It's probably accompanied by seizures,

34
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:20,978
which made me think that I
could set one off by flashing the--

35
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,420
God, I love this family!

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26

37
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:08,078
I can see fine now.

38
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,517
I've had seizures before.

39
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,544
Most of the time, they're small.

40
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,508
Doctors ran me through all the tests.

41
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,933
Couldn't find anything.

42
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,406
Any history of epilepsy in your family?

43
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,692
The only things I know
that run in my family are

44
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,877
a lot of chutzpah and the
ability to sleep for ten years.

45
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,378
Although I'm not really an expert.

46
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,557
Dad never really liked
my mother's side of the family,

47
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,495
and after she died and he came here,

48
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,524
I was raised by a guardian.

49
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:36,802
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with him.

50
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,565
How 'bout your father's
side of the family?

51
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,985
Any relatives we could speak with?

52
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,936
My father was an only child.
And my grandparents are dead.

53
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:47,104
Who did you put down as the person the
hospital should contact in an emergency?

54
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,303
I left it blank.

55
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,159
There's gotta be someone. A friend?

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,710
Oh, plenty of friends. Just...

57
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,058
no one that would care if I was here.

58
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,817
Say, do you mind passing me my backpack?

59
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:14,999
Hair of the dog.

60
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,145
- Could be infection.
- Or a brain tumor.

61
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:22,262
Says he had a CT.

62
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,054
What's wrong with
the simplest explanation?

63
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,733
Trauma.

64
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,134
He didn't report any injuries.

65
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,109
He didn't report being
an alcoholic, either.

66
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,710
Drinking equals falling down,
equals trauma, equals--

67
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,811
Maybe it's inherited.

68
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,264
How would you jump
to genetics from his EEG?

69
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:38,349
All you've got are some
vaguely epileptiform waves.

70
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,804
It's not his EEG.

71
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:41,458
It's his father's.

72
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:44,803
When it comes to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

73
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,914
Small seizures aren't unheard
of in a patient in a vegetative state.

74
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,642
Similarities are interesting, though.

75
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:51,240
What caused the vegetative state?

76
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,391
His house burned down.

77
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,752
Went back in to get his wife.

78
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,535
Firefighters found him unconscious three
feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.

79
00:04:58,536 --> 00:04:59,936
Not an inherited condition.

80
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:01,358
Test his DNA.

81
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,024
Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.

82
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:05,769
Check out the home.

83
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,840
- He has a single bed.
- They still make single beds?

84
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,802
Could mean he just doesn't have sex--

85
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,003
though there were
condoms in the apartment.

86
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,185
House asked you to check
out the home for toxins.

87
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,283
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

88
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:29,206
MRI and LP are both inconclusive.
Infection's still possible.

89
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,881
- Tumor's less likely, but--
- DNA?

90
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,932
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.

91
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:36,743
DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

92
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:39,270
Genetic tests take forever.
You can't just keep testing

93
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,359
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

94
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:44,110
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,130
You said no one's been sick, but
what about delivery people, repair guy?

96
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,102
I wouldn't know.

97
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:54,732
I work from home.

98
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,030
Haven't been to the
office in over a month.

99
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,932
- Visitors?
- Haven't had any.

100
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,069
The only person I've seen in the
last week was the pizza delivery guy.

101
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,633
And he looked pretty healthy.

102
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,633
There's gotta be
someone you're close to.

103
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:09,379
Actually,

104
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,129
the person I see
most often is my father.

105
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,707
He's asleep, so he can't stop me.

106
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:21,799
What is it?

107
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,675
Just feeling a little nauseous. I--

108
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,267
I think his liver's failing.

109
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,738
Oh, God. Does--does that mean that I'm--

110
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:41,575
I need a central line kit. Two units of
packed red blood cells, type O negative.

111
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:47,163
He's unconscious and heading for a coma.
He's at a four on the RLAS scale.

112
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,741
Stop all treatment.

113
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,103
You think this is
a reaction to our meds?

114
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,196
Well, they're obviously not helping.

115
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:58,592
Given the fact that he's an alcoholic,
there's a good chance his liver wasn't

116
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,513
so hot when he came in.

117
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,953
Anti-seizure drugs could
have just pushed him over the edge.

118
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,504
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

119
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:05,812
I was hoping you'd know.

120
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,607
May be academic,
but I just started him on dialysis.

121
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,540
Kidney and liver failure.

122
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,037
Not too many people come back from that.

123
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,318
Trauma's out of the picture.
It could still be infection.

124
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,919
- Or neurological.
- Or genetic.

125
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,967
We need a better history.

126
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:24,854
Did you miss the part where
the patient lost consciousness?

127
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,580
L-dopa?

128
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,476
You're not waking Kyle.

129
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,139
You're waking his father.

130
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,990
I commend your observational skills.

131
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,602
You have no reason to think any amount
of drugs will wake a man from a coma.

132
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:40,634
Vegetative state. Much easier.
This guy's no Terry Schiavo.

133
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:44,170
His brain's all there. He moves around.
His muscles have barely atrophied.

134
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,921
Just waiting for a fairytale kiss.

135
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:48,762
After I do that, stick a needle in him.

136
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,122
The amount of amphetamines
alone would be dangerous,

137
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,582
besides whatever the
hell else you've got in there.

138
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,483
There are reports out of South Africa

139
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:02,551
about a pill that would temporarily
revive someone in a vegetative state.

140
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:06,494
We've all seen Awakenings.
Made me cry. I wanna cry.

141
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:08,862
Put the syringe down.

142
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,265
I can out-draw you, mysterious stranger.

143
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,482
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

144
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:18,024
Be reasonable.
There's no way this is gonna work.

145
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,719
Even if you woke him,
it would only be for a few hours.

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,841
A day, two at the most.
You're risking his life.

147
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,951
I'm risking getting sued.
That's the only objection here.

148
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,200
You'll be torturing him. And his family.

149
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:33,203
Good news for legal. The only
family he's got is upstairs dying.

150
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,213
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

151
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:48,388
I want someone with him at all
times to make sure you didn't kill him.

152
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,580
I want your ass in my office--

153
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:54,971
God. I'm starving.

154
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,643
I could really go for a steak.

155
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:06,134
Do you know your name?

156
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,056
You know where you are?

157
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,929
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name of this hospital.

158
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,656
How much are three and five?

159
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,019
Eight.

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,225
Also known as 1/2 of 16,
1/4 of 32, two to the third power.

161
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,967
Coolest thing ever.
Any history of seizure in your family?

162
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:26,543
No.

163
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,834
- Liver disease?
- No.

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,070
How long have I been here?

165
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,012
I got the feeling it's,
um, been a long time.

166
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,629
Interesting.
If your internal clock kept ticking,

167
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,449
how deep does that awareness go?

168
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,364
Pick up scraps of conversations?
You have the vague sense

169
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,010
that the hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

170
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,811
Or that the new Star Wars
movies were a disappointment?

171
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:52,917
I know my wife is dead.

172
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,437
I don't know how long it's been.

173
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:04,415
Ten years.

174
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,009
What's the last thing you remember?

175
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,472
The fire.

176
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:19,687
My wife was in the bedroom.
She had taken a sleeping pill. I got...

177
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,350
Kyle out.

178
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:22,644
Went back in for her.

179
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,967
I knew I didn't make it.

180
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:27,788
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:32,108
What about your wife's side of the
family? Any history of seizures there?

182
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,725
Your son Kyle is a patient here.

183
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,159
I'm afraid his condition is serious.

184
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,684
He may be dying.

185
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,146
No seizure issues on
my wife's side, either.

186
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:47,737
What about that steak?

187
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,708
Nobody ever answered me.

188
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:58,407
Rumor in the cafeteria was
Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.

189
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,590
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy was woken by...

190
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,304
- yeah, Caustic Guy.
- So what happened?

191
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,455
Gotta get him a steak before
I can ask him any more questions.

192
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,182
He doesn't want to talk about his son?

193
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,083
Didn't seem to emotionally
register that his son is sick.

194
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,759
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated,
spent ten years as asparagus.

195
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,262
Who knows what damage is in there?

196
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,413
It's possible. 'Course,
there's always the simple explanation.

197
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,238
Maybe he just doesn't like his son.

198
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,918
Only in your world would that be simple.

199
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:25,876
The delusion

200
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:29,324
that fathering a child installs a
permanent geyser of unconditional love--

201
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,844
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional. Not everyone's--

202
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:34,818
Yes, well, of course, that would play
into your romantic vision of human--

203
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,738
In terms you would understand,
we have an evolutionary incentive

204
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,906
to sacrifice for our offspring.
Our tribe, our friends.

205
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,399
Keep them safe.

206
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,789
Except for all the people who don't.

207
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,856
Everything is conditional.

208
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,506
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

209
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:03,908
Mind if we talk for a few minutes?

210
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:08,783
How many pills would you say Dr.
House takes a day?

211
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,078
I'm uncomfortable setting a number.

212
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:14,362
Try.

213
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,195
Six.

214
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:18,874
A day.

215
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,025
Has he ever had you...

216
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,533
write prescriptions for him?

217
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,947
No. What is it you want me to say?

218
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,729
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital?

219
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,680
Or he takes too few because
he's selling them on the side?

220
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,317
Either one is ridiculous.

221
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,339
I meant the former.

222
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,159
You're wrong.

223
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:42,470
Can I ask what Dr.
House has done to deserve your loyalty?

224
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,335
He's not known as a great boss.
He's not even much of a friend.

225
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,070
I mean, look how he left Dr.
Wilson holding the bag.

226
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,460
It's odd.

227
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:56,676
You don't know about that.

228
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:58,533
You defend him, and

229
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,018
he won't even tell you

230
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,281
what's happening in his life.

231
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,856
I was paged.

232
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,601
Saw you with a cop.

233
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,377
- What'd he want?
- How many pills does House take,

234
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,228
did I ever write him a prescription,
that sort of stuff.

235
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,392
- I told him six.
- A day, or in a mouthful?

236
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,680
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with--

237
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,879
- He wants to talk to us, too?
- You're next.

238
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:34,060
We've gotta tell House what's going on.

239
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,811
- Tritter says no.
- Then no it is.

240
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:38,937
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

241
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,109
Quick, what's the kid's status?

242
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,390
I gotta get back to our sleeper before
he goes looking for the orgasmatron.

243
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,066
See, if that were rhetorical,
it would mean that I could just

244
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:54,146
turn around and leave now. Which I'm
not doing. From which you should deduce.

245
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,297
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

246
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:58,575
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

247
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,076
He's still sliding into coma.

248
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:14,511
Your barber sucks.

249
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,626
Coma diet. I could make a fortune.

250
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,154
Vegetative state diet.

251
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:24,876
- Who gave you your clothes?
- Dr. Cuddy.

252
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,090
I guess I'll need all new ones anyway.
Everything went in the fire.

253
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,606
Ah, don't worry about it.

254
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:33,817
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

255
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,847
Your son's measles vaccination.

256
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,981
Do you remember if he
had it and what type it was?

257
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:41,182
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

258
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,065
You weren't gonna tell me, were you?

259
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,086
I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy
says my body will adjust to the drugs.

260
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,520
That I'll be a vegetable again
by tomorrow. If I'm really lucky,

261
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:53,628
the day after.

262
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:56,316
Yeah.

263
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:57,906
If I got a day to live,

264
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm not gonna spend it
in a hospital room being grilled.

265
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,567
Come on, where you gonna go?

266
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,104
Your house burned down.
Your wife's dead.

267
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,323
Business was sold off.

268
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,235
The only thing you have left

269
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,788
is down the hall heading
for a liver biopsy.

270
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,949
Used to be this little,
um, hole in the wall.

271
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,769
Run by a guy named Giancarlo.

272
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,057
Made the best hoagies in the world.

273
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:23,265
Real Italian rolls.
Prosciutto. Provolone.

274
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,265
How far is Atlantic City from here?

275
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,813
You have one day to live.
And you want a sandwich.

276
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,969
People on Death Row get a last meal.

277
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,147
State provides it.

278
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,375
Who's providing for you?

279
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,350
You got a car? Money?

280
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,869
You're negotiating with me.

281
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,933
Take out another hundred for me.

282
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,875
And I need your car.

283
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,110
- I'm not doing you any favors.
- You'll get it back tomorrow.

284
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,353
Two days, max. Road trip.

285
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:09,025
This is like trying to control
the weather, but I'd prefer it

286
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:11,726
if you didn't eat in the car.
I just had it detailed.

287
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,938
- I drive.
- Oh, the hell he does.

288
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,039
Sure.

289
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,887
Aside from the fact he just
woke up from a vegetative state,

290
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,158
the guy doesn't have a license.

291
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,391
How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie.

292
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,088
You know how to do that.

293
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,380
Chips.

294
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,356
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

295
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,029
Right now, his reflexes are
better than Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s.

296
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,980
Hey, what's this?

297
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,519
It says, "Ipp-odd."

298
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,682
I'm coming.

299
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,151
So let's talk about toxic exposure.

300
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,516
What was wrong with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

301
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,783
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

302
00:16:58,788 --> 00:16:59,777
Raspberry cocaine.

303
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,831
This house that burned down.
Where was it?

304
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,361
Moorestown, New Jersey.

305
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:08,416
Listen, I really need to know about the
candy because I'm allergic to berries.

306
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,447
You didn't mention that.

307
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:11,208
- Is it significant?
- No.

308
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,301
So where else did you live?
List everywhere, including vacations.

309
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,181
Start with when your wife got pregnant.

310
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:20,432
We lived in Jersey. Then we
moved to Jersey. From there, Jersey.

311
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,846
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage in the Amazon

312
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,245
with the mosquitoes and
the lead paint all over the walls?

313
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,196
Yes.

314
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,131
You know what?
I didn't let you come along

315
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,982
so you could suck all the
fun out of my one day of life.

316
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,477
Well, you're outta luck,
'cause that's totally why I'm here.

317
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,601
Okay.

318
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,850
Rule change.

319
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,434
Person with the money makes the rules.
Or in this case,

320
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:47,888
the person who's friends with the
person with the money makes the rules.

321
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:50,239
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

322
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:52,264
All right, so here's the game.

323
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,746
Ask whatever you want.
But for every question I answer,

324
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:57,748
you have to answer one first.

325
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,384
And why would you care
about anything I have to say?

326
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,367
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

327
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:07,392
I had a factory with over 200 employees.

328
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,239
People listened when I talked.

329
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,900
I liked power.

330
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,830
Now the only power I have left

331
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,340
is the power to annoy you.

332
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,416
Took Wilson's assistant for coffee.

333
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,494
- Why?
- Something Tritter said.

334
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:32,158
She told me the police think that House

335
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,809
stole Wilson's prescription
pad and forged his name.

336
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:37,579
You... believe it?

337
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,179
Do you?

338
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,035
Oh, absolutely. I do.
I'm just checking how naive you are.

339
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,682
He's not gonna steal his best
friend's pad, jeopardize his career.

340
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,583
Until his best friend says no to him.

341
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,976
House is a junkie. Junkies do whatever
they have to do to get what they need.

342
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,709
Kyle's down to a
three on the RLAS scale.

343
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,764
He's only showing localized response.

344
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:03,573
I'll call House. Tell him
we're gonna need an answer soon.

345
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,949
Get in your right lane for 295.

346
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:10,618
And pass me the Twizzlers.

347
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:16,602
- I'm curious.
- No, you're not.

348
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,313
Why would a man's first instinct

349
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,593
be to drive away from
the only family he's got?

350
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,492
No! This is no time
for you to do your thing.

351
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,399
We don't care about his state of mind.

352
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,566
We don't care if he's happy. This
factory of yours. What did you make?

353
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:33,908
So ask me a question.

354
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,957
I'm thinking.

355
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,804
Only six left, by the way.

356
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:40,663
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor. You need a pen.

357
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:41,914
What is up with you two?

358
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,890
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me out of the big house.

359
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:48,132
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, who's he gonna tell?

360
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,505
By tomorrow night, he's gonna
be a mindless stalk of celery.

361
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,349
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

362
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,188
What did you make in your factory?

363
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,139
Luxury boats.

364
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,420
Have you ever been in love?

365
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:04,656
Going right for the closets with
the embarrassing stuff. Good move. Yes.

366
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:06,207
Describe the boats.

367
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:09,999
35- to 65-foot hulls. Twin engines,
parquet floors in the galleys,

368
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,718
staterooms with queen beds.

369
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,060
How'd you meet?

370
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,483
She shot me.

371
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:19,292
These boats. I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?

372
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,253
Naturally.

373
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:21,204
Shot you?

374
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,795
Paintball.

375
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,325
Doctors versus lawyers.

376
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,532
You ever take your son to the factory?

377
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,933
Sure. He used to run all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

378
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:32,849
Ever love anybody else?

379
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,338
No more questions. I got my answer.

380
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,330
While Dad's in the office,
son's watching them spray-paint.

381
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,152
And what kid wears a mask?

382
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,306
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

383
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:46,647
Are you saying this was my fault?

384
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,698
Mercury poisoning explains the seizures.

385
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,999
The liver is like a big soup strainer.
Soup runs through.

386
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,974
Chicken dumplings stay. For soup,
read blood. For chicken dumplings--

387
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,726
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

388
00:20:56,968 --> 00:21:00,818
Sits more or less idle until your kid
pours tequila shooters into his liver.

389
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:05,018
When the liver goes, takes
out the kidneys. Explains everything.

390
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,295
Yeah, it's me.

391
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,818
Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.

392
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:12,841
Chase. Start heavy metal chelation
while we're waiting for results.

393
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,566
Chase isn't here. I'll start the--

394
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:16,765
Where is he?

395
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:19,861
The lab.

396
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,307
How many pills does he take a day?

397
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,372
It's hard to say.
Pain levels vary over time.

398
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,731
Could be six, eight, ten.

399
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:36,352
Ever write any prescriptions for him?

400
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:37,540
- Yes.
- Why?

401
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,058
Did he tell you to?

402
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:41,152
He asked me to.

403
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:49,839
Medicine...

404
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:54,471
attracts people who
are attracted to power.

405
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:59,182
I know how he hates when
he is defied by a patient.

406
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:03,624
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

407
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,810
Now, you correct me if I'm wrong.

408
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:09,557
But I don't think Dr.
House asks for anything.

409
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,389
I think he takes it.

410
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:17,158
And I think that you
are stuck lying to the police

411
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,119
to cover up something...

412
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:22,492
you didn't want to do.

413
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,706
We have been up and down St.
James like a Monopoly car.

414
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:34,919
It's not here.

415
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,026
Giancarlo has left the building.

416
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:43,775
We could still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

417
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,019
No! We've come this far.
I'm getting the hoagie.

418
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,476
If your son does have mercury poisoning,

419
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,631
there's a good chance
he'll respond to the chelation.

420
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:56,111
You might be able to have a
few min with him before you lapse.

421
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:57,846
Why are you so concerned about me?

422
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,027
Deep inside,
Wilson believes that if he cares enough,

423
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,600
he'll never have to die.

424
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,253
Your behavior isn't normal.

425
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,563
And you would know normal.

426
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:11,822
What could he have done that
you won't forgive after ten years,

427
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,480
when this is your last chance?

428
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:17,010
My son is what he is.

429
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,410
His mother's side?

430
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:19,809
All drunken losers.

431
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:22,755
He's gone the same way.

432
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,520
House told you that drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

433
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:28,791
I just said that.

434
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:32,429
But you didn't hear him say
that till after we left the hospital.

435
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,001
So why did you leave?

436
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,413
Maybe your son takes after your side.

437
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,310
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

438
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,757
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

439
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,623
We're in Atlantic City,
and my time's not up yet.

440
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,022
We'll find a hotel with a casino.

441
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:57,967
BP's starting to drop.

442
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:00,218
O2-sat's down to 70.

443
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,826
0.3 milligrams of epi in.

444
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,801
What are you trying to do?
Make him bleed faster?

445
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:09,668
Check the pulse.

446
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:12,111
It's not his liver.

447
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,044
It's the heart.

448
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,990
I understand he's a French chef,
but I'm sure he can handle this.

449
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,135
We need a 12-inch Italian roll,
oregano vinegar--

450
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:26,383
No. Not balsamic vinegar.
Oregano vinegar.

451
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,568
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

452
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:31,358
Game's still on.

453
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,911
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

454
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,101
What other questions
would you care about?

455
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,621
If you each had one day to live,
you'd look for one last meal,

456
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,722
and House would look
for one last answer.

457
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,811
No, can you just send the ingredients
up here? And I'll make it myself.

458
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,247
Last ten years.

459
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:51,796
- How much awareness did you have?
- I don't know.

460
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,631
I knew it wasn't the next day.

461
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,169
I knew that--

462
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,916
I recognized your voice.

463
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,799
How often were you in my room?

464
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,919
No. You're wasting a question.

465
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:04,857
I have a better one.

466
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:09,359
- Why steal my pad?
- Oh, my God. You're right.

467
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:10,957
I'm an addict.

468
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:12,654
Thanks for opening my eyes.

469
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,392
No, I mean, why my pad?

470
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,029
Foreman, Cameron,
and Chase's pads are just as convenient.

471
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,173
But their association with
you is involuntary. They're employees.

472
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:23,024
I associate with you through choice.

473
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,923
And any relationship
that involves choice

474
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,674
you have to see how far
you can push before it breaks.

475
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:28,704
This is easy.

476
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:32,256
You ask the questions,
answer them, and make tasty snacks.

477
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,698
Let's go try the casino.

478
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:37,263
And one day, our friendship will break.

479
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,695
And that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional,

480
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:43,423
and you don't need human connection,
or deserve it,

481
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,150
or whatever goes on in
that rat maze of your brain.

482
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,141
Sorry. If I'd known he
was gonna be this annoying,

483
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:52,092
I would've stolen Dr.
Cameron's pad and Dr. Foreman's car.

484
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:55,112
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

485
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,475
House's House of Whining.
State your complaint.

486
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,957
Patient's BP just dropped like a stone.

487
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:03,305
Do an echo.
Mercury isn't likely to damage--

488
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,682
It didn't. Mercury test was negative.

489
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:09,328
Do an echo.

490
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:18,610
I was wrong. Your son's still dying.

491
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,383
I need to go over every
relative you ever had again.

492
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,932
This time, forget their diseases.
Just tell me how they died.

493
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,675
We don't have time to take turns.

494
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,934
Gimme the answers.
You get a big one at the end.

495
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:33,838
You go for whatever you want.
Destroy my privacy, my dignity.

496
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,617
Your grandmother?

497
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:43,281
Heat exhaustion.
Fourth of July picnic. The woman was 92.

498
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:46,355
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

499
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,143
that used to be on St. James Place?

500
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,044
Your sister-in-law with the diabetes.

501
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:51,830
As far as you know, is she still alive?

502
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:55,175
She's not. Killed in a traffic accident
driving home from a Phillies game.

503
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:57,776
I'm sure a lot of beer was consumed.
Phillies lost.

504
00:26:57,926 --> 00:26:58,876
Your father?

505
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,792
Old age. Heart finally gave out.

506
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,454
Your wife's father?

507
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,893
Hit-and-run.
Walking the incontinent dog.

508
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,558
Uh, hi. Do you guys deliver?

509
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:13,634
Let me put it this way. If you deliver,
there'll be a $100 tip in it for you.

510
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,850
Excellent!

511
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,617
Victory.

512
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,866
Ha, ha, the night
is finally going my way.

513
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,459
Wilson, toss me a soda.

514
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,335
Shall we go somewhere to talk?

515
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:40,599
House is an ass.

516
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,959
But he obviously needs pain medication.

517
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:47,099
How much pain one person feels is not
a call the government should be making.

518
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,220
So you think I'm a bureaucrat
with a badge following some

519
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,441
arbitrary guideline.

520
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:53,430
Yeah. I do.

521
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,696
So you're saying I should...

522
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,908
just trust him.

523
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:58,460
Do you?

524
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:01,911
- You're not qualified to make that--
- I'm not sure you are, either.

525
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,680
I've been a cop for 20 years,

526
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:06,562
and not a day goes by
that someone doesn't try to

527
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,330
sell me some self-serving story.

528
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,033
If you had my job, you'd know.

529
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,129
Everybody lies.

530
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,599
Think you've run out of relatives.

531
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:27,009
So. It's my turn.

532
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:35,166
- Why did you become a doctor?
- That's the big question?

533
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:40,118
I gave you complete license to humiliate
me, and that's the best you can do?

534
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,124
Well, okay. Let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

535
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:44,228
No, no, no.

536
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:45,393
You're a curious guy.

537
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,975
You like to figure things out.
Why not go into research?

538
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,640
Why work with people when you...

539
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:52,909
obviously hate people?

540
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,499
Oedipal fixation.
I was seeking my mother's love,

541
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,996
and she thought that Ben
Casey was just the dreamiest--

542
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:03,297
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need any more answers from me?

543
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,892
Give me a hard time.

544
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:15,791
When I was 14,

545
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,356
my father was stationed in Japan.

546
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,503
I went rock climbing with this kid
from school. He fell, he got injured,

547
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,589
and I had to bring him to the hospital.

548
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:32,184
We came in through the wrong entrance
and passed this guy in the hall.

549
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:35,338
It was a janitor.

550
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:38,455
My friend came down
with an infection and

551
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,491
the doctors didn't know what to do.

552
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,446
So they brought in...

553
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,386
the janitor.

554
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,600
He was a doctor.

555
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,248
And a Buraku.

556
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:56,704
One of Japan's untouchables.

557
00:29:58,495 --> 00:29:59,919
His ancestors had been

558
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:02,206
slaughterers, gravediggers.

559
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:04,675
And this guy,

560
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,475
he knew that he wasn't accepted
by the staff. Didn't even try.

561
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,426
He didn't dress well.
He didn't pretend to be one of them.

562
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,750
The people that ran that place,

563
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:18,741
they didn't think that
he had anything they wanted.

564
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,438
Except when they needed him.

565
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,498
Because he was right.

566
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,986
Which meant that nothing else mattered.

567
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,296
And they had to listen to him.

568
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:45,414
Thank you.

569
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,441
Need 20 milligrams
of diazepam in a syringe.

570
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,034
Heartbeat's irregular and accelerating.

571
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:02,674
- It's at 200.
- He's gonna crash.

572
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:05,248
- Allergic reaction to the diazepam?
- Better hope so.

573
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:07,199
It's either that, or his heart's done.

574
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:17,184
What happened on the night of the fire?

575
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:23,903
Yeah, I'm sure it's a
stressful emotional question.

576
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,660
Suck it up.

577
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,868
My wife had taken a sleeping
pill and gone to bed.

578
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,623
It was Christmas Eve. I let Kyle

579
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,837
pop corn in the fireplace. He

580
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,067
managed to...

581
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,277
knock loose some tinder.

582
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:42,506
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

583
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:44,467
Spread. So fast.

584
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:46,362
I got Kyle out.

585
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,487
And when I went back in for--

586
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:55,467
You're a disappointment.

587
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,536
You act as though you
don't need anybody. You--

588
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,174
You just blame your
son for what happened.

589
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,965
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

590
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,911
You don't blame a kid for an accident.

591
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:10,108
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

592
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,582
Because it wouldn't matter!
I failed to keep my family safe!

593
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:18,246
I couldn't stop the fire.
I couldn't save my wife!

594
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:22,140
Now you want me to stick around
watching while I fail to save my son.

595
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,299
Thank you so much for waking me up.

596
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,933
How did your son dislodge the tinder?

597
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,647
He dropped the popcorn tray.

598
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:45,334
He had been complaining it
was too heavy. I should've listened.

599
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:48,221
And the hit-and-run.
Walking the pissy dog.

600
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,111
That happen at night?

601
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:51,875
I think so, yeah. Why?

602
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:55,339
Car accident after the Phillies lost.
Night game?

603
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,931
Ragged red fiber.

604
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,045
It's an inherited condition.

605
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,733
Dropping things, muscle weakness.
Poor night vision.

606
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:08,563
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone, careless.

607
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:11,337
It's transmitted in mitochondrial DNA.

608
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,592
So it only passes through the mother.

609
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:16,143
Your wife's family weren't drunks.
They were sick.

610
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,984
It wouldn't have affected his liver.

611
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:19,985
The kid is a drunk.

612
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:24,000
He thinks that he killed his mother
and turned his father into a vegetable.

613
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,151
You know,
I might have a few shots myself.

614
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,396
Foreman.

615
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:30,942
Test his DNA for ragged red fiber.

616
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,261
- It's not gonna--
- Here's a thought.

617
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,364
Why don't we not assume that the test
is negative until we actually do it?

618
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,315
House.

619
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,677
The kid has severe cardiomyopathy.

620
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,963
Alcoholic. No shot at a transplant.

621
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:46,958
So yeah, maybe you figured out why.
Good for you, but...

622
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,545
he's gonna die anyway.

623
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:17,796
I want to give Kyle my heart.

624
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,197
This thing--

625
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,549
whatever it is--

626
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:27,891
you said he gets it from the mother.
My heart's fine.

627
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:31,237
And it could go on being
fine for the rest of your life.

628
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:32,756
Yeah.

629
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,003
It's not like he's
gonna do anything with it.

630
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,404
Well, you woke him up once.

631
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,964
Maybe someone will come
up with some other answer.

632
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,810
We've both seen breakthroughs
no one expected.

633
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:46,620
And ragged red fiber's treatable,
but not curable.

634
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,904
Even if he gets your heart,
there's no guarantee.

635
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,574
He's my kid.

636
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,670
No. Did you really
expect a different answer?

637
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:02,511
We have arranged transplants
before when a patient is near death.

638
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:06,733
Except he isn't near death. He's saying,
"Kill me and cut out my heart."

639
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,698
Are you out of your mind?

640
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,133
Fine. I'll think of something else.

641
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,417
I'm sorry.

642
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:32,463
Wilson.

643
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,705
Get out.

644
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:38,808
No.

645
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:45,022
You've lied to the cops enough for me.

646
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,757
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

647
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,279
Pills are the simplest.

648
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,800
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

649
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,591
I'm okay with pain.

650
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,680
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck.

651
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,070
Which means this'll be slow.

652
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:44,627
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car right now

653
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,140
and broke the speed
limit driving back, would I?

654
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:49,592
No.

655
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:53,737
Tell him--

656
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:04,894
I don't know what to tell him.

657
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,709
Think it's my turn to ask a question,
isn't it?

658
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,660
I don't think so.

659
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,284
'Cause you just asked me
that thing about the speed limit.

660
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,068
What do you wanna know?

661
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:28,139
If you could hear one thing
from your father, what would it be?

662
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,690
It wouldn't help you.

663
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,726
Try me.

664
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:39,883
I'd want him to say...

665
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:44,747
"You were right.

666
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,050
"You did the right thing."

667
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:52,048
Yeah.

668
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:53,567
It doesn't help.

669
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:15,105
I'm Dr. Wilson.

670
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:17,089
I'm Mrs. Schaeffer.

671
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm from Princeton.

672
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:24,101
My husband and I and our
three children live in Philadelphia.

673
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:28,981
So, uh...

674
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,574
do you like to swing?

675
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:35,524
No.

676
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,149
Well, if you change your mind,

677
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,650
I'm in--

678
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:43,235
House. House!

679
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,788
Is it room 622? 642?

680
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:47,554
622.

681
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:49,531
622.

682
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,289
Yeah.

683
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,320
Alibi.

684
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:12,288
I figured.

685
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,541
They found an open bottle
of aspirin by the body.

686
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:05,937
Lucky he had a headache.

687
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:08,718
Reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

688
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:11,931
Lucky.

689
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:25,897
That can't be all.

690
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,693
Well, you got a heart out of it.

691
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,123
How many organs do
you want from the guy?

692
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:34,324
I mean, my father
must have said something.

693
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:36,465
He couldn't just--

694
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:40,038
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

695
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,729
He said you were right.

696
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:50,153
You did the right thing.

697
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:56,859
Right about what?

698
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:00,736
What does that mean?

699
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,316
How would I know?

700
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:05,114
He's your dad.

701
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:20,687
You know what I found
interesting about this case?

702
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,809
That it proved that people
can love unconditionally,

703
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,060
and you can tell yourself
it's not true, but

704
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,009
you'll just end up in a hotel
room in Atlantic City asking someone

705
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,910
- to cut your heart out?
- The hoagie.

706
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,175
You thought this guy was emotionally
confused and that the hoagie

707
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:38,126
was just a mask to hide
his real feelings towards his son.

708
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:40,174
It was.

709
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,662
Did you know Tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

710
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:44,613
Yeah.

711
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:47,636
And yet you moved heaven
and earth to get him that mask

712
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:49,262
with mustard and prosciutto.

713
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,054
Which one of them told you?

714
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,147
All of them.

715
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:54,450
Which means that none
of them said anything

716
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:56,149
I have to worry about.
Back to the hoagie.

717
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:58,572
You think that my
addiction's out of hand.

718
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:02,442
Your need to be needed is so strong
that you'll give people what they want,

719
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:04,283
what they need,
what they think they need.

720
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:07,834
I don't think my enabling is anything
you should be complaining about.

721
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,356
Yes, my name is Dr. James Wilson.

722
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,521
Account number 835687.

723
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,488
The ATM says I've got zero--

724
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,468
What does that mean-- a hold?

725
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:25,352
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

726
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:34,951
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

727
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:40,646
They can't keep your money forever.

728
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:46,155
No, they can keep it till I agree to
help send you to prison for ten years.

729
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:53,226
You're getting dinner.

730
