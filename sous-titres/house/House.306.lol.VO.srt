1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:04,492
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL, and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:07,549
The General hands each
of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:09,081
"Your spouse is seated
next door in a room in a chair.

4
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:10,694
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside and kill them."

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,120
Immediately, the Green Beret says,

6
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,838
"No, sir, I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,006
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,157
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife and go on home."

9
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:23,134
Navy SEAL then heads in.
Five minutes later, comes out--

10
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:24,564
Tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,724
"I tried, I tried, I tried!
I just can't do it.

12
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,139
"She looked so beautiful in the chair.
I can't do it."

13
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,980
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

14
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,531
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,526
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

16
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,933
Shots rang out! There's banging.
There's screaming. It's going crazy!

17
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,856
Suddenly, everything goes silent.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,542
General says,
"Well, what the hell happened  inside?"

19
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:46,989
Sister from Brooklyn screams back,

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,940
"The damn gun had blanks in it! So I
had to beat him to death with my bare--"

21
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:53,647
What the hell?

22
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:55,596
A little bit of warning
would've been nice!

23
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,220
Sound of a saw cutting a hole
in a wall wasn't warning enough?

24
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:59,171
Bite me!

25
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:10,321
What, are you kidding me?

26
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,142
Tub-o-goo there has
gotta be over six bills.

27
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,219
You ain't gonna lift
him with a couple of blankets.

28
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,609
You got a better idea, Einstein?

29
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:16,890
Yeah, just roll him off.

30
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,962
He's already dead.
It ain't like he's gonna feel it.

31
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,464
How the hell does a guy get that big?

32
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,567
If we roll him off, he's likely to go
through the floor and take us with him.

33
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,383
Ready? All right, one, two-- Lift!

34
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,519
Come on, man.

35
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,786
- Me? You're the kielbasa king.
- Wasn't me.

36
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,150
Whoa, wasn't me either.

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,300
Don't look at me.

38
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,020
Please tell me dead guys can fart.

39
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,194
Of course. Dead bodies
are full of all sorts of gases.

40
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,225
But a dead body can't tighten the
sphincter. You need one to make a fart.

41
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,376
- No, you need a loose sphincter.
- Did you check his femoral?

42
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:55,473
No.

43
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:56,774
He peed all over himself.

44
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,837
Look, I've heard dead bodies moan,
groan, hiss--

45
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,832
I've even seen them
sit straight up on a gurney.

46
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,057
Trust me. His skin's cold.

47
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,257
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
He's not breathing.

48
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,016
- He's got a pulse! - No way.

49
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,618
Get me an ambu bag and EKG.

50
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,943
It's thready, but it's there.
Let's get him in the basket. Ready?

51
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,648
One, two, lift!

52
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:20,087
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26

53
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,987
46-year-old guy in a coma.

54
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,737
Doesn't appear to be anything
wrong with him except for the fact

55
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,857
that he weighs over 600 pounds.
What time does he usually get in?

56
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,508
Any time between 8:00 and 10:00.

57
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,281
- Did you say 600? - At least.

58
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,447
Biggest scale we
got only goes up to 350.

59
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,705
But this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

60
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:06,805
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker than pancake batter.

61
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:08,656
No mystery there, or much we can do.

62
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,775
Blood sugar's normal.

63
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:13,326
Cholesterol's lower than mine.
Tox screen's clean. No sign of trauma.

64
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,006
Sure there wasn't a mix-up at the lab?

65
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:15,957
Three times?

66
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,454
It's almost 11:00. Where is House?

67
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,598
Excusez-moi, garcon!

68
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,140
Hello?!

69
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:06,764
It's 11:00.

70
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:11,593
Which means my friend is ready for his
sponge bath. And I shouldn't be here.

71
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,316
Hey, Gomer Pyle!

72
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:18,028
I know you can hear me.

73
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,909
I think you mean Barney Fife.

74
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:33,185
So many great idiot
icons to choose from.

75
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,419
You need time to think of some more?

76
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:39,567
- Either arraign me or let me go.
- No problem.

77
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,129
Which do you prefer?

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,381
What took you so long?

79
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:56,132
Sorry, I didn't have 15
grand in my loose change jar.

80
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,007
What the hell did you do?

81
00:04:58,421 --> 00:04:59,268
Nothing.

82
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:02,418
The motorcycle was impounded.
That explains the speeding, DUI,

83
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:03,969
and driving without a license.

84
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,358
The fact that you're you

85
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:08,958
explains the illegal possession
of narcotics. And resisting arrest.

86
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,656
Where's your car?

87
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,039
What happened?

88
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:17,880
Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously
thought that I didn't treat him

89
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,176
with the deference due
to a man of his stature.

90
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,677
He trumped up a traffic stop.

91
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,902
Next thing I know,
I'm sharing a cage with a guy

92
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:27,103
who thinks that showers are
the way the devil gets inside you.

93
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:29,652
- Does Cuddy know?
- Everything she needs to.

94
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,418
- I'm innocent. - Till proven guilty.

95
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,432
Guy wanted to punish me.
He did it. It's over.

96
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,173
Better get yourself a lawyer.

97
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:39,124
Already got one.

98
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,940
You know what they say about
the lawyer who has himself as a client?

99
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,373
Same thing they say about the doctor

100
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,424
who lends 15 grand to a friend
he knows can't pay him back.

101
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,080
Relax, you'll get it.

102
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:49,984
Where am I gonna take off to?

103
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,545
Does Salma Hayek
live in Mexico or Spain?

104
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,121
There's nothing abnormal in
the EEG or in the neurological exam.

105
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,722
I'm guessing it's food related.

106
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:08,400
Improperly prepared puffer fish
can have toxins that could cause a coma

107
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,451
and might not show up on the tox screen.

108
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,835
- Where do you think he is?
- He's probably at the track.

109
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,185
If he was there he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him.

110
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,853
If it was a puffer fish,
he'd be dead in six to eight hours tops.

111
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,357
He's been in a coma at least 24.

112
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,366
The guy didn't get to 600
pounds eating a load of sushi.

113
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,100
What if he was in a motorcycle accident?

114
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,701
Explains the coma.
But how did he get back in bed?

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,950
Oh-- Cameron's talking about House.

116
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,646
- You ever see how he drives?
- No. We haven't.

117
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,891
But I have seen how many
pills he's been popping lately.

118
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,418
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's in a coma somewhere himself.

119
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,469
If I am, this is one lame hallucination.

120
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:40,554
What happened to you?

121
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:44,016
If you ever end up in a bar with
the Cambridge Women's Heavyweight Eight,

122
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,867
do not accept an offer
of an upside down kamikaze shot.

123
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,794
- We have a case.
- Fat guy in a coma, I know.

124
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:49,890
- Cuddy found you?- No,

125
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,999
but the wall between Wilson's office
and this one is thinner than you think.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,966
Which means we need to stop talking
about what a pathetic loser he is.

127
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,367
Start treating Jabba
for Pickwickian Syndrome.

128
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:02,535
His 96 double Zs are probably putting
pressure on his chest, suffocating him.

129
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,316
- CO2 and oxygen stats are normal.
- For you and me.

130
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,052
What's normal for a hippopotamus?

131
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,543
Get a detailed medical history.

132
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:09,892
From who? He was brought in alone.

133
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,341
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600
pounds bothers with annual physicals.

134
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,190
Talk to the neighbors. Search the house.

135
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,991
Let's see what else Shamu's
been up to besides eating.

136
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,372
This conversation is over

137
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,823
because I have officially run
out of clever things to call the guy.

138
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:35,096
It's hard to believe you can even attach
this much flesh to a human skeleton.

139
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:37,662
I wouldn't exactly call this attached.

140
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,114
This is ridiculous. A person
shouldn't be able to eat themselves

141
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,082
into oblivion and
then just expect everyone

142
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,833
to pull out the stops to fix everything.

143
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,720
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment to anyone who's obese?

144
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,021
Come on, gimme a break.
The guy's not obese.

145
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:53,135
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

146
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,071
People who attempt suicide get treated.

147
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,015
Plenty of noncompliant diabetics don't.

148
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:00,566
We don't give drug addicts dialysis.
Or alcoholics liver transplants.

149
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,323
What is your problem?

150
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:05,023
You get beat up by a
gang of fat kids when you were

151
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:08,014
- in grade school or something?
- Yeah, I'm the one with the problem.

152
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,099
So, um, I think his bedroom's through
there. And kitchen's to the left.

153
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,988
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

154
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,790
Any trouble with memory or balance?

155
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:20,568
No, but I really don't
see him that often.

156
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,924
He's not unfriendly or anything.

157
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,183
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

158
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:28,765
I think he only gave me a spare
set of keys because I gave him mine.

159
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,640
What?

160
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:32,467
Nothing.

161
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,168
Just reminds me of someone
I know who is unfriendly.

162
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,051
Does George have a job?

163
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,511
He has a headhunting
business he runs from home.

164
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,725
Occasionally he'll
interview people here. But

165
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:43,476
he does most of it over the phone.

166
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:47,587
He loves to cook.

167
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,717
And eat, obviously.

168
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,579
Four-course gourmet
meals almost every night.

169
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,883
Sometimes for lunch too.

170
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,024
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese or wild game?

171
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:57,975
I'm not sure.

172
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,201
He gets all his groceries delivered
from that market down on Alden.

173
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,202
They probably know.

174
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,827
He have any friends?

175
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:06,784
No,

176
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,153
I mean-- Sometimes women do come by.

177
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,336
Young, attractive--

178
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:13,888
Never the same one twice,
if you know what I mean.

179
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:14,614
I see.

180
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,865
There can't be many women
who'd want to be with a guy like him.

181
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,013
It's usually worst in the morning.

182
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,468
Especially if I've slept on my arm.

183
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,569
If I sleep on my back or
with my arms out, I'm usually okay.

184
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,228
So your arm only hurts after
you lie on top of it all night.

185
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,601
Yeah.

186
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,519
Well, have you thought about,

187
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,520
I don't know--

188
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:42,471
Not doing that?

189
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:45,546
Yeah, but it's how I sleep.
That's how I've always slept.

190
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,425
- Well, there's always surgery.
- To do what?

191
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,018
Clean out some cartilage or something?

192
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,347
You're not sleeping on some cartilage.
You're sleeping on your arm.

193
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:56,112
- You want to remove my arm?
- Well, it is your left.

194
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:57,401
A guy's gotta sleep.

195
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,633
Are you insane?

196
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,524
I see spending a night
in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.

197
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,825
While following my
every move is flattering,

198
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,430
a single rose on my doorstep
each morning would be

199
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,561
more enticing.

200
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,475
Just bringing your boss up to speed.

201
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,776
Which I guess you didn't
feel was necessary.

202
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,235
You gonna add that
to my list of charges?

203
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:28,386
People who are innocent tend
not to try to hide their arrest.

204
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:32,008
Is that based on your years
of experience arresting innocent people?

205
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:36,503
The way you're going at that gum,

206
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,927
it's obviously not
having the desired effect.

207
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:39,894
You're the addict.

208
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:42,280
You're gonna be back
on the butts in a month.

209
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:46,181
You're just taking out your frustration
on me because my meds actually work.

210
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,547
Why don't you quit while you're ahead,

211
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:49,247
before you end up

212
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,498
as a security guard working
the night shift at some strip mall?

213
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,852
I think working around a bunch of nurses

214
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,853
has given you a false sense
of your ability to intimidate.

215
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:08,754
Who's that?

216
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:14,156
Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm
donor search to include Neanderthals.

217
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,065
Cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?

218
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,080
It's a joke.

219
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,613
Like Cuddy would ever want a kid.

220
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,080
Or a kid would ever want Cuddy.

221
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,581
Hello? That's why it's funny.

222
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:26,902
Why are you guys here?

223
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,321
It's not Pickwick's.

224
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,800
Intubation and steroids
have had no effect.

225
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,789
Except maybe to cause whatever it
is to get worse. He's got a fever now.

226
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,840
What'd you find out?

227
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,812
That you and George have the same
taste in home furnishings and women.

228
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,613
Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?

229
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,853
Pianos and prostitutes. We should
do an LP, look for neurosyphilis.

230
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,757
- It's not syphilis. - How do you know?

231
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:47,004
Because you get STDs
from people you trust.

232
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,323
People you don't feel the
need to protect yourself from.

233
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,964
Whatever he has is connected to his gut.
Not what's below it.

234
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,515
MRI his brain, look for clots.

235
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,404
Weight limit on the
MRI machine is 450 pounds.

236
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,202
- So do a CT.- Limit's 350.

237
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,218
Then just start treatment.

238
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,535
We give him blood thinners and

239
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:05,048
the coma's caused by a bleed
instead of a clot, we'd kill him.

240
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,999
Either start treatment,
or start building a stronger MRI.

241
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,054
Whatever you do, do it fast.
The longer he stays in a coma,

242
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:13,205
the less likely it
is he'll ever wake up.

243
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:17,599
There's no way.

244
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,220
His head's the only part
that we have to get in the machine.

245
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,646
If we can just get him on the table.

246
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,573
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

247
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,046
We break the table,
hospital's out a million dollars.

248
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,101
And we're out of our jobs.

249
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:30,292
The weight limit's obviously
just an estimation.

250
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,516
It's not like it can
hold 450 pounds fine--

251
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,509
it'll instantly collapse under 451.

252
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,931
He's not 1 pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

253
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,939
I don't care. He still deserves the
same standard of care as anyone else.

254
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,659
And you believe the machine
will stand on principle?

255
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,667
You guys gonna help or not?

256
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:56,263
- How much does this guy weigh? - 440.

257
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:59,223
- Looks like a lot more than that.
- It's because he's lying down.

258
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:01,495
You guys ready? One, two, three--

259
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,356
Here.

260
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:20,447
What's this?

261
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:22,873
I made some calls for you.

262
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,618
The guy's the best criminal
attorney in Princeton.

263
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:26,910
Thanks, but I don't need it.

264
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,752
I assume you told Inspector Clouseau

265
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:30,706
that I have a valid
prescription for the Vicodin.

266
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,445
Yeah, and I assume you did as well.
Did it make a difference?

267
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,396
The guy's pissed.

268
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:37,651
And with the DEA now treating
pain doctors like Columbian--

269
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,083
I'm not a pain doctor.
I'm a pain patient.

270
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:42,684
Tell it to your lawyer.

271
00:13:57,344 --> 00:14:00,456
No midline shifts,
no bleeds, clots, infarcts.

272
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,211
I don't see any edema either.

273
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,476
So what do we do now?

274
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,014
An LP.

275
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:08,119
Even if it's not an STD, a fever
points toward some sort of infection.

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,974
I'm not sure we can
do an LP on a guy his size.

277
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,851
What? You have to be able to palpate
the spine to know where to go.

278
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:19,616
We could use fluoroscopy to guide us.

279
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,502
He's still gotta be
able to bring his knees up

280
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,579
and bend forward in
order to open a space--

281
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,191
George, it's all right.
You're in a hospital.

282
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,542
Calm down, man! Calm down!

283
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,044
Get him out already!

284
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:32,995
I'm trying.

285
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:38,788
We're gonna get you out.

286
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,742
We still have no idea why
he was in the coma to begin with.

287
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:49,693
Or why he woke up.

288
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:53,060
It was probably just
some sort of head trauma.

289
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,907
And we missed the swelling because...

290
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,691
Well, his head's already swollen.

291
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:59,148
A bump on the noggin
doesn't explain the fever.

292
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,019
An infection made worse by the steroids
we gave him for Pickwick's does.

293
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,715
He's not worse. He's better.

294
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,509
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.

295
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,320
Referring to the fund-raising
funbags by the royal "we" now?

296
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,192
Let me explain cause and effect to you.

297
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:15,093
I specifically told them
to skip the boring testing part

298
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,793
and jump right to
the dangerous treatment.

299
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,360
You blow stuff up,
makes my life miserable.

300
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,848
Makes me need to make
your life miserable.

301
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:23,592
He's telling the truth.

302
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:32,013
Kids these days. Got no respect
for other people's property.

303
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,714
Repairmen cost less than lawyers.

304
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:37,543
Morbid obesity is a
legally defined disability.

305
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:40,652
Which means if we'd denied access
to the MRI, he could've sued us for

306
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,908
discrimination as well as malpractice.

307
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:44,468
This was your idea?

308
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,130
Yeah.

309
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:59,898
Looks like Cameron's gonna be
having a lot more ideas in the future.

310
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:02,761
Who knew that being bloated
and bitchy could actually come in handy?

311
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,432
Shut up.

312
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,920
- What if it is hormones?
- It's not hormones.

313
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,257
I'm talking about George.

314
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,890
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

315
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,685
A glandular problem would cause
his temperature to be low, not high.

316
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,926
- Maybe the fever's not related.
- If it's not related,

317
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,806
- there's nothing to talk about.
- We should do an ACTH stimulation test

318
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,982
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

319
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,726
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

320
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,124
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals for chancres.

321
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,653
We should do nothing. Just keep
him a couple of days for observation.

322
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:30,780
If it doesn't get any worse,

323
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,831
it was probably just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

324
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,386
Or we do all of the above.

325
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:41,061
You check his belly for patches.
You check underneath it for sores.

326
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,379
And you...

327
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,580
Just sit on your ass.

328
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:54,158
Acanthosis nigricans is
a hyperpigmentation of the skin.

329
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:57,267
It usually indicates some
sort of hormonal imbalance.

330
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,077
There's nothing wrong with my hormones.

331
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,378
It's the first thing every
doctor I've ever gone to has checked.

332
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,443
Then it's the blood pressure.
Then it's gotta be diabetes.

333
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:08,394
They all figure there's
gotta be something wrong with me.

334
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,970
You having any problems
with your vision?

335
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,871
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth. I'm fine.

336
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:17,310
You're not. You were in a coma for two
days. There's something wrong with you.

337
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,147
Was something wrong with me.
Now I'm better. Now I'd like to go home.

338
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,790
A coma's not like a stomach ache.

339
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,330
You can't just shrug it off
and hope it's not anything serious.

340
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,811
My company places a
lot of insurance executives.

341
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,828
There are over 300,000
deaths caused each year

342
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:36,355
by medical mistakes and
hospital-associated infections.

343
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,284
I'll come in for tests.

344
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:41,898
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by obesity-related illnesses.

345
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:45,169
CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

346
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:48,688
George, you ever notice you
don't see a lot of obese old men?

347
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,668
If I'm gonna have a heart attack,

348
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,753
I would rather it be caused

349
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,568
by a perfect pan-roasted Ris de Veau

350
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,599
than running 26 miles for no reason
other than to brag that I can do it.

351
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,671
Or to have a MRI machine
break in the middle of a procedure!

352
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:07,414
We're sorry about that.

353
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:10,045
It was the only way to rule
out a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

354
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,196
And now that you have,

355
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:13,257
when can I go?

356
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,486
It's probably her mom.

357
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:25,223
I bet she's huge.

358
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,271
She's from the Midwest.

359
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,044
- Since when do you eat beets?
- Since I was five.

360
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,204
And who are we talking about? You know,
just in case you need me to chime in.

361
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:35,813
And tell you're a lunatic at some point.

362
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,980
Cameron-- she's lying,

363
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,203
destroying hospital equipment,

364
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:40,394
telling Cuddy off.

365
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,195
I gotta find out where
she got the fat scratch fever.

366
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:45,554
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

367
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,331
I heard Cuddy gave
you the name of a lawyer.

368
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:48,594
Or it could just be pity.

369
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,895
She feels guilty about
being born beautiful.

370
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,788
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

371
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:55,945
It would explain why she
gets along so well with you.

372
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,657
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her of you, not me.

373
00:18:58,658 --> 00:18:59,608
Call the lawyer.

374
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,055
Cameron sees a clump
of dirt and she thinks of me.

375
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,366
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic.

376
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,317
Call the lawyer.

377
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,041
- Very mature. - You started it.

378
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,302
Skin exam and ACTH stimulation
test were both normal.

379
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,381
He has nystagmus, but it's congenital.

380
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:17,965
No way it's related to the coma.

381
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,186
You say no way, I say...
Yeah, no way.

382
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,816
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis.

383
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,682
Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.

384
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:26,633
Not for long.

385
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,167
He wants to be discharged.

386
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:28,840
Oh, sure.

387
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,296
Places to go, people to eat.

388
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,078
He insists the chance of dying
from a hospital-acquired infection

389
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,278
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

390
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,231
Did you tell him that statistics
also say that he's a big fat idiot?

391
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,326
Yeah, I did.

392
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:43,429
He's not backing down. He says if we
don't discharge him, he'll leave A.M.A.

393
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,350
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative--

394
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,416
Maybe you ought to check his leg.

395
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,959
You see what he did there?

396
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,566
The patient's like me.

397
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,593
The patient's three mes.

398
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,390
If I were him...

399
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,624
Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.

400
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,244
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?

401
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:18,895
Putting chopped parsley in a hamburger
does not a Salisbury steak make.

402
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,802
You must be Dr. House.

403
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,380
And you must be full of baloney.

404
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,122
- A lot of it. - Ha! Right, fat joke!

405
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:30,739
Always fun.

406
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,170
The only people you
can still make fun of.

407
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,121
And Christians.

408
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:35,855
Oh, and black people.

409
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,035
No one in their right
mind comes out of a coma

410
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:41,598
and immediately asks to
go home with an unknown condition.

411
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,769
Which means you're either
not in your right mind,

412
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,988
or it's not an unknown condition.
So, what is it?

413
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,327
You tried to off yourself?

414
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,529
You figure I'm fat, therefore

415
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,366
I hate myself.

416
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,701
Yeah, that's a huge leap of logic.

417
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:55,174
I don't want to die.

418
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,674
I just don't want to be here.

419
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,795
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed.

420
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,057
Or it's something you know
you've inherited. Let's see.

421
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,472
Your stomach has deep-seated feelings
of abandonment written all over it,

422
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,223
which points towards sexual abuse.

423
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,191
Although a fear of hospitals...

424
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,646
that points to a more specific
traumatic event. So I'm gonna say

425
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:16,023
your mom,
in the hospital, with a candlestick.

426
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:19,315
By candlestick, of course,
I mean inherited OTC deficiency.

427
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:22,934
My parents are both alive
and well and living in Boca Raton.

428
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:26,455
- Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?
- I have no idea what that is.

429
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,662
- Leukoencephalopathy. - Will you stop?

430
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,704
If I knew what was wrong,
I would tell you.

431
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,327
I'm not an imbecile.

432
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,026
And I'm not miserable.

433
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,013
I'm just overweight.

434
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:46,401
What?

435
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,649
When?

436
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:50,913
To be continued.

437
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,918
What are you doing here?

438
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,781
Executing a search of the premises.

439
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,233
When you--uh, when you got bailed out,

440
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,850
before we could get
a judge to approve this.

441
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,697
I almost didn't bother.

442
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,824
I thought for sure you'd come

443
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,049
straight home and throw everything out.

444
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:35,584
Rookie mistake.

445
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:38,249
Never underestimate
the stupidity of an addict.

446
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:40,895
There's gotta be

447
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,743
over 600 Vicodin in here. Which most
DAs would say proves intent to traffic.

448
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,063
Even if all you really intended was

449
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:52,375
simply to be wasted 24/7
while practicing medicine.

450
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,566
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are prescription bottles.

451
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm not an expert on linguistics per se,

452
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,086
but I think that means
they were prescribed.

453
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:07,603
All these were legally prescribed
to a man who's in constant pain

454
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,210
but never misses a day of work?

455
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:11,711
Ever occur to you that's
why I don't miss a day?

456
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,799
Yeah.

457
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,509
Yeah, it crossed my mind.

458
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:15,768
Among other things like

459
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:19,393
what an unprofessional,
unethical, arrogant ass you are.

460
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:25,088
Because if you're unprofessional
in one area, it only makes sense.

461
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,222
Now, maybe just a few of these

462
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,087
are in someone else's name.

463
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,722
Forged prescription or...

464
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:36,604
Just

465
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,484
swiped from the pharmacy
when nobody's looking...

466
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:43,052
Oh, but, well,

467
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,082
you wouldn't do that.

468
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,570
Right?

469
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:54,724
Send him home.

470
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:56,446
Why, you think he's healthy?

471
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:57,745
Either I'm right,

472
00:23:57,994 --> 00:24:01,042
and he knows what's wrong and
he's just too stubborn to admit it.

473
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,893
Or I was right, and it's Pickwick's.

474
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,265
The treatment just had a delayed effect.

475
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,127
You don't have delayed
effects to oxygen.

476
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,778
And Pickwick's doesn't
explain the fever.

477
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:12,113
Being engulfed in an electric blanket
of blubber could explain the fever.

478
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:14,636
Yesterday, you insisted we
keep him here because of the fever.

479
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,388
We have no idea what's
wrong with the guy.

480
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,666
For all we know,
he could be dead in 12 hours.

481
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,291
He does not want our help.

482
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:22,848
Which means he doesn't want your help.

483
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:25,449
He's obviously just rationalizing.
And so are you.

484
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,084
You would never give up
this easy if you weren't so busy

485
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,135
dealing with your own personal problems.

486
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,033
Send him home.

487
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,621
What did you tell that cop?

488
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,221
- Nothing. - Nothing as in nothing?

489
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,212
Or as in nothing that'd
cause him to think

490
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,859
that I have a stash at my apartment?

491
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,011
He called to see if I prescribed
the pills. I said yes. That's all.

492
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:45,723
- Obviously not. - What happened?

493
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,453
He searched my house.
Found a buttload of pills.

494
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,907
Guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day.

495
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,289
Last I checked, pharmacies
were still open when it rained.

496
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,959
And because I never know when
you're gonna be in one of your moods

497
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,910
- and cut me off. - Oh, it's my fault?

498
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:00,832
I'm not the one who talked to the cop.

499
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,833
Well, I'm not the one who
put a thermometer in his rectum.

500
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,762
So stop yelling at me and
start talking to your lawyer.

501
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,941
Is there someone who can check on you?

502
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:16,038
Oh, don't worry. There's
gonna be a whole crew of carpenters

503
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,406
in my bedroom for
the next week at least.

504
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:23,375
You know, there's an Overeaters
Anonymous meeting here at the hospital.

505
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:27,029
If I wanted to jump out
of airplanes or climb Mt. Everest,

506
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,973
would you be telling me
to go to Daredevils Anonymous?

507
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,208
I would be worried about you,
just like I am now.

508
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,159
Don't be.

509
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:34,659
I enjoy food.

510
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:38,922
I like cooking it. I like looking at it.
I like smelling it.

511
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,130
And I especially like eating it.

512
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,798
Whatever happens is gonna happen.

513
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:50,406
Ultimately,
it's all out of our control anyway.

514
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,819
Why doesn't that philosophy
apply to medical mistakes

515
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,970
and hospital-acquired
infections as well?

516
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,665
I'm a complicated man, Dr. Cameron.

517
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,152
But don't worry.

518
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:04,486
I plan on staying
that way for a long time.

519
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:06,232
Wait, let us take
you all the way outside.

520
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,183
I'm fine.

521
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,691
It doesn't matter. It's hospital rules.

522
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:12,725
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back for four days.

523
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,438
I need the exercise, right?

524
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,594
George, come on,
let us just take you to the taxi.

525
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:20,449
Don't worry. I may not be able
to climb Everest, but I can walk, okay?

526
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,393
- George-- - Enough already.

527
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:31,956
George, are you all right?

528
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,692
George? You all right?

529
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,284
George?

530
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:51,972
Disorientation and loss of
balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.

531
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:53,825
Where's Chase?

532
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:56,953
Don't know. Haven't seen him since you
told him to sit on his ass yesterday.

533
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:57,904
Interesting.

534
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,848
NF-2 is also inherited.
Which means I was right.

535
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,192
You kept saying it was Pickwick's.

536
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,072
Between the first and
the second Pickwick's,

537
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,106
I said it was inherited.

538
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,069
Whatever. NF-2 doesn't explain fever.

539
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,093
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

540
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,493
Why? The disorientation and
loss of balance are more recent.

541
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:12,965
The coma was the most severe symptom.

542
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,606
But he's not in a coma anymore.
And he is disoriented.

543
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,783
No, he's not.

544
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:21,528
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass that begs to differ.

545
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:23,965
I just mean it's not connected.

546
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,401
You don't know that.

547
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:26,763
Yeah, I do.

548
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:29,406
- How could you possibly know--
- Because I did it.

549
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:36,024
I didn't think he should
be discharged, so I

550
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,034
gave him three grams of phenytoin.

551
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,210
I wasn't gonna just let him leave.

552
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,689
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

553
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,514
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

554
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:47,683
Nice audible, Peyton.

555
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,136
So what do we do now?

556
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:54,026
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

557
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:57,262
Humpty Dumpty didn't get to
be the size of all the King's horses

558
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,245
by skipping the most
important meal of the day.

559
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:01,990
What causes coma,
fever, and loss of appetite?

560
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,454
It can't be Chagas.
He's never been outside the country.

561
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:05,505
But his stomach has.

562
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,046
The food we eat no longer
comes from America's heartland.

563
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,747
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

564
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,413
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

565
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:15,795
Get a sample of his
CSF before the little bugs

566
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:18,121
that are now feasting on
his brain move on to dessert.

567
00:28:18,122 --> 00:28:19,422
How are we gonna do that?

568
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,241
He's too big to do an LP.

569
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,722
So go straight to the source.

570
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,745
You want to drill a hole in my head?

571
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:29,913
It's the only way.

572
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:32,834
It's got to be something
other than a parasite.

573
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:37,458
I buy my produce at the best
market in town. And I always wash it.

574
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:39,633
Leafy vegetables can
suck contaminated water

575
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,294
through their roots
right into the plant.

576
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,951
You could've washed them in chlorine
and it still wouldn't have mattered.

577
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,016
Then other people would be sick as well.

578
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:50,048
Parasites could've
been on only a few items.

579
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,237
Or maybe they just didn't
eat as much as you did.

580
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,294
It's always about my weight, isn't it?

581
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,757
Why can't you people
come up with one theory--

582
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,229
Because this one fits, George.

583
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,917
It explains your coma,
your fever, your loss of appetite.

584
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,434
And the...

585
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:11,165
disorientation?

586
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,397
It's all explained.

587
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:16,141
And if we don't treat it
while it's still in the acute stage,

588
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,113
it'll be too late.

589
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,553
It could go on to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

590
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,859
This is what I get for eating salad.

591
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:37,613
Suction.

592
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:39,978
Aspirator.

593
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,281
Your turn.

594
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:53,833
Irrigation.

595
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:56,105
Sponge.

596
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:59,321
- What-- What did you do?
- Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

597
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,034
I can't see.

598
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:02,619
Your vision's blurry or you've lost it?

599
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,466
I didn't lose it! You took it from me!

600
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,267
- George, calm down. - I can't see!

601
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:07,522
Give me some lorazepam!

602
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:09,856
- What did you do to me! - Hold still!

603
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,857
You're gonna rip your head on the halo!

604
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,953
There's no inflammation in the
optic nerve, and his retina's intact.

605
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:19,581
The blindness has to have been
caused by something in his brain.

606
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:21,657
And, not surprisingly,
there was no sign of Chagas

607
00:30:21,658 --> 00:30:23,408
or any other parasites in his CSF.

608
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:27,177
So we ruled out his parents,
prostitutes, the arugula.

609
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:29,895
- Means either--
- I took the sample from the prefrontal.

610
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,896
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

611
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:36,073
- Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.
- Not a chance. The MRI was clean.

612
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,493
You mind?

613
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:40,037
- Where are you going?
- To get a $400 butt plug.

614
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,933
- What about George?
- He's gonna have to get his own.

615
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:44,062
Come on, let's see

616
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:47,013
if we can get this thing figured
out by the time we get to the elevator.

617
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:47,964
It could be MS.

618
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,126
It would explain the coma,
the blindness,

619
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,433
loss of balance, and the fever.

620
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,620
Could also explain his
lack of concern for his health.

621
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,541
- MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.
- Yeah, he's a delight.

622
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:59,011
You don't get to MS with
coma as the first symptom.

623
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,762
Blindness plus coma says diabetes.

624
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:02,996
- Just in time. - No--

625
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:05,697
Blood sugar, urine dipstick,
and hemoglobin A1-C are normal.

626
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,148
Were normal when you tested.

627
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,493
He's been in and out of a coma.

628
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,138
Whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

629
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,739
unlike his pant size, which only waxes.
Which also points to diabetes.

630
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:17,285
Test him again. This time,
add a glucose tolerance test and an HEC.

631
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:18,845
We already have a CSF sample.

632
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:21,736
We might as well check it
for proteins and rule out MS first.

633
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:24,287
Agreed, except for the
part about doing it first.

634
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,343
Where are you going?

635
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:28,007
The butt plug was my way
of saying mind your own business.

636
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:29,158
Apparently too subtle.

637
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,604
George, all it is is sugar water.
I promise.

638
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,654
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic.

639
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:37,679
You tested me. Everybody's tested me.

640
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,683
Sometimes the blood sugar
levels can fluctuate,

641
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,085
make it difficult to diagnose.

642
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:44,421
You stuck a needle in my brain
and ten seconds later I was blind!

643
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,172
How's that difficult to diagnose?!

644
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,693
Who the hell knows what
else you guys have done to me!

645
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:50,923
- I should've never come here!
- You didn't come here.

646
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:53,723
You were brought here because
you were in a coma and barely alive.

647
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:57,074
We didn't do that to you.
You need to let us figure out what did.

648
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,468
For someone who insists
he enjoys life as much as you do,

649
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:04,355
you certainly don't seem
willing to do much to prolong it.

650
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:07,572
Yeah, because I don't agree
with the brilliant doctors,

651
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:09,544
suddenly I'm suicidal.

652
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,026
Refusing to cooperate with
us does not make you suicidal.

653
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,177
It makes you an idiot.

654
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:15,895
You think we want to
see you blind or in a coma?

655
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:20,832
I've been fat all my life.

656
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:24,402
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

657
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:30,952
You look for a disease that has nothing
to do with my size, and I will help you.

658
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,068
Otherwise,

659
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:36,284
leave me alone.

660
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:40,515
Speeding,

661
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:42,842
DUI,

662
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,452
reckless driving,

663
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:45,937
resisting arrest,

664
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,354
possession of a Class Three narcotic--

665
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,001
Now it looks like they've
added another possession

666
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,002
with intent to traffic charges as well.

667
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,122
They found some pills at your house.

668
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:59,073
All of which I had a prescription for.

669
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,811
- That's a lot of pills.
- I'm in a lot of pain.

670
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:03,793
This is all because some...

671
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:06,854
cop came into the clinic.
I was rude to him.

672
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:08,752
This is his way of getting back at me.

673
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,889
You've made it pretty easy.

674
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,359
His insane reaction to a simple

675
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:14,285
rectal thermometer reading

676
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:18,003
probably says a lot more about
his mother than it says about me.

677
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,607
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm...

678
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,334
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

679
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,525
I'm not interested in a plea bargain.

680
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:30,576
It's your best bet to make this go away.

681
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,076
There is no "this." There's a "him."

682
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,734
The only thing I'm guilty
of is humiliating a bully.

683
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,635
I wasn't speeding. I wasn't impaired.

684
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:41,443
I didn't resist. And I certainly
was not distributing narcotics

685
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,144
to anyone but myself because
I need those narcotics.

686
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,364
Five grand retainer.

687
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:50,456
If we end up going to trial, it'll be
another thirty due before the first day.

688
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:51,779
My hourly is $450.

689
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,576
That work for you?

690
00:33:58,258 --> 00:33:59,558
What did your lawyer say?

691
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:03,663
I looked up "butt plug" in
a legal dictionary. What did he say?

692
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:05,503
That a smile like mine can't lose.

693
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:08,966
- What did the tests say?
- You're right about MS.

694
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,817
No myelin basic proteins in his CSF.

695
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:11,761
What about diabetes?

696
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,437
Don't know. He says we only think
it's that because of his weight.

697
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,588
Won't let us test him.

698
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:35,498
So, you would rather be a blind
invalid than admit the fact that maybe

699
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:37,799
you might have a little
problem with overeating.

700
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,849
By a little problem, of course, I mean
you've eaten yourself half to death.

701
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,168
And you would rather let
me die than consider the fact

702
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,469
that whatever is wrong with
me has nothing to do with my weight.

703
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:48,511
I go where the symptoms tell me to go.

704
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:52,038
Right now, they're asking why this
stuff is the first thing you've ever

705
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,911
- refused to swallow.
- I am not diabetic.

706
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,900
Grocery stores giving away medical
degrees with the free turkeys now?

707
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:00,164
The sooner you drink this,

708
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,564
the sooner I get to go waste
my time with something else.

709
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:03,817
Get the hell off of me!

710
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,931
No dessert until you finish your dinner.

711
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,617
- Help me!
- George, just drink it.

712
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,647
Nurse!

713
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,453
Get this jackass off of me!

714
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,040
What the hell is going on?

715
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:17,041
Just trying to force a horse to--

716
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,134
Let go.

717
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:42,898
What's going on?

718
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,684
Get X-rays of his hands.

719
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:49,370
Then bronc him, do a sputum cytology and
check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies.

720
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:52,638
How are we gonna get him to do all that?
We can't even get him to drink a bottle.

721
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,261
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way connected to obesity.

722
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,462
You don't think he'll
realize we're lying?

723
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,483
You're not. Lung cancer's got nothing--

724
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:03,134
- I meant about him having lung cancer.
- You didn't notice his fingers?

725
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:06,771
- I noticed they were fat.
- You should've pissed him off.

726
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:09,044
He would've grabbed you.
And you would've felt the bones.

727
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,995
They're not just fat, they're clubbed.

728
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:45,416
George?

729
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,048
It's me.

730
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,105
Your tests were positive.

731
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,051
You have a small cell lung carcinoma.

732
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:02,094
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

733
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,445
which in turn caused
your blindness and coma.

734
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:07,854
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

735
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:12,572
It's inoperable. But there
are radiation treatments available.

736
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,294
It might give you a few more months.

737
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,073
I never smoked.

738
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,573
C'est la vie.

739
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,871
You were right.

740
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:21,081
So was he.

741
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,332
He said, "C'est la vie."

742
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,999
He's a complicated man.

743
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,286
What about you?

744
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:28,207
What are you gonna
do about your problem?

745
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,151
Nothing. Just got a call from my lawyer.

746
00:38:30,152 --> 00:38:32,352
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

747
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,286
As soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

748
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:37,158
they're gonna drop the possession,
DUI, and resisting arrest.

749
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,091
As soon as I pay my $85 speeding
ticket and the impound fine,

750
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:42,342
- I get my bike back.
- I guess that's good.

751
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,923
- You guess? - No, it's good.

752
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,046
You get to keep going
like you always have.

753
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,920
All right, I give up.

754
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,787
Who was it? Who in your
family had the weight problem?

755
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:57,455
You think I can only
care about a patient

756
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:59,733
if I know someone else who's
been through the same thing?

757
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:03,265
You care for everybody. You only
lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.

758
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:05,536
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

759
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:07,037
You're avoiding the question.

760
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,892
I like damaged people, remember?

761
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,348
Explains everything I do.

762
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:13,013
Almost everything.

763
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,063
Wasn't you, was it?

764
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,797
- Does it matter?
- No, but it'd be interesting.

765
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:24,448
Sorry to disappoint you. Sometimes
the answers just aren't that simple.

766
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:31,974
I know he can be a real ass.

767
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,823
And he has no problem
lying when it serves him.

768
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:37,877
But he's not lying about the pain.
He needs the medication,

769
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,416
which is why I prescribed it.

770
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:40,873
All of it.

771
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:41,914
I see

772
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,706
a lot of cases where

773
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,949
people who have real injuries

774
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:49,026
end up getting addicted.

775
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:51,745
And then, well...

776
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:53,576
Things kind of

777
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,487
spiral out of control.

778
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,358
And lives get ruined.
And not just their own.

779
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,559
Uh, I don't know what else to tell you.

780
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,166
- What about these? - This is getting--

781
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,562
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

782
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:22,563
- You sure? - Yeah.

783
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:25,493
Because the signatures on these

784
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,617
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

785
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,959
- You look surprised. - No, I'm just--

786
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:45,026
I haven't thought about it.
I do sign my name differently sometimes.

787
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,491
- Are you sure? - Yeah,

788
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:55,466
I just-- I guess I get
bored signing it the same way.

789
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,067
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

790
00:40:58,752 --> 00:40:59,702
I'm gonna give you

791
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,143
a moment...

792
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,270
to reconsider

793
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,310
that answer.

794
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:08,302
Because if you are,

795
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:09,743
for some reason,

796
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:11,182
mistaken...

797
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:14,487
we will find out.

798
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:17,404
And that will not be good for you.

799
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:19,685
Or Dr. House.

800
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,974
I am sure. Absolutely.

801
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:29,137
All right.

802
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,325
I guess that's it then.

803
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:47,087
- Thank you for your help.
- Okay, no problem.

804
