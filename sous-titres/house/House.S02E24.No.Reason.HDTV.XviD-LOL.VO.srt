1
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:09,892
He's got a temperature of 103.

2
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:11,693
And why do we care?

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,762
Because we're human beings.
It's what we do.

4
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:17,178
He said he was
at a luncheon memeeting.

5
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:18,680
You took his history?

6
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,931
Guy looks like Harpo.
You should see him.

7
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:24,244
You asked him what book
he's currently reading.

8
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:26,398
It's hilarious to
watch him try and talk.

9
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:28,540
I asked him
anything I could think of.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,001
Favorite color:

11
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,227
"Bwoo."

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,018
Favorite dessert topping?

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,594
Trust me, you never know
what fact may prove the key
to saving your life.

14
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,742
Whipped cweam.

15
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,780
House:
I asked him if he was sure.

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,092
Where are you going?

17
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:48,553
You're an ass.

18
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,492
I know.
Where are you going?

19
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:53,862
This is either a toxin,
an infection, or an allergic reaction.

20
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,970
I assume you gave him epi,
so that rules out allergies.

21
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:58,372
Put him on antibiotics
in case it's an infection.

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,582
And if it's a toxin,
we'll keep him here overnight,

23
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:02,582
let the swelling go down,
send him home.

24
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:04,473
I'm going to the movies.

25
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,501
Which one of you is House?

26
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,600
The skinny brunette.

27
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,483
No, that's Dr. Cameron.

28
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:16,481
I'm skinny.
How do you know her name?

29
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,163
I was a patient of yours.

30
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,581
Oh, well, if you want to leave
the chocolates downstairs--

31
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,032
Bang!

32
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,032
Stay!
Stay away from him.

33
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,983
Shocking, isn't it?

34
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,813
Who'd want to hurt you?

35
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,430
Bang!

36
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:45,163
2X24 - No Reason

37
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:10,620
Original Airdate (FOX): 23 MAY-2006

38
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,310
You're pathetic.

39
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:45,303
Judging by the growth,
I'd say I've been unconscious
for two days.

40
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,950
- Have you been sitting
there the whole time?
- No.

41
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,830
Judging by the oily buildup
in your hair, I'd say you're lying.

42
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:54,341
I was scared.
Pardon me for caring.

43
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,831
Did I lose any organs?

44
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,612
The bullet to your abdomen
pierced your stomach,

45
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,370
nicked the bowel,
lodged in the posterior rib.

46
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,643
Well, I always say,
if you're gonna get shot,
do it in a hospital.

47
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,602
The one in your neck--

48
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:08,602
I don't remember that one.

49
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,760
Went right through,
severed your jugular.

50
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,603
- The shooter turns out
to be a guy who--
- Don't care.

51
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:17,860
You don't care why a guy walked
into a hospital and shot a doctor?

52
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,040
Shot you?

53
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,643
I assume
his reasoning was faulty.

54
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,520
So what was it?
Infection?

55
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:25,680
The surgery went fine.

56
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,810
- You've had no post-op--
- Not me. Patient.

57
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,482
- Harpo.
- You just got shot, House.

58
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,550
You should rest.

59
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:35,623
I got shot.
Diagnostically boring.

60
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:40,042
Big fat tongue, on the other hand...
endlessly entertaining.

61
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,982
We biopsied his tongue.

62
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:44,263
House:
And it was negative.

63
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:47,503
And the blood tests were negative.

64
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:49,360
I didn't say
we did blood tests.

65
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,013
You don't biopsy a tongue
unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

66
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:56,793
And you don't have to biopsy a tongue
unless you've already come up with
nothing on a routine battery of tests

67
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,392
which don't involve
torturing your patient.

68
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:03,812
Any new symptoms?
Other than the increased
intracranial pressure?

69
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,212
Any guesses on how
I figured that one out?

70
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,623
You knew the next step
would be a lumbar puncture.

71
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:15,380
A lumbar puncture would almost
certainly give us a definitive answer.

72
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:18,271
Since we don't have a definitive answer,
we must not have done an LP,

73
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:22,312
and the most common
reason to not do an LP is
increased intracranial pressure.

74
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,803
He was shot by security trying to--

75
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:31,000
House, what are you--

76
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,062
House.

77
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,961
I'm talking to Cuddy.

78
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:36,641
Lie down.
You've got to be in pain.

79
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,123
Not today.
Today I'm on morphine.

80
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,471
You're going to rip your stitches out.

81
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,460
- Check Harpo's trash.
- Forget about the patient.

82
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,493
Come on.
You're curious.

83
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,863
T rash?

84
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:54,160
You don't know
what I'm talking about,
but you know it's good.

85
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,972
You can't just be walking around.

86
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:56,892
Well, then stop me.

87
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,540
- You've lost blood--
- Physically stop me.

88
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,150
- You could damage--
- You can't.

89
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:02,120
Because that would involve
physically touching me,

90
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:04,913
and then things would
get so sexually charged--

91
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,941
I'm twice your size.
Get your hands off me.

92
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,033
Everything that lives, eats.
Everything that eats, poops.

93
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,513
That's why every organ has
a sanitation department.
The lymph system.

94
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,811
Whatever's doing the damage
is dumping its waste in there.

95
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,540
That's what you meant by trash.

96
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:32,590
Biopsy the lymph node
under the jaw.

97
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,530
I'm sorry,I know it's crazy,
but there's no other place.

98
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:46,351
It's the ICU. It stands for intensive care.
He needs intensive care, so do you.

99
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,663
He needs to be shot again.

100
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:51,113
He is handcuffed to his bed.
He is sedated.
He's not going to hurt you.

101
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:54,202
If your security was any good,
I wouldn't have been shot
in the first place.

102
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,171
He is where
he's supposed to be.

103
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,293
- Where you're supposed to be--
- Who did my surgery?

104
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,562
Gillick, why?
You going to send him
a fruit basket?

105
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:01,610
He screwed up.

106
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,652
It's annoying enough dealing
with your Vicodin habit.

107
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,592
Quit upping your morphine.

108
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,151
I'm not.

109
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,561
I'm reducing it.

110
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:14,752
And you're not in pain?

111
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,603
I'm feeling better.

112
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,420
Gillick is very good.
Your recovery time--

113
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:25,220
My stomach kills me,
my neck is throbbing,
but my leg feels better.

114
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,660
- That's amazing.
- It's unbelievable.

115
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,693
Since getting shot is not
an FDA approved treatment
for anything,

116
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:36,360
it means something must have
gone wrong in the surgery.

117
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:41,673
Yes, terribly... tragically wrong.
Enjoy the mistake.

118
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,893
He must have nicked something
in my peripheral nervous system.

119
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,063
If it's alleviating pain,
who knows what else it's doing?

120
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:53,393
Get back to the ICU
before you rip out your stitches,
and I have to chain you to your bed.

121
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:17,443
Why did you try to kill me?

122
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,073
I didn't.

123
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,931
Then the gun thing
might have been a mistake.

124
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,430
If I'd have killed you,
it would have been over.

125
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,542
I needed you to live.

126
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,262
Because I want
to see you suffer.

127
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:53,071
[Moriarty  groans out]

128
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,981
Get the needle out of there.
[Alarm starts beeping]

129
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,713
He can't breathe.

130
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,273
House.

131
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,160
The test was negative.

132
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:24,570
Are you sure
you want to be doing this?

133
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm fine. I think.

134
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,342
Cameron,
you got my records?

135
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,563
They don't like to release
patient's operative notes.

136
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,591
And yet you're holding them.

137
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,403
And whispering.

138
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,233
He's sleeping.

139
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,652
Yeah.
Killer needs his rest.

140
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,810
Otherwise
he's grumpy all day.

141
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:45,210
Hey! Wake up!

142
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,760
Watch me save a life.

143
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,232
Almost for sure
it's some sort of infection.

144
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,557
We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics,
but it's not even slowing the thing down.

145
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:58,048
Unless we figure out what type of infection,
we can't treat, and we can't figure out
what type because we can't do an LP.

146
00:08:58,349 --> 00:08:59,844
Do an LP.

147
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,393
See what I did there?
Couldn't have done that
if you'd killed me.

148
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:05,722
We would have done an LP
2 days ago if we could have.

149
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:07,292
But that much pressure,
something's bound to go--

150
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:11,463
We would have done an LP 2 days ago
if the risks hadn't so obviously
outweighed the benefits.

151
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,920
We just cut a hole in his throat.
The equation has changed.

152
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:19,210
Couldn't have put it better myself.

153
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:31,850
Pressure...
120 millimeters H2O,

154
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,693
with small visible excursions
related to respiration and pulse.

155
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:39,402
- Well within normal, that's good.
- No, that's weird.

156
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,911
You want to hear a story?

157
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:53,400
I have a rule.

158
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:58,150
- People who shoot me
forfeit the right--
- My wife was sick.

159
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:04,081
- None of the doctors could figure out why.
- Oh, I know this story.

160
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:06,910
She died.

161
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:11,892
So you selected one of her doctors to kill,
because that wouldmake everything right again.

162
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:15,551
She lived.
You cured her.

163
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:19,453
I'm truly sorry I did that.

164
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,091
In the course of
investigating her illness,

165
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:26,922
you convinced me that
everything was relevant.

166
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:29,101
You needed the truth.

167
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,911
I confessed to you
that I'd had an affair.

168
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:40,743
But it turns out that it had nothing
to do with why she was sick.

169
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:45,660
Genetic predisposition
to brain aneurysms.

170
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,001
You told her that.

171
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:53,853
You also told her
about my affair.

172
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:57,920
And you caught crap,
she left you,

173
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:03,401
and now I've got to pay
because you couldn't keep
your little killer in your pants.

174
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,632
She killed herself.

175
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,270
What sort of hospital
has glass walls?

176
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,340
That's my husband.

177
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:43,321
Really?

178
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,720
You thought
I just liked watching people
get needles poked in the back?

179
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:52,430
Nope.
I figured a coworker
or a sister. Not wife.

180
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,081
Why?

181
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,861
Don't worry.
It's not insulting.

182
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,871
At least not to you.

183
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,670
You're satisfied
by that answer?

184
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,521
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

185
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:08,011
You're not going to
shoot me, are you?

186
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,202
You treated a friend of mine.

187
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:13,013
She told me
you only talk to people
if you have to.

188
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,651
And then you insult them
while showing off
how insightful you are.

189
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:19,510
Sevens marry sevens.

190
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,930
Nines marry nines.
Fours marry fours.

191
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:27,742
Maybe there's some wiggle room
if there's enough money, or
somebody got pregnant.

192
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,212
But  you've got at least
3 points on your husband,

193
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:34,370
and your frock says
you didn't do it for the money.

194
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:37,141
And your breasts say that
you haven't had any kids.

195
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,132
So you figure my marriage
is a mathematical error?

196
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,973
Numbers don't lie.

197
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,903
We're having trouble finding out
what infection your husband has.

198
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,641
The most likely culprit is an STD.

199
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:53,102
You want to know
if I've had an affair with
someone closer to my integer.

200
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:56,261
And I have to tell you the truth,
or my husband will die.

201
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,971
Is your friend single?

202
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:59,103
No.

203
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,493
And I've always been faithful.

204
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,402
Wow. I would've bet money
something would go wrong.

205
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,343
Let's rotate him back.

206
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,392
He's  bleeding
into his ocular orbit.

207
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,433
LP wouldn't do this.

208
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,302
Lots  of pressure behind.
Gotta relieve it.

209
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:28,040
[Alarms starts beeping]

210
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,230
What's going on?
What--what are they doing?

211
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,171
I should go.

212
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:41,353
I seem to have torn my stitches.

213
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:54,973
You collapsed in the hall.

214
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,001
Tore your stitches.

215
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,212
I remember.
I was there.

216
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,951
How's your gut?
It's hurting?

217
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:03,223
You shoot the guy
who sold her the gun?

218
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:07,261
She locked herself in the garage,
and she started the car.

219
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:11,131
You shoot the guy who
sold her the garage door opener?

220
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:13,470
You're an ass.

221
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,952
That is a bold position to take,
given that I shot you.

222
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,891
The shooting just makes you an idiot.

223
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:22,123
You're an ass because you're
trying to wrap it in the flag,
like you did a good thing.

224
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:23,763
You're an assand a hypocrite.

225
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,522
You don't believe in rules.
You do whatever you think is right.

226
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,272
That's all I did.
You were my role model.

227
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,722
Watch out. You're
getting crumbs on the flag.

228
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:34,800
I didn't commit to honor her.
I didn't commit to never lie to her.

229
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,673
Well, if you'd kept your mouth shut,
she'd be alive, and you wouldn't be shot.

230
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,472
If you'd kept
your pistols in your pants--

231
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:45,051
It's my fault she's dead.
I know it.

232
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:49,892
But why can't you admit that
it's maybe just a little bit yours too?

233
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:55,062
That maybe it's
not just medical mistakes
that screw things up.

234
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,981
Here's how life works.

235
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:02,451
You either get to ask for an apology,
or you get to shoot people.

236
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,260
Not both.

237
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,212
House:
Infections don't make
your eyes pop out.

238
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,652
Chase:
We should get back. You're
supposed to be chained to your bed.

239
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,921
House:
I'm not done eating.

240
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,143
There's got to be some sort of
bleeding disorder.

241
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:18,563
This is really stupid.

242
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:23,713
Look, if my stitches pop out again,
I got 3 doctors to save me.

243
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:28,100
Could be some sortof weakness
in the lining of the ocular veins.

244
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,610
Okay, I'll be you guys.

245
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,100
[as Chase] No way, mate.
Too much blood to just be a vein.

246
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:38,651
[as Foreman] No way is he!
If it was an artery,
he'd still be bleeding.

247
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,291
[as Cameron]
Actually, he'd be dead.

248
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,180
He could have had a granuloma
in his sinuses that bled,

249
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:45,870
which could have been
caused by Wegener's.

250
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,633
I think the surgeon would have
noticed a giant growth while
they were sticking the eyeball back in.

251
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,383
Tongue and eyes are sick.
What about the nose?

252
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,802
It's right in between.
Why isn't it sick?

253
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,902
So it's not spreading.
It's got a common source.

254
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,440
Which can only be what?

255
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,011
The brain,
except the CT was clean.

256
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,803
Check the brain's trash,
see what it's hiding.

257
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,990
- The brain doesn't
have a lymph system.
- I know.

258
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,581
All its garbage just blows off,
gets caught in the snow fence
by the side of the road.

259
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:10,131
You're referring
to the blood-brain barrier.

260
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,460
What else?

261
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:13,721
Biopsy the barrier.

262
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:16,501
Wouldn't it be safer to make
a few educated guesses first?

263
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,553
Try some relatively
safe treatments?

264
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:21,973
Biopsy the barrier. But first,
start him on mebendazole
in case it's a worm.

265
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:25,653
And levofloxacin
in case it's an infection that
slipped by the first antibiotic.

266
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:28,072
And azithromycin for STDs.

267
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,343
I really don't think the wife is
the kind to be messing around.

268
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,680
If I was married to her,
I certainly wouldn't--

269
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,422
House.
The patient isn't married.
He's a widower.

270
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:48,043
Really, it's more helpful
if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.

271
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,183
My body is fine.

272
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,832
My mind, on the other hand...

273
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,290
Maybe she was a girlfriend.

274
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:56,512
Maybe she was just trying
to jerk you around.

275
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:58,843
I spoke to every one
of the nurses on that floor.

276
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,853
The patient had only had 6 visitors.
Two females, no babes.

277
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:02,981
His mother and his aunt.

278
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,180
So they missed someone.
They're not security.

279
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:08,813
My posse never saw her or me
talking on the other side of the glass.

280
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,903
They were a little busy
trying to save the guy's life.

281
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,052
There's only one
possible conclusion.

282
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:16,033
It was a hallucination.

283
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,991
What does that look like to you?
Point-six?

284
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,902
Anesthesia? No.
It's got to be six and a smudge.

285
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,071
Let's say you're right.

286
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:28,231
It wouldn't be
that uncommon after trauma.
After that much blood loss?

287
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:31,851
If my perceptions are compromised,
then my judgmentis compromised.

288
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:36,211
What if his wife told me
that the patient just got bit
by a rabid Vietnamese leper?

289
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,911
So pull yourself off the case.

290
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,032
And the next case?

291
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:41,521
You take two weeks.
You recover.

292
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,182
What if I don't?

293
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:44,943
What if it wasn't the shooting?

294
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:50,440
The guy who sees connections
between everything sees no connection
between being shot and minor brain disruptions?

295
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:51,723
What if it was the surgery?

296
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,713
What if it was the fact that
you tore out your stitches
and lost two pints of blood?

297
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:02,322
Why did Gillick give me
ketamine during my surgery?

298
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,392
Working.

299
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,312
We need to talk.

300
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,172
Get back to the ICU.
Who un-cuffed you?

301
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:14,051
Why would a surgeon
administer ketamine?

302
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,143
Who showed you
your surgical file?

303
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,011
How do you know it's mine?

304
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:20,300
Because your patient hasn't had surgery,
and you don't care about anybody else.

305
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:23,851
My anesthesia was almost nonexistent,
and yet I wasn't awake.

306
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:29,013
For some reason, somebody decided
to put me in a dissociative coma
instead of just putting me out.

307
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:30,781
There are plenty of reasons to use--
- Fine.

308
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:34,162
I'll go beat the truth
out of my surgeon. Gillick, right?

309
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,693
It worked.

310
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:50,393
There's a clinic in Germany.

311
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,072
They've been treating
chronic pain by inducing comas,

312
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,373
and letting the mind
basically reboot itself.

313
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,463
There's about a 50% chance
your pain will come back.

314
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:03,322
Which of course means there is
a 50% chance that it won't.

315
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:07,181
- You had no right--
- To heal you?

316
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:10,332
- You messed with my brain.
- Why are you so upset?

317
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:14,692
Are you experiencing
any neurological symptoms?

318
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:17,160
Dizziness, tremors,
hallucinations?

319
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,572
No.

320
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,913
It's a point of principle.

321
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:29,321
- Test was negative.
- No trash against the fence.

322
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,561
Is your leg really better?

323
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,791
Don't worry, I'm sure
something else is wrong.

324
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,490
We did find blood.

325
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,731
- On which side?
- The wrong side.

326
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,133
First thing that makes sense.

327
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,382
The wrong side's the wrong side.
It can't make sense.

328
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:43,132
It'd mess with his brain.
Wouldn't cause fever.

329
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:46,662
- He's been sleeping a lot lately.
- You worried?

330
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,833
I marked a change of meds
on his chart.

331
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,203
Foreign object.

332
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,712
Body wants to get rid of it.
It causes the fever.

333
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:55,900
Blood's a foreign object?

334
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,950
In the brain lining, it is.
Blood dyscrasia means cancer.

335
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,821
Find it.

336
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,861
- All the tests--
- Have been negative.

337
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:05,143
What do you do
if your trash cans are full?

338
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,603
You use your neighbors' trash cans.

339
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,773
Except it's still light outside.
Your neighbor will see you.

340
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:14,442
So you go out the back way,
into an alley, and drop off
your trash by their garage.

341
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:17,112
We'll check
the lymphatic system in the chest.

342
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,083
You got that from
trash cans in the alley?

343
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:24,280
The saliva glands from the tongue are
connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs.

344
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,551
It's the next lymphatic system over.

345
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,530
Yeah.

346
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:32,140
Go get lung lymph.

347
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,590
How did he know that?

348
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:45,622
I wouldn't have hired him
if he wasn't smart.

349
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:46,923
Right.

350
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,792
Because you have
nothing but respect for him.

351
00:20:52,936 --> 00:21:01,862
Maybe he knew the answer
because the question wasn't
nearly as trickyas you thought.

352
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,682
Maybe he's not getting smarter.

353
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,312
You're getting dumber.

354
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,761
You pretend
to buck the system.

355
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,992
Pretend to be a rebel.

356
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,291
You claim to hate rules.

357
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:42,363
But all you do is
substitute your own rules
for society's.

358
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:45,082
And it's a nice, simple rule.

359
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:53,550
Tell the blunt, honest truth
in the starkest, darkest way.

360
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:59,803
And what will be will be.
What will be should be.

361
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:04,940
And everyone else is a coward.

362
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,121
But you're wrong.

363
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:12,993
It's not cowardly
to not call someone an idiot.

364
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:17,990
People aren't tactful or polite
just because it's nice.

365
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:23,761
They do it because
they've got an ounce of humility.

366
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:31,090
Because they know that
they will make mistakes,

367
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,760
and they know that
their actions have consequences.

368
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:40,531
And they know that
those consequences are their fault.

369
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:53,740
Why do you want so bad
not to be human, House?

370
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,493
Oh, he's awake.

371
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,182
House, we need
to talk to you.

372
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,053
How the hell did you know
I was awake?

373
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,192
Your nostrils flare
when you sleep.

374
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:10,782
- No, they do not.
- Fine, I'm lying.

375
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:13,943
- Test was negative.
- You knew?

376
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,761
- Force of habit.
- Showed no cancer.

377
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:17,613
No reason why
he's got a fever of 103,

378
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,493
and no reason why
his tongue won't fit in his mouth.

379
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,653
He's post-op. Chase is
getting him up and around.

380
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:24,552
It's important that
you're up ASAP after surgery.

381
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,830
You think you can urinate?

382
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,153
It's getting bigger!

383
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:41,201
What, you're...
getting aroused?

384
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:45,782
No! Not that part.
Oh, God, it hurts.

385
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:49,342
It's not stopping. Aah!

386
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,280
Surgeons found
no evidence of a burst artery.

387
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,123
The blood had to
come from somewhere.

388
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:58,063
You took a shower in it.

389
00:23:58,598 --> 00:23:59,363
Trauma?

390
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:01,880
You think someone snuck in here
just to kick him in the jewels?

391
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,931
And poke out his eye,
and swell up his tongue?

392
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:05,962
Keep riding.

393
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:09,250
I got a bet with my physio
that I can do 100 klicks by Friday.

394
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,723
What  about blood
from the kidneys?

395
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,203
Kidneys drain into the bladder,
which drains into the ureter.

396
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,563
There's no way it would
mess with the scrotum.

397
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,671
Yeah.

398
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,480
Basic human anatomy.

399
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:27,962
Therefore, I think it's safe to assume
that the problem lies elsewhere.

400
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:30,640
But given that this case doesn't
make any kind of sense whatsoever,

401
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,783
maybe we should
even question the basics.

402
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,223
Maybe he's not human.

403
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:37,633
An anatomical defect
would seem more likely,
but let's not rule that one out.

404
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:43,261
Even more likely, he is human,
his anatomy is where it's supposed to be,
but he has testicular cancer.

405
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,753
Cameron:
We tested for cancer.

406
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,592
Foreman: We tested
the lymph system in his chest.

407
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:47,911
Chase:
Surgeons found no growth.

408
00:24:47,997 --> 00:24:51,243
Foreman:
Surgeons were just trying to
put everything back where it was.
They weren't doing an inventory.

409
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,783
May have been lucky.

410
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,780
If you don't catch
testicular cancer early, it kills.

411
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,353
- Probably eroded some vessel.
- Yeah, I know.

412
00:24:58,436 --> 00:25:00,221
The question is
why I didn't think of it.

413
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:03,153
Eyes popping out is
a rather odd presentation.

414
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,890
Sack blowing up,
on the other hand...

415
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:09,093
If you could think of everything yourself,
you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

416
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:11,020
I screwed up some basic anatomy.

417
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,422
And I missed connecting
a testicular explosion
with a testicular problem.

418
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:18,621
You think there's any way
I would have done that before
Cuddy messed with my brain?

419
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,751
She was trying to
help you, and it worked.

420
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:24,202
Yeah, I can run like the wind,
but I can't think.

421
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,881
And seeing as how I'm too old
to become a professional athlete,

422
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:29,660
it looks to me as if
she screwed me over big time.

423
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:35,861
You don't want
a healthy leg.

424
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,181
Oh, here we go.

425
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:40,023
If you've got a good life,
if you're healthy,
you've got no reason to bitch.

426
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:41,073
No reason to hate life.

427
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:44,182
Here's the flaw in your argument.
If I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life.

428
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,610
- I enjoy it.
- I didn't sayit was rational.

429
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:54,002
HIV testing is 99% accurate,
which means there are
some people who test positive

430
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:58,590
who live with their own impending doom
for months, or years, before
finding outeverything's okay.

431
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:02,792
Weirdly, most of them don't react
with happiness. Or even anger.

432
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,511
They get depressed.

433
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:08,772
Not because they wanted to die, but
because they've defined themselves
by their disease.

434
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:11,670
Suddenly, what made them
them isn't real.

435
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,830
I don't define myself
by my leg.

436
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:17,820
No, you have taken it
one step further.

437
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:24,402
The only way you could come to terms
with your disability was to somehow
make it mean nothing.

438
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,672
So you had to
redefine everything.

439
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:31,461
You have dismissed
anything physical.

440
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:35,920
Anything not coldly,
calculatingly intellectual.

441
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:38,542
Why are you protecting her?

442
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:45,380
Because she's done
nothing wrong.

443
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,592
You're completely comfortable
with what she did to me?

444
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,773
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

445
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,643
You agonize
over moral choices.

446
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:59,053
You're not completely
comfortable with anything until

447
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:02,812
you've taken days to get your head
around every possible side.

448
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:06,370
I've known
what she did for 6 hours.

449
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,502
How come you're acting
like you've known for days?

450
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,171
What do I have?!

451
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,241
- You're not sick.
- What do I have?!

452
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:16,230
- You need to calm down.
- I have my brain!

453
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:18,121
- And that's it!
- We were trying to help you.

454
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:21,303
Yeah, nobody tries
to screw up! They just do.

455
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,803
You were out of control.
You were shooting morphine--

456
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,842
I can make people better!

457
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,683
And you two decide to
trade that for jogging shoes.

458
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,133
If you're suffering from side effects,
then we can look at that--

459
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:34,841
You value the physical so much.
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

460
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,322
You're unbelievable.

461
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:47,371
Even when you're out of your mind
with anger and fear,
you still couch it in logical terms.

462
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:49,790
- Are you hallucinating?
- Yeah, I'm hallucinating!

463
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:51,753
No, I mean right now.

464
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,050
[Moriarty's voice]
Are you hallucinating?

465
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:57,863
How did you know I was...

466
00:27:57,997 --> 00:27:59,853
You were yelling at me.

467
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,543
You were calling me Wilson.

468
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:04,063
No.

469
00:28:04,358 --> 00:28:06,532
You're losing it, House.

470
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,960
I never call Wilson by his name.

471
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:13,141
Oh, yeah, right.
The hallucinator is going to tell
the hallucinatee what happened.

472
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,793
You're not the hallucinatee.
Wilson was the hallucinatee.

473
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,740
You think maybe you're focusing
on the wrong thing here?

474
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:21,153
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.
The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

475
00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:24,131
Bathroom. It figures.

476
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:26,273
What figures?

477
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:29,741
You wet your bed.

478
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,161
Damn it.

479
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,372
Test was negative.

480
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:37,092
No.

481
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:40,340
AFP and Beta HCG
say no testicular cancer.

482
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,230
So, let's recap.
We've just ruled out everything.

483
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:44,303
Which doesn't make sense.

484
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,510
So the answer has to be
something that doesn't make sense.

485
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:49,231
Do a cystoscopy.
Make sure he's human.

486
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:51,801
Test was negative.

487
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:53,601
For him being human?

488
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,473
Everything was right
where it's supposed to be.

489
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,153
All the tubes go
where they're supposed to go.

490
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,680
Most likely scenario is
some kind of bacterial prostatitis.

491
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:12,850
Hmm.

492
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:15,650
Find out
if his father hunched?

493
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,512
His father have
trouble peeing?

494
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,211
His father have sex
with his own mother?

495
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:25,632
If the answers to
any of these questions is yes,
assume you're right.

496
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,351
If the answers are no,

497
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:31,011
assume you're right, but
biopsy some prostate lymphs
just to be sure.

498
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:31,991
But...

499
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:36,192
Then we'd have to cut through his stomach.
And since he's clearly got a bleeding problem,

500
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:39,570
- this kind of surgery might--
- He doesn't clearly have anything.

501
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,350
How did I get here?

502
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,240
What are you talking about?

503
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:50,371
I was in the ICU.

504
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,883
And then I was coming down
these stairs with you guys.

505
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:58,281
What happened in between?

506
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,293
I don't remember
how I got here.

507
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,170
I'm taking myself off my case.

508
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:22,120
Your patient's in critical care.
He's had a fever unabated for two--

509
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:24,111
I'm losing my mind.

510
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,303
I'm having blackouts.

511
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:30,170
- You said you weren't having any--
- I lied.

512
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,270
If you are doing this to scare me,
you made your point.

513
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:36,841
Next time you get shot, I promise
to only treat the bullet wounds.

514
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,631
I'm off the case.

515
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,830
Why did you jump up
when I came in?

516
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:50,803
I thought you were
going to attack me again.

517
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,653
Again?

518
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:55,011
Yeah, you were in my face.

519
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:57,403
- You were--
- No, I wasn't.

520
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,220
- You came in here with Wilson and--
- That was a hallucination.

521
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,682
- No, you--
- Which means this is a hallucination.

522
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,921
How can I tell
what's real and what's not?

523
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,103
Everything looks the same.

524
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:30,073
Sounds the same.

525
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:32,963
Tastes the same.

526
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:38,701
Seems like
I'd be the last person
you'd want to ask.

527
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:40,282
Why not?

528
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:42,392
You're obviously not here.

529
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:43,823
I'm obviously not here.

530
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:47,801
Which means this is a creation of my mind,
which means I'm really just asking myself.

531
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:51,890
Well, if you're talking to yourself,
that's a lot of unnecessary explanation.

532
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:54,161
Hey, I'm trying to work this out.

533
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,952
That requires give and take,
even in my own mind.

534
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:00,082
What was the question?

535
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,262
How can I tell what's real?

536
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:03,981
Does it matter?

537
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,742
That doesn't sound like
something I'd ask.

538
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:12,800
All right. Your concern is that
if you act in the real world
based on information that's not real,

539
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,780
the results are
impossible to foresee.

540
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:15,713
With you so far.

541
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:19,443
But information is
incapable of harm in and of itself.

542
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:27,361
Ideas are neithergood nor bad, but
merely as useful as what we do with them.
Only actions can cause harm.

543
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:29,932
That sounds like me.

544
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:34,480
So you do nothing.
You refrain from taking any actions.

545
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:40,831
You continue to throw out your ideas
as you always would, but
if they're based on faulty assumptions,

546
00:32:41,348 --> 00:32:43,413
your team will point that out.

547
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:46,072
They won't do anything
that could hurt him.

548
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,570
So I trust my team.

549
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:53,643
Test was negative.

550
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:54,881
No blood in the prostate.

551
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:56,472
No structural abnormalities.

552
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:58,900
If something
doesn't make sense,

553
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:00,540
what does that mean?

554
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:03,032
It's not rhetorical.

555
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:07,022
I need your input on everything I ask,
no matter how obvious it might seem.

556
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,781
It means you're wrong.

557
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:11,871
It means one of
your assumptions is wrong.

558
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:15,512
Because if something doesn't
make sense, it can't be real.
So, what are our assumptions?

559
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,680
We don't have any.
We're just guessing on testing.

560
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,263
We assume
the tests are right.

561
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,111
We've already
redone them. Twice.

562
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,390
Let's go more basic.

563
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,550
What's more basic
than the test results?

564
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:26,211
The tests themselves.

565
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,431
What does a biopsy consist of?

566
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:30,492
You take a sample.

567
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,320
Define sample.

568
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:36,152
It's a small representative piece
of whatever you think is the problem.

569
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:38,640
House:
You go down to the shore,
you fill a cup of water.

570
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,881
It's got no fish in it.

571
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,323
Does that mean
no fish in the ocean?

572
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:44,270
- We can do another biopsy.
- We could fill another cup of water.

573
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,781
We gotta dive in. We gotta see
what's actually in there.

574
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:48,563
We can't operate.
He's got a bleeding problem.

575
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:50,050
We ASSUME
he's got a bleeding problem.

576
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:55,040
Yeah, because he bled from
where he wasn't supposed to bleed,
causing parts of his body to blow up.

577
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:58,923
Assuming that
crazy assumption is correct,
if we operate on him, we'll kill him.

578
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:04,180
What if we could find
a way to do this surgery

579
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,293
without giving him
more than a paper cut?

580
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:12,461
You want to let a robot
operate on me?

581
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:14,422
The technology is amazing.

582
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:17,532
It magnifies everything ten times.
It's ten times the accuracy.

583
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,591
No way. I want a person.

584
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,623
- A personwill be controlling--
- People suck.

585
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:29,501
People have turned you from a guy with
a swollen tongue into a guy with one eye,
one ball, and a stapled-on face.

586
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:34,582
If you want someone to hold you
while you cry yourself to sleep at night,
choose warm and soft.

587
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:38,573
If you want
someone to write you a poem,
pick the sensitive loner.

588
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:42,033
But if all you care about is that
something's done right,
pick the guy with the metal head.

589
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:42,993
No way.

590
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,170
No way, no way.

591
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,162
You gotta see this thing in action
before you say no way. Come on.

592
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,232
House.
What are you doing?

593
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:52,181
Nothing.

594
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:55,651
I'm not doing anything.
Just throwing out ideas.

595
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:58,780
I think
you should put him in a wheelchair,
take him down to the O.R.

596
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,621
But I may be out of my mind.

597
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:12,123
Relax, Cameron.

598
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,091
I'm not going to cut you.

599
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:17,123
I just want to show
what this puppy can do.

600
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:20,400
It can make
1mm incisions.

601
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:22,621
You know how small that is?

602
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:25,102
It's small even in metric.

603
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:31,740
If I do something
that doesn't make sense,
even to you, stop me.

604
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,952
Delicate, no?

605
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,683
House.

606
00:36:18,395 --> 00:36:19,963
Does that hurt?

607
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,543
Seen enough?

608
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,691
No.

609
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:32,081
That wasn't a question.

610
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:34,863
You either do this, or you die.

611
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:40,693
You've wasted your life.

612
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:42,091
Yeah.

613
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:47,620
If only I'd spent more time
dedicating myself to finding
someone worthy to shoot.

614
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,743
If I had killed you,
would it have mattered?

615
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:51,900
Not to me.

616
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:53,012
Have you got a pen?

617
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,811
You don't care
if you live or die?

618
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:56,972
I care because I live.

619
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:58,961
I can't care if I'm dead.

620
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,400
I don't want to
hear semantics.

621
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:04,391
You anti-semantic bastard.

622
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,550
Would anybody care that
the world lost that wit?

623
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:08,693
Working here.

624
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,822
That's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

625
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:13,913
Just let me soak
into your subconscious.

626
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:18,203
You think that
the only truth that matters

627
00:37:18,308 --> 00:37:20,500
 is the truth that
can be measured.

628
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,400
Good intentions don't count.

629
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:24,883
What's in your heart
doesn't count.

630
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:27,243
Caring doesn't count.

631
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:33,530
But a man's life can be measured by
how many tears are shed when he dies.

632
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:37,400
Just because
you can't measure them,

633
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:41,091
just because you don't
want to measure them,

634
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:44,803
doesn't mean it's not real.

635
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:52,841
That does not make sense.

636
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:58,953
And even if I'm wrong,
you're still miserable.

637
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:06,771
Did you really think that
your life's purpose was to sacrifice yourself
and get nothing in return?

638
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,253
No.

639
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:15,861
You believe there's
no purpose to anything.

640
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:18,901
Even the lives you save,
you dismiss.

641
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:27,130
You turn the one decent thing in your life,
and you taint it, strip it of all meaning.

642
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:36,851
You're miserable for nothing.

643
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:41,483
I don't know
why you'd want to live.

644
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,093
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,771
I know what's wrong.

646
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:28,723
House, get out of here.
You're not sterile.

647
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,210
He'll be fine.

648
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:33,700
Chase:
Great.

649
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:36,982
What's he got?

650
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:41,331
How come you guys have
never tried to yank me off this case?

651
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:45,151
I'm having hallucinations.
Blackouts.

652
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:49,493
But you're always insane,
and you're always right.

653
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:53,251
I'm almost always
eventually right.

654
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:56,980
You have no way of knowing
when "eventually" is.

655
00:39:57,376 --> 00:40:02,800
Every time I've had
an epiphany on this one,
you guys were right on board.

656
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:05,883
No challenges,
no need to explain.

657
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:10,332
No offense, but either
you guys are getting smarter,
or I'm getting dumber.

658
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,252
We've worked with you
long enough to know--

659
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:15,040
I know the test results
even beforeyou enter the room.

660
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,471
We have identical knowledge.

661
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:19,003
How is that possible?

662
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:19,891
You're wrong.

663
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:24,392
If something doesn't make sense,
one of your assumptions has to be wrong.

664
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:27,121
Because if something
doesn't make sense,
it can't be real.

665
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:32,963
But what if the faulty assumption
is that it's real?

666
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:36,150
House, you're losing it.

667
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,832
I've lost it.

668
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,732
Why did you stop me?

669
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,692
Because I think
you're going to kill him.

670
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,851
No, you don't think that.

671
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:49,123
You know it.

672
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,632
Because you're in my head.

673
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:55,633
As long as the delusion makes sense,
my mind lets it go on.

674
00:40:56,326 --> 00:40:59,330
I have to make it
not make sense. I have to... 

675
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,903
push it past the point
where it can trick my mind.

676
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,421
Hey, hey.

677
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:06,501
If this is a nightmare,
you're gonna wake up.

678
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:08,182
If it's real,
you're killing a man.

679
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:10,812
It's also possible that
I may already be dead.

680
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,603
But I don't believe
in the afterlife.

681
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:14,681
House, go back to your room.

682
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:18,071
If this is a hallucination,
it's a good one.
You're pain free, you can walk--

683
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,953
It's not real.
Therefore, it's meaningless.

684
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:22,853
I want meaning.

685
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:27,822
[Alarms start beeping]

686
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:38,442
[Monitors flatlining]

687
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:08,152
Oh, God.

688
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,503
Goodbye.

689
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,221
- Foreman: He was shot.
- Twice.

690
00:42:45,305 --> 00:42:46,930
Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.

691
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:47,992
Hello.

692
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:50,420
It's going to be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

693
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,841
You don't know nothing.

694
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:55,150
Tell Cuddy...

695
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:58,330
I want ketamine.
