1
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,195
Fran?

2
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:25,046
- I'm Robin.
- Please come in.

3
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,513
Cute home.

4
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,064
- Two bedroom, one bath?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,731
A guy I know collects those.

6
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,511
He says they're worth
a fortune on the internet.

7
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:40,462
Yeah.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,270
You've never used our agency before,
have you?

9
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:45,766
Is it that obvious?

10
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,980
As you can see,
we offer a full range of services.

11
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:01,398
- "Round the world"?
- Our Deluxe package.

12
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,158
Offers all the services of A, B, and C.

13
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:09,696
How much?

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,826
$1,000. And satisfaction's guaranteed.

15
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:14,369
Twice.

16
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,098
- I'll get the money.
- I'll get ready.

17
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:31,319
Harrington?

18
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,409
What are you doing up there?

19
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:39,712
All right, now.

20
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:42,079
Don't take this personally,
but you're gonna have to go...

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,030
Fran?

22
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,792
Is this okay?

23
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:05,723
Are you all right?

24
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,066
Oh, God.

25
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:44,573
Yeah, I... I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

26
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,958
I don't know. My... friend collapsed.

27
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:56,276
Transcript: swsub.com
Sync: jh26

28
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,086
And what were you
doing when you fainted?

29
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,068
- We were just...
- Looking for her cat.

30
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,765
And have you banged your head recently?

31
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,716
No.

32
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:41,533
Is this a motion sickness patch?

33
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,867
I must've forgotten to take it off.
I just got back from a trip.

34
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:48,812
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,079
You probably hit your head when
you fell and that caused the blackout.

36
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,080
I thought those patches were supposed
to prevent you from getting sick.

37
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,469
Every drug has a side effect.
But it might be a good idea

38
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,343
to keep your eye on her for the
next few hours to make sure she's okay.

39
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,957
- Oh, actually I...
- She has to get back to work.

40
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,330
Is it important?

41
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,566
We just don't like people
to be alone after they leave here.

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,608
I'm fine. Really, I'm...

43
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,386
I got a seizure. Code cart!

44
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,779
- What's wrong with her?
- I have no idea.

45
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,413
Where's House?

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,785
Antique vintner's cane. It cost me $900.

47
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:37,248
It had a corkscrew in it.

48
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,452
Ah, that would explain
the "vintner's" reference.

49
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,753
Could be used as a
weapon against the pilot.

50
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:43,838
Only if you stuck it
in a bottle of Zinfandel.

51
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,564
You'll get it back when we land.

52
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,412
I want my blankie!

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,675
Give her 20 milligrams of antihistamine.
It could save her life.

54
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,453
Cause if she doesn't shut up,
I'll kill her.

55
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,810
Delivering good will
to yet another continent.

56
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,358
You only forced me to deliver a speech,
not good will.

57
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,959
You gave a three-minute speech.

58
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,864
You know how much WHO accreditation
means to the hospital?

59
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,733
May have been short, but it had girth.

60
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:07,475
And the room service
thing was just spiteful.

61
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,221
- I was hungry.
- $300 for a bottle of wine.

62
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,825
- I was thirsty.
- $120 on video services.

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,910
I was lonely.

64
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,845
That's $500 in expenses I can't justify.

65
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,829
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

66
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:21,934
Right.

67
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:29,255
Welcome aboard.
Mr. House, you're right here in 2A.

68
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:34,327
Ms. Cuddy, you're in the
next cabin and to the left, 9C.

69
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:38,119
No, I booked two first-class tickets.
This must be a mistake.

70
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,771
No mistake.
Just arranged for a $500 fare reduction.

71
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,699
Expense problem solved.

72
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:51,831
Where did you travel?

73
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,156
Duluth. To visit my sister.

74
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:55,761
Really?

75
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,618
Is this her artwork?

76
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,375
Fire... butt?

77
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:05,794
I was a little drunk.

78
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,244
Where were you a little drunk?

79
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,262
I turned 58 last March.
Same age my mother was when she died.

80
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:23,012
Next week I packed a bag.
I went to JFK. Looked at the big board.

81
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:26,022
Took the first plane
that went to a warm place.

82
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:28,493
Caracas.

83
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:29,809
Oh, my God.

84
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,551
Did you drink the water?
Eat salads? Any raw foods?

85
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:33,955
Yup.

86
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,331
And?

87
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:44,879
I also did mescal shooters, and snorted
cocaine from a homosexual man's stomach.

88
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,728
- Did you have sex?
- No.

89
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:52,685
Not with him.

90
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,712
I had sex with El Gordo.

91
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,827
- He was a large man.
- Oh, my God.

92
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,248
I never do things like that.

93
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,755
I should have gone to visit my sister.
It was stupid.

94
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,971
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

95
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:17,132
It's... possible.

96
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,643
Here you are. Rib eye, medium rare.

97
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:30,819
Thank you.

98
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,020
Some more Pinot Grigio?

99
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,804
Uh, no. I think I
will switch to the Syrah.

100
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,362
- Sir, are you all right?
- He's drunk.

101
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,167
See?

102
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,921
Does anyone speak Korean?

103
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,086
Is anyone a doctor?

104
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,199
Yes.

105
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:20,484
I'll go get her.

106
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,289
What do you want?

107
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:47,136
Did you really think I was gonna
leave you stuck back here for 18 hours?

108
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,111
Go on. Enjoy.

109
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,581
The Vicodin and the wine.
I could sleep anywhere.

110
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:58,902
Thank you.

111
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,782
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

112
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,351
She can't wear motion sickness
patches for the rest of her life.

113
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,884
No, but if it does relieve her symptoms,
it'll narrow down our search.

114
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:14,630
Anything else you two
guys want to agree on?

115
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:17,657
- You have a problem with us agreeing?
- No, I have a problem with the other

116
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,368
thing you're doing which makes
me question your motive for agreeing.

117
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,087
I'll put her back on the patch.
What else?

118
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,638
It's got to be something neurological.

119
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,540
We should do a CT and
look for a brain tumor.

120
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,715
It can also be an allergy or something
environmental. We should check her home.

121
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:31,136
Bit more likely she got sick
in Caracas than in New Jersey.

122
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,505
Right, I forgot there
are no toxins in the U.S.

123
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,757
I think I'm starting
to feel sorry for House.

124
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:40,141
Get a tox screen, chem 20, STD panel,
blood cultures, then you run a CT,

125
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:41,712
and you check her house.

126
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:44,394
Please.

127
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,160
- Not funny.
- Wasn't supposed to be funny "ha ha."

128
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:58,133
Fever, headache, severe abdominal pain,
and a rash all over his lower back.

129
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,588
It's serious. It may be contagious.

130
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,366
We just attended
a symposium on pandemics

131
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:07,448
and you run right into one on the
flight home. Talk about a small world.

132
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,360
If it's meningoccus, half the passengers
on this plane could get infected

133
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,061
and die before we reach New York.

134
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,088
- Is someone sick?
- No.

135
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:17,069
Someone has a hangover.

136
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,724
He had a snoot-load of
Bloody Marys before dinner.

137
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,635
Watch the movie.

138
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:29,766
That booze did not give him the rash.
It is textbook meningoccus.

139
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,184
It's also textbook allergic
reaction to pollen, peanuts,

140
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:36,218
semen-stained polyester
blanket he's lying on.

141
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,913
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

142
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,373
We have to turn around.

143
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,970
What? Why do we have to turn ar...?

144
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,537
We don't. You misunderstood.

145
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:44,960
Dr. Cuddy just meant

146
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,414
that he might feel less nauseous if
he was facing in a different direction.

147
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,511
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

148
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:52,530
We're about to head over the North Pole.

149
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,323
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

150
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,248
He'll be fine. I'm a doctor too.

151
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:58,860
You haven't examined him.

152
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:03,392
Korean male, mid-thirties, 5'9, 160,
bald, scar on the right side of his jaw,

153
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,828
medic alert bracelet
on his left wrist indicating

154
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:07,853
that he is allergic to at least,
penicillin.

155
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:10,962
Without any way to do an LP,
or rule out meningoccus,

156
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,142
our only choice is to assume the worst.

157
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,182
Good point.

158
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,144
On the other hand,

159
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,983
I am a board certified
specialist in infectious disease.

160
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,367
She assigns parking spaces.

161
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,264
Please let me know if he gets any worse.

162
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,439
Think we should feed the cat?

163
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,204
Bowl's full.
If he wants it, he can get it.

164
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,080
Cadmium yellow?

165
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,134
Heavy metal poisoning would
explain the ataxia and the seizures.

166
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,435
Not unless she was
painting with her tongue.

167
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:58,557
Is Foreman right? Did you agree
with me because of our relationship?

168
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:01,536
- Relationship?
- You know what I mean.

169
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:04,231
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship?

170
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,745
I mean because we're having sex.

171
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:11,251
Yes, Foreman's right. I thought you were
completely wrong about the medicine,

172
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,502
but agreed with you anyway,

173
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,553
because I figured then you'd
do me in some old lady's home.

174
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,861
Then well played.

175
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:22,394
Come on, we're supposed
to be looking for toxins.

176
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,312
We agreed it was a brain tumor. What?

177
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,965
He's watching.

178
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,867
Haven't you had anybody watch before?

179
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:55,245
- Is that guy really sick?
- No, he's all better.

180
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:56,639
I don't believe you.

181
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,384
Look that way.

182
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:01,956
Why?

183
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,757
Cause you're gonna throw
up and I don't want it on me.

184
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,058
I'll get some towels.

185
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,585
Give her a banana. Monkey see,
monkey barf. You smell vomit...

186
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,997
Okay. I wasn't expecting that.

187
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,950
- I need help.
- Who doesn't?

188
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:42,912
I need someone to talk to.

189
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,519
Can you say...

190
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,937
- "Crikey, mate"?
- Crikey, mate.

191
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:55,792
Perfect. No matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

192
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:58,808
- O- kay.
- Nicely done.

193
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,812
You disagree with everything I say.

194
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,004
Sorry. Not understanding.

195
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,686
That's close enough.

196
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,843
And you... get morally
outraged at everything I say.

197
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,723
That's permanent marker, you know?

198
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:14,880
You guys are good.

199
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:20,128
We are looking for the simplest
way to explain these symptoms.

200
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:26,826
Organophosphate poisoning. Some
international flights spray pesticides.

201
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,058
Could be.

202
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,934
Sorry, English not so nice.

203
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:33,693
Is this a joke?

204
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,356
Just passed the halfway mark.

205
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:37,141
Can't turn around. Nice call.

206
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:38,273
No worries.

207
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,489
- We think it's pesticide poisoning.
- We don't spray these flights.

208
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,849
- Dramine overdose.
- Wouldn't explain the fever.

209
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,143
- Jet lag.
- Wouldn't explain the abdominal pain.

210
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:48,464
- Deep vein thrombosis.
- Wouldn't explain the nausea.

211
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:50,252
Food poisoning. What was on the menu?

212
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,086
Steak and sea bass in first class.

213
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,416
Fettuccini and seafood
kebabs in economy.

214
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,717
Since when does food
poisoning cause a rash?

215
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,182
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?

216
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,482
He had the sea bass.
Please tell me she had the kebabs.

217
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:02,979
I think so.

218
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,305
Ciguatera poisoning.
It's an instant onset toxin.

219
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:10,568
Symptoms include 'E' all of the above.

220
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:14,062
It's only found in certain
kinds of tropical game fish such as...

221
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:15,486
Sea bass?

222
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,770
Make sure you get a resume from him.

223
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,641
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

224
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,596
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief
announcement concerning your meals.

225
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:31,399
If you ate the sea
bass or the seafood kebabs,

226
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,251
you have ingested a dangerous toxin.

227
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:35,507
However,
if you proceed to the restrooms,

228
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:37,782
both on your left and right
and in the rear of the plane

229
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:41,211
and vomit as soon as possible,
the toxic effect should be minimal.

230
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,356
Thank you and have a pleasant flight.

231
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,326
- Meningoccus makes just as much sense.
- I know.

232
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:04,703
What'd you find?

233
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,027
Nothing in her house. Big waste of time.

234
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,692
- Medically.
- CT was a complete waste.

235
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,226
She was negative for tumors, her blood
was negative for drugs, heavy metals,

236
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:16,053
tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

237
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,371
Also no sign of lead
poisoning or sepsis.

238
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,810
Apparently, Venezuelan tattoo
parlors have standards after all.

239
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:22,939
Good to know.

240
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,215
We sure she's even sick?

241
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,424
Two more seizures in the last two hours.

242
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:31,225
Which is slower than she was having
them before you put the patch back on.

243
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:34,760
I'm an idiot.

244
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:38,311
She's exposed herself to so much crap,
I just assumed it was a zebra.

245
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,197
It's breast cancer.

246
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:43,549
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by motion sickness meds?

247
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,476
It's not. But the inflammation
caused by the paraneoplastic syndrome

248
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,447
caused by the cancer can
be reduced by anticholinergics.

249
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,153
Is he gonna die?

250
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,554
We're doing all we can.
We don't know what's wrong with him yet.

251
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:07,505
Am I gonna die?

252
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,160
No. Here, chew on these.

253
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:21,426
Good news is all the
pilots are red meat men.

254
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:25,437
Although I was kind of looking
forward to landing this puppy myself.

255
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:28,426
- Peng's getting worse.
- That makes sense.

256
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,810
First class ate before coach.

257
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,514
He digested more of
his food before he threw up.

258
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:37,139
Or you're wrong and we're gonna
start seeing neurological symptoms soon.

259
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,255
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

260
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,465
We're not gonna see ataxia.

261
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:47,227
- You're so sure you're right.
- No, it's just hard to show clumsiness

262
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,797
when you're lying moaning
in the fetal position.

263
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:57,633
Stand up!

264
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:02,087
- Nobody speak Korean on this flight?
- I assumed you did.

265
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:04,060
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18.

266
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,711
I don't think that's gonna help.

267
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:06,975
Stand up!

268
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,236
Don't play the cripple card with me.

269
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,864
I'm leaving.

270
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:39,006
Work.

271
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,309
Important client.

272
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,010
Sure.

273
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,980
Listen...

274
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:54,841
are you close?

275
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,750
Why?

276
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:01,020
She needs a mammogram.

277
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:03,811
Oh, God.

278
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,973
I know I'm throwing a lot at you.

279
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,350
She just has no family in town.

280
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:12,593
And I really think she
could use a friend right now.

281
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,208
Okay, put your hand here.

282
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,057
You don't have to stay.

283
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,594
No, it's... no problem.

284
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,624
But why?

285
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,626
You don't even know me.

286
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,173
You gotta be scared.

287
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,257
- I almost hope it's breast cancer.
- No.

288
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,458
- Then it wouldn't be my fault.
- Whatever it is, it's not your fault.

289
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,137
That's not true.

290
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,251
You can control things.

291
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:57,193
Not everything.

292
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,785
But you don't have to take stupid risks.

293
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,940
- I was being an idiot.
- You were having fun.

294
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,616
You have regrets?

295
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,372
Yeah.

296
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,024
Robin.

297
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:25,294
Hold still.

298
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:31,714
Good.

299
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,243
Okay, we're gonna get just one more.
Sorry, I know it hurts.

300
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:38,472
It's not that.

301
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,407
It's my eye.

302
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,071
My right eye, I...

303
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,736
I can't see.

304
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,764
It's definitely ataxia.
It's definitely a rash.

305
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,586
You want to look at it for
five more minutes before concluding

306
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,602
it's also definitely a leg.
- Thin leg. It's been in a cast.

307
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:59,905
- So?
- So it could be radiation poisoning.

308
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:02,414
- From a broken leg?
- From the X-rays they took of it.

309
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:03,871
He could break every bone in his body

310
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:06,343
and still not have enough
X-rays to cause radiation sickness.

311
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:09,469
Unless those X-rays were
performed in "Wankoff", North Korea

312
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,250
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

313
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,165
Which accounts for the absence of fur.

314
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,498
Radiation poisoning accounts
for all the symptoms.

315
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:19,899
I have hair. I haven't had
an X-ray since I got my teeth whitened.

316
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:21,097
You're pregnant.

317
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:22,927
I'm what?

318
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,800
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever.

319
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,327
And why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

320
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:31,000
- And her rash?
- PUPPS.

321
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,990
- A common pregnancy rash.
- I can't be pregnant.

322
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:36,036
- You a virgin?
- No, but...

323
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,651
You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

324
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,939
Let's get him into the chair.

325
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:43,176
Two different diagnoses.

326
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,299
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

327
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,550
I believe in statistics.

328
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:48,937
200 passengers on the plane.

329
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,207
10 should be gay,
two should be with child,

330
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,763
and one should be incredibly
annoying with an extra ass chromosome.

331
00:21:57,158 --> 00:22:00,608
Get him some iodized salt to
protect his thyroid. I'm going back...

332
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,145
You're wrong.

333
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:25,312
I said we should've turned back.
You should have listened to me.

334
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,219
Now we're eight miles over the Arctic...

335
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,520
I'm trying to listen to you now,
so shut up.

336
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,968
Heart's fine.

337
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,231
Breasts are firm.

338
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:40,293
Is it contagious?
A lot of the passengers are scared.

339
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:42,082
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

340
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,612
- Is there something to worry about?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:48,447
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

342
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,559
Get me a flash light.

343
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,088
Cover your left eye with this.

344
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:07,608
Photophobia!

345
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,982
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

346
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,183
I'll call down to the pharmacy.

347
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,511
You're creeping me out.

348
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,094
Then get me a lab.

349
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:23,862
Pseudomonas smell yeasty.
Staph smells musty.

350
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:27,066
Some liver diseases smell of ammonia.

351
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:29,698
House, I'm not in heat.

352
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:34,137
Citrusy on the nose,
with a blush of toasted coconut.

353
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:48,144
I need to get a better
look at your rash.

354
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,245
Use your imagination.

355
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:53,367
Fine, shall I go with lifeguard
Cuddy or Mother Superior Cuddy?

356
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,134
Three more passengers are sick.

357
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,389
If we don't get drugs, we're
gonna have a lot of dead passengers.

358
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:10,555
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not breast cancer.

359
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,299
- It's likely neurological.
- I just met her today.

360
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,705
- You should go.
- She needs someone here.

361
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,195
That's not your job.

362
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:54,902
Please let me know that she's okay.

363
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,094
- It's just sex.
- There's no such thing.

364
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,539
Other eye.

365
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,852
Are you saying women can't separate
the physical from the emotional?

366
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:11,899
No one does it well. Women do it worse.

367
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,378
You just want us to stop,
because you think it's affecting...

368
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,693
Me. Yeah.

369
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,667
- Polyspikes over 01 and 02.
- That's her left eye.

370
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,134
Burst suppression on every lead.

371
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:33,899
She's comatose.

372
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,086
Nothing...

373
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,636
Come on, nobody has no meds.

374
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,142
Excuse me.

375
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,294
Open your mouth.

376
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:55,038
- Where is the acyclovir?
- I'm not on any meds.

377
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,754
Well, you'd better get some.
You've got herpes.

378
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:11,852
Oh, what do you know? He's got some.
This must be your lucky day.

379
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,533
This is for real! People are sick.

380
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,651
Some of us will be deplaning
in body bags unless you cough up.

381
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,934
Thank you... thank you.

382
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:28,499
God bless you.

383
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:32,014
Her brain is shutting down
because of intercranial pressure.

384
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:33,265
Or her nerves are dying.

385
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,980
Because of the increased pressure.
She has a bleed in her brain.

386
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,003
- You said the CT showed...
- No tumors.

387
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,276
But if she has an AVM leading
to a cerebral hemorrhage,

388
00:26:40,277 --> 00:26:42,861
we could have missed it.
She needs a burr hole to relieve...

389
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,071
You want to drill in her brain

390
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:46,672
because of an invisible
bleed the CT couldn't see?

391
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:49,180
We should do an LP to confirm
the presence of red blood cells.

392
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:51,735
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

393
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:55,065
Right, better to kill her in the OR.
Chase, what do you think?

394
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,270
Here's a cliffhanger.

395
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:02,272
I think it'd help to know what she has
before we start digging into her brain.

396
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:06,433
Might be better to
play it safe to start.

397
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:07,556
Do an LP.

398
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,923
Sex better be damn good.

399
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:21,968
Lotta apples, not many candy bars.

400
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,382
- Any antibiotics?
- Three caps of augmentin.

401
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:27,565
There are six patients.

402
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,511
Give them to Peng.

403
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,431
He's allergic to penicillin.

404
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:34,377
The first aid kit has two epi pens.

405
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,168
If he has a severe reaction, ten epi
pens won't save him, you take the pills.

406
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,919
- He's worse.
- He's a guy who doesn't speak English.

407
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,509
- Give him the meds.
- If it's not meningitis,

408
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,181
we're risking his life and
flushing meds down the toilet.

409
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:49,447
Then do an LP on him.
If it's clear, you win.

410
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:54,185
If it's cloudy, he gets the
augmentin and we risk a reaction.

411
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:56,556
Sounds like a plan.

412
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,191
Oh, except for the part
where we don't have an LP needle.

413
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:02,536
Oh, and the shaking of the plane means
I'll probably pierce his spinal cord

414
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:04,087
and cripple him for life, but,

415
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,678
I mean, it totally soundslike a plan.

416
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:08,692
You're right.

417
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:12,309
Let him die. Give me the meds.

418
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,221
Got it.

419
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:36,814
Damn.

420
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:39,248
- What is it?
- Shut up.

421
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,320
- Don't get hysterical.
- Just tell me what the hell it is.

422
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:48,369
We should have turned back.
We should have turned back!

423
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,414
Hold this.

424
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,155
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,203
we have a passenger with a
confirmed case of bacterial meningitis.

426
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:15,887
And even if we land as soon as possible,
the passenger will not survive.

427
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:19,515
It's very likely that some
of you have been infected as well.

428
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,884
As soon as you start feeling symptoms,

429
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:24,264
we need to isolate you
in the first class cabin.

430
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:28,681
Fever, rash,
nausea, and in the late stages...

431
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:31,787
tremor in the left hand.

432
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,158
I have that.

433
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,330
Oh, God.

434
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,135
No!

435
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,930
What do we do?

436
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:45,003
Break out the bubbly.

437
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,365
Yo! Listen up!

438
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,402
Bad news is you have an illness.
The good news is,

439
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:55,316
it's not meningitis.

440
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,120
It's not fatal.

441
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,231
It's just embarrassing.
It's conversion disorder.

442
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:03,257
Or commonly known as mass hysteria.

443
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:08,192
It happens often in high anxiety
situations, especially to women.

444
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,879
I know it sounds sexist, but

445
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:12,756
science says you're weak and soft,
what can I do?

446
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,072
House, you're wrong.

447
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,036
Look at my hand.

448
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:19,445
Yeah, look at her hand.
Shaking left hand.

449
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,732
What is that a symptom of?
Not meningitis.

450
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,722
It's basically a symptom of nothing.

451
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,050
She put the idea into their
head and watched it happen.

452
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,064
Same thing that Peng cruelly
did with the puking and the rash.

453
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:32,015
- The rash is in my head?
- Your mind controls your body.

454
00:31:32,652 --> 00:31:34,802
It thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

455
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:43,026
If... If you'll all just calm down,
your symptoms will soon go away.

456
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:46,520
And to facilitate this process, your
flight crew will move through the cabin

457
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,221
with a complimentary bar service.

458
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:52,259
Thank you and,
as always, have a pleasant flight.

459
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:02,715
- Still feel like puking?
- No.

460
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:15,323
How did you know?

461
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:17,787
LP was negative.

462
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:21,327
I came up with an alternate
theory and I tested it.

463
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:25,877
Couldn't have done it without you.
Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria.

464
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,513
Just one more thing to clean up.
Peng set off the mass hysteria.

465
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:33,171
What set off Peng?

466
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:38,215
- He really is dying.
- Yeah.

467
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:40,534
And I haven't the faintest idea why.

468
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,985
What's extension pastoring?

469
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,716
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

470
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:00,204
Do we really need these three?

471
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,514
Worried they'll make you look bad?

472
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,950
Could be symptomatic of head trauma.

473
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:09,000
Cerebral infarction or
intercranial hemorrhage. Thoughts?

474
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:11,929
- How long till we land?
- Too long to wait.

475
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,166
His head's as smooth as a baby's bottom.

476
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,299
No bumps, so I think
we can rule out head trauma.

477
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,200
So you gotta choose between what's left.
Clog or a leak?

478
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,124
Uh, you're talking of toilet?

479
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:23,788
Is this actually helpful?

480
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,123
Not so far.

481
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:29,186
What about syphilis?

482
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:33,183
First of all, he apparently speaks
a language that no one else speaks.

483
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,564
Which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

484
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:36,948
We're flying out of Singapore.

485
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:40,399
If he has a credit card and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

486
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:43,897
What?

487
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:46,281
Condoms.

488
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,751
He has focal limb paralysis.

489
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:56,882
- His legs got paralyzed by a condom?
- No, by cocaine

490
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,694
that was inside the condom, and is now
spreading through his digestive tract.

491
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:04,866
- You think he's a mule.
- I think he's a jackass.

492
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:08,281
- We're gonna have to operate.
- Cool.

493
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:31,050
They're gonna kill her.

494
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:33,401
We were wrong.
Which means Foreman was right.

495
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,543
Maybe Foreman's right about us too.
Maybe we should just stop all this.

496
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,967
- I mean, if it's affecting our jobs.
- It's not affecting our jobs.

497
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:46,206
We had sex in a patient's bedroom.
A bedroom we were examing for toxins.

498
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:48,306
Yeah, our judgment's right on the mark.

499
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,553
All right, no more sex at patient's
homes. No more sex with cats watching.

500
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:53,904
Anywhere else you want
to cross off the list?

501
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,088
- The bowl.
- What?

502
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:01,906
- Has she eaten since she's been here?
- She's been sick since she's been here.

503
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:03,932
- What if it's a symptom?
- Why would you think...

504
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:04,860
The bowl was full.

505
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,447
You're gonna need to hold him down.
He's not gonna like this.

506
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,686
- Do you really think he's a mule?
- It fits the symptoms.

507
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:29,974
- You sure he's not contagious?
- Pretty much.

508
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:33,037
Can't be "pretty much" sure.
It means you're not sure.

509
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,310
Oh, aren't you clever?

510
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,884
Well, I know you're
"pretty much" unconscious,

511
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:46,435
but as it's been pointed out to me,
"pretty much" doesn't mean squat.

512
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,059
Okay, hold him tight.

513
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:58,645
The faster we do this,
the less likely he is to die of shock.

514
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:09,267
Tighter.

515
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,660
- Sorry.
- Do that again.

516
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,501
Ease off, then press down.

517
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,046
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

518
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,383
- Okay.
- Wrong again.

519
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:51,784
Where's his wallet?

520
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:57,970
SCUBA certification card.

521
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,486
Big deal. I have one of these.

522
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:03,929
Yeah.

523
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,875
Do you also have a receipt from
Tekong's scuba rental dated yesterday?

524
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,120
Tell the captain to drop
as low as he can under 5,000 feet.

525
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:16,226
- We're at 38,000. We can't...
- Peng's got the bends.

526
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:19,161
He went diving yesterday, and
like an idiot, he surfaced too quickly.

527
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:20,163
And like a bigger idiot,

528
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:23,618
he boarded a flight which is pressurized
to 8,000 feet above sea level.

529
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,069
Low pressure is killing him.

530
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,960
Tell the pilot to dive until we
can club baby seals out of the window.

531
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:31,128
And get him some oxygen.

532
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:46,706
Fifty years ago, it was one estate. The
two homes shared an electrical system.

533
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:50,397
Unfortunately the exterminator
didn't know that, so when they fumigated

534
00:39:50,398 --> 00:39:53,782
next door, the poison gas flowed through
the old pipe and into your house.

535
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:56,883
The scopolamine patch was
masking the effects of the poison.

536
00:39:57,037 --> 00:40:01,137
You'll have to stay here for a few more
days, but after that you should be fine.

537
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,547
I'm sorry about your cat.

538
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,790
And your hair.

539
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:11,894
For 12 years,
Harrington never left the property.

540
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:16,907
I thought I was being
punished for going away, but

541
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,890
really...

542
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,826
I was being punished for coming home.

543
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:41,635
Have a safe trip home.

544
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:51,212
Thank you.

545
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:52,842
I saved your life. You owe me.

546
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:55,403
- I wasn't sick.
- But you didn't know that.

547
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,479
- You owe me.
- I know it now.

548
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:02,476
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia, and vomit.

549
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,447
How do you know it wouldn't have
shut down your cold, cold heart next?

550
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,348
I don't owe you.

551
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:14,743
You're mean.

552
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,377
That's how I compensate
for being weak...

553
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:19,892
and soft.

554
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,110
I just wanted to say thank you.

555
00:41:27,472 --> 00:41:30,722
- You're extremely welcome.
- And I'm in New York every Monday.

556
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:32,951
Are you handicap accessible?

557
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:46,151
Hi, Robin?

558
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:48,713
This is,

559
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,717
Dr. Wilson, F-Fran's doctor.

560
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:53,771
James.

561
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:59,710
It was a toxin. We caught
it on time and she's gonna be fine.

562
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,383
Yeah, it is.

563
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:11,376
Listen, I was just wondering if
you were coming back in again to visit.

564
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:15,910
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

565
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:19,599
- Think even House would be impressed.
- I don't know about that.

566
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,715
Any idea how you want to celebrate?

567
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:25,281
What?

568
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,630
I want more.

569
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:30,598
I thought you were getting
a little worn out, but...

570
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,849
That's not what I meant.

571
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:34,586
I know.

572
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:38,897
I was just hoping you'd take the
hint and pretend you never said that.

573
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:43,228
- I want this to be more than it is.
- I thought we were clear.

574
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,153
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me you...

575
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:49,064
Yes, I can. And I don't.

576
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:53,141
It was... fun.

577
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:54,922
That's it.

578
00:42:58,771 --> 00:42:59,745
And now it's over.
