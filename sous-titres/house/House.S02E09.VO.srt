I'll take the two and the four.

Hey, that's my birthday.
February 4th, 1963.
I think that's a good bet?

00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,884
Oh, wh-what's your birthday?

11

Take your time. Don't worry.
There's only 30 seconds to post.

12

Is there any way I can bet
on the 6 and the 3 also?

You know, for the year?
All four horses. Can I do that?

14
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:52,850
He wants a $2.00 exacta box - 2, 4, 6, 3.
Give him $24.

00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:56,791
Mm-hmm.

I took a CPR class at the Y.

38
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,697
That would be useful
if she was having a heart atack
instead of seizure.

39
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,625
Seizure?
Hold her tangue down?

Call an ambulance.

Man's an addict.

Right, addicted to pills,
not gambling.

53
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,008
Same thing - drug abuse,
drinking, gambling.

54
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:16,711
They all fire up the same
pleasure centers in the brain.

What up with that?

60
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,173
You were just standing there

alcohol level of .13.

Hot OTB babe?

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,829
Obviously a working girl.
Probably an STD, infection.

66
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:48,700
No fever, no infection.

67
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,490
Alcohol abuse explains it all.

68
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,591
Causes seizures and affects
her blood's ability to clot,
which causes bruising.

69
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,398
Start her on heparin.
She'll be fine by morning.

70
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,816
Except for the fact that
the bruises are not petechial,
which means it's not DIC.

71
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,741
So the bruises were
caused by trauma.

72
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,677
She probably got beat up
by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

73
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,105
What's that called
when you judge someone
before ever meeting them?

74
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,208
She's a regular at OTB.

75
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:14,167
Somehow I don't see her

I have a "9-to-3" job.

78
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,824
It could be SLE,
familial telangiectasis,

79
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,683
- or even Cushing's.
- Good. Start with those.

80
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,263
- Which one?
- Cushing's.

81
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,160
Explains the seizure
and the bruising.

82
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,170
Not the anemia.

83
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,575
So she doesn't eat
a lot of meat.

84
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,691
DIC brought on by alcohol abuse
is far more likely. Do a full workup.

Okay, so it's a micro adenoma,

It's so small,
it's not even there.

00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:20,618
Results from her LP back yet?

171
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:23,328
Didn't do an LP.
I knew what she had.

172
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,664
Window Closed
[control panel: open_winMRI-1]

173
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:27,599
Go do the LP.

174
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,698
Okay, I need you to roll over
on your side, kiss your kneecaps.

175
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,401
Party time.

176
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:43,220
I thought it only took
one doctor to do this.
I'm observing.

177
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,485
She's here to make sure
I don't paralyze you.

178
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:47,966
You've done this
before, right?

179
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,975
Successfully?

180
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,021
He's kidding.
He's an excellent doctor.

181
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,697
House:
I'm gonna numb the area
with some lidocaine.

182
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,648
And then we're off to the races.
See what I did there?

183
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:00,388
I used horse racing jargon
to make the patient
feel more comfortable.

184
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,181
Okay, here we go.

185
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:04,442
[Gasps] Ow!

186
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,900
Felt like bone.
Does that hurt?

187
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,692
A little bit.
What are you doing? Oww!

188
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,209
Try running your back a bit more.

189
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:12,747
Perfect is the way you are.

190
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,832
- [Gasps]
- Oops. That was all me.

191
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,762
Ow!

192
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,432
Might wanna move down
one vertebrae.

193
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,952
This is actually much harder
than I remember.

194
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:22,543
[Gasps] Ohh!

195
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,887
My chest feels
a little tight.

196
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,363
Try taking a deep breath.

197
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,030
Dr. House, maybe
I should take it from here.

198
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,344
Eighth time's the charm.

199
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:30,527
Aah!

200
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,110
You trying
to piss off Foreman?

201
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,078
[Monitor stars beeping]
Let...

202
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,684
Cameron:
EP's 240 over 140.

203
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,048
Turn that thing off, will you?

204
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,491
Take the needle out.

205
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:40,698
- Take the needle out!
- Okay!

206
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,892
It's a hypertensive crisis.
Start her on an IV Lopressor drip.

207
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:50,108
Titrate to systolic
less than 140. She'll be fine.

208
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:52,380
House:
Cameron, meet me
in my office.

209
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:55,008
House:
At the risk of
sounding redundant...

210
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:57,266
and right...again...

211
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,177
she has Cushing's.

212
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,439
Cushing's.

213
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:03,988
Right...the fact that
you mangled her LP
has nothing to do with it?

214
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,134
Actually, it has
everything to do with it.

215
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:10,399
Cushing's plus stress
equals hypertensive crisis.

216
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,125
Smart move,
sending the rookie.

217
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,511
Her initial symptoms
could have been caused
by alcohol-induced DIC.

218
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,602
She hada hypertensive crisis
because it's been at least six hours
since she hadher last drink.

219
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,440
She's detoxing.

220
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,727
The exact same moment
that I'm futilely trying
to give her an LP?

221
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:27,719
Right, an invisible tumor
on her pituitary
is much more likely.

222
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,377
Chase:
What if the tumor is
somewhere else?

223
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:32,932
There could be an
ACTH-secreting tumor
on her lung or pancreas.

224
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:33,886
It's awfully rare.

225
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:35,671
Not as rare as
an invisible tumor.

226
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:38,132
Why didn't they put you
in charge instead of Foreman?

227
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:41,006
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
that killed that woman.

228
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:44,881
Get a pan-man scan
before she dies of cortisol OD.

229
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,010
[Whimpers] Please?

230
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,220
Fine, do it.

231
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,055
But when you
don't find anything,

232
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,843
put her on a Librium taper
for the withdrawal and
get her a bed in a rehab clinic.

233
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,174
Chase:
Lungs look clean.

234
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,398
Her lymph node's
not enlarged.

235
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,388
Cuddy tapped Foreman
to run the department.

236
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,222
- I didn't even get asked.
- Neither did I.

237
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,280
- You were suspended.
- I was kidding.

238
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,894
It's the irony of women in charge.
They don't like other women in charge.

239
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,366
Hmph!

240
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,195
What? You think
it's something else?

241
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:32,702
You sabotaged yourself.

242
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:35,332
You went on a date with House.
You slept with me.

243
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,725
Putting you in charge of this department is
like a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen.

244
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,590
Yeah. They're really worried
that I'm gonna create
a hostile work environment.

245
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,708
Maybe that's the problem.

246
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:49,650
Being in charge means
having to say "no" to House.

247
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,672
Would you hire you for that?

248
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,308
[On TV]
<i>Anderson coming out strong.</i>

249
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:01,342
<i>What is he thinking?
He watched what Tom Meents just did.</i>

250
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:05,401
You ordered MRIs for
the entire maternity ward?

251
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:07,182
I was in a crazy mood.

252
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,532
Good thing I got
a new boss to back me up.

253
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,678
Although I think one of those
is actually necessary.

254
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:14,039
Better comb through
before you cancel them all.

255
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,990
What do you expect me
to do, House?

256
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,075
Quit? Cry?

257
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,855
Actually, I expect you
to act like what you are.

258
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,143
My employee.
My subordinate.

259
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,968
My bitch.

260
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,332
Yeah. Well, since
you asked nicely--

261
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,258
God. I can't believe I got
more than a year behind

262
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:37,328
on my discharge summaries.
Gotta get caught up.

263
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:39,207
Oh, no. Wait.

264
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:42,346
I'm not authorized
to sign these anymore.
Only you are.

265
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:46,112
Keep it coming.
I'm not gonna break.

266
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,149
Scan showed a mass
on her pancreas.

267
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,566
It looks malignant.
Probably inoperable.

268
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,290
I'd give her two months.

269
00:12:58,651 --> 00:12:59,995
[Sighs]

270
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:03,820
On the bright side,
it still means I was right.

271
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,024
Where's Dr. House?

272
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,232
Dr. Foreman's
overseeing your case.

273
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,821
He thought it'd be best
if I spoke with you.

274
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:19,371
We found a mass
in your pancreas.

275
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,792
It looks like cancer.

276
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,371
So something in my pancreas
caused me to have a seizure?

277
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:31,378
Probably.
But the bigger point is...

278
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:37,299
[Inhales deeply and exhales]
A one year survival rate for
pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.

279
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,110
So what's the treatment?

280
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:46,660
We need to biopsy the mass
to see what we're dealing with. And...

281
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,179
Then we can recommend
options from there.

282
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,724
Sounds good.

283
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,368
I need your consent
to do the biopsy.

284
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,132
Thanks.

285
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,382

It was weird.
She barely reacted at all.

288
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:18,368
I've had people hug me

289
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,352
and people take
a swing at me.

290
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,585

she didn't even hear me.

I'm Dr. House.

Perfect.

298
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:58,972
Excuse me.

299
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,978
I need Dr. Foreman in
Exam Room One for a consult.

300
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,090
So, when did this start?

301
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:11,738
A couple weeks ago.

302
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,203
I didn't want
to get pregnant.

303
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,424
Jake's not into rubbers,
so I got on the jelly.

304
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:19,284
You think I'm allergic
or something?

305
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,541
You have an infection.
Gonna need a sample.

306
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,822
I brought the jar.

307
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,387
No, I meant
a sample of your...

308
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,075
Okay. We have
a neurological problem here.

309
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:38,375
There's something wrong
with my brain?

310
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,147
Oh, yeah.

311
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,438
You can cover yourself up.
I got what I need.

312
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,315
What's up?

313
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,990
Smell this.

314
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,358
[Sniffs]
Smells like vaginosis.

315
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:54,593
But it's not
really my call.

316
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,485
Great. I'll be sure
to put a gold star
by your name on the board.

317
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,191
Anica's biopsy
for pancreatic cancer

318
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,028
was negative.

319
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,506
Okay. I'm gonna give you
some antibiotics

320
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,336
and you probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

321
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,366
How long?

322
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,828
On an evolutionary basis,
I'd recommend forever.

323
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,567
The mass in the
pancreas is benign.

324
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,062
It's probably
just scar tissue.

325
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,467
Good news. She's not sick all.
Other than being an alcoholic.

326
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,209
The labs you sent
yesterday put her ACTH at
64 pico-grams per milliliter.

327
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:32,541
She's got Cushing's.
Something set it off.

328
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,287
It's gotta be in her brain.

329
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,325
Set her up
for a venous sampling.

330
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,814
There is another possibility.

331
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,207
Chase, hold on.

332
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,283
How'd you get him
trained so fast?

333
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,521
Electronic collar?

334
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:43,832
Got treats in your pocket?

335
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,887
She didn't even
read the consent form
for the pancreatic biopsy.

336
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,876
Who reads those things?

337
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:51,274
Maybe she didn't read it
because she KNEW that
there was nothing wrong with her.

338
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:55,509
There is another explanation
for the Cushing's. Maybe she
injected herself with the ACTH.

339
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:57,433
Her behavior suggests
Munchausen's.

340
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,203
She's had four hospitalizations
in the last four months.

341
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,276
Well, being hospitalized a lot
certainly points to nothing
being wrong with you.

342
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,312
She's had zero symptoms
since she got here.

343
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:12,098
The scarring on her pancreas could be be
caused from injecting herself with
the benzene and setting offthe seizures.

344
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,599
House:
She's had brain surgery.

345
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:16,345
You can fake a stomach ache.
You can't fake a brain tumor.

346
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,100
You can fake
an invisible one.

347
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,371
We should check her apartment.
Look for medications, syringes.

348
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,541
- Venous sampling's easier.
- And more dangerous.

349
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:26,963
Not if you get caught breaking in.

350
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,298
So don't get caught, House.

351
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,720
Why do you think
Cuddy picked Foreman over me?

352
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,988
If I done something wrong
or if there's something
I needed to improve on...

353
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,189
Would it make you shut up
if I told you she wanted someone black?

354
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,615
How would you describe
my leadership skills?

355
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,199
Nonexistent.
Otherwise excellent.

356
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,570
There's more to being
a leader than being a jerk.

357
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:47,708
The world will never know.

358
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,891
[Starts engine]

359
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,623
No. No way.

360
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,638
- It just snowed.
- Yesterday.

361
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,972
The streets are clear.

362
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,172
My car is right there.

363
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,261
There's construction on Elm.
Bike'll be faster.

364
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,176
[Guns the motor]

365
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,819
Cameron:
There's even books
in the bathroom.

366
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:32,022
Well, either she's very smart or
she has a severe fiber deficiency.

367
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:36,555
"Tuesday 1 pm Opthalmologist,  Dr. Peterson"
"Thursday 10 am Gynecologist, Dr. Lachowicz"

368
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:40,759
She's got an appointment
with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday

369
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,250
and an appointment with
her gynecologist on Thursday.

370
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:46,357
Multiple appointments
with multiple doctors.

371
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:48,296
Symptom of Munchausen's.

372
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,178
Or, just thinking outside the box here,
she has a vagina and trouble reading.

373
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:58,815
There's three pairs of reading glasses.
Each with different prescriptions.

374
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,804
Which would be
explained by a tumor
pressing on the optic nerve.

375
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,498
Because you're looking
for her to have a tumor.

376
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:05,242
And you are looking for...

377
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,804
A person with
Munchausen's Syndrome

378
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:11,587
drinks battery acid.
They don't go to an ophthalmologist
to get their pupils dilated.

379
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,839
An ophthalmologist is a doctor.
Attention is attention.

380
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,082
How many hospitals
have you contacted?

381
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,048
Has one doctor said she's crazy?
It's not Munchausen's.

382
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,997
It's not your call.

383
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,159
If you think she's got Munchausen's,
then obviously you got
something to show the man.

384
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,706
A syringe in her apartment.
A bottle of ACTH.

385
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,918
Munchausen patients are good
at covering their tracks.

386
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,647
Oh, right. So the fact
that we found nothing

387
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:35,582
proves there's something.

388
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,339
Look at the pathology reports
from the surgery she had in Chicago.

389
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,286
They removed 30% of her pituitary.

390
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,241
They found no tumor.

391
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:43,184
It's possible
the surgeons just missed it.

392
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:45,429
I mean that kind of surgery.
You're just cutting and hoping.

393
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:49,790
Of course! We're both right.
Excellent solution. Everybody's happy.

394
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,549
Come on.
Step up, Foreman.

395
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,489
If you think I'm right,
order me to stick a needle in her brain.

396
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,569
If you think Cameron's right,
send the patient home.

397
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,153
Either she'll be fine,
or she'll die.

398
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:03,083
Do the venous sampling.
Get her consent.

399
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:11,758
Nice move, boss.
Way to cover your ass.

400
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,530
I just agreed with you.

401
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,114
Not because
you think I'm right.

402
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,960
You're just taking
the safe route.

403
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:18,767
You're a wuss.

404
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,091
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

405
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,746
House:
Hey, Wilson!
Guess what Foreman just did?

406
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:35,580
Hi.

407
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,822
This is a consent form
to stick a wire into your brain.

408
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:45,659
It's important for hospitals to
get these signed for procedures
that are completely unnecessary.

409
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:48,438
Then why are you doing it?

410
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:50,388
Because you're mentally ill.

411
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:55,142
You injected yourself
with ACTH to induce Cushing's
to get attention doctors.

412
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:57,177
And so far it's worked.

413
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,583
I'd like to see
another doctor.

414
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,294
I'm not giving you
what you want?

415
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:02,946
I don't want a bitch.

416
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,614
Just sign the forms, okay,
and I'll get out of here.

417
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,663
Hopefully for you, what ever
you injected yourself with
won't wear off

418
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,367
before you get fun of
a caring and concerned doctor
cutting into your head.

419
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,226
You chose me to make
House miserable, didn't you?

420
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,154
Apparently he's
making YOU miserable.

421
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,512
That's impressive.

422
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,750
Find someone else.

423
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,129
No.

424
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:42,111
For the first time in six years
I'm getting copied on all
experimental tests and procedures.

425
00:21:42,195 --> 00:21:45,208
Clinic hours have been
logged and completed.

426
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,776
You've given me four months
of House's dictations

427
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,958
so I can finally bill
insurance companies.

428
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,251
I only did that stuff to prove
he couldn't make me miserable.

429
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:54,854
Well, way to go.

430
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,388
Now everybody's
getting what they need.
Even House.

431
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:01,978
He gets to play mad scientist,
and this department runs smoothly.

432
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:04,821
So I'm stuck with this
for the next three weeks.

433
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,541
Maybe longer.

434
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:11,212
Would you be interested
if this wasn't just pretend?

435
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:14,414
What did Mommy say?

436
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,074
I don't get any candy
in my stocking.

437
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:17,798
Patient being prepped
for the venous sampling?

438
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:18,595
Yeah.

439
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,325
Mentally ill patient is
right on track for
a pointless procedure.

440
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,923
Yeah, we get your objection.
[Phone starts ringing]

441
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,295
Foreman.

442
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,346
Are you sure?

443
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,291
That doesn't make any sense.
Check it again.

444
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:39,360
Haw! We gotta delay
the venous sampling.

445
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,418
Why?
Her urine turning orange?

446
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,706
How would you know that?

447
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,441
Because that's
what rifampin does.

448
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,113
She's not on antibiotics?

449
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:53,082
But if a Munchausen's patient
thinks she's about get busted,

450
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:57,169
she sees pills labeled
"Dangerous: might cause seizures,"
she might grab a couple.

451
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:00,769
And if that label were accidentally
on a bottle of antibiotics

452
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:03,128
and if that bottle were
accidentally left in her room...

453
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:05,101
- You set her up?
- Might have.

454
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:06,920
It's Munchausen's.

455
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,265
All this she did to herself.

456
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:29,324
I don't  what the hell
you're talking about.

457
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:32,802
I had a seizure.
I'm sick. I need your help.

458
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,562
Not from this department.

459
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,427
The half-life of rifampin is
three hours. After that,
you'll get your psych referral

460
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:39,973
and your discharge papers.

461
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,142
You know, just because
you stick your fingers
down your throat

462
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,289
doesn't mean
the rest of us are screwed up.

463
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,340
I guess when cooperation fails,
you move onto hostility.

464
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:51,159
I didn't do this to myself.

465
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,825
Chase:
100% commitment.

466
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:05,986
Sign of a good liar.

467
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,614
[Scoffs]
Also the sign of a sociopath.

468
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:10,350
What are you doing?

469
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,187
Correcting your last note.

470
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:14,781
We can't discharge her,
she's sick.

471
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,615
Anybody ever tell you
you write like a girl?

472
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:18,548
What?

473
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,781
You got some other explanation
for orange urine?

474
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,221
- It's Munchausen's.
- Correct, but not complete.

475
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:25,418
You just don't wanna admit
that she skunked you.

476
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:27,961
At the end of
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

477
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:30,031
the wolf really does come.

478
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:32,808
And he eats the sheep
and the boy and his parents.

479
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:34,839
- The wolf doesn't eat the parents.
- It does when I tell it.

480
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,195
You're not telling
the story now. I am.

481
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,689
Look, I checked her records.

482
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,913
All her hospitalizations
were for different things.

483
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,882
Brain tumor, fainting spells,
skin rashes, seizures.

484
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:48,747
She's had every blood test
known to man and the results
were all over the map.

485
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,783
There's only one constant.
Low HCT.

486
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:53,153
The anemia's real.

487
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,495
There's a million things
she could have taken
to have done that.

488
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,084
True. Could just be her M.O.

489
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:00,380
She self-induces two illnesses.
One always changes, one never does.

490
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,825
Or maybe, she has
Munchausen's and aplastic anemia.

491
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:07,062
Which would mean
without the proper treatment,
she'll continue to get sicker, weaker,

492
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:09,643
eventually she'll start
bleeding internally and die.

493
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,894
- She's not getting sicker.
- She will.

494
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,220
If her bone marrow was dying,
the entire blood panel
would be affected.

495
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,032
- Her white count's normal.
- So far.

496
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:18,598
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

497
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,137
- No. No more tests.
- Look.

498
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,465
You kick her to the curb
with a Munchausen's diagnosis,

499
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:25,194
you're guaranteeing that
no doctor will ever listen to her again.

500
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:28,080
We do more tests,
we'll only be feeding her psychosis.

501
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,440
The more attention we give her,
the more she'll want.

502
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:34,498
What if she doesn't know
we're testing her?

503
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:37,365
House. You were wrong.
Live with it.

504
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,885
There's probably some blood
left over from previous tests.

505
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,462
Blood tests alone can't
confirm aplastic anemia.

506
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,670
Yes, I know.
That's why I wanna
do a bone marrow biopsy.

507
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:49,256
The blood tests could show
a systemic disease, or a virus
or toxin that could be the cause.

508
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,258
Fine.
You wanna test the extra blood?
Knock yourself out.

509
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,039
But the patient is off-limits.

510
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:55,980
And if the results
are positive...

511
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,667
I get my biopsy?

512
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:01,415
It's a safe way to go.

513
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:23,034
I need all of these tests
and a PCR done on this sample.

514
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,049
You're gonna
need more blood.

515
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,322
Patient's empty.

516
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,269
Then I can't do it.

517
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:30,843
You can try.

518
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:33,085
You can try to look
like Salma Hayek.

519
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:34,883
It's not gonna
make it happen.

520
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:44,839
You may not have Salma's ass,
but she doesn't have your eyes.

521
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,797
Yeah, right.

522
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,969

Dr. Wilson. Can I talk to you
about something in confidence?

525
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:58,742
Of course.

526
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,181
- It's about House.
- Oh. Then no.

527
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,783
Fine.

528
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,686
I won't say anything.

529
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:08,281
Do you think
there's any way

530
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:11,392
House would take me
seriously as his boss?

531
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:14,007
Uh...where is this coming from?

532
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,587
Did Cuddy say something?

533
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,277
We talked.
She intimated.

534
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,459
And you want my advice
on how to usurp him?

535
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:24,646
It's very ancient Rome.
He'll need a toga, of course. A...

536
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,420
sword.

537
00:27:25,504 --> 00:27:26,855
It's not a coup.

538
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,393
I just wanna
figure out some way
we can work together.

539
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:32,584
I mean, I keep the team running
from an administrative point of view.

540
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,319
House doesn't have to
deal with the red tape.

541
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,033
- It's a win-win.
- I'm sure he'll see it that way.

542
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:40,104
You have any advice
on how to approach him,

543
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:42,726
- how to deal with the guy?
- No.

544
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,560
But you won't
tell him we talked?

545
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:50,238
No.

546
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,792
There is no way
this is gonna happen.

None of her other blood panels
showed any sign of Sickle Cell.

something's changed

Who are you more afraid of?

579
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,375
I'm not afraid of Foreman.
I agree with him.
All the tests back him up.

have not been done.

is only temporary.

582

you're still gonna treat me like crap.

583

- What?
- Sit.

- No.

Well, don't feel bad.
It's for gout.

601
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:42,814
It's got nothing to do with anything
you've ever pretended to have.

602
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:45,071
- I'm not pretending...
- Shut up.

603
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:49,090
Colchicine decimates
your white blood cells

604
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:50,609
and leaves almost no trace.

605
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,429
It's great for faking
your way into hospitals.

606
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,502
- I didn't fake my way...
- Shut up.

607

You've beeing this for years.

608
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,996
Don't worry,
it's probably not your fault.

609
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:05,228
When you were a kid,
you had a close relative
who had a chronic disease,

610
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:07,210
probably your sister.

611
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:12,243
You saw all the attention she got
while you were left alone, ignored.

612
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,384
And it really seriously
crewed you up.

613
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,316
- I do not have a relative...
- Shut up!

614
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,789
I'm trying to give you
what you want.

615
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,504
And save your life.

616
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:30,283
You have aplastic anemia.

617
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,278
What, are you trying
to scare me now?

618
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:36,151
It means you're
not just sick in the head.

619
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,532
The problem is,
the rest of you appears well.

620
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:41,036
So I've got to make you seem
as sick as you're supposed to be

621
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,734
by injecting you with a drug

622
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,802
that simulates symptoms
that you actually have.

623
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,833
All you need to know is...

624
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,459
you've hit
the Munchausen's jackpot.

625
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:56,466
I'm gonna give you
a cocktail of insulin
for a seizure

626
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,781
and colchicine
to kill your white count,

627
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:03,271
this will absolutely confirm
my diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

628
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:06,648
There is one...small catch.

629
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:10,096
If you've actually done something
to yourself to cause the anemia,

630
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,861
then I'm wrong.

631
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,767
And if I do what I plan to do,

632
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:18,411
then the treatment will kill you
instead of saving you.

633
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,263
So I need to know.

634
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,485
Have you been taking anything
besides the insulin, the ACTH,

635
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:27,386
and the pills Cameron
left in your room?

636
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:34,887
No.

637
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,252
Good.

638
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,576
Give me your arm.

639
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:51,736
It was my mom.

640
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,225
She had MS.

641
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,246
She was in and out
of hospitals all the time.

642
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,782
People were always
trying to do things for her.

643
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,878
Bring her food
or brush her hair, or...

644
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,657
make her happy.

645
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,373
People cared.

646
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,566
She died when I was 16.

647
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,068
Then there was no one.

648
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,857
Boo hoo.

649
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,059
Where are you going?

650
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,633
Well, I obviously can't
be around when it happens.

651
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,660
Well, what are you gonna do?
You're just gonna...

652
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:39,454
Relax.
You know the drill.

653
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,950
People walk by here
all the time. You'll be fine.

she has another seizure.

grabbed insulin on her way out.

656
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:15,782
Once she's stable, we need to
get her out of here before
she does more damage to herself.

657
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:16,974
We can't.

658

White count, hematocrit,
and platelets are all off.

663
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,775

She actually has aplastic anemia.

664

00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,142
Cameron:
All her other labs show
nothing that would...

00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:40,655
Lab ***.
A good diagnostician
reads between the labs.

667
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,311
You were right.

668
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:45,587
Hey, hey, hey.
We're not here to
play the blame game.

669
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:46,887

Sometimes doctors send
people out on the street to die

after other doctors warn them
that they're sending people
out on the street to die.

672
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,913
There's no way you could know.

00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,406
I'll go give her the news.

674
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,493
Who are you?

675
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm in charge of your case.

676
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:16,012
You have aplastic anemia.

677
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,855
Which means your
bone marrow has shut down.

678
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,596
And your body can't
make new blood anymore.

679
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:23,770
Are you sure?

680
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:26,510
I went back and
checked your old records.

681
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:28,157
It makes sense.

682
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,307
The aplastic anemia's apparently
been developing for months.

683
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:35,571
I'm sorry,
we should've caught it earlier.

684
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:36,927
So...

685
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:41,418
It's not just the latest white count
that's leading you to feel this...

686
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:46,433
I know this is scary.

687
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,612
But a bone marrow transplant
could cure you.

688
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,066
A marrow transplant
could kill me.

689
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,403
The other option is
weekly blood transfusions.

690
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,966
Injections of GCSF.

691
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:01,761
- It's a life-long regimen.
- Yeah, I don't want that.

692
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,241
Are you sure?

693
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:08,442
I-I don't want to
be ruel here, but...

694
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,081
you jumped through a lot of hoops
to get this sort of attention.

695
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,531
I just wanna be healthy.

696
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:19,557
It's not so much fun
when you're actually sick.

697
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:22,995
No.

698
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:29,384
We'll um...
we'll check the registry.

699
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,452
See if there's a donor match.

700
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:36,309
Thank you.

701
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:46,046
We have to kill all the old bone marrow
before we give you the new stuff.

702
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:48,085
You'll have no immune system.

703
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:51,363
We'll keep you in a sterile room
for two weeks to make sure
everything's dead.

704
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,163
Then we'll give you
the donor marrow.

705
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:55,933
It'll take another couple of weeks
until it takes hold.

706
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,045
You won't feel a thing.

707
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:01,232
If you get uncomfortable for any reason
I need to talk, don't yell.

708
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:04,150
Walls are four inches thick. Lead.

709
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:05,831
Use the microphone.

710
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:07,859
Are you ready?

711
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:09,867
Okay.

712
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:11,851
[Irradiation starts]

713
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,579
Where's Dr. House?

714
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:07,731
Turn it off.

715
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,229
[Monitor starts beeping]
Now what?

716
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,427
How long has she been in there?

717
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:13,285
Three minutes.
What's going on?

718
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,479
She doesn't have
aplastic anemia.

719
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:16,951
She has an infection.

720
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:20,551
No. Her white count
would be through the roof.
Hers is one the floor.

721
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,158
- Well, the body does crazy things.
- "The body does crazy things."

722
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:25,731
Well, that explains everything.

723
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:26,656
She had no fever.

724
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,048
'Cause her self-inflicted Cushing's
suppressed her immune system.

725
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:33,026
Stopped her from having a fever.
Hid the infection.

726
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:39,170
Clostridium perfringens
could cause the bruises,
schistocytes, the anemia...

727
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:41,345
Explains everything
except the white count.

728
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:47,307
Augmentin is a lot safer than
destroying her immune system.
Why don't we try that?

729
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:52,651
Ww-you're taking
the safe course?

730
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:54,337
What's going on?

731
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,751
There's lots of explanations
for a low white count.

732
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,986
Name one that fits her case.

733
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:05,794
Colchicine.

734
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:14,397
I figure that she'd gotten
her hands on it and, uh,
just self-medicated.

735
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,782
That's brilliant of her!

736
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:22,372
Take the exact medication that
would confirm your diagnosis.

737
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:24,931
People do crazy things.

738
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,976
You injected her against her will
just so you could be right?

739
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,388
- She consented.
- She's mentally ill!

740
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:32,868
But she smells oh so sweet.

741
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:37,643
She would've gotten sicker
when I said she was gonna get sicker,

742
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,676
except Cameron dosed her
with antibiotics. Just hold this.

743
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,329
- Is everything okay?
- Pull my finger.

744
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:45,247

[Sniffs]

746
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:49,131
Grapey.

747
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:50,974
You have a bacterium.

748
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,403
It's on all of us. But...

749
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:55,612
the bruises you gave yourself
with the Cushing's made a lovely home.

750
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,463
Bacteria moved in,

751
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,505
parked their cars on the lawn.
There goes the neighborhood.

752
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:03,777
By "neighborhood"
I mean your internal organs.

753
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:06,764
So, should we put her
on the Augmentin, boss?

754
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:10,127
Or do you think she injected
herself with grapes? [Sniffs]

755
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,975
I love the smell of pus
in the morning.

756
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,560
Smells like...

757
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,863
victory.

758
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:24,675
If you were serious
about the offer,

759
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:26,506
I'm serious
about accepting.

760
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,472
I'd like to run
the department.

761
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:32,174
And you said it yourself,
things run smooth.

762
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,099
Except for the part where
House went behind your back

763
00:40:35,204 --> 00:40:38,596
and KO'd the patient
with insulin and colchicine.

764
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,175
There was no reason
to suspect an infection.

765
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:43,875
Even House didn't think
it was an infection.

766
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,782
You would've done
the same thing I did.

767
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:47,725
And I'd be just as wrong.

768
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:51,015
What House did was insane.
But he saved her life.

769
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:51,859
He got lucky.

770
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:54,114
He got her to admit
she's got a problem.

771
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,578
She's agreed to
out-patient treatment.

772
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,270
He gets lucky a lot.

773
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:05,588
Did you ever really
intend to give me this job?

774
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,263
Or were you just trying to
stop me from stepping down?

775
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:10,728
You've got
two more weeks in charge.

776
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:13,639
Hopefully the next case
will go better.

777
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:22,642
She should've died.

778
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,162
House is not a hero.

779
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,363
A person who has the guts
to break a bad rule,

780
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:30,302
they're a hero.

781
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:33,103
House doesn't break rules.
He ignores them.

782
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,323
He's not Rosa Parks.

783
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,768
He's an anarchist.

784
00:41:37,852 --> 00:41:39,356
All he stands for is the right

785
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:42,703
for everyone to grab
whatever they want
whenever they want.

786
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,187
You tell doctors that's okay,

787
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:48,971
your mortality rate is
gonna go through the roof.

788
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:56,763
Kinda digging this whole
Foreman-in-charge thing.

789
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:58,665
You know.

790
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,484
It frees me up
to watch my soaps.

791
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:04,878
Catch a movie
in the afternoon.

792
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,273
Have lunch with you.

793
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,336
Yeah, that's
a big change for you.

794
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:11,733

Why not?
