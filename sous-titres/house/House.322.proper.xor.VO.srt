1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:01,382
Hajime.

2
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:10,691
Matte.

3
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:12,479
She almost took my head off!

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,780
Your fault.
You didn't guard your left side.

5
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:21,897
Hajime!

6
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,555
Matte!
Point.

7
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:33,789
Hajime!

8
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:48,647
Matte, matte, matte!

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,980
Stop, stop, stop!

10
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:55,071
Addie...
you're bleeding.

11
00:00:57,612 --> 00:00:58,712
I never even hit her.

12
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:08,537

13
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:36,474
Good morning.

14
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:38,655
This is funny.

15
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,318
- "People don't... "
- Not done reading. Go away.

16
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:45,336
Most likely she coughed it up,
which would mean it's from her lungs.

17
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:46,889
Drugs, toxins, infection?

18
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,734
No fever, no elevated white count,
which rules out infection.

19
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,836
And the blood panels found no drugs,
no toxins.

20
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,587
The bronchoscopy was pristine.
So much for the lungs.

21
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:56,243
- Good morning.
- Not yet.

22
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,238
So then the blood came from her stomach,

23
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,159
which would mean it's
an ulcer or a GI bleed.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,896
ER also ran an upper and lower GI.
No occult blood in her stool.

25
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,848
Which means no ulcer or GI bleed.

26
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,729
Which means it's not
from the stomach either,

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,721
which means it didn't
come from anywhere.

28
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,953
You guys get to the point where
the blood didn't come from anywhere?

29
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:19,406
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

30
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,458
Not that much blood.

31
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,789
Trauma from karate?

32
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,921
No trauma. Kicked the other guy's ass.

33
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,553
Now a good time?

34
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:28,118
If you can tell me how
blood can mysteriously appear...

35
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,069
Now.

36
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,072
This includes you.

37
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,520
What's going on?

38
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,093
Feel free to speculate
amongst yourselves.

39
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,632
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,891
- Why?
- He's afraid of turning into me.

41
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,833
Well, that's a good enough reason.
Sign here.

42
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:55,228
That's not promising.

43
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:00,857
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,930
That's it? You're not gonna
tell him that we're a family,

45
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,784
and families don't abandon each other?

46
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,075
- You want me to?
- No.

47
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,388
- Would it make any difference?
- No.

48
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,589
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

49
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:24,731
- So, where were we?
- College sophomore coughing up blood.

50
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:30,730
Not the case, the speculation. The
palace intrigue, the rising self-doubts.

51
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,835
- Did Foreman get a promotion?
- I resigned.

52
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:36,117
What?

53
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:40,118
Personally, I can't believe I've had the
same three employees for three years.

54
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,627
The patient could have a heart problem.

55
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,664
Yes, life goes on.

56
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,046
Look at the eager
beaver combing his hair.

57
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:55,526
Hyperdynamic heart could
force too much blood into her lungs.

58
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,769
She coughed up the overflow.

59
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,321
It wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs

60
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,492
because it's traveling
through normal plumbing.

61
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,343
Foreman, go do a stress
echo test to see if he's right.

62
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:06,772
Cameron, check out the dorm,
and redo the ER labs.

63
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,753
I'll get going on
Foreman's farewell party.

64
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,687
Everybody good with a
mermaid under the stars theme?

65
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,098
So why are you leaving?

66
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,033
Or is it just some sort of power play?

67
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,627
You can have my parking
space and my locker.

68
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,043
Is it about House?

69
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,094
Let me get all sensitive
and confide in you.

70
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:41,198
Addie, pedal harder.
We need your heart rate at 170.

71
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,236
Why wouldn't you want to tell me?

72
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,269
I don't like you.

73
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,833
Never have, never will.

74
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,125
You want me to share some more?

75
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:57,296
Even if you do hate me,
if you found another job, you'd tell me.

76
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,046
If House did something to
drive you out of here, you'd tell me.

77
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,081
The fact that you won't tell me means
that whatever the real reason is...

78
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,085
you're ashamed of it.

79
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,991
Guys...

80
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,696
I'm at 170.

81
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,656
Pulmonary artery looks good.

82
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:27,397
It's not a heart problem.

83
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,398
- Are you cold?
- No.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,014
- Scared?
- I'm okay. Why?

85
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,355
On your arm.

86
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,290
Addie has goose bumps.

87
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:50,999
No recovering from those babies.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,650
You don't have goose
bumps for no reason.

89
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,656
They're a reaction to
the body thinking it's cold.

90
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:56,423
She wasn't cold.
Her temperature was normal.

91
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,282
But her body thought it was,
which means...

92
00:05:58,283 --> 00:05:59,577
What, a brain problem?

93
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,182
A messed-up hypothalamus
could cause goose bumps,

94
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,191
but they're not gonna
cause her to cough up blood.

95
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,351
She has no neurological issues.
She had a shiver.

96
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,691
I think there's an infection.

97
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,455
We've ruled out infection
because no fever, no white count.

98
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:13,381
I think there's an infection.
Blood goes where it's needed.

99
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,753
An infection likes nice wet places...
her lungs.

100
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:16,704
Start treatment.

101
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,131
All that cool stuff for bacterial,
fungal, and atypical infections.

102
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,143
Get a lung biopsy.

103
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:24,054
I want to see the
little bugger up close.

104
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,081
- Why is Foreman quitting?
- He wants to breed llamas.

105
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,399
Interesting.

106
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,204
You're ashamed of the reason too.

107
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,439
No one writes tamoxifen like you.

108
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,273
Well, I use a G.

109
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,549
Foreman resigned.

110
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:04,692
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,456
It's okay, no biggie.

112
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:07,827
Right.

113
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,408
He give a reason?

114
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,311
He said he didn't
want to end up like me.

115
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,596
I had a brilliant retort.

116
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,333
I can't remember what
it was at the moment.

117
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,075
You don't want to end up like you.

118
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,578
Good point. Can I resign?

119
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,613
What's up with that?

120
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:27,799
With what?

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,750
You yawned.

122
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:32,609
I just told you something interesting,
so you're not bored.

123
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,449
It's 11:00 in the morning, you're
drinking coffee, so you're not tired.

124
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,250
I didn't yawn,
so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction...

125
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:39,484
which leaves symptom.

126
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,440
Vasovagal issue. Maybe a heart problem.

127
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,254
My heart's fine. I was up late.

128
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,107
You're just deflecting having
a conversation about Foreman.

129
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,658
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

130
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,294
Either you're lying,
or you don't really think he's leaving.

131
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,457
Or you just jumped right to acceptance.

132
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,369
Sorry, I yawned because I
was trying to communicate boredom.

133
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,921
You could try bargaining with him...
give him a raise.

134
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,858
How much do you think it would
cost to make him want to be like me?

135
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:10,657
Thanks for the coffee.

136
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,045
She seems fine.

137
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,488
She is fine.

138
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:20,401
- She coughed up blood.
- Past tense.

139
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,352
She has diarrhea.

140
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,244
From the antibiotics for the infection.

141
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,378
Lung biopsy says she
doesn't have an infection.

142
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,896
Well, then you screwed up the biopsy.

143
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,451
Or you're wrong about infection.

144
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:29,917
If I'm wrong, then so is her body,

145
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,925
'cause it obviously thinks
she's got an infection,

146
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,169
or it wouldn't have gotten
better from the antibiotics.

147
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,840
What is pandiculation symptomatic of?

148
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:39,040
Yawning's a symptom of fatigue
or cholinergic excitation.

149
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,836
Does this have anything
to do with Addie?

150
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:41,693
Let's say yes.

151
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,617
Cerebral tumor, epilepsy.

152
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,488
Could also be a medication
reaction to antidepressants,

153
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,639
or some meds for
end-stage liver failure.

154
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:49,633
Let's say no.

155
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,051
You don't want to leave this job.

156
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:58,303
Three years you've been here,

157
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,650
you've never once laughed
at anything he's said.

158
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,372
Because I wasn't kissing his ass.

159
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:04,407
But now you are? No.

160
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,680
Now you're nervous.
Uncomfortable about your decision.

161
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,115
- It wasn't even that good a joke.
- Oh, crap.

162
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,919
Most of your jokes are excellent.
I just meant in comparison.

163
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,870
Shut up.

164
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,131
I think she may not have an infection.

165
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,886
We better deal with
her before she crashes.

166
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,448
- She can't breathe!
- Get off the bed.

167
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,549
We need a crash cart.

168
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:30,142
- What's happening?!
- Let's get her down now.

169
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:35,105
The pressure's collapsing her lungs.
She's not getting any air.

170
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:42,849
Oh, my God!

171
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,367
She couldn't breathe because
she had a pleural effusion.

172
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,572
Thoracentesis revealed
low protein count.

173
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,788
Effusion was transudative, which
means she has cirrhosis of the liver,

174
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,010
or she's in heart failure.

175
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:06,211
Heart was fine,
liver enzymes were normal.

176
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:09,336
There's something called
"blude" in the pleural effusion.

177
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:12,434
Oh, it's not "blude," it's blood.

178
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,615
Ha... which is great.
Not for her, but for me.

179
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,340
Because it means I
think it's an infection.

180
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,056
The labs indicated
minute traces of blood.

181
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:24,748
You can't ignore the blood because
it's a minority, can you, Foreman?

182
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,673
If we count the traces
of blood as significant,

183
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,624
the differential isn't just infection.

184
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,345
It could be lung cancer,
breast cancer, lymphoma.

185
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,546
Great, go tell her
she's got one of those.

186
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:34,928
Or you can tell her that

187
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,949
we haven't given her enough
antibiotics for her infection.

188
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,458
Double the dose, and check her lungs.

189
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:42,678
We checked her lungs, they're clean.

190
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,759
On the outside.

191
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,955
She needs an arteriogram.

192
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,608
It's about my bowel movements.

193
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,472
What isn't these days?

194
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:03,049
- You sure you want to be here for this?
- We do everything together.

195
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,434
Of course.
The toilet can be a lonely place.

196
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:07,807
Drop your pants, I'll suit up.

197
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,132
They float.

198
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,154
My bowel movements.

199
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,160
Honey says they're not supposed to.

200
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:19,248
I'm a nutritionist.

201
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:23,128
Yes, I could tell from
the cool toe-loop sandals.

202
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,034
Thank you.

203
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:27,723
You're welcome.

204
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,740
And the natural-fiber clothing,
I assume,

205
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,991
means some kind of
vegetarian denomination?

206
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:36,998
We're vegans. At first I was a little
concerned about the lack of protein,

207
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,449
but Honey showed me
you can get it from lots...

208
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,102
Well, whatever floats your poop.

209
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:44,096
And you've been together how long?
Six months?

210
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:45,819
How'd you know?

211
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,886
Because after six months,
poop love fades.

212
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,956
And if you'd been together
shorter than that, then...

213
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,262
I'll explain right after this break.

214
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:04,807
Three ten-milligram pills
of your finest amphetamines.

215
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:07,982
Arteriogram was normal.

216
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,913
Which means her lungs are fine.

217
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,891
What if the clear
arteriogram is significant?

218
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:17,442
It is significant.
It means there's no infection.

219
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,101
- I think there's an infection.
- Infections don't come and go.

220
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:22,459
People don't get better
then worse in the same treatment.

221
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,248
Unless your body can't
finish out the fight.

222
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,101
Maybe goes a couple of rounds,
then gives up.

223
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:28,709
- Why would it give up?
- Maybe its name is Foreman.

224
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:31,156
Come on, where's that smile?

225
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,489
That laugh that makes
the whole world sunny

226
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,490
without contributing to global warming.

227
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,992
Maybe she's missing a protein.

228
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,128
Blood panel and enzymes
show her proteins are normal.

229
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,751
You can't have tested for every protein.

230
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:46,365
I can think of at least
one you can't test for at all.

231
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,966
Complement factor H deficiency.

232
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,671
If she has that, she's dead.

233
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,364
No way to fend off bacteria.

234
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:56,448
She'll get one infection after
another until her body shuts down.

235
00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:00,099
Maybe we can get ahead of the game.
Manage each symptom as it comes up.

236
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:03,966
It would give her five miserable
years instead of six miserable months.

237
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,266
There's no diagnostic test
for complement factor H deficiency.

238
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:10,146
So we isolate the cells
that are yummiest for it.

239
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,511
Stick a needle in her eye.

240
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,529
You're cheating on Honey.

241
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,765
What?! No, I'm not.

242
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,784
Oh, yes, you are.

243
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,960
It's okay.

244
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:28,953
I get it.

245
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:34,683
Well, I was gonna say relax, but oddly
enough you seem pretty relaxed already.

246
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,533
You're accomplished, you're funny.

247
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,781
You can have whatever you want...
women are gonna...

248
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,581
He's not cheating with another woman.

249
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,986
He's cheating with another food group.

250
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,272
What?

251
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,818
His floaters float because
they're full of fat.

252
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,599
Probably had a big
cheeseburger for lunch.

253
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:53,437
You're eating flesh?

254
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,519
It's just a hamburger. Not all the time.

255
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,470
You're disgusting!

256
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,785
The soy cakes taste like cardboard.
Unsalted cardboard.

257
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:01,445
I'm accomplished.

258
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,620
I'm funny.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,950
Can I...

260
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:06,523
have whatever I want?

261
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,068
Can we wait a second?

262
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,242
- What's wrong?
- I feel good.

263
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,034
Do you really need to put that needle...

264
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,550
You felt good yesterday,
and then you almost suffocated.

265
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,873
And you know that
that thing is in my eye?

266
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:28,344
We think it could be.

267
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,327
If we find it,
our hope is that we can treat it.

268
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,302
You hope?

269
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,955
Mom. Don't hang on every word.

270
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:36,575
He said he hopes.
That means he doesn't know.

271
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,588
I just want to understand
what's going on.

272
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,889
We won't know anything
until we do the test.

273
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,948
Addie, this all looks really scary,
but you'll feel nothing.

274
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:46,973
- Okay?
- Okay.

275
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,878
- You rang?
- You called me.

276
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,989
I bought you an espresso.

277
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,407
You've been buying me
coffee for a couple of weeks,

278
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,322
I thought I'd pay you back... with one.

279
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:52,127
How did you walk with
the cane and the two coffees?

280
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,908
Why are you suspicious?

281
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:57,956
Because it's either that or accept the
fact that you've done something nice.

282
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,457
And then I have to deal with
the horsemen and the rain of fire

283
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,949
and the end of days.
- You think I spat in yours?

284
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,072
Or worse.

285
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:07,559
I stacked them.

286
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:33,742
What do you think of me hiring
a nutritionist instead of a neurologist?

287
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:35,168
They sound almost the same.

288
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,219
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.

289
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:38,574
Don't cheapen this.

290
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:42,009
We had an in-depth conversation
about proteins and fats.

291
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,822
I was about to examine
her boyfriend's rectum.

292
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,819
You asked for a date while
your finger was in her boyfriend?

293
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,160
Got her number.

294
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:52,875
No, no. No way.

295
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,549
This is an employment application.

296
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,624
She doesn't want to go out with you,
she's looking for a job.

297
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,520
Oh, God, she's 26.

298
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,142
With the wisdom of a much younger woman.

299
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,588
- Have you spoken to Foreman?
- Several times.

300
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:14,896
- We laugh...
- You're gonna lose him.

301
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:16,447
And that will be depressing...

302
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:20,028
and will only make me appreciate
all the good things that I do have.

303
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,243
Macular biopsy was negative,
which means you're wrong.

304
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:30,444
There's no complement
factor H deficiency.

305
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:34,041
The most likely cause of altering blood
flow in the brain is a clot or a tumor.

306
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,693
We can rule out a clotting
issue because she has a bleeding issue.

307
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:38,508
Which means we should
be looking for a tumor.

308
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,184
I think there's an infection.

309
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:44,897
Just because the cells in her eye aren't
dead yet, doesn't mean they're working.

310
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,230
So why did we do the test?

311
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,124
Because if it had been positive,
it would have proved I was right.

312
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,168
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.

313
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,613
That's the beauty of the test.

314
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,271
- She needs an MRI of her brain.
- Absolutely.

315
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,676
As long as you're scanning,
you mind having a boo for an abscess,

316
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:02,527
or something caused by an infection?

317
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,966
I didn't expect House to beg me to stay,

318
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,788
but it seems like he's
in a better mood since I quit.

319
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,552
Nothing in the axial view.

320
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,648
You haven't asked me why I'm leaving.

321
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,350
I figured you'd tell
me when you wanted to.

322
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,307
I don't want to be like him.

323
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,570
You're not a jerk.

324
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,162
Thank you.

325
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:36,494
I mean,

326
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,666
sometimes you are.

327
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,009
But I don't think
we can pin that on House.

328
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,160
And you're a better doctor
than when you came through the door.

329
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm better at some things,
worse at others.

330
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:48,704
Again, not House's fault. It's a job.

331
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:52,058
You're supposed to take the good,
and leave the bad.

332
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,109
It's easier for you.

333
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,242
Why, because you think
I need to toughen up?

334
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:58,966
You think I'm weak?

335
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,631
Yeah.

336
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,199
See, I am a jerk.
I've gotta get out of here.

337
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:13,350
- What's wrong, Addie?
- My head hurts!

338
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,938
Brain's clean. No tumor and no abscess.

339
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,770
We're all wrong.

340
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:21,862
My head!

341
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,224
- Grody!
- Looks like massive tissue death.

342
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:42,186
Who cares...

343
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,067
her head blew up. How cool is that.

344
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,211
It's not puss-y.

345
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:47,314
Meaning you don't
think it's an infection.

346
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,465
And you'd be right,
if you weren't wrong.

347
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:50,468
Here we go again.

348
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,881
She's got infections that come and go,
which means...

349
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:54,615
It means it has to be something else.

350
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,967
Good guess, but no.

351
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:59,730
It means either she's
got a leprechaun in her colon,

352
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,974
which is playing with the doggy door,
letting bacteria in and out.

353
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,699
Or she's got complement
factor H deficiency.

354
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,799
Are you enjoying this?

355
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,150
I'm saving a woman's li...

356
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,965
I'm saving a woman's life!

357
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:11,887
Actually, I'm diagnosing her.

358
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,792
Technically I'm diagnosing her
with something that's gonna kill her,

359
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,946
but other than that
I am saving her life.

360
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,299
An autoimmune problem makes more sense.

361
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:23,809
You can't explain a transudative pleural
effusion with Giant Cell Arteritis.

362
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,841
You'd need three white boards
and 100 different-colored markers.

363
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,967
No, it's much more likely
she has an invisible protein

364
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,851
that allowed bacteria to
arbitrarily invade her lungs,

365
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:36,577
then arbitrarily invade her pleura,
then arbitrarily jump into her head.

366
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,441
If it's autoimmune, she can live.

367
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,774
But we have to give her steroids now,
before her heart ruptures.

368
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,549
If you're wrong and you
give her steroids, she dies now.

369
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:51,598
You want a rundown on how it feels
to go with your gut and kill a person?

370
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,095
We can get into the whole spiraling out
of control, self-doubt, resigning thing.

371
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,507
Do it.

372
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,143
The worst that can happen is you quit.

373
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,153
Cameron, want to explain to the parents

374
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:10,787
why you'll be holding
paddles while he's doing it?

375
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:13,588
Because if her heart goes boom,
it'll boom right away.

376
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:23,278
She really has to be awake for this?

377
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,792
If there's a problem,
she can tell us what she feels.

378
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:32,113
- Relax.
- We're scared.

379
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,216
I don't want you to be scared.

380
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:36,672
Then get better.

381
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,390
Okay, sweetie?

382
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:40,343
We love you.

383
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:44,179
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:49,897
Ready?

385
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,051
Ready.

386
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,072
My patient's about
to have a heart attack.

387
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:24,506
It's gonna be massive.

388
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,672
Well, that's too bad 'cause I just got
tickets to a stroke on the third floor.

389
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,823
Have you had a
conversation with Foreman?

390
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,284
- Do me a favor.
- You haven't...

391
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,305
because then you would have
to confront your own emotions.

392
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,388
Is bile an emotion?

393
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,229
Because I could definitely
feel something here.

394
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,330
Get me some licorice.

395
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,114
This is gonna be the
best heart attack of all time.

396
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:49,542
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

397
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:51,315
She's gonna shock her.

398
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:09,021
There's always tomorrow.

399
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,203
You wanted to see me?

400
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:29,971
Pretty sure the label is straight.

401
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,362
Are you really gonna leave?
Where are you going?

402
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:35,244
- You lined up interviews yet?
- I'm not sure.

403
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,176
You're pissed at House... I get it.

404
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,911
You're symbolicating killing him.

405
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:41,467
Symbolicating? What?

406
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:44,151
Symbolic-a-lating...
Gosh, that's a hard word.

407
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,502
- Are you okay?
- Hey, I'm not the one sym...

408
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,607
I'm not the one pretending
to kill someone.

409
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,382
What'd it take for you to stay?
Is it money?

410
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:53,245
- He wants you to stay.
- He said that?

411
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:55,988
If I said he said that,
would that make a difference?

412
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:57,889
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Hello?

413
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,065
Ugh, I'm leaving now.

414
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,011
I'm late for a breast thing.

415
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:07,471
You know he wants you. You know he's
good; you know he can make you good.

416
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:09,652
I don't know what I'm saying.
You don't... I don't...

417
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:12,659
You know what I'm saying
and you know I'm right. I gotta go.

418
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:15,517
Sorry it took me so long
to get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.

419
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:17,454
I guess Dr. Stein's gone.
Don't worry about it.

420
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,067
I'll talk to him when we're done.

421
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,444
Dr. Stein said they're
probably calcium deposits.

422
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:24,895
Well, with your medical history
you don't want to take any chances.

423
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:28,702
I can't seem to put on my gloves today.
It's weird.

424
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,380
Well... that's fine.
One's enough. Well, let's have a look.

425
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:38,641
You sure talk fast.

426
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,860
This is nothing.
You should see me when we're busy.

427
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,565
I just winked at you. I've never
winked at a patient in my life.

428
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:48,109
I have no... I am so sorry.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

429
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,264
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

430
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:50,144
I was hitting on you.

431
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:53,490
I wasn't consciously hitting on you,
but what else could you think?

432
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,882
That you were being reassuring?

433
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:57,583
Yeah, that would make sense.
On the other hand, I...

434
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,025
I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

435
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,118
Are you okay?

436
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,783
I feel a little sweaty.

437
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:03,832
- Am I sweating?
- Yeah.

438
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,113
- Is something wrong?
- I can't... I can't...

439
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,346
I put on gloves to do a breast exam...
perfect. Sorry.

440
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,122
It's 185.

441
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,925
185.

442
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:22,201
185?

443
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,673
Excuse me, I have to go kill someone.

444
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:31,252
You dosed me!

445
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:36,780
Yes, I did. But only because
you didn't trust me, your best friend.

446
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:39,946
- You could've killed me!
- Amphetamines aren't gonna kill you.

447
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,697
You don't know my medical history.
I... I could've...

448
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,120
You could've given me a heart attack.

449
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:48,724
A heart attack is not gonna kill you.
You were in a hospital.

450
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,288
A- ha! You yawned.

451
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:53,131
A- ha... you tried to kill me.

452
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:55,687
I put you on uppers,
and you still yawned.

453
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:58,969
Means it's a symptom of being a big,
fat liar.

454
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:01,989
Yawning is a side effect
of some anti-depressants...

455
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,184
apparently the ones you're on.

456
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,937
I'm not on anti-depressants;
I'm on speed.

457
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:10,268
That means it's a symptom of cerebral
tumor. You got six weeks to live.

458
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:14,338
Mr. Well-adjusted is as
messed up as the rest of us.

459
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:15,950
Why would you keep that a secret?

460
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,844
Are you ashamed of recognizing
how pathetic your life is?

461
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,995
It's not a secret, House!
It's... it's...

462
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:23,871
It's personal!

463
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,373
- How long has it been personal?
- It's personal!

464
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:29,972
Yawning's recent, so either you just
started or you changed prescriptions.

465
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:30,963
This is why I take them.

466
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,757
They're anti-depressants.
Not anti-annoyance-ants.

467
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:36,217
You'd think this would naturally
come up in conversation.

468
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,195
Oh, don't act hurt. You don't care.

469
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:40,887
On one of those occasions
when you're pompously lecturing me on

470
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:42,972
what to do to fix my life.
- You wouldn't take them.

471
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,531
You'd rather OD on Vicodin
or stick electrodes in your head

472
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,376
because you could say
you did it to get high.

473
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:50,670
The only reason to take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

474
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,721
You have to admit that you're depressed.

475
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:53,845
Gimme.

476
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,208
Are you gonna admit that...

477
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,559
Nope. I'm gonna prove
that I'm not depressed.

478
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:06,410
Well, I can't give you my prescription.
You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.

479
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:07,833
You need a whole work-up.

480
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,395
Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke.

481
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,737
I... wouldn't drink that.

482
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,034
My leg hurt, and I...

483
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:15,871
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

484
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,204
- We've been calling.
- I was sleeping.

485
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:24,686
What did you do?

486
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,298
Nothing.

487
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,733
This is how regular people
look when you wake them up.

488
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:35,974
Chase was wrong.
Addie's kidneys shut down.

489
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,030
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

490
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,481
Peripheral smear of
red cells had schistocytes.

491
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,718
HUS is usually caused by an
infection or a protein deficiency.

492
00:28:58,589 --> 00:28:59,659
What a coincidence.

493
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,097
I know a patient with an
infection and a protein deficiency.

494
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:05,615
You think it's possible
there's a connection?

495
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,318
I want to hear you say it, Chase.

496
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:08,893
It will please me.

497
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,434
Doesn't mean you're right.
You predicted cardiac arrest...

498
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:12,901
instant cardiac arrest.

499
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,000
There were only two choices. Since yours
was wrong, mine must've been right.

500
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,761
Either that or we missed the leprechaun.

501
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:20,557
If you're right,
there's nothing to be done.

502
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,468
The steroid treatment we gave
her means when the next infection hits,

503
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:25,955
it'll hit hard.
Liver failure, cardiac arrest...

504
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,713
On the bright side,
it confirms my diagnosis.

505
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:34,626
Don't you see how
incredible this call was?

506
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:38,075
A protein deficiency.
Can't be tested, can't be seen.

507
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:40,379
I called it based on coughing blood.

508
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,785
- You're happy about this.
- She's going to die.

509
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,034
That's not my fault.

510
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,766
She's gonna die anyway.

511
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,791
But now, thanks to me,
at least she'll know why.

512
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:53,142
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude
in her eyes when you tell her.

513
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,700
- I'm not telling her.
- I'm not telling her.

514
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:58,311
No one's telling her.
Not 'til we're sure I'm right.

515
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:01,187
But we're gonna wait for her to
stroke or have a heart attack to confirm

516
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:02,188
before we tell her.

517
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:04,711
Seems like the humane approach.

518
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,038
Her heart went into V-fib.

519
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,159
Brought her back.

520
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:53,532
Barely.

521
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:54,794
Congratulations.

522
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:56,605
You have your confirmation.

523
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,590
What's her name?

524
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:11,429
- Who? The co-ed?
- Sure.

525
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,367
Dead sophomore girl?

526
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,910
You know her father's name?

527
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,170
Dad.

528
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:21,833
Her mother's name is Mommy.

529
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:25,702
Ben and Jodie are about to
lose their only daughter, Addie.

530
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,514
You think they're gonna
give a crap if I know their names?

531
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,076
Five years from now when
the father's looking at photographs

532
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:33,971
of his daughter graduating from
high school, they're not gonna remember

533
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,972
the nice black doctor who
called them by their first name.

534
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,525
You don't wanna quit.

535
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,150
- You saying you don't want me to quit?
- Didn't sound like I said that.

536
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:52,835
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying
to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass.

537
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:55,054
'Cause you know who you are.

538
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,255
And you figure if you
can make me decent and caring,

539
00:31:58,256 --> 00:31:59,701
then maybe there's a hope for you...

540
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:03,555
You are about to tell a girl she's
dying. And you think it's about you.

541
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,709
God, I hope I'm not you.

542
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:28,078
I'm sorry.

543
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,039
Addie, you're dying.

544
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:37,992
Are you sure?

545
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,156
Yes.

546
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:45,229
Your infections will get worse.
The toxins will spill into your blood.

547
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:47,607
How long?

548
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,350
Two days...

549
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,700
maybe less.

550
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:53,724
- You have a condition called...
- It doesn't matter.

551
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,424
It's, um,
a very rare protein deficiency...

552
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:00,224
I don't want to hear it.

553
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:07,926
Okay.

554
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,494
It's what's killing you.

555
00:33:27,676 --> 00:33:30,769
This is what's killing you. You're
not interested in what's killing you?

556
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,320
Will that make any difference?

557
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,888
- Will I live any longer?
- Please, could you just leave?

558
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:39,643
What's the point of living without
curiosity? Without craving the...

559
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:43,720
So I'm screwing up my last few
hours because I won't listen to you?

560
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:45,743
Get out of here.

561
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,164
It's... it's... it's like the...

562
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,139
dark matter in the universe.

563
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,790
You're smiling.

564
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:54,054
No, I'm not.

565
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:58,208
You can only diagnose a
problem by looking at what's...

566
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:02,645
missing.

567
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,151
Oh, God.

568
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:10,235
I have to go.

569
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:17,792
Nineteen-year-old

570
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:21,847
didn't want to hear the coolest
explanation of why she's gonna die.

571
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:22,948
Begged me to shut up.

572
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:26,472
If you can't shut up,
at least talk quietly.

573
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:30,636
Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch.
She thought that I was happy.

574
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:37,552
- You were happy.
- No, I was hazy.

575
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:41,828
I don't get hazy on Vicodin
or anything else I throw down.

576
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,991
Which means I was throwing
down something I didn't know I was.

577
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:48,386
Which got me to wondering... why
didn't you give me those happy pills?

578
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,099
I told you; you gotta be checked out...

579
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,300
No, you just didn't
want me double dosing.

580
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:55,917
You dosed me!

581
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,859
Those coffees...

582
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,476
They worked.
You've been smiling. Relaxed... happy.

583
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,538
A dying girl thought I was happy.

584
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:06,081
A moron thought I was happy.

585
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,293
Who the hell doesn't
want to know why she's dying?

586
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:10,007
- House was happy.
- Hazy.

587
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,179
- Happy.
- Hazy!

588
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,465
Oh, right,
a dying girl mistook hazy for happy.

589
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:16,766
Because dying people
see happiness everywhere.

590
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,700
- She's miserable.
- She wasn't miserable.

591
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,856
Of course she was miserable.
You just told her she...

592
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,907
She was not different
than she'd ever been.

593
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:28,731
She was not different
than she'd ever been.

594
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,085
Oh, God.

595
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,469
I gotta go.

596
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:45,463
I need a minute with your daughter.

597
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:48,464
- Dr. House, get out of here before...
- She's gonna live.

598
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:50,401
Does that help?

599
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,015
Now get out.

600
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:53,386
Are you jerking us around?

601
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,337
Get out!

602
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,352
You...

603
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:07,717
have got leprechauns in ya.

604
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,695
Depression manifests
in lots of different ways.

605
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,069
Some people can't
get out of bed all day.

606
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,734
Others have serial relationships
and become oncologists.

607
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:24,841
- I'm dying; I'm not depressed.
- Wrong and wrong.

608
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:28,988
You tried to kill yourself
by throwing down kitchen cleanser.

609
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,695
Now, most normal suicidal
morons would've just drank the stuff.

610
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:37,750
Burn the hell out of
their mouth and throat.

611
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,484
Painful, but not deadly.

612
00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:42,495
But being a college-educated,
suicidal moron,

613
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:47,002
you wrapped it in gel caps
or gum which left no trace.

614
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,376
It burned a hole in your intestine.

615
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,232
But the body can repair
almost anything...

616
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:53,884
which is cool.

617
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,807
In your case,
scar tissue closed up the hole.

618
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,653
But it also formed a bridge
between a vein and an artery.

619
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:04,824
Now, veins are supposed to
help the intestine flush bacteria away.

620
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,074
But the bridge allowed the
bacteria entrance to the artery

621
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,106
where they got a free ride...

622
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:11,528
everywhere.

623
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:17,258
Can you fix me?

624
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:23,771
Surgery can fix the bridge.
Take about two hours.

625
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:27,923
Psychotherapy's gonna
take you a little longer.

626
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:33,755
Why'd you do it?

627
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:39,932
I don't know.

628
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,151
I just...

629
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,117
have never been happy.

630
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:53,505
Please don't tell my parents.

631
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:57,209
They'll blame themselves,
and it's not their fault.

632
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,660
Please, you can't tell them.

633
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,908
Technically, all you have to do

634
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:09,097
is promise me that
you won't do it again.

635
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:11,823
Then legally, I can't tell them.

636
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,055
I promise.

637
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,061
Yeah. Sure.

638
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:02,694
- We can't thank you enough...
- Your daughter tried to kill herself.

639
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:06,406
That's why she's here.

640
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,972
Legally, I'm supposed to
keep that between me and her.

641
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,273
Which makes sense.
She's obviously an adult.

642
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:15,556
Capable of her own
well-reasoned decisions.

643
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:20,144
You're sure?

644
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:23,368
If she doesn't die in
the next couple of hours...

645
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,142
yeah, I'm right.

646
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:28,062
How could she hide this?

647
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:32,289
Everyone has secrets.

648
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,161
We'll take care of her. Figure it out.

649
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:41,753
Make her happy?

650
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:44,387
Get her into therapy.

651
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:50,974
Might want to try some meds too.

652
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:57,246
Can we call you?

653
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,560
If we have any questions.

654
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:02,437
No.

655
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,740
'Sup?

656
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:14,202
Nothing.

657
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:16,265
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

658
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,970
House's patient.

659
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:23,277
Yeah, the one that would've
died if not for him.

660
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,372
- Subtle.
- Thanks.

661
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:32,678
You're really scared
you'll turn into him.

662
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:36,714
Don't tell me I'm better than him. Don't
tell me take the good, leave the bad.

663
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:37,865
Cameron already tried.

664
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:42,665
I'm telling you there
are worse things to turn into.

665
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,964
It's not worth it.

666
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:13,982
I didn't think you were gonna show.

667
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:15,165
Sorry.

668
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:17,238
Surgery went a little late.

669
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:21,781
So you really think I have
all the necessary qualifications?

670
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:26,635
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth.
What do you got there?

671
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:28,825
Peppermint tea.

672
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:32,668
I'm going to have a mug
of peppermint tea, please.

673
00:41:36,516 --> 00:41:38,266
This isn't a job interview, is it?

674
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:41,775
It's some kind of interview.

675
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,526
You're judging me, I'm judging you.

676
00:41:46,332 --> 00:41:47,582
You have the upper hand.

677
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:49,986
I don't know anything about you.

678
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:54,864
I'm on anti-depressants

679
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,998
'cause a doctor friend
of mine thinks I'm miserable.

680
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,899
I don't like them. They make me hazy.

681
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,284
I eat meat. I like drugs.

682
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,020
And I'm not always faithful
to the women I date.

683
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:09,733
You don't seem depressed.
