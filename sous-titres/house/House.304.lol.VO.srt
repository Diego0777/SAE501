1
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:02,548
Follow my finger.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,701
Adam.

3
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,235
Show me...

4
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:09,404
a bicycle.

5
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:16,004
Eyes here.

6
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:22,298
Adam.

7
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,124
Show me a bicycle.

8
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,516
No, buddy, that's a ball.

9
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,986
Adam, look at me. Are you hungry?

10
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,965
Show me what you want for lunch.

11
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:11,214
Still drawing those lines
instead of looking at the cards.

12
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,249
More juice?

13
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,638
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

14
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:21,992
Adam.

15
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:24,811
- Buddy, eyes here.
- He's tired, Dom.

16
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:27,293
Wouldn't be if we stuck to the schedule.

17
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:29,997
Show me the juice, buddy.

18
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:33,802
I think we've reached the
point of diminishing returns.

19
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,436
He has to ask for it. Adam.

20
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:38,583
He's choking.

21
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,032
That's impossible. It's mac and cheese.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,500

23
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:25,268
Ten-year-old boy,
screams for his life for no reason.

24
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,221
He's autistic. Severely autistic.

25
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:31,058
Can't talk, can't make eye contact.

26
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,612
Screaming's probably
his way of communicating.

27
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:36,145
And he went to three different
doctors who all said just that.

28
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,898
Well, so clearly,
that can't be the answer.

29
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,122
His brain can't filter information. It's
a constant assault on his senses. I'd

30
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,073
scream too.

31
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:47,092
Or it's something medical sounding,
like dysesthesia.

32
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:51,216
Parents are convinced that
there's something wrong with their son.

33
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:55,743
Since when did we start
believing parents? Or anyone?

34
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:56,744
Where are we going?

35
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,326
Elevator.

36
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:02,430
Dad was on Wall Street,
mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

37
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,751
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

38
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,907
So they're overprotective and scared.
That's all the more reason to discount--

39
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,580
They study this kid.
Heard him scream a million times.

40
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,231
But in ten years of caring for him,
It's

41
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:14,217
the first time they've
brought him to a hospital.

42
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,420
E.R. checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

43
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,769
Which means the only symptom was a
scream, which is diagnostic of nothing.

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,873
Kid clutched his chest, B.P. was
elevated. Maybe there was chest pain.

45
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:24,374
E.R. said the heart was fine.

46
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,537
Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.

47
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,088
- Where are we going?
- Down.

48
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,531
Stool sample to check for parasites.

49
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,522
Blood culture to rule out infection.
And ana for lupus.

50
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:34,879
Because he screamed?

51
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,265
Could also be an environmental reaction.

52
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,539
An allergy. Dust, wheat, pollen.

53
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,960
A toxin, or something he ate--

54
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,927
Check the house and
run a lung ventilation scan.

55
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,286
Lungs are in the chest too, right?

56
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,737
I had a date last night. She screamed.
Should we spend $100,000 testing her?

57
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,188
Of course not.
This isn't a veterinary hospital.

58
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:51,392
Zing!

59
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:53,464
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving--

60
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:54,678
That's not what I'm saying.

61
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,369
Well, it's too bad. It's a good point.

62
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,970
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

63
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,859
You know what it's gonna be like,
trying to put an autistic kid

64
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,210
into a nuclear scanner?
I don't envy you guys.

65
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,153
I want my old carpet back.

66
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,873
We're gonna have to do this later.

67
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,641
A kid... in the clinic had an accident.

68
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:18,448
Generally, when people are on the--

69
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,273
I want my old carpet back.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,880
- It was stained with blood.
- Yeah, my blood.

71
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:25,582
Which makes the carpet part of me.
I want it back.

72
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,871
I want to be buried with it.

73
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:30,972
You think you can get me to do anything
you want, regardless of how stupid it is?

74
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:31,925
It's my office!

75
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,844
It's where I work.
Where I think. Where I save lives,

76
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:38,309
allowing you to brag to rich
people so they'll give you more money

77
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,061
to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops.

78
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,523
I want it back the way it was.

79
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,524
It's identical to the old carpet.

80
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,698
Except without the
hazardous biological waste.

81
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:52,116
I shall not return to my office until
every patented durable micro fiber has

82
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,870
- been restored to its rightful place.
- Inspiring.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,399
You don't want to work in your office,
work in the clinic.

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,512
You don't want to work in the clinic,
go home. And don't get paid.

85
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:04,826
Attica! Attica! Attica!

86
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,541
Attica?

87
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,977
He, uh, just needs to finish this level.

88
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,687
We only have the scanner
up for the next half hour.

89
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,088
- After that--
- Trust me.

90
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,750
You don't want to move
him until he's finished.

91
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,920
Sooner we do this test,
the sooner we can get you guys home.

92
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,090
Adam.

93
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,600
Do you think that-- that we--

94
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,175
Ten minutes, tops.

95
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,478
If he has a vascular disorder,
he might not have that--

96
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:48,118
He might not have ten minutes?

97
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,624
I don't have ten minutes.

98
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,150
No, no, you don't wanna do that--

99
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:54,877
Adam. Adam.

100
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:03,036
I used metamucil
like the doctor told me,

101
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,419
and finally I was
able to use the bathroom.

102
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:10,771
But I saw something in
the toilet I couldn't identify.

103
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:15,530
I-I wrapped it in tissue
paper --so you could take a look.

104
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,605
Couldn't you sedate him or something?

105
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,606
I could if I didn't want
the test results to mean anything.

106
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,700
Painkillers, exercising.

107
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,807
We even did that puncture thing.

108
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:46,554
Nothing works.

109
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,140
And this morning,
I get up, my back feels great.

110
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,825
I figured I'd better
get down here right away.

111
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,064
Big shocker.

112
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,292
Dad's depressed.

113
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,061
Save your time.

114
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,912
SSRIs don't cause chest pain.

115
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,297
Every minute of every day is booked.

116
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:18,442
When he eats,
sleeps, plays his handheld.

117
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:20,527
Not much of a life for them.

118
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,292
They chose to have a family.

119
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:25,043
You don't get to decide
what your kid's gonna be like.

120
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:26,999
Nobody chooses this.

121
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,408
It's funny.

122
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,690
You get a normal kid, the parent works.

123
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,807
You get a special kid that costs more,

124
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,739
they quit and turn the
backyard into a therapy circuit.

125
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,680
Yes, if only you were handicapped.

126
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,758
All the good times
you could've had with Dad.

127
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,253
Hi, Dr. House.

128
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,369
Hello, girl whose name I don't remember,

129
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:09,483
but whose dad I treated,
so I don't really know why she's here.

130
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:10,434
Ali.

131
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,890
Um, I think I caught what my dad has.

132
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,530
The rhino thing.

133
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,355
Right.

134
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,378
Does that hurt?

135
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:21,274
A little.

136
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,880
It's in my chest, too.

137
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,736
Of course it is.

138
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,344
Kinda had access through the shirt.

139
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,212
But this'll work.

140
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:44,566
Feels good.

141
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,358
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

142
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,157
About five weeks ago.

143
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,154
It's been very lonely.

144
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:08,010
The ventilation scan was normal.
Time to send him home.

145
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,523
Can't leave right now.

146
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:13,873
Well, congratulations. You are the proud
owner of your very own rhino thing.

147
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:16,561
A rhinovirus-- you can't
leave because she has a cold?

148
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,862
Can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

149
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,628
All the tests are normal.

150
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:27,712
Okay, don't start with me.
We're backed up.

151
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,401
I know this is hard for all of us,
but thanks to Dr. Cuddy,

152
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,338
I don't have an office.
So I have to work here.

153
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,839
What'd she do to your office?

154
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,016
It's unusable.

155
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:40,195
So whatever is bothering him, it wasn't
his lungs. What about the kid's house?

156
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:43,271
There were some pesticides and some
alcohol, but the tox screen was negative.

157
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,650
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong with this kid.

158
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,064
We already had that discussion.

159
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,165
We get a fecal smear?

160
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,152
Should we do this someplace else?

161
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:52,047
No, Cuddy says I have to work here.

162
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:56,172
No, I said you can work in
your office or you had to work here.

163
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,501
And since I can't work in my office...

164
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,358
Is this your master plan?

165
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:04,012
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

166
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,221
Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie.

167
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:08,901
Fecal smear!

168
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,966
- Talk to me.
- Get out of here.

169
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,116
- You'll put back my carpet?
- No.

170
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:13,971
Get out of here!

171
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:16,372
Fecal matter.
Is there a sample we can look at?

172
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:18,986
Parents have the smear kit.
The kid is constipated.

173
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:20,104
Do what you want.

174
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,489
Not replacing your carpet.

175
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,543
Go up his rear and get a smear.

176
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,893
Which reminds me,
I kinda feel like a bagel.

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,110
Carpets.

178
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,047
We need a stool sample.

179
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,742
We should probably wait until
he's finished playing that level, huh?

180
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:48,297
I actually think he's a bit better
today. He seems more like his old self.

181
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,248
It is possible that he was never sick.

182
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,474
I guess we, uh, could've overreacted.

183
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,578
So what makes fluid fill
the lining of a kid's lungs?

184
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,677
Why are we in here?
Is this some sort of power play?

185
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:13,919
Yeah.

186
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:17,372
So you stuck your finger in
the kid and gave him a pleural effusion.

187
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:20,048
You ever considered getting a manicure?

188
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,151
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

189
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:24,216
Or do you really have
a problem with the carpeting?

190
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,967
- Change sets you off--
- I said it was a power play.

191
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:30,119
Someone answers "yes" to option A,
you don't move on to option B.

192
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,741
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out heart failure.

193
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,046
Why now? Why a power play now?

194
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,278
I smelled weakness.

195
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,522
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

196
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,372
That's funny. It says

197
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:48,779
"James Wilson."

198
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:51,052
A strange typo.

199
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:55,313
If the fluid comes back an exudate,
get him on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

200
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,808
- Thank you for coming.
- No problem.

201
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,128
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

202
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,312
You share stories, feelings...

203
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:07,735
toys.

204
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,707
You don't share offices.

205
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,560
That is so not zen.

206
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,190
It was a gift.

207
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,248
Some doctors get those.

208
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,687
- So you want mornings or afternoons?
- You couldn't make Cuddy miserable,

209
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:23,885
so you're gonna make me miserable so I
can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?

210
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:24,910
Yeah.

211
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,868
What makes you think
I can make her miserable?

212
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,236
Because you're good at that stuff.

213
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,006
Oh, I'm nothing compared to you.

214
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,501
Is there anything you'll throw out?

215
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,772
That's a gift from an
11-year-old patient of mine.

216
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:37,164
She and I both knew it was a piece
of junk, and that's what made her laugh.

217
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,815
So you gotta keep it until she--

218
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:40,554
She already did.

219
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:52,440
Adam.

220
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,091
I need you to stay still, buddy.

221
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,052
It's okay, it's okay. I got him.

222
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,016
There we go.

223
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,126
What?

224
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,741
What is it? Is his heart okay?

225
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,198
No.

226
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,862
Echo suggested a conduction abnormality.
EKG confirmed it.

227
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,917
Still doesn't explain the effusion.

228
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,443
The pleural fluid was an exudate.
We should be looking for something

229
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,555
that explains both the
heart and lung problems.

230
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,587
Infection, parasite, cancer.

231
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,316
Microbiology showed no organisms
in the fluid, so forget infection.

232
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:38,898
It's not a power play.

233
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:44,626
Doing a differential in the
clinic makes sense. Piss Cuddy off.

234
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,888
Same thing with Wilson's office.
Works indirectly.

235
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,048
But now, we are in office space.

236
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,938
Because you don't want
to be in your own office.

237
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:54,464
Which means this has
nothing to do with Cuddy.

238
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,683
You really are obsessed
with your carpets. Which means--

239
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,018
What are you doing here?

240
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,110
I have this room booked
from 2:00 to 3:00.

241
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,260
Oh, 2:00 east coast time.

242
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:07,952
I thought you meant pacific.

243
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,099
Which is...

244
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,445
stupid of me, I guess.

245
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:13,482
What about parasites?

246
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:16,796
- Stool sample was negative.
- It's 2:00.

247
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,705
Oh, well, we should go, then.

248
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,118
That just leaves cancer.

249
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:22,930
Get a lung biopsy.

250
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:26,042
It took a half an hour to get
the mask on the kid for the lung scan.

251
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:28,693
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was there somewhere you needed to be?

252
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:33,954
House.

253
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:35,697
Can we talk?

254
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:41,976
- Carpet?
- Never.

255
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,645
Nothing to talk about.

256
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:47,076
Your girlfriend called the
clinic 15 times looking for you today.

257
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,692
Lot to discuss. China patterns--

258
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,169
House. She's a stalker.

259
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:52,295
Right.

260
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,798
Couldn't be that she finds
me interesting. Attractive.

261
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,719
- Has to be that she's insane.
- She's called you 15 times.

262
00:14:57,723 --> 00:14:59,392
Your mother's not
that interested in you.

263
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,247
Well, maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

264
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,413
- I'm notifying security.
- Is this about the carpet?

265
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,367
You think I'll back
off if you block all my fun?

266
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,663
You better not be having fun.

267
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,464
I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.

268
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,292
- She's dangerous.
- She's not dangerous.

269
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,876
- She's pretty.
- She's pretty.

270
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,977
- Men are stupid.
- I'm with you so far.

271
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:15,332
I'm notifying security.

272
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,750
Oh, give her a break.
She's not dangerous, she's...

273
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:20,836
insightful.

274
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,197
You can't stop our love!

275
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,327
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:33,728
We have a ten-year-old

277
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,849
with pleural effusion and conduction
abnormality but no heart failure.

278
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,513
Was there a protein
in the pleural fluid?

279
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,663
Yeah, that's why we're thinking cancer.
Non-Hodgkin's, probably.

280
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,264
So we want to do a lung biopsy.

281
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:47,598
Lung biopsies usually come back negative.
So biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

282
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,056
That's probably something
an oncologist should do, right?

283
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,134
There's nothing real tricky to it.
It's a biopsy.

284
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:53,581
Still, just to be safe,

285
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:55,365
you mind?

286
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:06,829
For the love of god!
Can't somebody shut that kid up?

287
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,428
Some people are trying
to work around here.

288
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,491
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

289
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,362
Who are you?

290
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,297
Somebody you'll never send a a gift to.

291
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,198
This is Dr. House. Your son's doctor.

292
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:17,939
High test, please.

293
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,200
Out of vicodin?

294
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:28,745
What are you doing?

295
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,481
Eating the red berries.

296
00:16:58,997 --> 00:16:59,947
He trusted you.

297
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,498
No, that wasn't trust. That was...

298
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:04,828
self-preservation.

299
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,460
No. That was huge.

300
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,322
It was like a conversation.

301
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:10,465
A monk--

302
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:15,738
A monkey's afraid to eat the red berries
until he sees another monkey eat them.

303
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,817
Monkey see, monkey do.
That's all it was.

304
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,416
Your kid's still just as
messed up as when we admitted him.

305
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,606
That was sensitive.

306
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,179
You have pretty hair.

307
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,762
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

308
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,272
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

309
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,461
What they should do
is get a cocker spaniel.

310
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,190
A dog would look them in the eye.

311
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:54,911
Wag his tail when he's happy.

312
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:56,749
Lick their face, show them love.

313
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,225
Is it so wrong for them
to want to have a normal child?

314
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:00,926
It's normal to want to be normal.

315
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,916
Spoken like a true circle queen.

316
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,427
See, skinny,
socially privileged white people

317
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:11,685
get to draw this neat little circle. And
everyone inside the circle is normal.

318
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:16,102
Everyone outside the circle
should be beaten, broken, and reset

319
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,582
so they can be brought into the circle.

320
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:22,670
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized. Or worse, pitied.

321
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:25,325
So it's wrong to feel
sorry for this little boy?

322
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:28,867
Why would you feel sorry for someone who
gets to opt out of the inane courteous

323
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:32,818
formalities which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore degrading?

324
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,105
This kid doesn't have to pretend
to be interested in your back pain,

325
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,656
or your excretions,
or your grandma's itchy place.

326
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,122
Can you imagine how liberating
it would be to live a life

327
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,602
free of all the mind-numbing
social niceties?

328
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,790
I don't pity this kid.

329
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:49,687
I envy him.

330
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,328
Uh, no cancer.

331
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:54,822
Because...

332
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,188
These aren't lymph cells.

333
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Then what are they?

334
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,245
Liver cells.

335
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,958
Liver cells under his arm.

336
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,059
Wonder what he's got where
his liver's supposed to be.

337
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,210
Anyone got a clue how liver
cells got into the kid's armpit?

338
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:39,003
Make yourself at home.

339
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,070
So, you think maybe gray's
anatomy got it all wrong?

340
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,540
Lymph system circulates fluid,
not organ cells.

341
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,104
Cancer cells break into
the lymphatic system all the time.

342
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,776
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

343
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:53,377
What's the difference between
cancer cells and liver cells?

344
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,425
Why can one pass through
walls but the other can't?

345
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,856
Cancer cells are damaged.
Lets them grow into blood vessels.

346
00:19:57,857 --> 00:19:58,768
Go wherever they want.

347
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,322
So if the liver cells are damaged--

348
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,447
Liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

349
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,377
So if the liver cells are damaged,

350
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,870
it's theoretically possible
to pass into the lymphatic system.

351
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,984
Liver failure could also explain
pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

352
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:13,615
Liver cells are fine.
He was immunized for hep A and B, and

353
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:17,566
do you really think this kid is having
unprotected sex or sharing needles?

354
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,547
Daddy does seem the
type to use a rubber.

355
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:22,468
So it's not viral.

356
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:25,375
That just leaves "lotta-booze-irrhosis."

357
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:29,824
Our ten-year-old boy does no
thave a drinking problem or cirrhosis.

358
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,264
House, when we echoed his heart,
we got a piece of his liver.

359
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,684
- There was no scarring.
- Cirrhosis explains the symptoms.

360
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:35,849
Heart problems, lungs--

361
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,377
Look up "cirrhosis" in the dictionary.
It means "scarring."

362
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,428
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.

363
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,008
How would you know that?

364
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:42,959
Kid can't talk.

365
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,033
Why'd you think I took this case?
He's not gonna give away the ending.

366
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:47,534
They quit their jobs for him.

367
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:50,259
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

368
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,369
Unfortunately,
their kid is nothing you'd want.

369
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:56,344
When a baby is born, it's perfect.

370
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,696
Little fingers, little toes.

371
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:00,670
Plump, perfect, pink.

372
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:03,589
And brimming with unbridled potential.

373
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,655
But then it's downhill.

374
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:07,711
Some hills steeper than others.

375
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,029
Parents get off on their
kids' accomplishments--

376
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,669
- Bend over and relax.
- Cute.

377
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:17,481
They'll annoy you with
trophy rooms and report cards.

378
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,002
Hell, they'll even show you a purple cow

379
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,703
and tell you what a keen
eye for color their kid has.

380
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:31,368
But this kid...

381
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,179
He doesn't smile,
he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh.

382
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:36,509
His parents get nothing--

383
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:39,769
The right to brag that their
kid picked orange juice out of a lineup.

384
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,220
So you figure they slip the
kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.

385
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,030
Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis.

386
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:49,147
And don't try and pawn it off on
Wilson-- he's gonna be busy with Cuddy.

387
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,705
My parents loved me unconditionally.

388
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:57,915
Get out of here.

389
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,326
Don't you think the restraining
order's a little much?

390
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,268
He's not actually going to
have sex with a 17-year-old patient.

391
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,974
I didn't think he was gonna ask me to

392
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:11,380
dig a blood stained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

393
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,181
It might be easier in the long run.

394
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:18,547
Are we stopping here
so House doesn't find us?

395
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,790
Unless you want to make out.

396
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,851
You want me to surrender
to House's coup?

397
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:26,913
No, no, you

398
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,739
proactively...

399
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:31,345
give him what he wants.

400
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,698
I defeat him by surrendering to him.

401
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,151
He'll never see it coming.

402
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:36,677
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

403
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,001
What is it,
a thousand bucks to carpet a room?

404
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:40,023
Actually, it's 400.

405
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:41,449
- Oh--
- Not doing it.

406
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:49,803
Liver biopsy?

407
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:51,638
They're doing it now.

408
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:52,589
How's it going?

409
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:53,902
Like a biopsy.

410
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,109
Needles, cells. Screaming.

411
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,797
What'd you find in the stool sample?

412
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:00,548
You were too busy bothering Cuddy,

413
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,298
but as discussed, it was negative
for parasites. Can we get out of here?

414
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,763
I didn't ask what you didn't find.

415
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:07,884
I asked what you did
find in the stool sample.

416
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:08,835
Stool.

417
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,451
And traces of iron,
zinc, calcium carbonate.

418
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,272
- Can we leave?
- What's the matter?

419
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,423
You afraid of the man?

420
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:20,606
Too late.

421
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,242
Leave my stuff alone!

422
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,835
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim
in 15 minutes. Wearing that?

423
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,006
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm gonna fire you.

424
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:31,760
One--

425
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:34,196
Calcium carbonate,
that's an antidiarrheal, right?

426
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:34,918
Two--

427
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,269
You think that's significant?
You think hard poops is significant?

428
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:40,564
Two and a half?

429
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:45,533
Never threaten unless you're
ready to deliver. Makes you look weak.

430
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,460
Thank god you don't have children.

431
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,962
Dr. Cuddy.

432
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:55,306
Take a message.

433
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,885
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

434
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:05,226
That's like the one thing
that would get me outta here.

435
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,071
I'm sorry, you can't come in here now.

436
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,022
What's going on?

437
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,821
He's in V-fib.

438
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:20,349
Charging.

439
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:21,998
Clear.

440
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:23,692
- Charging.
- Clear.

441
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,100
He's stable for the moment.

442
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,235
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

443
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:45,649
Okay.

444
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:46,945
What else do we know?

445
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:50,017
His liver's damaged; pleural
effusion compromised his lung function.

446
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,768
Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis.

447
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:54,156
Parents didn't poison their son.

448
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:57,858
It's not his liver,
his heart, or his lungs.

449
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:01,555
It's the calcium carbonate in his stool.

450
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:04,311
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably just overdid it.

451
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:05,762
Or they didn't do it at all.

452
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,684
Calcium carbonate's
also what's in chalk.

453
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,617
So he ate some chalk. It isn't toxic--
sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.

454
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:14,980
- Forget the chalk.
- You just said it was about the chalk.

455
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,980
Yes, and then I said,
"forget the chalk."

456
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,331
You must be very confused.

457
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:19,833
This kid's got pica.

458
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,924
Take him to a buffet,
he's gonna eat the table.

459
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:23,875
Or lead paint.

460
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:26,502
Level of lead in the blood was normal.
His tox screen was clean.

461
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:29,385
We're not looking for typical poisons.
We're looking for anything that

462
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,690
he can put in his mouth.
Matches, spiders, bricks.

463
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:34,369
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

464
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:35,513
Even better.

465
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:39,162
Hansel? Get samples of the
gingerbread house. Bag everything.

466
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:56,813
You could get into a lot of trouble,
being here.

467
00:25:57,796 --> 00:26:00,186
- I wanted to see you.
- Yeah, I got that.

468
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:02,774
So did everyone else.

469
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,381
They think you're a stalker.

470
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:08,943
One could argue those people
might be jealous of your attention.

471
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,969
Yes, I actually made that argument.

472
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:13,695
You going home?

473
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,350
That's the plan.

474
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,496
In Iceland, the age of consent is 14.

475
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:23,905
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry up there.

476
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:25,832
So today I'm jailbait.

477
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,635
But in 22 weeks...

478
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:30,911
anybody can do anything to me.

479
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:34,998
Will I be so different in 22 weeks?

480
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:39,188
22 weeks is enough for
an embryo to grow arms and legs.

481
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,587
It's just a line.

482
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:44,530
An arbitrary line drawn by
a bunch of sad, old men in robes.

483
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,011
Yeah. Who cares what the judges think?

484
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:53,255
Didn't think of you as a guy who followed
rules just because they were rules.

485
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,700
You are...
over ten years younger than me.

486
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:04,338
I said over.

487
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:08,808
Gotta go!

488
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,046
House.

489
00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:11,552
Dr. Cuddy!

490
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:14,839
Do you happen to know the
way to the icelandic consulate?

491
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,790
This young woman,

492
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:18,515
a stranger to me,
was just asking directions.

493
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,662
Security was gonna call the police.

494
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:22,713
I don't want to do that to you. Go home.

495
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:23,911
She needed a ride.

496
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,690
She got her on her own,
she can get home on her own.

497
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,910
Now.

498
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,438
And if I see you on hospital
grounds again, I will call the police.

499
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:49,286
After that look, I'm

500
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,130
feeling a little frisky.
Looks like you're up.

501
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,060
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

502
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:57,675
The frisky, it went away.

503
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,050
House, this isn't a game.

504
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,875
If I leave her alone,
can I have my carpet back?

505
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,750
No.

506
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,083
If I forget about my carpet,
can I have her?

507
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,205
Jimsonweed.

508
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,948
Found a small patch
of it in his backyard.

509
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:44,657
Jimsonweed contains atropine.

510
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:46,221
Poor man's acid.

511
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:50,086
Our kid's been tripping on
Lucy in the sky with cubic zirconia.

512
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:52,741
Explains the pleural effusion,
the heart arrhythmias.

513
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:54,764
Meeting here will do
nothing to upset Cuddy.

514
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:55,996
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

515
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,213
I'm trying to figure out
what's wrong with the patient.

516
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,932
- Continue.
- I'm done.

517
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,240
Jimsonweed doesn't
explain the screaming.

518
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,398
You've obviously never had a bad trip.

519
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,869
I would've thought you'd
try to accomplish two goals at once.

520
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,308
Why can't you be more like
the other age-inappropriate girls

521
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:10,449
who have a thing for me?

522
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,600
Just accept me for me.

523
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:14,512
Continue.

524
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:17,472
Treatment for jimsonweed
OD is physostigmine.

525
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:20,143
Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

526
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:21,880
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

527
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:24,639
Serum from the lab in Paterson
is three days, minimum.

528
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,410
He won't survive three days.

529
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,630
What time does he wake up?

530
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:29,895
7:35 AM.

531
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,253
Then what? Walk me through it.

532
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,400
7:40 to 7:50, he goes to the toilet,
washes his face. What does this matter?

533
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:37,942
I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.

534
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,972
His schedule has nothing
to do with jimsonweed.

535
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:43,060
There are two possibilities-- either
the parents saw him eat the plant,

536
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:47,111
or the kid has unsupervised time and eats
plants instead of playing with blocks.

537
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:50,475
Even if you find 15 minutes of free
time outside, doesn't mean he spent it

538
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,353
- eating a bush.
- So what do we do?

539
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:53,146
Nothing?

540
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,897
Wait for the kid to tell us? What?

541
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:01,124
Where are you going?

542
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,767
To talk to him.

543
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,637
- Ever see your son eat a bush?
- I haven't.

544
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,452
I've only ever seen him eat what--

545
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,403
Adam, you ate something at your house.

546
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,241
Something that made you sick.

547
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,342
I need you to show me what you ate.

548
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:27,292
- He can't answer you.
- Neither can you.

549
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,347
This is your backyard.

550
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,342
You may know it as Mel's diner.

551
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,563
This is your sandbox. Your jungle gym.

552
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,220
And under it is this.

553
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,190
I need to know if you ate this, Adam.

554
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:47,815
He doesn't know what you want.

555
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,905
Adam, you have to tell me.

556
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,098
Because if you don't...

557
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:56,519
It'll be game over.

558
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,901
- You'll be dead.
- What the hell are you doing?

559
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,820
Show me what you ate.

560
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,478
Adam.

561
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,249
Show me what you ate.

562
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,034
- Adam?
- Honey?

563
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:29,993
Adam?

564
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:40,574
Come on in, brothers and sister!

565
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,819
Welcome to the House of the Lord.

566
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,192
House, come on. The chapel?

567
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,817
We have been blessed with
the miracle of a new symptom.

568
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:52,807
Brother, can you testify
as to why this poor child's eyeball

569
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,636
rolled back into his head?

570
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,212
It's consistent with jimsonweed
poisoning-- ocular paralysis.

571
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:00,324
Sorry.

572
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:03,436
The wicked shall deceive ye,
because they have turned from the lord

573
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:07,427
and are idiots. His ocular
muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

574
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:08,386
M.S.

575
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:11,491
It is easier for a wise
man to gain access to heaven--

576
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,970
Will you stop doing that?
Just say "not M. S."

577
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,080
A stroke.

578
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,107
Bleed in the brain.

579
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:19,519
We'd be seeing other symptoms
besides a single eye misalignment.

580
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,663
Like a coma.
And you've already testified.

581
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:22,614
It's a tumor.

582
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:25,247
And all the imaging just missed it?

583
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:26,250
It's a microtumor.

584
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:29,151
Started in his lung,
which caused the pleural effusion.

585
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:32,142
Then it metastasized to his liver,
which made it slough cells.

586
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:33,791
And then went to his brain,

587
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,710
behind the eye ,which caused
it to roll back into his head.

588
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:39,231
So he has three tumors
and we missed all of them.

589
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:41,605
What's the opposite of a miracle?

590
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:45,322
I have a better chance of finding it
now that I know exactly where to look.

591
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:46,273
So...

592
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,268
Unless you have a better idea.

593
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:51,547
I'm gonna go CT his head. And then, if--

594
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,356
If I have to, remove his eye.

595
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,428
You remove this kid's eye,

596
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,930
he's only gonna be half
as good at not making eye contact.

597
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:15,871
Hello?

598
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:18,988
Hello?

599
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:21,766
Hello?

600
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:25,512
I have sad news for you.

601
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,066
She doesn't love you.

602
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:29,257
You're ugly when you're jealous.

603
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,244
She showed up at my house last night.

604
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,195
Came on to me.

605
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:35,149
She's even more perfect than I thought.

606
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,100
House.

607
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,436
She's sick.

608
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:40,005
You say "sick, "I say "freestylin'."

609
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:42,838
The girl will have
sex with an invertebrate.

610
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,541
Come on. You're not that bad.

611
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:49,218
She has a problem. You're not
doing her any favors by indulging her.

612
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:52,879
Why would you lie like this? Do
you not have room your heart for love?

613
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,928
You don't believe me.

614
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,993
I didn't believe the kids when they said
that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

615
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,179
I didn't believe them then,
I don't believe them now.

616
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,254
I don't care that Susie
married Johnny--he's mine.

617
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:05,862
She has a mole on her right breast,
just below the nipple.

618
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,990
No, she doesn't.

619
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:09,821
- You've seen her breasts?
- It was a medical exam.

620
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:11,772
I was listening to her heart. It went,

621
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:13,845
"Greg-House, Greg-House, Greg-House."

622
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:16,957
Fine, I'm lying.

623
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:19,266
But she did come back.

624
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,609
She's locked up in my office.

625
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:23,765
I was hoping you could talk to her.

626
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:24,766
Put an end to this.

627
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,121
Listen to me.

628
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:48,103
Do you have any idea what you'd have to
look forward to if you stayed with me?

629
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,203
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

630
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:55,062
You're only saying that to make me go.

631
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,497
I'm saying it 'cause it's true.

632
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:03,694
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

633
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,752
Is there a Victor in your class?

634
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,854
If you're not with someone your age,

635
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,563
you'll regret it.

636
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,633
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

637
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:20,785
And for the rest of your life.

638
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:25,794
- What about us?
- We'll always have Fresno.

639
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:31,260
I'm no good at being noble, but

640
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:34,306
it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of two little people

641
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:36,794
don't amount to a hill
of beans in this crazy world.

642
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:40,527
Someday you'll understand that.

643
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,261
Now, now.

644
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:47,842
Here's looking at you...

645
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:55,649
Damn.

646
00:35:57,586 --> 00:36:00,036
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

647
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:01,143
What?

648
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,776
I ask all my girlfriends that.

649
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:07,586
Yeah, a little one.

650
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:10,447
Damn.

651
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,770
What? What, what is it?

652
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,047
It's not love.

653
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:17,176
You have a spore in your brain.

654
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,833
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of 'em.

655
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,318
They get an earthquake,
they get released into the air,

656
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:24,991
you breathe it in, you get a cold...

657
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:28,557
turns into sinus congestion,
aches, weakness, milky tears...

658
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,078
and sometimes...

659
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:33,885
a loss of inhibition and judgment.

660
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:36,755
Damn!

661
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:38,394
So...

662
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:39,708
loving you?

663
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,919
Wanting to have sex with you?
It was all just...

664
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,356
the spores talking?

665
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:51,695
You'll probably live.

666
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,696
Damn.

667
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,071
Don't touch his eye.

668
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,430
This is an appendectomy.

669
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:31,462
Like i said, don't touch his eye.

670
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:36,932
Why isn't he in surgery?

671
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,765
Well, some emergency bumped him.
We've got another room in ten minutes.

672
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:40,884
You're not taking him in.

673
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,369
Kill the lights.

674
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:47,128
He was seeing them all the time.

675
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:49,351
What are you looking for?

676
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,017
And he was telling
us what he was seeing.

677
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,218
Telling us exactly
what was wrong with him.

678
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,612
Drawing them for us over and over again.

679
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,283
Nobody knew how to speak "autistic."

680
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:01,584
When I asked him what he ate,
he even told me that.

681
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,985
What are you talking about?
What was he seeing?

682
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,664
Hello, my pretties.

683
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,159
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

684
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,703
It's worms. Swimming in his eye.

685
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:16,532
Animal makes potty in the sandbox.

686
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:19,741
Boy plays in the sandbox,
boy eats the sand.

687
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,485
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

688
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:24,236
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

689
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:27,087
Raccoon roundworms are
not excreted by their human host.

690
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,271
- Cameron tested the sand.
- All of it?

691
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,907
Worms spread from his
gut to the rest of his body.

692
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,403
They attacked his lungs. That's what
made him scream and caused the effusion.

693
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:40,146
They invade his liver, sending dead
liver cells coursing through his system.

694
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:42,393
They attack his eye and
the muscles surrounding it,

695
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:44,094
making his eyeball do a backflip.

696
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:49,511
Laser photocoagulation to fix
the eye and a high dose of benzimidazole

697
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:50,871
to kill the worms.

698
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:52,382
Wait a minute. That's it?

699
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:54,229
H-he's gonna be okay?

700
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:56,295
Good news.

701
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:00,188
He's gonna be with you for a long,
long time.

702
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:09,559
I'm going to read you something.

703
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:13,117
"Asperger's syndrome is
a mild and rare form of autism.

704
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,560
"It is typically
characterized by difficulty

705
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,081
"establishing friendships
and playing with peers,

706
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,565
"trouble accepting
convential social rules,

707
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,195
"and they dislike any
change in setting or routine."

708
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,049
Or broadloom.

709
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,928
It doesn't say that last part,
but you get my point.

710
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:32,029
House doesn't have Asperger's.
The diagnosis is much simpler.

711
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:33,174
He's a jerk.

712
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,345
Why do you think he took this case?

713
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:37,175
Because he believes these parents?

714
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:39,117
Because he wants to help a young boy?

715
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,425
He sees himself in this kid.

716
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,511
And he's trying to help himself.

717
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:47,722
He doesn't want this.

718
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:49,685
He needs it.

719
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,454
You're not autistic.

720
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:09,609
You don't even have Asperger's.
You wish you did.

721
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,866
It would exempt you from the rules.

722
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,580
Give you freedom,
absolve you of responsibility.

723
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:16,568
Let you date 17-year-olds.

724
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:20,536
But most important, it would
mean that you're not just a jerk.

725
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:25,653
At what point does a person endlessly
lecturing someone make him a jerk?

726
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,860
Your first tongue kiss...

727
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,072
an eight on the happiness scale.

728
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:43,482
Your child being snatched
back from the brink of death...

729
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:44,788
that's a ten.

730
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:51,604
But they're clocking
in at a very tepid 6.5,

731
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:55,556
because they know what
they have to go back to.

732
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:02,993
Uh, listen...

733
00:41:05,873 --> 00:41:06,823
Thanks.

734
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
You saved his life.

735
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:11,375
Yeah, I know.

736
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:12,975
See ya.

737
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,940
That was so good.

738
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,026
That was a ten.

739
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:45,032
All change is bad?

740
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,547
It's not true, you know.

741
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
