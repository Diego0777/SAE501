1
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,753
So you want me to explain
how you just lost?

2
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:19,626
Or do you wanna stare
at the board your full...

3
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:20,918
three minutes?

4
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,566
Cling to hope?

5
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:30,262
Come on. It's called speed chess.

6
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,881
Good bye.

7
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:22,236
Good game.

8
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:27,355
I said good game.

9
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:45,759
What are you doing?

10
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,219
Stop that, son! Stop that!

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,813
Back away from him. Back away!

12
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:58,999
Call 911. Get an ambulance!

13
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,577
Tell them to send two!

14
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,753
My head's gonna explode!

16
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,578
- Your head still hurt?
- You a moron?

17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,070
Nate.

18
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:47,726
I'm clutching my head in pain,
and he asks if it hurts?

19
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,026
What are you, some kind of med student?

20
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,342
You look like you still
have theme birthday parties.

21
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,293
Sorry.

22
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,978
Any problems concentrating
in school lately?

23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,666
Besides the dreams of running my tongue
along my French teacher's breasts?

24
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,017
No, I'm doing quite great.

25
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:06,594
The rage and pain could
be caused by a parasite.

26
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,352
- Does he eat a lot of sushi?
- No.

27
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:10,939
Uh, he was a vegetarian
until just a few months ago.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,083
Any changes in behavior
since the new diet?

29
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:14,034
No.

30
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,943
He's been this way
since he became a teenager.

31
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,632
It doesn't matter how much I
yell or punish, he's still gonna say...

32
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,683
Yeah, let's all shed a tear
for poor little Nate's mother.

33
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:28,067
Any more stupid questions?

34
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:29,257
Nate.

35
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,356
I hate this kid.

36
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:34,478
I like this kid.

37
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:35,957
You haven't met him.

38
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,508
I know you hate him.
What more do I need to know?

39
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,448
The kid's not a cliché. Anybody
can get into a fight after losing.

40
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,169
It takes real creativity
to beat up someone you just beat.

41
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,704
The pain's not limited to his head.

42
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:49,896
The rest is bumps and bruises
accounted for by the 17 fights

43
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,670
he's been in this semester.
- Concussion?

44
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,703
MRI was clean. No frontal lobe tumor.

45
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:56,172
And the tox screen showed
no trace of coke or amphetamines.

46
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,618
Nate went medieval on the other kid.
Could be...

47
00:03:58,619 --> 00:03:59,569
Hold on.

48
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,517
I'm having a moment.

49
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:02,915
This...

50
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,563
This could be Foreman's last time

51
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,765
mistakenly suggesting
adrenal gland tumor.

52
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:11,121
Which could create excess adrenaline.
Causes the head pain and rage.

53
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,786
But not the personality disorder.

54
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,904
There is no personality disorder.
He's a teenager.

55
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,958
Being a teenager excuses
the odd inappropriate comment.

56
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:22,562
This kid say anything appropriate?
He's having cluster headaches.

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,719
Probably been having them for years.
Question is, what's causing them?

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,763
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

59
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:30,812
ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain.

60
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:33,648
Useless for this pain. But it
could have knocked down the swelling.

61
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,584
Best bet is a vascular problem.

62
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:39,260
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

63
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,900
He's still in pain. Which means...

64
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,031
Normal treatment is
called normal treatment

65
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,596
because sometimes you
have to use abnormal treatment.

66
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:46,806
Start him on blood thinners

67
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,463
and give his noggin Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation.

68
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,563
Don't you dare...
touch that acerbic wit.

69
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,468
50 bucks to whichever of
you steps up and treats this brat.

70
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:59,069
Not the kid's fault, he's sick.

71
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,310
Fine. You do it.

72
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,569
No way. He's your brat.

73
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,454
I'll do it.
But I've got a job interview after work.

74
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,705
Anything comes up later,
you guys handle it.

75
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,991
- Need a peer recommendation?
- Thanks.

76
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,339
Cameron's should suffice.

77
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,916
This isn't gonna
turn me into some, like,

78
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,101
drooling vegetable
that wets his pants, is it?

79
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:28,052
It's safe.

80
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,212
The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells

81
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,245
which will hopefully
squelch the head pain.

82
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,525
Is there anything you
can do about the other pain?

83
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:35,476
From the fights?

84
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,768
Yeah, I mean, my face, my shoulder.
My stomach.

85
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,432
I mean, I can barely bend my fingers.

86
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,814
You're already on pain meds.
Nothing more I can do.

87
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:44,779
Sure you can, man.

88
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,442
Tell your homies to quit stomping on me.

89
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:51,293
I'll get the word out
that you're a great guy.

90
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,113
So, do people watch
what they say around you?

91
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,584
- Because I'm black?
- No, because you're gay.

92
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,234
Cluster headaches can persist for years,

93
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,200
cause irritability or
even hostility towards others.

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,737
You mean, the illness
is affecting his personality?

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,070
- If these treatments work, it could...
- Change him?

96
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,519
Yeah.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,224
Oh, thank God.

98
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:34,218
Oh, you must think I'm awful. Here
my son's lying in a hospital bed and...

99
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,246
I- I'm pretty sure I get it.

100
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,583
I thought I was a bad mother.

101
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:44,763
And I hated myself.

102
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,914
Because I hated him.

103
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:57,372
What have you got
for me this fine morning?

104
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:00,673
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect.
It's not cluster headaches.

105
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:04,132
- You accusing the symptoms of lying?
- Could be hemochromatosis.

106
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,042
Wouldn't account for
the personality disorder.

107
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,393
What about hypothyroidism?

108
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,118
He's not getting
aggressive and lethargic,

109
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,169
he's getting aggressive and aggressiver.

110
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,099
What about ruptured dermoid cyst?

111
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,724
Sorry.

112
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,425
Just got dizzy there.
I was expecting to turn right.

113
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,363
It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.

114
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,954
The thing that Cameron said.

115
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,502
Way to think outside the box.

116
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,607
But no fat in the ventricles.
It's cluster headaches.

117
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:30,758
Normal treatment didn't work.
Abnormal treatment didn't work.

118
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:31,853
Good point, Foreman.

119
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,265
The treatments don't always work.
Symptoms never lie.

120
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:38,511
The only approved treatment left
for cluster headaches is brain surgery.

121
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:41,533
- And that's not even a guarantee.
- Back off, Foreman!

122
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:47,427
If the approved treatment doesn't work,
we go with an unapproved treatment.

123
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,492
Something on your mind?

124
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,514
Because you totally can't tell.

125
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:00,357
I had a job interview lined
up at New York Mercy yesterday.

126
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,952
Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati.
Big coup.

127
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,548
Your homies must be kvelling.

128
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,189
Didn't happen,
because apparently I called to cancel.

129
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,288
I don't remember making that call.
You think I have neurological issue?

130
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:10,942
Yes.

131
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:13,393
- Why are you jerking me around?
- It wasn't me.

132
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:17,639
Yeah. It was one of the other petty,
socially repressed asses I work for.

133
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,756
Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.

134
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,371
If you want me to stay,
tell me you want me to stay.

135
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,204
Would it matter?

136
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,405
No, but it'd be the
adult way to handle it.

137
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,835
If the adult way doesn't work,
why bother with it?

138
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,436
I've been totally professional!

139
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,152
Gave two weeks notice,
continued to work cases.

140
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,413
Scheduled my interviews on my own time.

141
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,458
You have no right
to screw with my future.

142
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,562
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differential diagnoses, aren't you?

143
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,462
It wasn't me.

144
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,479
I only sabotage people
I consider worth it.

145
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:14,145
You are one evil, cunning woman.

146
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,297
It's a massive turn-on.

147
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,075
You girls can gossip later.

148
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,438
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,739
You called New York Mercy to
have Foreman's job interview killed.

150
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,731
When I said,
"You girls can gossip later,"

151
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,886
I was throwing you out,
but in a polite way.

152
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,262
Well, I take it you're
off your antidepressants.

153
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:38,154
Ah, you're deflecting.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

154
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:39,905
Does Foreman actually think I did that?

155
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,598
No, just me.
But I know something he doesn't.

156
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,060
- I didn't do it.
- Why would I do it?

157
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,481
- Do you want him to leave?
- No.

158
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,655
- Were you planning on doing something?
- I'm waiting for board approval.

159
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,356
But if he takes the job, there's
nothing to be done. You had to stop him.

160
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,434
Wasn't me.

161
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:07,195
What are you doing?

162
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,207
Looking for a tell.

163
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,587
Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.

164
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:15,108
Send in Nurse Unger when
you pass her on your way out.

165
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:19,450
Almost forgot.

166
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:22,694
I need to give a 16-year-old magic
mushrooms to treat a cluster headache.

167
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,754
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, no problem.

168
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:31,544
I was being sarcastic.

169
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,108
Wouldn't look that way
in the court transcript.

170
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,976
Mushrooms have psilocybins
that work on cluster headaches.

171
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,485
It's either that, or cutting into his
brain and going on a fishing expedition.

172
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:45,163
I assume you've considered
he could have a psychogenic experience.

173
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,264
Possibly suffer a
fit of severe paranoia.

174
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,429
Well, I have now.

175
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:53,404
Yeah, it's definitely better
that the dean of medicine prescribes it

176
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:56,947
instead of an unhinged doctor with a
history of drug use. Takes the stink off

177
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,106
if the patient decides to
put on a cape and fly off the roof.

178
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,816
Low dose. No more than ten milligrams.
Tightly controlled setting.

179
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,284
And make sure the
mother signs off on it.

180
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,436
Party on, Garth.

181
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:12,913
And don't stand in Foreman's way.
It's just wrong.

182
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:19,467
New research shows that a chemical
component in the mushrooms can be...

183
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:23,006
Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff.
So when do I get 'em?

184
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,584
I went to college.
I know about mushrooms.

185
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,917
A friend of a friend
shot himself in the foot.

186
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,080
They're not giving me a gun, Enid!

187
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,907
Sign the consent form.

188
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:35,785
We'll be monitoring him,
but cardiac arrest is possible.

189
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,173
Big E...

190
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:39,742
small N...

191
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:42,058
And if the mushrooms don't work?

192
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:45,510
The next step would
be a type of brain surgery.

193
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,852
- Oh, God.
- Pain's gettin' worse.

194
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:51,233
Need 'shrooms now!

195
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:18,528
- Oh, yeah.
- Nate, how's the pain?

196
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,862
It's Skippy! The bush kangaroo!

197
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,407
Your head, Nate.
We need to know how the pain is.

198
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,579
What I got here

199
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,985
is the opposite of pain.

200
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:38,312
That means you're suffering from cluster
headaches. Which means, hopefully...

201
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,918
Man, you're hot.

202
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:44,597
- She's making me horny.
- Deal with it.

203
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,804
You can't get me stoned,
then not close the deal.

204
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,571
- Shut up.
- Take it easy. He's not well.

205
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,586
You'll regret saying no. Check it out.

206
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:59,140
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Hold it.

207
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,301
What the hell are you doing?

208
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,410
He has undersized testes.

209
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:12,174
His other secondary sexual
characteristics are normal.

210
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:16,303
If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid
discussions of other men's testicles.

211
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,373
Thanks.

212
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,595
Focus on phrases like... "You
were right about the cluster headaches."

213
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:23,091
But wrong about what caused them.

214
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,292
Vascular problem in a major
artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

215
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:30,820
Okay, what causes rage, headaches,
personality disorder, and hypogonadism?

216
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:33,502
- Where's Foreman?
- He's mad at me.

217
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,808
- Why?
- No reason.

218
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,430
Yeah, that makes sense.

219
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:41,271
The male genitals are controlled
by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

220
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,268
We're not talking about Foreman anymore.

221
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,698
The kid's being pummeled at school.

222
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,156
A couple blows to the head
could cause hypothalamic lesions.

223
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:49,557
We ever gonna talk about
what happens when Foreman's gone?

224
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:52,761
If this were an employee-owned
airline in Scandinavia, yes.

225
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:57,423
It's not lesions. His temperature would
be all over the map. Symptoms don't lie.

226
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,919
He's gone in less than a week
and you haven't even read a rÃ©sumÃ©.

227
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,034
Doesn't even need to.
The two of us can handle it.

228
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,885
Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.

229
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,979
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

230
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:12,738
And let the record show I was
right about the cluster headaches.

231
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,977
- Forget it.
- It's a straightforward procedure.

232
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:18,191
We thread an endoscopic
tube up through the nostril...

233
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,793
And cut something
out of my brain? No way.

234
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,799
If it's a tumor, it could kill you.

235
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:25,335
Just give me more 'shrooms, okay?
I'll be fine.

236
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,936
You only need my consent, right?

237
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,935
Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if he...

238
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,336
Do whatever you have to do.

239
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,839
You don't touch me, all right?

240
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,212
You can touch me. Just not my brain.

241
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,901
Nate, you gotta do this.
I can't take it anymore.

242
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:40,086
My God, Mom! Save me the
melodramatic hand- wringing, okay?

243
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,567
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

244
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,662
I'm gonna give him a sedative.

245
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,418
You're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.

246
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,910
Why don't you take her for a ride?

247
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:54,824
Nate...

248
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,239
Are you in pain?

249
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:07,698
His heart rate's normal.
Respiration's even.

250
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,999
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?

251
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,258
He's jaundiced.
His liver's shutting down.

252
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,521
We started him on sodium
polystyrene sulfonate.

253
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,619
His liver's operating at
about 20% and deteriorating fast.

254
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:30,245
Which means he'll be dead long before
Foreman turns in his parking pass.

255
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,424
So, what causes personality disorder,
head pain,

256
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,756
blah blah blah, and liver failure?

257
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,041
Liver failure can cause hypogonadism,
head pain.

258
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,263
Altered mental status leads
to the personality disorder and rage.

259
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:44,798
All we need to do is figure
out what caused the liver failure.

260
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,714
Yes... also, we need to
figure out how symptoms yesterday

261
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,749
can be caused by liver failure today.

262
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,959
If his liver's failing now,
it wasn't great yesterday.

263
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,866
If it wasn't operating at capacity,
it could have caused...

264
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:59,028
- Don't sneak up on a person like that.
- I'm listening.

265
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,792
Well, listening doesn't help me.

266
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:05,401
Okay. Let's go with the
liver and a time machine theory.

267
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:09,434
- Foreman, what causes liver problems?
- Wilson's disease.

268
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,540
No. Ceruloplasmin's normal.

269
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:14,222
No enlargement and no palpable mass,
so no cancer.

270
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,799
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

271
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,150
Most liver damage begins with
what we put in our bodies. Foreman?

272
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,855
Angry teen... alcohol.

273
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,983
No, blood tests were negative.

274
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:28,091
No signs of drug use or acetaminophen
poisoning in his tox screen.

275
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:29,792
Maybe the water was contaminated.

276
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,467
His mother would also be sick.

277
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,829
Sounded like someone with back.

278
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:39,567
Go.

279
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:44,086
We'll try and muddle through
without your blank stare to guide us.

280
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:48,039
So if it's not the bad things he's
putting in, what about the good things?

281
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,440
He was raised a vegetarian.

282
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,179
Was raised. Means he's all grown up.

283
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:55,005
Or he's not a vegetarian anymore.

284
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:57,023
He started eating red
meat a few months ago.

285
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,629
Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow,

286
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,652
his body would have
no problem metabolizing it.

287
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,553
It would if he had an OTC deficiency.

288
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,689
Body can't metabolize nitrogen,
damages the liver.

289
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:07,879
Run a hamburger test.

290
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,541
It's exactly what it sounds like.

291
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,628
Stuff him full of meat,
wait for his ammonia levels to spike.

292
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,716
I'll double your salary.

293
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,176
Chase and Cameron would
mutiny if they found out.

294
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,690
Chase and Cameron wouldn't be
heading up their own diagnostic group.

295
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:35,174
You'll work in parallel with House.
It'll be your practice.

296
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:39,172
Separate staff, separate cases.
Complete autonomy.

297
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,983
I've only been doing
this for three years.

298
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,234
Three years under House.
No better training.

299
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,217
And when that case comes
along that I can't figure out?

300
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:48,818
You know who I'd have to go to.

301
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,379
Or you can just let that patient die.
That's completely up to you.

302
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,242
No.

303
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:03,571
Why?

304
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:05,777
He's evil.

305
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,070
He didn't sabotage your interview.

306
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,124
- How do you know?
- Because I did.

307
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,360
I didn't.

308
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,708
You believed me...
means you're not sure House did it.

309
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,407
Well, somebody did it.
Somebody here did it.

310
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,123
I can't work here.

311
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,205
This isn't a medical procedure.

312
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,091
This is just about Doogie
making me eat garbage.

313
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:52,245
We need to see how your
liver processes the proteins.

314
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:54,752
Then get me a steak, some roast beef.

315
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,482
What if I brought
him something from home?

316
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,837
It has to be prepared here
so we know there's no chemicals

317
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,954
or preservatives that
could affect the test results.

318
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:05,490
I'm not eating anything prepared
by $5-an-hour immigrant hospital cooks

319
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:07,497
in hairnets.
- Shut up!

320
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,522
Either you start eating,

321
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:13,047
or I'm gonna strap you to this
bed and shove these down your throat

322
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,001
one by one... got it?

323
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,465
You can't get mad at me. I'm sick.

324
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,565
You're supposed to feel bad for me.

325
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:29,079
- Nurse, full set of body restraints.
- Yes, Doctor.

326
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:30,977
Trust me.

327
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,099
It'll be a lot less
messy if you do it yourself.

328
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,513
You killed Foreman's job interview.

329
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,320
Why would I...

330
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,141
Somebody did.
Wasn't me, and it wasn't House,

331
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:01,926
which means it has to be somebody
who thought he was protecting him.

332
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,948
Which means it has to be somebody who
actually likes House. Which means it's

333
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:08,140
either you or the weird night
janitor who wears his pants backwards.

334
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,510
I want Foreman to leave.

335
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,543
House has to realize he needs
someone who stands up to him.

336
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,734
Cameron's in love with him, Chase
is afraid of him, and I enable him.

337
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:20,230
- House needs limits.
- I give him...

338
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,830
You authorize magic mushrooms.

339
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,054
House is a six-year-old who
thinks he's better off without parents.

340
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,242
A few tummy aches

341
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:30,376
after dinners of ice cream
and ketchup might do him some good.

342
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,353
You're lying.

343
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:38,413
An enabler doesn't conspire against,
an enabler enables.

344
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:41,317
- What?
- You're paranoid.

345
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:43,989
You made that call.

346
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:48,290
And because of that call, you basically
guaranteed Foreman's out of here.

347
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,687
I thought it would be fun
to work on my boat with him.

348
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:03,778
And you went shirtless
because skin cancer looks cool.

349
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,129
Well, I realize I got burnt.
I'm not too worried about that.

350
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:08,955
It's these white marks, you know?

351
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:10,653
Lie down.

352
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:17,304
I mean, that boat has all sorts of lead
paint, and there's chemicals everywhere.

353
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,322
When Daddy works on his boat,
does he have a cooler

354
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:24,334
with lots of brown
bottles with long necks?

355
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:29,298
And does Daddy like to lie down
on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

356
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:35,851
What... what the hell?

357
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,083
I will give you this for the...

358
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:44,074
$1.41 in your pocket.

359
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,868
Wait, how could you know...

360
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,356
A psychic once told me that I'm psychic.

361
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,838
One of these quarters is Canadian.

362
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,564
Give me back my syringe.

363
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,937
Hamburger stress test showed
no change in his ammonia levels.

364
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,300
Liver's properly converting
the ammonia into urea.

365
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:14,901
He doesn't have OTC deficiency.

366
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:17,049
- Welcome back.
- Sorry.

367
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:19,898
I shouldn't have been taking
my problems out on the patient.

368
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:22,046
Or on me. Apology accepted.

369
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,356
Starve him.

370
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:26,407
What are we looking for?

371
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,879
Diabetic steatosis
would screw up his liver.

372
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,339
Starve him overnight and
see if his blood sugar pops.

373
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,738
We mess with his blood sugar,
we could set off another rage.

374
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,318
Not a problem. You can take him.

375
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:43,238
- I want something to eat!
- Honey, please don't.

376
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:43,993
What happened?

377
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:46,397
I was just trying to get a urine sample,
and he went crazy.

378
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,536
I need to eat!

379
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:50,127
You're not sticking anything else in me.

380
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,892
- It's just a few more hours.
- You're gonna hurt yourself.

381
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:53,857
I'm gonna hurt you!

382
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:56,422
As soon as we get a urine sample,
we can leave you alone.

383
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,590
You want your sample?
Here's your damn sample!

384
00:22:58,591 --> 00:22:59,541
Nate, don't.

385
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:09,763
Oh, my God.

386
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,731
Nate, you need to get back into bed.
Right now.

387
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:23,995
Chem panel and urinalysis
confirms the bloody urine was caused

388
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:24,946
by kidney failure.

389
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,601
He's on dialysis. He's gonna
need it for the rest of his life.

390
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,252
Which is shortening as we speak.

391
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:34,944
We are looking at a Chinese menu, and we
have got symptoms from too many columns.

392
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:36,746
They're going to overcharge us.

393
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:39,778
Multiple organ failure
could mean primary HIV infection.

394
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,148
That would mean someone
agreed to sleep with him.

395
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,281
- Plus his serology is negative.
- His uric acid's slightly elevated.

396
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,485
10% of males in this
country have elevated...

397
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:50,536
So we're only gonna pay attention
to abnormal abnormalities?

398
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,952
We've been stuffing him with
meat and his kidneys are shot.

399
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,239
Of course his uric acid...

400
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,257
Could be hepatic fibrosis or MCADD.
The brat's got a genetic disorder.

401
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:01,924
Get the sequencing primers. See
if it's one of the ones we can treat.

402
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,599
I can draw some blood,
but then I gotta run.

403
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:05,634
Job interview?

404
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,626
You gonna stop me if it is?

405
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:13,485
You do the nurse stuff,
they'll do the doctor stuff.

406
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:25,566
This a blood test
for a marriage license?

407
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:30,263
Plan on kidnapping me
to Massachusetts or Canad...

408
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:34,598
What did you give him?

409
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,107
- Are you treating him for something?
- Sedative.

410
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,225
- Did he need a sedative?
- I did.

411
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:44,406
Just shutting him up so I
can draw some of his blood in peace.

412
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,791
You walked in with that.
You didn't even give him a chance.

413
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,715
- People are what they are.
- He's sick.

414
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,115
The rudeness isn't his fault.

415
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,302
If he had tuberculosis,
it wouldn't be his fault either.

416
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:56,403
But I still wouldn't
let him cough on me.

417
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:12,899
Where are you going?

418
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:15,630
The lab. We're testing our
patient's blood for hereditary...

419
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:19,496
Cuddy thinks I sabotaged Foreman's
interview. She's gonna fire me.

420
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:22,815
I don't believe it.

421
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:25,125
She said it was unprofessional and...

422
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:27,444
No, I mean I literally don't believe it.

423
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,623
Cuddy wouldn't fire
you for something like that.

424
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:36,573
Which means either she lied to you,
or you're lying to me.

425
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,406
You so would have fallen
for that three years ago.

426
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,493
You were looking for a reaction. You
were looking for me to feel bad for you.

427
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:48,369
To save your skin.
But how am I gonna save you?

428
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,311
Unless...

429
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:53,008
you think I'm the one who really did it.

430
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:59,133
Cuddy's logic was Foreman's
valuable to House. I care about House.

431
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:01,368
Ergo, I would do anything to save him.

432
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,685
And your logic was... I care
about House as much as you do, ergo...

433
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:08,695
It wasn't me.

434
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,541
- I don't care about House.
- I don't believe you.

435
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:14,342
No one does.

436
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:19,263
House is nothing more than my boss.
Foreman's nothing more than a colleague.

437
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:23,756
- You're lying.
- Everyone does.

438
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,979
But it wasn't me.

439
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,485
No markers for hepatic fibrosis.
And nothing for MCADD.

440
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,664
Foreman's interview
in New York got screwed up.

441
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:47,615
I heard.

442
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:50,371
Foreman thought it was House,
House thought it was Cuddy.

443
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:53,172
Cuddy thought it was Wilson,
Wilson thought it was me.

444
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:57,189
And you think it was me?

445
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:02,077
You think I sabotaged Foreman?

446
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,688
- I don't even want him here.
- I know.

447
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:06,786
Then why would I do...

448
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:09,728
I think you sabotaged Foreman
just to sabotage Foreman.

449
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,469
So everyone's a suspect because everyone
wants to help House. Except for me.

450
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:21,011
I'm a suspect because I'm a petty,
vindictive jerk?

451
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,580
You actually think I
would do something like that?

452
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,240
- It was someone.
- It wasn't me.

453
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,446
Negative for Von Gierke disease.

454
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,985
And it's Tuesday.

455
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,720
I know.

456
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,517
- I like you.
- I know.

457
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,240
See you next Tuesday.

458
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:53,763
Found something.

459
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,029
He's got a partial
HPRT enzyme deficiency.

460
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:02,085
Means he could have
Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome.

461
00:28:02,086 --> 00:28:05,607
But it's a partial deficiency.
So it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.

462
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:09,324
Yes. Those are the two options.

463
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,205
It is or it isn't.

464
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:13,593
Kelley-Seegmiller explains
the aggressive personality.

465
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:16,146
If he had Kelley-Seegmiller,
he wouldn't just be aggressive,

466
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,903
he'd be self-mutilating.
Chewing his lips, banging his head.

467
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:22,649
Lovely disease.
Degenerative, fatal, incurable.

468
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,672
I wonder if that's why
Cameron's on the "Not" side.

469
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,823
That and the fact
that symptoms don't lie.

470
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:31,179
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers
self-mutilate when they're stressed.

471
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,740
He's in the ICU with a
failing liver and no kidneys.

472
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,197
Yeah, his life is sweet.

473
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:39,287
His vegetarian diet could have
limited the purines in his system,

474
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:40,888
slowing the disease's progress.

475
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,716
- So let's speed it up.
- Why?

476
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,484
So you two kids will stop fighting.

477
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,633
Also, I don't feel like
waiting for respiratory failure.

478
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:53,734
Chase, find some way for
the mother to get lost for a while.

479
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:57,146
I'm going to stress this
kid until he bites off a finger.

480
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:07,196
They move me to geriatrics?

481
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,107
- Who are you?
- Dr. McCaney.

482
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,576
The man who's gonna kick
your ass all over this chessboard.

483
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:14,761
Yeah, well, I'm too weak to...

484
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:15,886
Bite yourself, yeah.

485
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,840
You need some liquid energy.

486
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,670
Now, if you consent, I'm gonna
give you this shot of adrenaline.

487
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,212
I don't wanna play.

488
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:28,255
Aside from being indicative
of pituitary issues

489
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:32,527
and certain kinds of genetic disorders,
small testicles also indicate...

490
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:36,534
that you're a big chicken.

491
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,447
Please don't make
me do the sound effect.

492
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,108
You're not gonna goad me into playing.

493
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:43,674
Didn't think I'd have to.

494
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:47,185
Thought you'd just jump at
the chance of humiliating someone.

495
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,456
Age before cripple.

496
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,118
I'm white.

497
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:02,533
It... is... on!

498
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:14,451
Bird's opening. Passive approach.

499
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:16,101
Sign of a coward.

500
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:19,482
Sicilian defense. Sign of an idiot.

501
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:21,525
Arrogance has to be earned.

502
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,289
Tell me what you've done to earn yours.

503
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:26,929
I can walk.

504
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,800
I don't bleed out of my penis.

505
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:45,597
Check.

506
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:51,676
You know, it's a real thin line between

507
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:57,869
tortured genius and awkward kid
who can't get girls because he's creepy.

508
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:05,793
Why are you doing this?

509
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,790
To stress you out.

510
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,416
Check.

511
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:12,310
Yeah, but why?

512
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:16,697
I'd tell you, but I figure it's
more stressful if you don't know why.

513
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,304
Yeah, well...
I'm not feeling too stressed.

514
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:23,934
You know that no one likes you, right?

515
00:31:24,526 --> 00:31:26,926
- Yeah, well, anybody like you?
- You're dying.

516
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,596
Check.

517
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:42,689
Your move.

518
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,700
Care to lay down your king?

519
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:22,263
You can't win.

520
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:24,676
You can pin my queen.

521
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:26,796
My knight to E7.

522
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,651
Your king to H8.

523
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:31,765
Sacrifice rook takes pawn.
Bishop blocks.

524
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,716
Queen to H5. Checkmate.

525
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,067
Save what's left of your dignity.

526
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Lay down your king.

527
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,240
Crap.

528
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:58,644
He's having a seizure.

529
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,889
- Four milligrams IV lorazepam.
- Right away.

530
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:21,525
I hate this kid.

531
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:24,114
I like this kid.

532
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,610
Did you get the job?

533
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:29,471
They're gonna let me know.

534
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,839
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't
cause this seizure.

535
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,831
So we've got one more symptom,
one less diagnosis.

536
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:38,286
I assume they're gonna
call for references?

537
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:40,207
- Did you give 'em my name?
- No.

538
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:42,458
Amyloidosis can cause seizures,

539
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,675
and the protein buildup
could cause organ failure.

540
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:46,276
Wouldn't alter his personality.

541
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:47,564
Whose name did you give?

542
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:49,874
My last boss.

543
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,509
That can't look good.

544
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:54,988
I hate this kid.

545
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,537
What if we're not dealing
with one condition?

546
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,182
What if it's multiple conditions?

547
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:02,176
Uh-uh, it's gotta be one.
It's always one.

548
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,536
Nothing explains this
constellation of symptoms.

549
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:05,986
We've gotta be missing something.

550
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:09,074
Maybe the kid lied about some
medication. Maybe he's hiding something.

551
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,675
- Why would he be hiding something?
- I don't know, because he's evil?

552
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,418
What if he is?

553
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:19,139
What if the symptoms lied?

554
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:24,331
There.

555
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,713
Now all we're looking at is a simple,
evil jerk with amyloidosis.

556
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:31,479
- You're not being objective.
- Amyloidosis was your idea.

557
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,270
You were right,
it doesn't fit the symptoms.

558
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,767
Yeah, it does. Look.

559
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:38,198
You crossed it off because
you wanna hate the kid.

560
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,896
And you can't hate
him if he's a victim...

561
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,962
You want him to be a victim because
you wanna believe that people are good.

562
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:45,312
And if they're not,
it's gotta be a chemical problem.

563
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,013
Except they're not, and it's not.

564
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:50,846
Flush him with immunosuppressants,

565
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,669
get a biopsy to confirm,
and find him a marrow donor.

566
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:03,062
What will happen to him?

567
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:07,565
Substances called amyloid proteins
build up in the body's organs,

568
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:08,965
shutting them down.

569
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,917
It's a fairly rare disease.

570
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,574
And I'm afraid it can be fatal.

571
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:21,608
So do you operate or
something to take them out?

572
00:35:22,326 --> 00:35:24,475
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

573
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:30,712
Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank.
We should test you as well.

574
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:37,678
When you first told me he was sick...

575
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,253
I was...

576
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,203
happy.

577
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:45,852
Relieved.

578
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:51,027
Now...

579
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:58,665
Nate, I'm gonna take a small
piece of nerve from your ankle.

580
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:02,596
- Let me know if you feel any pain.
- I'm burning up.

581
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,656
Couldn't you just knock
me out like you did last time?

582
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:07,607
Wish I could.

583
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,284
But your body has to be clear
so it's ready for a marrow transplant.

584
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,235
Hey, Dr. X...

585
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,041
I know you've busted
ass trying to save me.

586
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,075
It's all right.

587
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,879
I wasn't gonna thank you.

588
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,320
I was gonna tell you

589
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,340
you really suck at this.

590
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:28,416
We're doing our best.

591
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:30,732
That's sort of my point.

592
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,429
Your best really sucks.

593
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:45,645
Nerve biopsy was clean.
No evidence of amyloidosis.

594
00:36:46,244 --> 00:36:48,852
It was your idea.
Don't give up on it so fast.

595
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,511
He's running a fever.

596
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,449
If it's two conditions,
one of them's gotta be an infection.

597
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,257
We should start him on antibiotics,
see what clears up, what doesn't.

598
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,489
Is he having trouble breathing?

599
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,090
Yeah, he has mucus in
his chest from an infection.

600
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,410
Could also be an amyloid buildup.

601
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:06,031
Keep him on immunosuppressants
and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.

602
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:07,957
Look, you got two choices.

603
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,200
Engage me in a futile argument then do
what I asked, or just do what I asked.

604
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:15,872
You're not ready.

605
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,959
There was a third choice.
Don't do what I asked.

606
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:26,804
You could have defied me, stuck
the kid on antibiotics. But you didn't.

607
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:30,326
Because you still trust
my judgment more than your own.

608
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:57,965
You sabotaged Foreman's job interview,
didn't you?

609
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,311
Foreman's already been over this.

610
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:04,186
It wasn't me.

611
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,634
Everybody's chasing ghosts over this.

612
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:12,675
Which means either nobody did it, or
somebody wants everybody chasing ghosts.

613
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,729
Now, who does that sound like?

614
00:38:16,242 --> 00:38:17,492
And why would I do that?

615
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,697
Because as long as Foreman
thought you were guilty,

616
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,548
he was gonna be useless around here.

617
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,905
You know,
sometimes I forget why I hired you.

618
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:32,970
You cost him a good
opportunity and gained nothing.

619
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,183
I cost him a crappy opportunity.

620
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:40,745
New York Mercy's where you go to
treat boils and cysts and build a 401K.

621
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,170
If you want him to stay, tell him.

622
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:45,127
I don't. And there'd be no point.

623
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,142
You do.

624
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,684
And the point would be to
make him feel like he's wanted.

625
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:50,785
He doesn't need that.

626
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:54,533
All right, then. It'd make
him feel like maybe you weren't evil.

627
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,193
He needs that.

628
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:05,311
Talk to Foreman.

629
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:13,091
We dumped one symptom.

630
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,499
But forgot to add one.

631
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:25,564
Revenge time, Nate.

632
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:26,689
Are you...

633
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,640
Yes! I am.

634
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,309
Black or white?

635
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,325
Just limp away.

636
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,559
He doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.

637
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,811
Pick one, or this comes out.

638
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:41,375
And for all you know,
this is really important.

639
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,884
- Stop it!
- That hurts, right?

640
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:54,339
Which is odd,
because I'm really enjoying this.

641
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:58,633
You hold the pieces that way
because you can't bend your thumb.

642
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:01,266
Because your bones
have formed abnormally.

643
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,869
Thanks to all the crap that's
been pushing its way in between them.

644
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,196
Actually,
this stuff isn't important at all.

645
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,792
Your doctors said he
needs immunosuppressants.

646
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:12,175
They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.

647
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:13,895
It's iron.

648
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,571
He's got hemochromatosis.

649
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:21,016
The body absorbs iron from food, but
can't process it. Can't get rid of it.

650
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,691
And idle iron is the devil's playground.

651
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:27,863
It builds up in the organs and joints,
whacking them in the process.

652
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,010
Caused all of the symptoms.

653
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,534
Including something
that wasn't a symptom.

654
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,825
Those body aches,
they were not from the fighting.

655
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:39,179
- His personality issues?
- Sorry.

656
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:41,851
The iron's innocent on that count.

657
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:43,905
Your kid's a jerk.

658
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,810
And yeah, it's probably your fault.

659
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,363
Although, if you'd stayed
off the meat like your mom said,

660
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:53,754
you'd have half as much iron,
and be twice less almost dead.

661
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:57,253
Oh, nurse!

662
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:05,348
This patient is bleeding
for some reason.

663
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:07,503
Is he going to be okay?

664
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,358
He'll need dialysis.
He'll have to get his blood drained

665
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,561
every few months for
the rest of his life.

666
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:17,269
But my condolences. It's going
to be a long and annoying life.

667
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:24,995
And I wouldn't have taken your bishop.

668
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:27,596
I'd have moved my queen to D6,
defusing the threat.

669
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,807
Then rook to E8,
attacking the king's pawn.

670
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:32,565
I'd have lost the exchange,
but won the game.

671
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:35,757
I know.

672
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,629
I was bluffing.

673
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,730
And that's why...

674
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:45,712
you lost.

675
00:41:49,288 --> 00:41:50,238
Little jerk.

676
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:11,207
You just here to watch,
or you got something to say?

677
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,716
Still running the new
biopsy for amyloidosis?

678
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:23,821
Yeah, but still nothing.
