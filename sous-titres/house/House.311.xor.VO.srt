1
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,170
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just got clipped with a beam.

2
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,057
What the hell do you
two think you were doing?

3
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,536
We thought we heard someone in there.

4
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:28,096
You never go in without authorization.

5
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:30,171
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

6
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:32,649
So torching your ass
last year wasn't enough, huh?

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,799
You need to stop trying
to prove how tough you are

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,110
before you get yourself killed.

9
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,254
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,208
Go have the paramedics look you over.

11
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,670
Come on, Derek, let's get
this ladder to the second story.

12
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:50,621
Let's go.

13
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:20,555
Derek!

14
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:40,403
What's happening?

15
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,571
I'm...

16
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:43,849
freezing.

17
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:51,945
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26
www.sub-way.fr

18
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,679
- I'm fine.
- ER docs don't think so.

19
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,063
Your temperature's been going
up and down like a rollercoaster.

20
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:27,614
- How old are these skin grafts?
- Last one was about six months ago.

21
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:32,952
Gonna run some tests,
and we'll get a consult with Dr. House.

22
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,071
I'll be fine.

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,630
You'll be doing what
the doctors say. Got it?

24
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:39,445
I'll check in later.

25
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,465
The way you covered for me last night.

26
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,443
He's my brother.

27
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,798
I know how to eat it from him.

28
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,963
I'm gonna stop after my shift, okay?

29
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,357
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
So where is this Dr. House?

31
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,837
Speaking engagement.

32
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:07,792
Not guilty.

33
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:11,643
And on the charge of gaining
control of said medication by fraud,

34
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,073
- how do you plead?
- Not guilty.

35
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:18,506
Very well. Preliminary hearing is set
for the 19th at 10:00 AM, at which time

36
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,685
I'll determine whether there's
enough evidence to proceed to trial.

37
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:25,163
Next case on the calendar, People v.
Williams.

38
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,481
You're gonna go talk to him?

39
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,182
I was just gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

40
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:41,845
They have your signature
in a prescription log,

41
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,727
a security camera video,

42
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:47,734
and a pharmacist's sworn statement
saying you stole the dead guy's pills.

43
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:50,054
You're already looking at ten years.

44
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,355
You want to add witness
intimidating charge?

45
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,840
Go ahead. Ask him about his hair.

46
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:04,214
He suffered third degree burns
over 54% of his body a year ago

47
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,958
and arrived in the ER last
night disoriented and shivering.

48
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,163
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between 96 and 102.

49
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,574
Why don't you contest the
search of the pharmacy records?

50
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,464
Yeah, you could argue it violated
doctor-patient confidentiality.

51
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,192
Except he wasn't the
patient or the doctor.

52
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:20,143
He was the guy who stole
from the patient and the doctor.

53
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,061
This was the third time he had
been disoriented in the last two weeks.

54
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,662
Running into smoke-filled burning
buildings can be a bit disorienting.

55
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,951
Fortunately, I have the cure.
Stop doing it.

56
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:32,567
He's not in a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

57
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,184
A hypothalamic tumor could
cause a vacillating temperature.

58
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:37,852
So could ER nurses who are
too busy to notice that a patient likes

59
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:39,766
both hot coffee and cold sodas.

60
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:46,952
He tested negative for Hep C, TB,
HIV, Lyme, and his tox screen's clean.

61
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,474
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly in the mood to dance.

62
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:56,425
I'm not asking you to dance.
I asking you to do your job.

63
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,562
EKG showed arrhythmia.

64
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,434
Probably just a mild heart attack.

65
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:09,918
No chest pain. And smoke inhalation
already explains the arrhythmia.

66
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,223
The guy was in the burn unit for
six months and had multiple surgeries.

67
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,807
Could be a hospital-acquired infection.
Maybe MRSA.

68
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:16,758
Works for me.

69
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,683
Draw blood cultures.
Start him on antibiotics.

70
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,034
Vancomycin plus broad
gram negative coverage.

71
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:32,206
If you called to see the design for
my prison tats, they're still in R&D.

72
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:35,402
- You need to talk to Tritter.
- Not according to my lawyer.

73
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,560
Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to get
the DA to the drop the case. Tritter can

74
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,611
Yeah, you know what else Tritter can do?

75
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,475
You are not impressing anyone.

76
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,595
You may call yourself principled,

77
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,396
but what you really are is stubborn,
adolescent idiot.

78
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,886
- This isn't his fault.
- I'm not the one--

79
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:54,646
You used the rectal thermometer on him.
You insulted him instead of apologizing.

80
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:59,702
You flaunted your drug use in his face.
And you refused to accept a deal--

81
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,268
I accepted the deal.

82
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:03,788
Not until after you
stole a dead guy's pills.

83
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,789
Allegedly.

84
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,753
Tritter has been opening
doors for you every step of the way,

85
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,404
and you keep slamming them shut.

86
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,162
There are no more
openings to give, House.

87
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:16,882
If you want to stay out of prison,
you gotta make one for yourself.

88
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,094
It's Vicodin.

89
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,016
You function better on it.

90
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,242
Talk to him.

91
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,199
MRSA's a bacteria that
often infects hospital patients.

92
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,436
The burns on your chest and arm

93
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,288
exposed raw flesh that
made you a wide open target.

94
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:43,924
But the antibiotics
will take care of it, right?

95
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,425
Depends on what strain it is.

96
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:48,601
We'll know more once we get
the results back from these cultures.

97
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:49,552
So this...

98
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:51,085
MRSA thing...

99
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,569
Would it make everything look blue?

100
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,290
He's seeing blue.

101
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,138
Who'd you get the scrip from?

102
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,565
Cuddy.

103
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,525
You want to know what I gave her?

104
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,282
MRSA wouldn't change his ocular palette.

105
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,382
Heavy metal poisoning
could cause vision changes,

106
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:12,533
particularly thallium.

107
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,414
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

108
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:15,665
So maybe it's menopause.

109
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:17,755
He's 28 years old.

110
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:22,090
Yes, his age is the reason
it's weird that a man has menopause.

111
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:25,007
Male menopause.
High estrogen, low testosterone.

112
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:27,816
Explains the temperature swings,
disorientation.

113
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,588
Endocrinologically
similar to female menopause

114
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:32,934
but without the vaginas
and mah-jongg tiles.

115
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,240
Male menopause doesn't
explain the blue vision.

116
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,543
The blue vision isn't a symptom,
it's a side effect

117
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,494
of Viagra.

118
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,247
It's right there on the label.

119
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:43,042
Which I have no reason to
have read except that I'm a doctor.

120
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,348
He's not taking Viagra.

121
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,753
You mean he didn't tell
you he was taking Viagra.

122
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:51,097
I don't care how sick he is, trust me.
He still thinks he's got a shot.

123
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,413
Menopause causes temperature swings,
limpness.

124
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:55,764
Limpness causes pills,
pills cause the blues.

125
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:58,137
He's presenting no other
signs of premature aging.

126
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:02,038
Aging's not the only cause. You said
that's he got burns on 54% of his body.

127
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,277
Sure it's not 55%?

128
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,491
Burns to his genitals
could cause testicular trauma.

129
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,923
Which in turn could cause?

130
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:11,749
Run a hormone panel.

131
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,311
Comes back positive, pump him
full of testosterone and send him home.

132
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:16,462
And stop following me.

133
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,833
Thank God my parents are dead.

134
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,160
If the old man had heard I
had menopause, I'd never live it down.

135
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,919
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

136
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,794
Once these testosterone
pellets dissolve,

137
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,354
your system will be back to normal.

138
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:33,205
Yeah, but till then I'm an old lady.

139
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,074
Okay to come in?

140
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,525
It's not MRSA.
He's not being isolated anymore.

141
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,402
Anyone not in a white coat is welcome.

142
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,673
You're looking better.

143
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,099
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

144
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,503
Turns out I got some hormone thing.

145
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:52,904
They're fixing it right now.

146
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,851
You okay?

147
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,933
Yeah, I think so. I just--

148
00:08:58,836 --> 00:08:59,836
Derek, you in pain?

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,404
- You need to get these out.
- Hold on. What's wrong?

150
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,775
- What's going on?
- Looks like an allergic reaction.

151
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,376
Hold on, we're gonna
get you something to stop it.

152
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,351
- No, just take 'em out!
- You gotta calm down.

153
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:11,605
- Get 'em out!
- Derek!

154
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:13,786
Derek, let her go!

155
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,414
I need two milligrams IV lorazepam stat!

156
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,479
Get 'em out!

157
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,050
Complaint department's across the hall.

158
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:44,543
I'm busy.

159
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,961
Can I just assume that you
told me how unfair I'm being and--

160
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,435
You could throw a dart at all the
adjectives between arrogant and unhinged

162
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:00,786
and I'm sure you'd
hit one that describes me.

163
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,394
There's a reason I operate that way.

164
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,982
I live in pain.

165
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,598
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable,

166
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:17,038
but on bad ones will suck
the life force right out of you.

167
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:21,455
Doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

168
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,700
Actually...

169
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,399
means I was wrong.

170
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:32,423
Thank you.

171
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,268
I know that couldn't have been...

172
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:37,914
easy for you to say.

173
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,358
Even if you don't mean a word of it.

174
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,827
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.

176
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,451
And I'm sure you'd pass.

177
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:57,707
The thing is, I've never been
interested in what you have to say.

178
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,307
All I care about is what you do.

179
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,889
I'll see you at the hearing.

180
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,373
It wasn't the medicine.

181
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,197
Contamination and allergy
tests both came back negative.

182
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,721
There was nothing to
suggest a pulmonary embolism.

183
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,940
And his EKG showed
the expected tachycardia

184
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,572
from the exertion of the attack.

185
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,481
And I'm fine by the way,
thanks for asking.

186
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,399
Aggression comes on that fast,
it's gotta have a neurologic basis.

187
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,900
We should do a CT for a frontal
lobe tumor and an LP for meningitis.

188
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,063
Great.

189
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:40,546
Have at it.

190
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:47,557
That's it?

191
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:50,502
No challenging our theory?
No tearing us down?

192
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,214
No need.

193
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,097
You've got it under control.

194
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,037
Where are you going?

195
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,038
Upstairs this time.

196
00:11:57,953 --> 00:11:58,903
To do what?

197
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,050
Check myself into rehab.

198
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,306
- Did Tritter offer you another deal?
- Nope. This is all me.

199
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:18,203
So, no slaps on the back,
encouraging words?

200
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:21,317
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

201
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,849
I hope it's me detoxing.

202
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:27,835
Otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair
of underwear last night for nothing.

203
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:28,927
So this is for real?

204
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,010
It's not just a show for Tritter?

205
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:34,883
Absolutely it's a show for Tritter.
And the judge.

206
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:37,706
Unfortunately,
unless it's real, there is no show.

207
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:39,963
Hey, if it doesn't help my case,

208
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:42,923
then at least I can go
to prison with heightened senses.

209
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,709
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

210
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,384
Time's up. Group's starting.

211
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,390
Gonna need to check that stuff.

212
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:57,654
When I lead the big patient rebellion,
Voldemort here is first to go.

213
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,805
CT was normal. No frontal lobe tumor.
LP was negative for meningitis.

214
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,394
We're back to square one.

215
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:06,878
What about something vascular?
Polyarteritis nodosa?

216
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,155
Brain lesions would've
shown up on the CT

217
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:11,739
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

218
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,643
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

219
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,594
We would've seen respiratory problems.

220
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:18,861
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

221
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,981
We need to deal with this ourselves.

222
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,484
He can make the time.
Derek's still his patient.

223
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:25,688
The man's life as he
knows it could be over.

224
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,453
I think you of all people
would want to cut him some slack.

225
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:32,118
We're treating a man who runs into
burning buildings for perfect strangers.

226
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,177
He didn't ask for what's happening
to him. House did everything to himself.

227
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:36,695
He's been cut more than enough slack.

228
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,596
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

229
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,212
It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

230
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:47,291
I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms
around me and tell me he understood.

231
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,768
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

232
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,600
He may never be ready.

233
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,042
You're doing the only thing you can do.

234
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:57,054
You're trying.

235
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,586
How about you, Greg?

236
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,372
You thought about how to
fix things with people in your life?

237
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,323
No need.

238
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:07,386
People in my life have
no expectations of me.

239
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,675
- Makes all our lives easier.
- Apparently not.

240
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,132
- The first step in recovery--
- Is admitting I have a problem.

241
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,347
I've obviously done that,
or I wouldn't be here.

242
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:21,048
I've even embraced step two. I've
accepted that there is a higher power.

243
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:25,483
Maybe not a god per se, but
that Andre the Giant guy was powerful.

244
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,619
Where I start to butt
up against it is step three,

245
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,873
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

246
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,772
I'm sure Andre's ghost has
my back and all, but my free will?

247
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,983
- I never leave home without it.
- Kind of like your pills.

248
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:44,524
If you could do this on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

249
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,321
True.

250
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,717
Everybody lies.

251
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,373
- His tox screen.
- It's been clean every time.

252
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,486
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

253
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,908
He's had extensive skin grafts,
which hurt like hell.

254
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,572
Not everybody's House. People
can handle pain without medication.

255
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:12,723
But they do have pain.

256
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,128
This guy's worried about losing his job,
so he's hiding the pain.

257
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,193
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out where the problem is.

258
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:22,137
- Or he doesn't feel pain.
- Either way, it's something.

259
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,890
- When?
- Two minutes ago.

260
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,985
Pulse is 137. Respiration 42.

261
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,420
He was fine, just telling me a joke.

262
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,471
Get her out of here.

263
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:38,555
No fluid in his lungs.

264
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,671
O2 set's 85. He's hypoxic.
We're gonna have to intubate.

265
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:42,672
It's not his lungs.

266
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:46,084
He's got marked S-T elevation.
He's having a heart attack.

267
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,658
Pick a color.

268
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:00,497
Medication time.

269
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,887
You are a ray of
sunshine on a cloudy day.

270
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,852
- He's stable.
- Won't stay that way.

271
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,367
His blood tests show
troponins and CKMB up.

272
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,307
Chase was right.
He was hiding chest pain.

273
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:32,336
He's been having a whole
series of heart attacks.

274
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,626
Heart attacks can't cause
to reach out and choke someone.

275
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,880
Lack of oxygen to the
brain causes disorientation.

276
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,352
Increased adrenaline causes rage.

277
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:41,053
More important question is,
what caused the attacks?

278
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:46,934
Where you going?

279
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:50,289
To see House. We have a
28-year-old with clean arteries,

280
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,602
no valvular abnormalities
having multiple heart attacks.

281
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,753
I'm not gonna wait for Chase
to give us another breakthrough.

282
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,190
Maybe we should go.

283
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,291
We don't have an answer yet.

284
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,383
I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking.

285
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:12,142
Whoever came up with buprenorphine
to wean off Vicodin should be shot.

286
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,443
Then stabbed in the eye.

287
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:16,082
Think someone needs to adjust my meds!

288
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,467
The heart shows no
signs of inflammation or--

289
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,373
The cause of the heart
attacks isn't internal.

290
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,469
It must be external,
something environmental.

291
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,920
None of the attacks
happened in the same place.

292
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,453
Still must be something in common.

293
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,207
First one happened in
a flat building fire.

294
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,923
Fire, water, smoke, oxygen masks.

295
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,572
And the 2nd and
3rd ones happened here.

296
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:32,990
There's no fire, no water, no smoke.

297
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,283
His clothes are all different.
He'd been cleaned.

298
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:37,617
That's the what's. How about the who's?

299
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,220
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but--

300
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,864
- Anyone else?
- People don't cause heart attacks.

301
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,885
Well, you should be worried
about proving me wrong.

302
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,213
Would you come with me, please?

303
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:57,614
Anything new on my brother?

304
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:00,736
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

305
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:01,691
Yeah.

306
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,560
What's this all about?

307
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,305
I don't know.

308
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,187
They wanted to talk to us together.

309
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,659
House was right.

310
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,216
I don't get it.

311
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,928
How can I be causing his heart attacks?

312
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:42,345
You may be carrying an agent that
triggered them. It could be anything.

313
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:46,296
Mold spores, poisonous plant residue,
something you picked up at a fire site.

314
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,723
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

315
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,395
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

316
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:57,146
You can't blame yourself for this.

317
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,530
- You know how he got those skin grafts?
- He was trapped in a fire.

318
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,590
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire, and

319
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,993
the ceiling collapsed.

320
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,844
And it cut me off from
the rest of the group.

321
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,649
And I kept yelling that I was fine, but

322
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:18,026
Derek refused to wait for the
team to clear the debris, so he took off

323
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:19,743
looking for another access point.

324
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:23,474
He got caught in a back draft.

325
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:29,174
He almost died because of me once.

326
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,901
And now it's happening again.

327
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:53,980
You're not my mom.

328
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,602
You don't have to
keep checking up on me.

329
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,364
- How you doing?
- Not bad.

330
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,382
Considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

331
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,701
See this big fancy wing?

332
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,324
It was built because this program works.

333
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,275
Faulty logic.

334
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:16,808
This big fancy wing exists because some
people with money think that it works.

335
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,543
They want to believe
they can buy a better world.

336
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,572
This is nothing short
of idealized despair.

337
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:26,827
- Let other people wallow in it.
- I don't even know what that means.

338
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,367
None of this means anything.

339
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:31,584
It's just nonsensical
slogans and platitudes.

340
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:35,444
- Meaning takes time. It takes work.
- What do you think I've been doing?

341
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:38,445
You've been here for two days.
Talk about wallowing in it.

342
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,236
We all get it.
We know how much pain you have.

343
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:44,002
You're here to deal with
that and get on with your life.

344
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:44,882
Right.

345
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:48,333
I should have an affair with
a dying patient and move into a hotel.

346
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:52,564
You're a coward, House.

347
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,657
You find fault in everybody, because
you're afraid to look at yourself.

348
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:00,245
Thanks.

349
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,507
I was running short on platitudes.

350
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:03,651
You can leave now.

351
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,526
We tested Amy for about
a dozen different agents,

352
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:18,127
- but they all came back negative.
- So she's not causing the attacks.

353
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,214
Are you in love with her?

354
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,998
What does that have to do with anything?

355
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,361
Amy told me how you
got those skin grafts.

356
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,691
And the way you're always
watching out for her.

357
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,442
And I see the way you look at her.

358
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,030
Have you told her how you feel?

359
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,685
She has a six-year-old daughter.

360
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,240
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

361
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,205
I know.

362
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:53,492
Because she did.

363
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,460
With my brother.

364
00:21:59,016 --> 00:21:59,966
They're engaged.

365
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,855
Broken Heart Syndrome.

366
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:07,380
He's in love, and it's killing him.

367
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,502
Thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

368
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:12,466
Thanks to his menopause and estrogen
level he basically is an old woman.

369
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,617
BHS is an acute physical
response to an emotional experience.

370
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,165
Stress triggers a
flood of catecholamines--

371
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,316
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy, not a heart attack.

372
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:24,232
But if you're too worried about
losing your job to get it treated,

373
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,296
they can devolve into
full-on heart attacks.

374
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:29,112
You think it's a coincidence
this started when Amy got engaged?

375
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:30,063
No, I don't.

376
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:34,389
But now that you know the why,
what are you gonna do to stop the how?

377
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,208
We already put him on beta
blockers and nitroglycerine, no effect.

378
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,755
We need to put him on anti-depressants.

379
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:39,806
Not if you're right.

380
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,861
Anti-depressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

381
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,744
which would only speed
up the heart attacks.

382
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:47,929
We could try propylthiouracil.
Slow down his metabolic rate.

383
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,320
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

384
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,703
The only other option is blood thinners.

385
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:56,482
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled
arteries and a swollen heart.

386
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,684
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to his heart.

387
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:01,420
So buy him a girlfriend. Make him happy.

388
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,243
That might make you happy. The only
thing that'll make him happy is Amy.

389
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:06,945
So keep him away from her.

390
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,503
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks in the room.

391
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,057
What will happen when we'll
tell him he can never see her again.

392
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,354
- He needs a shrink.
- Chase's idea is as good as any.

393
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,383
Because short of frying
his brain and wiping Amy out,

394
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:19,498
he's screwed.

395
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:24,597
We need Cuddy.

396
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:26,558
Why?

397
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,561
So you can tell her why
you need to fry a guy's brain.

398
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:34,903
The guy's heart isn't working,
and you want to shock his brain.

399
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:38,186
Electroshock therapy is the
only way to erase his memories of Amy

400
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:40,239
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

401
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,790
This isn't 1940. The problem
can be controlled with anti-depressants.

402
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:44,925
Cameron?

403
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:47,420
Anti-depressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

404
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:48,521
speed up the attacks.

405
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:52,558
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them will solve this problem.

406
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,179
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin romance in his head.

407
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,584
We're gonna pull out the 1940 playbook.

408
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,423
Bilateral electrodes,
high stimulus sine-wave intensity,

409
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,744
turning that dial all the way to 11.

410
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,398
It's basic brain chemistry.

411
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,192
We interrupt protein synthesis,
altering the neurotransmitter system.

412
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:13,037
End results: no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

413
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,550
Go ahead.

414
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:26,845
You heard the lady. Go plug him in.

415
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:35,953
Am I really that pathetic?

416
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:39,874
What are you talking about?

417
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:42,381
If I had pitched electroshock therapy

418
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,301
as a cure for Broken
Heart Syndrome any other time,

419
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:49,695
you'd have dug in and maybe try
a hundred other useless things first.

420
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:52,662
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me, or

421
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,207
you just feel sorry for me.

422
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,413
You presented a reasonable argument.

423
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:01,974
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

424
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,089
Never once used the word "moron."

425
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:08,167
The rehab's working, House.

426
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:14,967
You'll still be able
to perform routine functions

427
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,877
like walking, talking, tying your shoes.

428
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,151
The treatment targets
the anterior cingulate cortex.

429
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,247
It should only affect
your experiential memories.

430
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:27,066
So my parents? My childhood?

431
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,761
If this works, you won't remember them.

432
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:33,942
Or your firefighting training.

433
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,019
And Amy.

434
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:40,703
Are you okay with that?

435
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,508
I wouldn't miss her, right?

436
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:48,346
Tell Amy how you feel,
because if she loves you--

437
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,457
No.

438
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:51,008
I won't do that to her.

439
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:53,643
Or to my brother.

440
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,783
You're effectively killing
who you are just to keep this secret.

441
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:04,850
She doesn't love me.

442
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:22,385
Caterpillar?

443
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:27,374
Lower intestine with ulcerative colitis.

444
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:32,197
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

445
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:37,138
Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until
I promised I'd come and see for myself.

446
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:40,703
I gotta admit,

447
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:43,378
this move I did not expect.

448
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,820
Well, don't tell anyone, but the photos
of smiling people in the brochures,

449
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:48,952
it's just marketing.

450
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,469
Well, you're obviously making an effort.

451
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,789
So I suppose the next
step is for me to...

452
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,162
talk to the DA.

453
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,333
Which you have no intention of doing.

454
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,022
No.

455
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:08,855
So words mean nothing,
actions mean nothing.

456
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,006
What the hell is left?

457
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,665
You son of a bitch!

458
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:22,906
What about your words? Your actions?

459
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,637
"Gotta get House cleaned up.

460
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,605
Gotta get him to show some humility."

461
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,065
But when it comes to actually
doing something, you've proved that

462
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,423
all you care about is bitch-slapping
a guy who refused to kiss your ass.

463
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,217
You ever trust an addict?

464
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,275
You ever give one
the benefit of the doubt?

465
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:46,169
- How many times that works out for you
- Yeah, I get it.

466
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,520
So you were screwed over by your wife,
your mother, your partner.

467
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,567
But you keep sending
them Christmas cards

468
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,120
while you take it out on everyone else.

469
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,371
No more Christmas cards.

470
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:57,835
No, I learned...

471
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,629
people like you...

472
00:28:01,843 --> 00:28:03,223
even your actions lie.

473
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,990
I'm scared.

474
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,604
I know.

475
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:23,227
I'm gonna give you a muscle
relaxant so your body doesn't convulse.

476
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,136
Count backwards from ten.

477
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:51,903
Go.

478
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,044
What's your name?

479
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:10,358
Heart sounds good.

480
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,142
Do you know what city we're in?

481
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:17,648
No.

482
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,951
Would you be okay with
a couple of visitors?

483
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,372
It's me. Brock.

484
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:52,177
I'm your brother,

485
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,081
and when you get out of here,

486
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,684
you'll be staying with me.

487
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,064
I'm Amy.

488
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:08,334
I'm your friend.

489
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:12,028
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:16,354
But I don't remember either of you.

491
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:30,008
We've give him four
rounds of electroshock.

492
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,926
The charge made his voice a little
higher, but the EKG and BP are good.

493
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,948
Good.

494
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:39,116
We're gonna give him
his last round in the morning,

495
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,867
then be in court for your hearing.

496
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,080
Thanks.

497
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,880
I'm gonna stay here.

498
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:46,944
Monitor Derek.

499
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,970
Thanks for the update.

500
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,909
My next condolence call is arriving.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

501
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:11,438
I got you something.

502
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:15,735
Nice.

503
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,900
I figured it might help make
a good impression on the judge.

504
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:23,598
It's not that nice.

505
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:29,864
I had no business blaming
you for any of this.

506
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I know you were just trying to help me.

507
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,118
Protect me.

508
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:38,970
That's what friends do.

509
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:43,625
Is this

510
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:44,907
an apology?

511
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,389
Part of the program.

512
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,208
You don't like it, I can stop.

513
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,997
Not at all. It's just so...

514
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,155
unfamiliar.

515
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,426
Please, keep going.

516
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:15,709
He looks lost.

517
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,586
It's gonna take him a while.

518
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,807
Brock's pulling a double shift.

519
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:26,697
He can't stand to see him this way.

520
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,698
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

521
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,517
I know the timing isn't
great with a wedding coming up.

522
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,403
What wedding?

523
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,946
Yours.

524
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:39,542
You and Brock.

525
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,869
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

526
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,985
Why would you think
we're getting married?

527
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:51,744
When you first offered Dr. House
the chance to check into drug rehab,

528
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:54,845
- how did he respond?
- He told me to get out of his office.

529
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,014
I warned him that...

530
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:00,624
he could end up in prison
and lose his medical license.

531
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:01,940
If he was concerned,

532
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,071
he didn't show it.

533
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,464
- So you continued your investigation.
- Yes,

534
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:09,407
which is what lead me
to the hospital pharmacy.

535
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:11,613
Turn it off.

536
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,102
I thought I told you never
to call me when I'm on trial.

537
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:19,835
The memories were false.
We fried his brain for nothing.

538
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:21,798
Whatever was killing
him before is still there.

539
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,317
We did an MRI. There's a slight
hypoperfusion in the anterior cortex.

540
00:33:25,318 --> 00:33:27,837
What did you find when
you checked the pharmacy log?

541
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:28,940
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

542
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,226
Thanks, Your Honor. Hard to hear.

543
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:34,157
Did you test for clotting
time and LV function?

544
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:36,169
I believe this is a medical emergency,
Your Honor.

545
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,712
His blood's normal, and his
heart's pumping it up to the brain.

546
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:41,627
But it's not all getting there.
Something's obstructing the blood flow.

547
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:45,043
You were given adequate notice
to make arrangements for your patients.

548
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,147
There's no hyperintensity to
suggest a foreign body near the region.

549
00:33:48,148 --> 00:33:50,479
And no signs of infection
or vascular malformation.

550
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,584
- It's lower down.
- Dr. House, hang up.

551
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,696
The cytology on the
LP doesn't suggest a tumor.

552
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:55,647
Now!

553
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:58,689
Hang on a second.

554
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:04,181
Does your voice always get that
high and annoying when you're angry?

555
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,560
- Do you want to go to jail?
- No thank you.

556
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:11,803
Set him up for a selective
vertebral angiography. I'm on my way.

557
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,320
Dr. House--

558
00:34:15,082 --> 00:34:16,032
Sit down!

559
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,099
Why?

560
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,526
I'm bored. There's nothing I can say or
do that's gonna make a difference here.

561
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,227
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

562
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:24,938
Get a recess.

563
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,201
Are you out of your mind?

564
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,884
They said they wanted me there,
but I don't think they liked me.

565
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:33,117
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

566
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,868
It's another symptom of menopause.

567
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:38,056
His system keeps getting
hit by women's issues.

568
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,861
So let's follow the pattern.

569
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,244
What might obstruct the blood flow
that's more common in women than men?

570
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:45,136
- Is the catheter in?
- Go back to court.

571
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:48,087
- We'll let you know the results.
- Shut up and wire him.

572
00:34:50,637 --> 00:34:53,137
Center the image on
the interpeduncular cistern.

573
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,218
Keep it moving at 30 frames per second.

574
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,811
If you think the arteries are narrowing,

575
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,526
we're gonna need still shots,
which we can do without you.

576
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:01,577
The problem is not how wide the road is.

577
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,600
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars,

578
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,456
that's what's causing the slow down.
We find him, we find the problem.

579
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:11,710
- He's wired.
- Go.

580
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:13,216
Injecting the dye.

581
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,710
Blood's in the capillarieses.

582
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:18,584
There.

583
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:21,749
Mr. Squeegee.

584
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:26,197
Spinal meningioma pushing
on the nerves to the vocal chords.

585
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,768
Creates the voice change.

586
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,640
And that nerve just happens to live

587
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:32,541
right near the meningeal
branch of the vertebral artery.

588
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,426
Obstructs the blood flow to the brain.

589
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,779
Brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

590
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,585
Memories cause love.

591
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,142
Love kills.

592
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:46,072
And we didn't completely screw up.

593
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:49,549
Cleaning the slate bought
us time to find the real problem.

594
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,300
On the other hand, if we'd been better,
we wouldn't have needed the time.

595
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,567
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

596
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:58,668
He can start enjoying real
misery instead of the fake stuff.

597
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:06,084
I just heard that
you apologized to Wilson.

598
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:07,839
Detoxing.

599
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:09,971
I didn't know what I was saying.

600
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:19,436
Excuse me.

601
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:24,352
I have to go to jail.

602
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,024
What is your position
at Princeton-Plainsboro?

603
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,216
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

604
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,397
And you're responsible
for oversight of the pharmacy?

605
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:37,260
Yes.

606
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,605
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

607
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,990
I hope you don't mind that
we continued on without you.

608
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,131
I said I was sorry.

609
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,497
There's no need to be sarcastic.

610
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,039
What is this?

611
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:54,947
That's our prescription
sign-out log from December 24.

612
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,381
Does that appear to be Dr.
House's signature?

613
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,545
Yes. What has he signed for?

614
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:04,153
A prescription for oxycodone
in the name of patient Larry Zebalusky.

615
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,350
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

616
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:07,312
- No.
- Why?

617
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:08,557
He was already dead.

618
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:10,992
- And Dr. House knew this.
- Yes.

619
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:12,672
So...

620
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:17,121
Dr. House had no legal or medical
basis for acquiring that oxycodone?

621
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,253
Dr. Cuddy?

622
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:28,794
He never got the pills.

623
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:31,994
It's his signature.

624
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,240
The log is strictly controlled.

625
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:37,404
Dr. House did pick up a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

626
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:39,012
It says oxycodone.

627
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:41,037
- You testified it was--
- I know.

628
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,671
But it wasn't oxycodone.

629
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:46,674
Dr. Wilson informed me that Dr.
House already tried

630
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:49,118
to steal the pain
medication of this patient,

631
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,222
which made clear to me that Dr.
House was in

632
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:54,872
a particularly vulnerable
and desperate state.

633
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:58,130
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

634
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,331
Dr. House only got
a bottle with placebos.

635
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:03,435
I understand your impulse
to protect a valued colleague.

636
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:05,480
I have it right here
on the inventory report--

637
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:08,105
Your Honor, she's lying.
She's obviously forged that report.

638
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:09,205
In light of this evidence...

639
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,630
If this is real,
why didn't she mention it earlier?

640
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:14,653
- I move to dismiss this case.
- There is other evidence, Your Honor.

641
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:16,687
Everyone shut up and sit down.

642
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,974
Dr. Cuddy, why are you only
now coming forward with this?

643
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:25,779
I guess I never expected
it to go this far.

644
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:31,990
The witness is excused.

645
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:34,718
Your Honor,
you can't seriously believe--

646
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,366
Dr. House, please stand.

647
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,774
My suspicion is your boss--

648
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,150
My suspicion is you have
better friends than you deserve.

649
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:55,375
Rules and laws apply to everyone.
You are not as special as you think.

650
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:58,646
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

651
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,915
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

652
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,891
but I am sure that this man is
not flooding the streets with cocaine.

653
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,584
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

654
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,136
he must've done something
to set you off. But

655
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,431
you're gonna have to live with it.

656
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:20,421
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony, I'm not
going to allow this to proceed to jury.

657
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,642
Case dismissed.

658
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:23,934
Court is adjourned.

659
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:31,800
You're still guilty of contempt
for that little walkout earlier.

660
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,462
You'll be spending the night in jail,

661
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:36,035
and after that,
you're going right back to your rehab.

662
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:36,986
Bailiff,

663
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:38,791
take Dr. House into custody.

664
00:39:46,232 --> 00:39:47,182
Dr. House.

665
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,695
So should I be looking
for you in the shadows?

666
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,283
Flinch every time a car backfires?

667
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:04,127
Good luck.

668
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,512
I hope I'm wrong about you.

669
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,434
We got the meningioma.

670
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,647
Your brain should start
generating real memories again.

671
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,703
What do I do when I get out?

672
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,296
You have people who love you.

673
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:33,918
They'll take care of you.

674
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,860
You start over.

675
00:40:45,354 --> 00:40:48,654
Surprised to see you're not
spooning your way through the walls.

676
00:40:52,036 --> 00:40:53,230
So, what do you say?

677
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,251
How about a conjugal visit to celebrate?

678
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,190
There's nothing to celebrate, House.

679
00:40:58,575 --> 00:40:59,975
You made me perjure myself.

680
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,423
Fabricate evidence.

681
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:06,193
You make everyone around
you worse for being there.

682
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,737
The only bright spot
is that now I own your ass.

683
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:14,857
When you get out of rehab,

684
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,361
you're gonna be pulling
double clinic duty,

685
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:19,016
giving lectures to students

686
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:21,204
helping me find donors,

687
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,369
and pretty much anything else I ask.

688
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:25,303
You got it?

689
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:40,767
Your buprenorphine.

690
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,985
You get these from the
pharmacy or from Voldemort?

691
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:46,954
Voldemort.

692
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:49,007
Why, what difference does it--

693
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:54,936
That's Vicodin.

694
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:57,618
- He's been slipping you Vicodin?
- No!

695
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:01,138
He'd be risking his
minimum wage job to do that.

696
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:09,048
The whole time?

697
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,023
My higher power said it was okay.

698
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:13,925
Nothing's changed?

699
00:42:14,456 --> 00:42:15,728
Nothing's changed.

700
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:30,598
The apology.

701
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,933
You didn't need to
do that to make this work.

702
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:35,665
Believe what you want.

703
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:39,993
Good night, House.

704
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:43,147
I'll see you tomorrow.

705
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Good night, Wilson.

706
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,376
