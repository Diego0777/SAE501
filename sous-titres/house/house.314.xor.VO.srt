1
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:04,605
I'm okay, let's just go home.

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,366
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,624
I tripped on the ice. Eight other
kids tripped. This is embarrassing.

4
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,491
You said you were just
gonna hang with your friends.

5
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,613
I turn around and you're
out there on the ice.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,905
- I'm fine.
- You don't know that.

7
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,387
You fell. Awkwardly.

8
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:23,526
No, I didn't.

9
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:24,860
You don't know how to fall.

10
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:28,429
I'm 16, I've been falling a lot.
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

11
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:29,763
And I checked.

12
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:35,374
And now the doctors are gonna check.

13
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:37,682
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,226
I don't need you to fix every boo-boo.

15
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:41,586
Then stop getting them.

16
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,083
I was just playing around
with my friends. I was having fun.

17
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:45,484
You know you can't do that.

18
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,269
- Oh, I can't have fun?
- You know what I mean.

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,110
I'm gonna have a talk with your friends

20
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,666
- No!
- they need to stop--

21
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,249
No. I don't want you freaking them out.

22
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:01,341
Fine. I'll go to the hospital, but
they're gonna tell you that I'm fine.

23
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:04,642
And they're gonna tell you
that you don't need to worry about...

24
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:05,888
Mom!

25
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,739
Mom?

26
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:51,619
Hello!

27
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:04,898
Mom, you gotta wake up.

28
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:06,497
No one's coming.

29
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,705
911, what is your emergency?

30
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:22,341
We got into an accident along
the canal road just outside Kingston.

31
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:24,336
My mom's unconscious.

32
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,334
Are you hurt?

33
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:29,929
I'm fine.

34
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:42,378
Transcript: FRM - Sync: jh26

35
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:18,785
- Where's Foreman?
- He's down here somewhere.

36
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,689
Somewhere. Very helpful.

37
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:24,247
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

38
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:25,546
Sometime.

39
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:29,730
I realize you can't predict, I just
thought you might be able to estimate.

40
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,531
It's Valentine's Day.
I've planned a surprise getaway.

41
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,672
Getaway.

42
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:36,627
Getaway.

43
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,202
Get away.

44
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:48,079
- Is my mom okay?
- She's gone to surgery.

45
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,666
Your girlfriend wants to know
if you're available for Valentine's.

46
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,617
Act surprised.

47
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,104
What are you doing down here?

48
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,203
There's a snowstorm.
E.R.'s short staffed.

49
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:04,733
We're all supposed to be here.
You're supposed to be here.

50
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,434
And you're an ass. Act surprised.

51
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,701
This could sting a little.

52
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:14,897
Can we hurry this up?

53
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,798
- Make sure that--
- Take your time.

54
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,215
What's your name?

55
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,194
Hannah Morganthal.

56
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,109
You have CIPA, Hannah Morganthal.

57
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:26,843
No, I don't.

58
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,147
We have to do x-rays to make
sure you don't have internal injuries.

59
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:34,148
Blood tests to make sure no infections.
EEG for neurological anomalies. And...

60
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:37,121
biopsy a spinal nerve.

61
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,880
Congenital insensitivity to pain is one
of the rarest conditions on the planet.

62
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,571
There's only been about...
60 documented cases...

63
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:48,328
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think she's one of them.

64
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,384
- She says she's not.
- That's reason number one.

65
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,243
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

66
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:58,207
Two, she's still wet from the snow,
but she's not shivering. That's odd.

67
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,535
Unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

68
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:02,960
The ambulance was warm.

69
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:04,852
I want to see my mother.

70
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,103
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

71
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,121
When she was a baby, she chewed
on herself without feeling it.

72
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,738
I fell through a
window when I was a kid.

73
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,513
Four, when you cleaned the wound,

74
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:16,362
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

75
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,967
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

76
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,861
Takes an imaginative leap, Ms.
Morganthal.

77
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,590
That's one of them Jew names.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,779
Ashkenazis are a higher risk group.

79
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,498
One the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it.

80
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:33,106
And she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

81
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:36,051
They killed our Lord.
You gonna trust them?

82
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,535
She wants to see her mom.
If she admits having CIPA,

83
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:43,546
she knows we're not letting her
go anywhere without a battery of tests.

84
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:46,850
- You said you had seven reasons.
- I pulled a number out of the air.

85
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,651
- What, five isn't enough?
- Five lame reasons aren't.

86
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,490
I'm taking her to
see her mom as soon as--

87
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,762
I can hit her again if six isn't enough.

88
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:00,127
Do the tests.

89
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,261
Need to bail on the E.R. I got a case.

90
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,702
Why are you wearing perfume?

91
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,909
Is this a real case or

92
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:15,647
one of those imaginary cases
that happen when you're bored?

93
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:16,598
CIPA.

94
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,383
CIPA is a diagnosis.

95
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,770
Diagnoses happen at the end of cases.

96
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:26,891
She's got no idea what's going on in her
body. There's gotta be something wrong.

97
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:28,795
In other words,
she could be perfectly healthy,

98
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:31,496
but you're curious about
someone who can't feel pain

99
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:34,444
because you always feel pain.
So you wanna go exploring.

100
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:36,668
She was in a car accident.

101
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,392
She needs x-rays,
blood tests, EEG, nerve biopsy.

102
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,195
I also note that, although snow
was coming down in sheets this morning,

103
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,546
you left your hat at
home and used ear muffs.

104
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,927
Do your tests except for the--

105
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:51,317
So while everyone else was
just worrying about getting in,

106
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,018
you were concerned with hat-head.

107
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,185
Blind dates are never a good idea.

108
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:02,526
Only reason to wear a scarf like that is
as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.

109
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,593
Do your tests. Except the nerve biopsy.

110
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,795
- I need the nerve biopsy.
- You'd risk paralyzing her.

111
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:10,696
- But it's neurological.
- You have no evidence of that.

112
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,172
She tripped.

113
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,930
Do you have any evidence
other than the fact

114
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:18,981
that a typically clumsy CIPA
patient tripped on an icy day?

115
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,409
If the EEG reveals a problem,
we can talk then.

116
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,340
You could have left the
scarf at home and just told him

117
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,266
you'd be wearing a look of desperation.

118
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,245
Spiking on leads C3 and O2.

119
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,088
She could be going into a seizure.

120
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,021
I think there's a simpler explanation.

121
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,622
You're not gonna find anything.

122
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,854
I'm fine. I wanna see my mom!

123
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,661
- So sedate her.
- She won't consent.

124
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,194
- She's a teenager.
- No dad, mom's still in surgery.

125
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,900
What do you want us to do,
hold her down?

126
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,899
Only until you inject her with
a sedative. Then you can let her go.

127
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,850
We tried.

128
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,312
Seriously?

129
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,238
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

130
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,516
before we could get her
to sit still enough to inject her.

131
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,723
So break her arm. She won't mind.

132
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,311
- You're cranky.
- I'm in pain.

133
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,033
Come on, let's go break her arm.

134
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,991
Nurse Shortie, your biz-nitch.
How long you gonna waste her time?

135
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:27,138
So glad we're walking somewhere. Another
60 feet and this conversation is over.

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,779
When you guys are out of this program,
Cameron will find somebody,

137
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,478
Chase will find eight somebodies,
and you'll be alone.

138
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,392
- 30 feet.
- You'll date and you'll date.

139
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,234
But you're the ultimate Darwinian.
You've got to fight for everything.

140
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,777
Anybody else would just slow you down.

141
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,578
Yeah. I'm still with her, aren't I?

142
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,995
Yeah. I can only imagine it's
because she hasn't given you an excuse

143
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:48,596
to break up and you don't have
the guts to recognize your own reality.

144
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,016
I wanna see my mother!

145
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,447
Hi again.

146
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,718
Not sure I can say this
without being condescending,

147
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:00,463
but then you'd get the false impression
that I respect you, so... you're a kid.

148
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,816
You're scared, you're stalling. Grow up.

149
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,567
I'm not scared. I'm never scared.

150
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,143
See? How juvenile was that?

151
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,646
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

152
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,038
Why don't you tell
me how wonderful that is?

153
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,989
It sucks.

154
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,145
Better than being in pain all the time.
Get in the chair.

155
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,796
Every morning I have
to check my eyes to make sure

156
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,671
I didn't scratch a cornea in my sleep.

157
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,604
Oh, God, stop.
I'm in a pool of tears here.

158
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,186
- I can't cry.
- Neither can I.

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,531
Every morning,
I check my eyes for jaundice.

160
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,562
In case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

161
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:39,055
I can't run anywhere without
examining all my toes for swelling.

162
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,006
I can't run.

163
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,891
Boys can't hold me for
too long because I can overheat.

164
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:46,178
Girls can't hold me for too
long because I only pay for an hour.

165
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,429
I need an alarm on my watch
to remind me to go to the bathroom.

166
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:52,783
You know how many humiliating
experiences before I thought of that?

167
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,529
The bathroom's 50 feet from my office.

168
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,927
Every drink of water,
I weigh the pros and cons.

169
00:09:56,928 --> 00:10:00,450
After everything I do, I self-check.
Mouth, tongue, gums, for cuts.

170
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:04,133
Count teeth, check temperature.
Fingers, toes, and joints for swelling.

171
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,545
- Skin for bruises.
- I got shot.

172
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,593
I sat on the stove when I was three.
Wanna see the coil marks?

173
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,447
- Yeah.
- You think I'm lying?

174
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,110
You think I just wanna check out
your tuchus, as your people would say?

175
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,683
Get in the chair and run the damn tests.

176
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:34,863
If she moves again, give her nitrous.

177
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,674
You weren't shot because of leg pain,

178
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:40,253
you were shot because you're a jerk.
- Some think the two are connected.

179
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,435
- He didn't have to do that.
- Yeah, he did.

180
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,183
I'm sick?

181
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:55,491
No, you EEG was normal.
X-ray showed no breaks.

182
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,862
Blood test showed no infections.
Urine indicated no...

183
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,329
Call a code!

184
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:05,291
Oh, God.

185
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,808
Need ice packs and cooling blankets.

186
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,399
Got saline in there?

187
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,568
She's not flush, she's not sweating.
You must be--

188
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:14,069
She has a temperature of 105.

189
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,022
Wow, she's actually sick.

190
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,859
We got her temperature down
below boiling. Could be infection.

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,074
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,510
High bilirubin.
Could be a liver problem.

193
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,726
Nope, transaminases were normal.

194
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,931
Could be drugs.
She's smoked pot since she was 11.

195
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,668
No again. Tox screen was clean.

196
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,838
We're doing this case backwards.
We do the tests and then she gets sick?

197
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,389
Maybe we did something to her.

198
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Maybe she got sick after the tests.
We should re-run them.

199
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,330
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

200
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:01,571
You wanna risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

201
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:05,472
I want to risk paralysis because
I don't know what's causing the fever.

202
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:07,206
- If it's neurological--
- It's a fever!

203
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,201
In a CIPA patient.

204
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:11,865
Obviously, things are a little
different in her upstairs wiring.

205
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,911
And have been since
the day she was born.

206
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:17,708
It's much more likely that whatever
it is was cleverly waited in hiding

207
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,519
until you guys were done testing.

208
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:22,525
- Were are you going?
- You're all against this, right?

209
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:26,541
And you're all gonna stand on
principle and refuse to do it, right?

210
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:30,186
I'm going to get Cuddy's approval.

211
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,932
How long are we gonna keep
Hannah in the dark about her mother?

212
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,118
As long as possible.

213
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,707
Side airbag should be standard.

214
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,438
I'm sure she'll agree.

215
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,798
She should know her mother's situation.

216
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,612
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

217
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,046
- Any word from House?
- No.

218
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:57,340
Maybe Cuddy will say no.

219
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,511
- Cuddy never says no.
- That's not true.

220
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,042
Nobody ever says no.

221
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:04,742
- We don't say no.
- You don't say no.

222
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:08,363
He'll come back, he'll browbeat us,
he'll give us seven reasons,

223
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,064
and eventually we'll fold.
We all will, not just me.

224
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,900
The only way we can avoid
biopsying this kid's spine is to find

225
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,851
the answer some other way.
- All the tests were negative.

226
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,663
We need a better history.

227
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,706
How much more paperwork do you need?
We've got pediatric records,

228
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:26,790
a few dozen E.R. records,
our own admission questionnaire.

229
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,671
- What's the first question?
- Insurance coverage.

230
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,476
- Okay, second question.
- Just make your point.

231
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,565
Where does it hurt?

232
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,620
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

233
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,871
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

234
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,343
No, CIPA means she's
insensitive to pain.

235
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,361
She still has scattered nerve
fibers that could conduct pain,

236
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,612
but the signals don't
make it to the brain.

237
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:52,533
What if we give her more pain signals?

238
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,172
A lot more pain signals.
Maybe some of them will make it through.

239
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:57,983
- You wanna torture her?
- No.

240
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,507
Yes. We do this to anybody else,
it's torture.

241
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,394
Doing it to her is no different
than pricking her finger.

242
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,295
We keep poking sharp sticks into her,

243
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,056
eventually we'll find
the part that's already tender.

244
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:17,117
So what does a Dean of Medicine do?

245
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,025
Oh, can we please not talk about that?

246
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,456
I will talk about anything else.
I'm just trying to get away from work.

247
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,407
Metaphorically.

248
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:29,204
Because geographically, the coffee place
around the corner from the hospital

249
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:31,027
probably isn't the
furthest you could get.

250
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,606
-Well, the snow.
- The roads are clearing.

251
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,097
But it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

252
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,727
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

253
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:44,050
Experience has taught
me to have an escape route.

254
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,301
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

255
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:55,922
Whatever happens...

256
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,010
I need you to understand that
there are certain aspects to my life

257
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,138
I'm not happy about.

258
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,039
I need the nerve biopsy.

259
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,647
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that.

260
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:11,048
- And how did you even know I was here?
- I had to bring the file.

261
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:14,437
This was the most noncommittal
location in walking distance.

262
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,558
You left your car keys on your desk.

263
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:18,944
Greg House!

264
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,545
You two must have met online.

265
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:25,063
Either that or you've got
a friend who secretly hates you.

266
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:27,675
Don Herrick.

267
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:32,265
Yeah, we connected through
singleballroomdancelovers.com.

268
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,721
Why would he volunteer that information?

269
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:40,285
Why would I hide it?

270
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,979
You didn't tell him that anything
he said would be held against you.

271
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:46,988
- So what line of work are you in?
- Oh, auto maintenance.

272
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:48,758
Changing oil and filters.

273
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:52,746
Great, my place overcharges.
Can't trust anything you guys say.

274
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:55,348
- Where're you located?
- In 14 states.

275
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,205
I own Eastern Lube.

276
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,720
Most CIPA complications are infections
and she's got a fever.

277
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,663
LP? Urine?

278
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,265
Clean, normal.

279
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,717
Same with the white blood cell count.

280
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:13,472
- Cancer?
- Nothing on the scan.

281
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:16,315
I think it's her nerves messing
with the temperature control.

282
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:19,831
Amyloid, sarcoid. There's
a lot of candidates. I want a biopsy.

283
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,694
Fine. If that's what you need,
go get it.

284
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:31,403
He seems a lot nicer than that one
from Wicca needs a daddy figure dot com.

285
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:42,236
One of these is warm,

286
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,945
the other is very hot.

287
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:50,496
Start here, move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds.

288
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,839
Then back.

289
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:55,047
We're gonna monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

290
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:59,242
If you feel any response to the heat,
it could indicate a vascular problem.

291
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,641
How's my mom doing?

292
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,640
She's okay. Do you feel anything?

293
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,247
No.

294
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,702
What does okay mean?

295
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,319
She's still in surgery.
They tell me it's going okay.

296
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,720
You can take your hand out.

297
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:21,582
And you didn't ask anything else?

298
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,271
Take your hand out of the water.

299
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,255
What's going on with my mother?

300
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,940
You just got second degree burns.

301
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:36,507
I'll be fine.

302
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,670
What's going on with my mother?
Is she gonna die?

303
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:40,771
They said she's okay.

304
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,726
Surgery this long is typical
when there are internal injuries.

305
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:48,790
Naloxone and kinase proteins in.

306
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,106
And that's gonna make me feel pain?

307
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,119
I didn't feel anything when you
guys screwed this thing into my head.

308
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,432
It'll replace missing chemicals
in your nerves. Heighten sensitivity.

309
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,730
We'll be drilling
directly into your skull.

310
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:01,531
A response should indicate sarcoma.

311
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:04,466
- What does it feel like?
- It...

312
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,170
hurts.

313
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:08,948
Sorry.

314
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,327
Bone pain is the worst there is.

315
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,601
So you need to let know
as soon as you feel anything.

316
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:17,894
She's ready.

317
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,803
So what... I just sit here
while you guys drill a hole in me?

318
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:25,757
You wanna talk?

319
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:30,800
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

320
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,355
We were. Until I got arrested.

321
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:35,717
The third time.

322
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:37,582
- Drugs?
- Fights.

323
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,782
You got an advantage.

324
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,786
Not really. Never know when to stop.

325
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:46,327
You piss a lot of people off or are
you just trying to piss off your mom?

326
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:49,681
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

327
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,643
You want us to stop?

328
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,229
Stop the drill. Stop the drill.

329
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:08,465
It's okay.

330
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:09,902
What'd you feel?

331
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:11,992
Where did you feel it?

332
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,808
Hannah, I need to know how it hurt.

333
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:29,715
I am so tired of this.

334
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,690
Did you know that the new nurse
from cardiology is sleeping with

335
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:36,735
that weird lawyer from the board?
- The guy with 11 fingers?

336
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,314
He has 11 fingers?

337
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,898
How do you not notice that?

338
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,144
The nurse used to be a man.

339
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:47,962
- She's not anymore?
- But we can't talk about that.

340
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,404
- I thought we were.
- We were supposed to talk about that.

341
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,605
I came here to talk about that.
But on the way up, I ran into Cameron.

342
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:54,972
You've got a CIPA patient.

343
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,372
- Tranny nurse is more interesting.
- Oh, it's way more interesting.

344
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,587
But instead,
I've gotta be your damn conscience.

345
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:04,091
I'm tired of being your conscience.
I don't enjoy it.

346
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,025
- No one enjoys...
- You're studying her.

347
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,076
She's actually sick.

348
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,406
Which you found out
after you took her on.

349
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,593
I was curious. Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

350
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:15,991
I don't think that metaphor
was designed to actually warn cats.

351
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,425
You don't care about her illness,
you care about CIPA.

352
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,730
Which means your focus is gonna
be on getting your answers, not hers.

353
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,983
Thank you. Forewarned is forearmed.

354
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,128
What do you think
you're gonna figure out?

355
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:29,381
You think her lack of pain
is somehow the answer to your pain.

356
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,433
I think if you'd stop talking
to Cameron, then right now,

357
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:36,315
we could be ranking nurses
in order of do-ability.

358
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,941
- Need you.
- What did the nerve biopsy show?

359
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,374
- Never did it.
- Then do it.

360
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,328
- Can't.
- Why?

361
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:43,663
She's gonna jump off the lobby balcony.

362
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,527
You think I can catch her?

363
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,429
- Get away from me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

364
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,147
Yes, you are. You're just
jealous that I can do anything.

365
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,117
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

366
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,418
- I don't believe you.
- You think she would

367
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:02,761
This is real. You want me to be in pain.
You even said so.

368
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:05,264
If we wanted to hurt you,
we'd let you jump.

369
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,233
Just let me see my mother.

370
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,184
Fine, we'll take you to her O.R.
observation room.

371
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,432
I don't believe you!

372
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,453
Your mother is fine.
I just spoke to her surgeon.

373
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:14,653
I don't believe you!

374
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,858
Hannah, what do you want from us?
What do you want us to do?

375
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:20,783
I can't feel my legs.

376
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:23,235
You're trying to pull the
same stunt twice in ten minutes.

377
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:27,145
I'm not pretending.
They don't hurt, they just aren't there.

378
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:42,734
Anything?

379
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,617
We're not looking for pain.
Anything at all, pressure?

380
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:46,568
Nothing.

381
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,529
You have six broken bones, a fever,
a concussion, erratic heart rhythms,

382
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,157
and a complete lack of
sensation below the waist.

383
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,185
I feel fine.

384
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:58,253
Is my mother out of surgery yet?

385
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,183
Not yet.

386
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,010
This is excellent.

387
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:07,112
The paranoia seems to have dissipated.
But her vitals keep getting worse.

388
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:08,336
She could be dead in hours.

389
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:11,384
But if you're gonna die a miserable,
lingering death,

390
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,483
pain-free is the way to do it.

391
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,732
You sure the fall didn't
cause the paralysis?

392
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,331
The paralysis caused the fall.

393
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:21,639
Spine's clean. No vertitable
fractures or spinal cord compression.

394
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,833
Even better.

395
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:27,295
The nuttiness and paralysis mean there's
definitely a neurological component.

396
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:28,799
Could be a nerve disease.

397
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:31,779
Which is why we need to look
at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.

398
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,459
- There are other tests...
- HIV? Syphilis?

399
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:39,687
She was negative for all STD's.
Vascular? No. ANA was negative.

400
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,122
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

401
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,282
Thyroid storm.

402
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,967
Makes sense, given her glucose
reaction was slow and potassium's down.

403
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:52,636
Yeah.

404
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,390
I'll check with an endocrinologist.

405
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:57,995
- Bennett's on call.
- Perfect.

406
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,866
- No.
- Need a consult.

407
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:16,332
I already okayed your nerve biopsy.

408
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:19,070
- Need an endocrinologist.
- Bennett's on call.

409
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:21,576
Won't pick up.
His cell phone must be broken.

410
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,650
Mine's working.

411
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:24,775
Had to give you the file.

412
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,150
I assume you're thinking thyroid storm.

413
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,131
Have you done a hormone panel?

414
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,099
Normal. TSH was on the low side.

415
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,916
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

416
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:40,022
No.

417
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:43,437
- What about CPK enzymes?
- Elevated. 275.

418
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,603
People light fires for themselves.

419
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,039
But then they don't deny it.

420
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:51,682
He's here.

421
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:52,987
CPK isn't high enough.

422
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:56,226
Potassium's what you'd expect
because of the bronchodilators.

423
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,856
Oh, my God! You're not wearing a bra.

424
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,155
It's not thyroid storm.

425
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,125
- You just met him.
- I like him.

426
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:04,615
And I like sex.

427
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,245
Do I need to stitch a letter on my tops?

428
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:10,598
No. But it might be worth
taking out an ad in the local papers.

429
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,106
Do you like me, House?

430
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:22,885
I was on the phone with Bennett 15
minutes ago. His cell phone's working.

431
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:25,754
You're M.O. is to avoid me at all costs.

432
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:29,220
And suddenly, you need
my input on every move you make.

433
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,716
I can only assume it's
because I'm on a date.

434
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,029
When we met, I noticed--

435
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,587
You noticed he was a Shriner
because the way he parted his hair.

436
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,403
That he was a mama's boy because
of the way he blinked his left eye.

437
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,148
I'm not interested. I'm not impressed.

438
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:43,748
There are only two reasons anyone
would want to screw with me tonight.

439
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,717
Either they're an altruistic,
decent person

440
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:50,388
who is worried about my well being.
Or they want me for themselves.

441
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,032
You left out the third option.

442
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:58,846
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with other people's happiness.

443
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:04,837
Good night, House.

444
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,043
We won't be bothered again.

445
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:22,243
It's late.

446
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:24,841
- I should go.
- Why?

447
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,484
I part my hair
on the left and I'm a Shriner.

448
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,067
You heard the conversation.

449
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:33,676
I'm not interested in him.

450
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,140
I don't blame you.

451
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:38,108
I only said those things
so that he wouldn't come back.

452
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,759
I don't really care about my job.

453
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:47,159
I do it well, I provide a service.
But my goal

454
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,712
was always to make enough
money to do the things I really like.

455
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:54,908
- Music, travel...
- I like those things too.

456
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,640
You like them,
but they're not really important to you.

457
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:01,395
I don't know whether it's House,

458
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:04,935
your job, or if you just
thrive on conflict, but...

459
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:09,046
you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

460
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,431
Nothing else in the world is going on.

461
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:16,531
You're focused, confident, compelling.

462
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,749
Don't take this the wrong way, but

463
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,070
I'd like to go out with that woman.

464
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,676
I can get her on the phone.

465
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:45,355
Where did you go? She's getting worse.

466
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,267
It's not thyroid storm.
Get me spinal nerve.

467
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:49,861
There are still other tests.

468
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:53,316
She just said the girl was getting
worse. You're really wanna wait?

469
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,346
We'll be risking infection,
maybe make the paralysis worse.

470
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:06,515
It is worse. We're making
it worse than worse. Do the biopsy.

471
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:09,314
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

472
00:27:09,315 --> 00:27:11,667
Do the biopsy.
- You're thinking peripheral neuropathy,

473
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,160
we should a take a nerve a
little further away from the spine.

474
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,560
A little further from the truth.
We're talking paralysis.

475
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,311
Good chance the spine is relevant.

476
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:21,482
And if this thing is progressive,
it'll kill her in hours.

477
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,122
Give me back my papers.

478
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,996
Is he asking for a spinal nerve?

479
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:30,211
- How did you know?
- Give us a minute.

480
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:40,985
Did you know they recently found
a protein that speeds up nerve growth?

481
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:43,920
Fascinating stuff.
If you put that protein

482
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,810
with the insulation from a spinal nerve,
you could grow your own little garden.

483
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,046
- If that spinal nerve...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,648
If it happened to come from a person
with CIPA, I could grow pain-free nerves

485
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:56,249
and graft them into my own leg.
What an evil plan.

486
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,703
You'd have to be on
immunosuppressors for life.

487
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,716
Risking infection, shorter life span...

488
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,476
Shorter. But normal.

489
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:07,353
Usually jealousy expresses itself
by trying to destroy what someone has.

490
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:09,381
You're more ambitious.

491
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:12,693
You actually wanna change
medical fact to get this thing...

492
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:16,371
- Medical fact changes all the time.
- You're risking your patient's life.

493
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,922
That's how medical fact changes.
A doctor risks--

494
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,412
To serve their patient's health.
Not their own.

495
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,001
- This is medically justified.
- Are you sure?

496
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,994
Are you sure...

497
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:30,266
that you're the right
one to be making this call?

498
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,029
Biopsy whatever nerve you
figure you can safely get at.

499
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:46,779
God, Wilson's annoying.

500
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:54,451
Past 3:00 AM on Valentine's Day night.
I assume you had a date with Wendy.

501
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,447
She'll survive. She knows the deal.

502
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,593
- You're lucky.
- I know.

503
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:04,198
Someday, when there's time, I would
like to actually have a social life.

504
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,369
Someday?

505
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:09,862
Come on. If there's one thing a good
looking woman can have when she wants,

506
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:12,063
it's a social life.
- You mean a sex life.

507
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,086
There's nothing wrong with a little

508
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,197
companionship 'til
the real thing comes along.

509
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,305
I had the real thing.
Forgive me if I don't want to settle.

510
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:20,824
Right.

511
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:22,749
What does that mean?

512
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:24,053
Nothing.

513
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,054
You think I didn't have the real thing?

514
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,086
I have no idea what you had.

515
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,121
And yet you're judging it.

516
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:35,113
It's late, I'm cranky. Sorry.

517
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:38,157
You think I didn't have the real thing.
How could you even know?

518
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,680
You married a dying man.

519
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:41,869
You thought...

520
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:44,255
six months, a year, it'll be tough.

521
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,964
But then I'll recover and
I'll have the rest of my life.

522
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:50,815
It's like willingly getting the flu
or joining the Peace Corps. Short term.

523
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:54,464
Wow, you nailed it.
It's basically like a wasted weekend.

524
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,729
The sacrifices you made were huge.

525
00:29:58,324 --> 00:30:00,874
But they were at the
height of your love for him.

526
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:04,601
A commitment is only commitment
because it has no expiration date.

527
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:08,428
You stand next to someone
and watch them floss for 30 years,

528
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,322
like my parents have,
then ask for sacrifices.

529
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:13,802
That's how you know the real thing.

530
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,568
I wasn't criticizing you.

531
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,976
People who avoid commitment are
people who know what a big thing it is.

532
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,706
This isn't right.

533
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,767
CIPA can't cause this much degeneration.

534
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:52,506
A few nerve fibers we teased out
of the center have some insulation left.

535
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:55,150
But the insulation around
the bundles has been stripped bare.

536
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,270
Means the damage must
be coming from the outside in.

537
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:59,421
Which means it's
secondary demyelination.

538
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,233
Which means the source
is somewhere else.

539
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,031
Which tells us it's not a nerve disease,

540
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:05,732
it's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves.

541
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,690
Which means that we need to--

542
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,250
Where are you going?

543
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:12,757
Kid's mom is finally out of surgery.

544
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:15,579
I'll be right back.

545
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,161
- So what?
- Hannah should see her.

546
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:26,246
Yes, immediately after we're
done chatting about saving her life.

547
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,517
Most likely causes are metabolic.

548
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:32,362
They found brain swelling. They're
prepping her mother for another surgery.

549
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:35,756
Again, so what?
Get a nurse to take the kid.

550
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:39,449
There are more than 60 different
metabolic conditions that could account

551
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,526
for what she's got.
There's only three of you guys.

552
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,581
- She's scared.
- She should be.

553
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,944
- She'll die if we don't diagnose her.
- So diagnose her.

554
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,469
Mom.

555
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:20,194
How bad is it?

556
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:22,682
Are you OK?

557
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,132
I'm okay, Mom.

558
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:29,086
I'll get better. I always get better.

559
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,700
Are you checking yourself?
Your temperature?

560
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:36,498
Mom, could you just let it go?

561
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:39,712
You shouldn't be worrying.

562
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,179
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

563
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:47,189
- I should have seen that car coming.
- No.

564
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,567
I did this to myself. I screwed up.

565
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,309
You were right.

566
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:55,956
You were right and I was wrong.

567
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,156
No.

568
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:01,429
I... I shouldn't have
gone out on the ice.

569
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,247
I shouldn't have fallen down.

570
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:09,895
And I shouldn't have made you rush me
to an ER for the tenth time this year.

571
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:22,869
- Mom?
- You okay?

572
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:26,088
We gonna have to take
her back to surgery.

573
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,989
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

574
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,130
My hand's wet.

575
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,533
You're crying.

576
00:33:36,672 --> 00:33:37,647
I can't cry.

577
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,513
My head is killing me.

578
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,518
So what does the pain tell us?

579
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,127
No tingling,
no itching, so we can rule out--

580
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,992
It tells us nothing. It wasn't
physical pain, it was emotional.

581
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:01,943
Exactly.

582
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,619
What were they doing
when she got the headache?

583
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,056
- Saying good-bye.
- You said they were arguing.

584
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,238
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

585
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,989
- What were they arguing about?
- Whose fault it was.

586
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:18,061
Peripheral neuropathy,
fever, and intermittent paranoia.

587
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:22,763
Lots of metabolic conditions can explain
those things. But what if we add guilt?

588
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,291
Guilt as a symptom?

589
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:30,199
Alzheimer's can cause euphoria,
pain causes depression,

590
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:32,216
and B12 deficiency causes guilt.

591
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:34,624
Along with all that other stuff.

592
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,586
If she felt guilty, she wouldn't
be making her mother's life miserable.

593
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,726
She wouldn't be getting in fights,
getting arrested.

594
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,781
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

595
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:44,416
She's showing her mom she can
take stupid risks and still be safe.

596
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,717
- Means mom can let go.
- Which is rational.

597
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:50,186
If guilt is a symptom, it's caused by
the illness, not by a thought process.

598
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:51,398
And it would have to be new.

599
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,009
Two years ago,
she was a model student.

600
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,247
This is pointless.
If the headache was caused by guilt,

601
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,702
she has a B-12 deficiency.
If it's just because she was sad,

602
00:34:57,703 --> 00:35:00,037
it's meaningless.
How the hell do we test for that?

603
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,838
We don't. We give her a shot of B12.
When she gets better, I was right.

604
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:05,934
We already did.

605
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:08,698
ER gave her B12 when she was admitted.

606
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,906
Part of a multi-vitamin supplement.

607
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,597
Apparently, she's just sad.

608
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:21,093
Why are you still here?

609
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:25,262
Trying to get a couple patients into
a drug trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow.

610
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,213
Why are you here?

611
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:28,371
Still haven't figured out why...

612
00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:30,520
No, I meant here, in my office.

613
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:34,637
Just dumped a cool B12 theory.
Moved on to leukemia.

614
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,888
Very pedestrian.

615
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:39,535
I'm not happy.

616
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,138
Her white blood cell count was low.
But the one she's got...

617
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,647
A whole lot of eosinophils.

618
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:49,084
The immunoglobin E level's borderline.

619
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:51,913
If you wanna be 100% sure,
check the bone marrow.

620
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,760
Team's doing a biopsy right now.

621
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:57,935
So it turns out...

622
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,619
the weird lawyer knew
that she used to be a man.

623
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:03,377
And he's cool with that?

624
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,617
Turns out that his previous
girlfriend also used to be a man.

625
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:09,673
Yeah.

626
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,416
Is it possible for
you to just watch me eat?

627
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,654
Or do you get some
primeval thrill out of

628
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:24,685
beating the other hunters to the food?

629
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:34,822
See ya later.

630
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,041
You still haven't figured
out that I don't need sedation?

631
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,342
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

632
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:43,456
Is that nitrous?

633
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,300
You trying to kill her?

634
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:48,666
You gave her nitrous during the EEG.

635
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:50,833
That's what made this
thing rear its ugly head.

636
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,894
- What thing?
- B12 deficiency.

637
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,621
Are you having deja vu? We've had
this conversation. She was given B12.

638
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,472
- She didn't get better.
- Because someone else ate it.

639
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:01,174
- Get an abdominal MRI.
- What?

640
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:03,718
What are you doing?

641
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,260
Don't touch me!

642
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,095
See, there she goes.

643
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,145
Another paranoid delusion.

644
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:14,171
At the rate she's going downhill,
forget the MRI, we need an O.R.

645
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:15,572
Leave me alone!

646
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,970
- Occupied!
- Her hernia can wait.

647
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:21,311
Help! They're trying to kill me!

648
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:24,715
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are trying to kill her...

649
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:27,583
Or you can assume that she's
suffering from a medical condition.

650
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:30,140
Seeing as this is a hospital
and we're all dressed like doctors,

651
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,001
and there are easier
ways to kill somebody...

652
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:32,952
Bev, help them.

653
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,234
I'm gonna need iodine,
scalpels number 10 and 15, forceps,

654
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:37,849
and a largish salad bowl.

655
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:40,998
Okay, hold her down.

656
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:44,653
Come on, weenies, she's in a cast.

657
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,257
Swab.

658
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:52,257
15.

659
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,013
You're not gonna anesthetize her?

660
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,910
Relax, it's just a magic trick.

661
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:03,881
She's faking it.
We're not falling for it this time.

662
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:07,844
Okay, keep that retracted.

663
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:14,877
Forceps.

664
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,821
Lake fishing can be fun.

665
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,526
It can bring the generations together.

666
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,870
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

667
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:40,279
you'll be giving room
and board to this fella.

668
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,406
And by free board,
I mean all the B12 you can take in.

669
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:46,467
I could have a * in me?

670
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,183
Not likely. You'd be in a lot of pain.

671
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,097
- It's gotta be 25 feet long.
- Dammit.

672
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:01,318
World record's over 60.

673
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:13,458
Wake up.

674
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:15,143
Somebody here to see you.

675
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:19,476
She's got limited
motion on her left side.

676
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:23,077
You might have to take
care of her for a while.

677
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:30,318
You don't feel it, but you're
about to rip your stitches out.

678
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:33,642
Take care of yourself.
Then you can take care of her.

679
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:46,148
You haven't gone home.

680
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,417
Sorry I screwed up Valentine's Day.

681
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:50,241
I'm dating a doctor.

682
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:53,967
I'd be an idiot to expect anything else.

683
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:55,961
I did get you a gift.

684
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:58,725
MGH.

685
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,666
Best teaching hospital in Boston.

686
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:05,598
You wanna be a nurse practitioner,
that's as good as it gets.

687
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:08,392
I made a few calls.

688
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:10,428
You're in if you want it.

689
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,591
This is why you've been helping me
get my surgical hours for accreditation?

690
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:16,737
- I thought you wanted--
- Stupid.

691
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,403
You've got ten feet of
personal space around you.

692
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:26,087
I step forward, you step back.

693
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:28,089
I've shared a lot of things with you.

694
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,140
Which is why you're breaking up with me.

695
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,242
You can't stand to be close.

696
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:38,244
You think I'll stay with
you because you're angry with me?

697
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,195
I'm upset.

698
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:42,469
Because I care.

699
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,292
Only you'd expect an
argument to be rational.

700
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:50,856
You and that ass boss of yours.

701
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:17,482
You could ask her for the spinal nerve.

702
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,170
She's got no reason to give it.

703
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:22,267
She owes you.

704
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,200
The hospital will send her a bill.

705
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,930
I'm just saying.

706
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:31,228
If you wanna do it,
do it while her B12 is still low.

707
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:33,127
Guilt can be your friend.

708
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,001
Breakfast?

709
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,145
Happy Valentine's Day.

710
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,643
A holiday that only applies
to people who are already paired up.

711
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,394
For everyone else, it's Wednesday.

712
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:57,343
Thank you for that dash of cold water.

713
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,463
Don't get me wrong,
I still think true love's out there,

714
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:03,164
it's just very far away.
Possibly in another galaxy.

715
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,080
We may need to develop faster than
light travel before we can make contact.

716
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,284
So I'm thinking we should have sex.

717
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,833
That makes sense.

718
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:19,923
Despite the wisdom of pop songs, there's
no point in putting our lives on hold

719
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:21,044
'til love comes along.

720
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:25,269
We're both healthy and busy people.
We work together, so it's convenient.

721
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:27,711
Like microwave pizza?

722
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,280
And of all the people I work with,

723
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,816
you're the one I'm least
likely to fall in love with.

724
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,260
Like microwave pizza.

725
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:37,221
The point here is to make
things simpler, not more complicated.

726
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:40,639
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

727
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,085
Meanwhile, we already had sex
once and didn't get weird about it.

728
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
I get it. I get it.

729
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:49,609
So what if I'm offended
by your judgment?

730
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:53,354
Then you're not the man I'm looking for.

731
00:42:55,851 --> 00:43:00,867
