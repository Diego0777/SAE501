1
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:06,568
Mom!

2
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,544
- I'm thirsty.
- I just gave you water.

3
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:14,902
I want juice.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,149
It's bedtime.

5
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:18,926
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

6
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,599
Mom!

7
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,547
What do you want, Clance?

8
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,629
Hi, Dad.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,990
Go to bed.

10
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:51,165
- Can I turn the TV on?
- TV is only for the daytime.

11
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:53,775
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.

12
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:55,027
Go to bed.

13
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:56,797
Dad, what if...

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,890
What if they come to get me again?

15
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:05,264
Nobody is coming to get you. OK?

16
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:06,937
Go to bed. Now.

17
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,859
Come on, Clancy.

18
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:42,292
It's time to get up.

19
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,231
- I guess he's already up.
- That's a first.

20
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:56,080
I-I will,
uh, I'll see if he needs breakfast.

21
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:01,239
Hey, Clance, you hungry?

22
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:06,962
Hon, he's not down here.

23
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,395
You sure?

24
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:11,667
Clancy?

25
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:22,177
Clancy?

26
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:27,961
Where are you?

27
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,617
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?

28
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,231
Where is he?

29
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,109
You're gonna be in big
trouble when I find you.

30
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:46,837
Honey, come out right now,
wherever you are. This is not funny.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,500

32
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,567
Where's the sweat and the B.O.?

33
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,571
You've taken such pride
in bathing us all in your musk.

34
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:56,472
- Showered at home.
- And yet you're earlier than usual.

35
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,411
Is this an intervention?

36
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,441
It's a little late,
since I'm not using drugs anymore.

37
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,442
I am, however, still hooked on phonics.

38
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:06,934
If you did your morning run and showered
at home, you'd be later than usual.

39
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,435
Thought of you in the shower.

40
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:09,663
How's your leg?

41
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,785
You seem to be favoring your left side.

42
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,895
I was hanging down my
right pant leg yesterday.

43
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,957
- Makes all the difference in the world.
- You've taken the stairs every day.

44
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,058
- Did I need a restraining order?
- You slack on your rehab,

45
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,827
the muscle will weaken.
And your leg will hurt again.

46
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:28,173
Looks like the Ketamine
treatment might not stick.

47
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,696
Or maybe we've made him depressed
because we're lying to him.

48
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:35,659
- Telling him he got that case wrong.
- We didn't hurt him. The pain isn't...

49
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,475
He gets depressed, he stops exercising.

50
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:39,626
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

51
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,624
The muscle atrophies, the pain returns.

52
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,746
Maybe he stopped exercising because the
giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

53
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:47,574
The Ketamine could work perfectly

54
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,208
and he would still be back
on his cane popping Vicodin again.

55
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,202
You can't tell him.

56
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,854
He got lucky. There was no medical...

57
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,039
He was right.

58
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:00,358
We tell him he was right,
and we're feeding his addiction.

59
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,893
Without Vicodin,
he's only got one to focus on.

60
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:06,494
- Well, he's not gonna O.D. on puzzles.
- No, it's not gonna hurt him.

61
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:10,134
But he could just as easily
have killed that patient.

62
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:15,816
We have a tiny window of time here where
House may be healthy enough to change.

63
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,128
And based on that limp,

64
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,237
the window's closing fast.

65
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,812
Kid is a product of an
in vitro fertilization pregnancy.

66
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,548
Had all his vaccinations.

67
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,172
Fractured his right ulna at age three,
chicken pox at age five...

68
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,129
Did he ever get his feelings hurt?

69
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,364
I'll need to know that too.

70
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,274
You are 0 for 1 since you came back.
We just wanna make sure...

71
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,897
Rectal bleeding plus alien abduction
fantasies, most likely sexual abuse.

72
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,416
Penetration causes the bleed,
trauma causes the fantasy.

73
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:51,049
E. R. ran a rape kit, found no evidence
of tearing, semen, or pubic hairs.

74
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,800
I think we should talk to the kid.

75
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,305
Why?

76
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,265
In case he's telling the truth?

77
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,270
You're a believer, aren't you?

78
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,223
I'm just not arrogant enough to
think that of the 50 billion galaxies,

79
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:07,534
100 billion stars per galaxy and ten
million billion planets in the universe,

80
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:09,352
that we're the only ones with life.

81
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,324
No. But

82
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:13,469
I'm guessing we're the only ones who like
shoving things through our backdoors.

83
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,388
There is new research indicating
a link between neurological problems

84
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,039
- and bleeding disorders.
- Perfect.

85
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,440
Especially if there
were neurological problems.

86
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:24,204
What part of hallucinating
an alien abduction isn't neurological?

87
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,419
- It wasn't a hallucination.
- What?

88
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,603
- You think the kid...
- Is having nightmares.

89
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,914
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything
other than wanting to sleep with mommy.

90
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,504
Which just leaves us with one symptom,
the bloody tuchus.

91
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:39,792
Which can easily be explained by a G.
I. problem or a bleeding disorder.

92
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:42,720
Check his coags with a PT,
PTT, and bleeding time.

93
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,486
Prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

94
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,822
Gonna make a tiny nick
in your forearm, okay?

95
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,069
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you to stop bleeding.

96
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:03,643
This is gonna sting a little,
so you might want to look the other way.

97
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,503
Are those windows locked?

98
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:16,193
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.

99
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:17,961
Good. 'Cause they know I'm here.

100
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,297
Clancy...

101
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,760
don't bother the doctor with this stuff.

102
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,011
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

103
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,962
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

104
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:28,935
I can feel it back there.

105
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,895
Clancy, you know there
is nothing back there.

106
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:33,575
- There is.
- Let me see.

107
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,165
Lean forwards.

108
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,830
And they have this other thing.
And they put it...

109
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,317
in between these two ribs.
Always on this side.

110
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,232
And then they move it around my insides.

111
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,013
- It hurts.
- You know what, Clancy?

112
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,533
I think I might have
found the chip back there.

113
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,442
And I think I might
be able to get it out.

114
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:53,543
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,575
Okay, lean forwards.

116
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:03,478
Now hold very still, okay?

117
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,026
Got it.

118
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,335
I'm seven... not three.

119
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:13,448
All you did was pinch my neck.

120
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:18,605
Sorry.

121
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:22,616
His alien abduction story,
the level of detail is...

122
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,311
I don't know where he gets it from.

123
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,133
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi,
he doesn't read comic books.

124
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,533
Great. You do any of that
medical stuff we talked about?

125
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,492
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.

126
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,260
So, it's a simple bleeding disorder.

127
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:37,316
No. Blood tests were all normal.
And he clotted in six minutes.

128
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,706
So it's a simple bleeding
disorder and you screwed up the test.

129
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,611
I didn't screw up the test.

130
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:44,699
So it's a U.F.O.

131
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,539
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

132
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,390
Either you screwed up the test or
I screwed up my analysis of this case.

133
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,619
If you screwed up,
I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

134
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,500
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.

135
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,190
How could I screw up
a simple bleeding time test?

136
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,863
Maybe you were abducted and lost time.

137
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,084
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

138
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:15,953
You're sure?

139
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,554
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

140
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,209
So you're saying Chase did screw up.

141
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,905
Or Foreman screwed up.

142
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,110
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

143
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:31,684
Oh, snap.

144
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:35,510
Foreman's playin' the dozens. You're at
a huge cultural disadvantage here, Chase.

145
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,555
Take a couple minutes
to think of a witty retort.

146
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,514
So we have contradicting
bleeding time tests.

147
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,761
If we run labs to check his clotting fac-
tors, we can confirm which one's right.

148
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,097
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

149
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:47,001
Way better than trying to
guess which doctor's incompetent.

150
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,752
Looks better in the paperwork too.

151
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,759
Hey, Foreman,

152
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:54,354
your mama's so fat, when her beeper
goes off, people think she's backing up.

153
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:07,753
Where's Clancy?

154
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:09,355
He's asleep. He's...

155
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,376
House!

156
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:17,502
Clancy's gone missing.

157
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,430
Oh, no!

158
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:23,433
You take Alpha Centauri,
Foreman can look on Tatooine,

159
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,266
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

160
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:31,018
Let's pray he hasn't gone into
hyperdrive. We'll never catch him.

161
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,116
Clancy?

162
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:43,805
I had to go where there are no windows so
I could get the chip out like you said.

163
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:44,756
God.

164
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,771
- I can feel it, I just can't grab it.
- Clancy, stop! There is no chip.

165
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,047
We're gonna clean you up and
we're gonna go back to your room.

166
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,632
You can't do things like this.

167
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,289
Your parents--

168
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,445
Said it might not even be terrestrial.

169
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,204
- Really?
- No, you idiot, it's titanium.

170
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,545
Like from a surgical pin.

171
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,450
Like the kind the kid had inserted
into his broken arm four years ago.

172
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,491
- Nice medical history.
- That pin was removed six months after.

173
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,692
So a little piece
broke off during removal.

174
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,470
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

175
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,265
Tell that to guys on the Kursk.

176
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,812
And how exactly did it get
from his arm to the back of his neck?

177
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,546
Body attacks any foreign object.

178
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:39,538
Inflammatory reaction could erode it
into a vein, fragment gets a free ride.

179
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,967
To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.

180
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,839
Yeah, an alien chip makes more sense.

181
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,619
The real mystery is that
you didn't actually screw up.

182
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,821
You okay?

183
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,285
Fine. Tripped.

184
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,278
Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck
and apparently didn't bleed to death.

185
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,069
- Now, that's weird.
- He clotted on his own?

186
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,282
Sure did.

187
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:06,691
So first there was no bleeding disorder,
then there was, now there is not again.

188
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,812
- Which is impossible.
- Or Foreman screwed up.

189
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,634
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

190
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,385
Well, lucky for us,
the fourth test will be the charm.

191
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,890
So you're just gonna keep cutting him?
Until what?

192
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,281
This test is different.

193
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:28,662
We draw some blood and see if
any clotting factors are low or missing.

194
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,529
But why haven't the other tests--

195
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:33,949
We've got three results that haven't been
consistent. One of them must be wrong.

196
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,900
Or two of them.

197
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:40,718
Is it possible the problem isn't
his blood? It's just psychological.

198
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:45,884
- I mean, he almost killed himself.
- He wasn't trying to hurt himself.

199
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:50,092
No... he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

200
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:54,889
I have time for one more.

201
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:58,017
Don't blame you for spending
extra time down here.

202
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:01,272
Heard the artist formerly
known as gimp is back upstairs.

203
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,255
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

204
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:04,901
She's busy. I'll take it.

205
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:10,544
Oh, my God. You're...

206
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,392
How...

207
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:13,854
You're okay.

208
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,070
Have we met?

209
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,830
I was one of your doctors.

210
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,784
You were in a vegetative
state when you left here last week.

211
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,070
Addison's disease.

212
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:27,759
All I needed was cortisol
and my brain turned on like a switch.

213
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:29,908
- This is amazing.
- Surprised

214
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:32,836
- you didn't know.
- How would I know?

215
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,652
Not quite my old self yet.

216
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:39,084
- Baby steps, the doctors tell me.
- With rehab, you'll do great.

217
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,084
What hospital did you go to?

218
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,988
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife.

219
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,521
And I was hoping that maybe...

220
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,553
- You could...
- Viagra?

221
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,739
- You're here for Viagra?
- A bucketful would be nice.

222
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:57,232
Dr. Cuddy.

223
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:08,934
- It's completely unethical.
- He was reckless with a patient.

224
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,948
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.

225
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,149
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

226
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,902
Why does he need that?
Because other people have that?

227
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,331
Why does he need
to be like other people?

228
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,982
- He needs to be less reckless.
- Well, you did it.

229
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,949
He's dismissing symptoms, looking
for easy solutions. He's in pain.

230
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,349
- How much pain?
- Why?

231
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,432
You know this is affecting him,
don't you?

232
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:37,929
Telling him that he got his last case
right won't do anything to help him.

233
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,527
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.

234
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:41,803
But you don't know.

235
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,759
Just let me run a PET scan

236
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:47,856
on his parietal thalamic
area to see if it's sensing pain.

237
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:52,127
If it is, the Ketamine isn't working any-
more and he's headed for a huge crash.

238
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,840
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault

239
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,158
and I will tell him the truth.

240
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,749
Too tight?

241
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,711
- My parents think I'm crazy.
- No, they don't.

242
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,901
They're just worried about you,
that's all.

243
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:11,919
I'm not weird.

244
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,355
It's just that weird
things keep happening to me.

245
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,675
Slight pinch.

246
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,098
If you make me better,

247
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,748
do you think the aliens
will leave me alone?

248
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,665
I don't think they're gonna
be bothering you for much longer.

249
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,160
- You lying again?
- No.

250
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,953
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

251
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,278
You still with us?

252
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,755
Pulmonary edema,
stage two hypertensive crisis.

253
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,590
- What is happening?
- Wait outside.

254
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,636
Get him oxygen. Start him on
an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.

255
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:01,587
Get them outside!

256
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,475
He's in ICU.
Systolic is hovering around 170.

257
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:09,576
I left instructions to lower it slowly so
we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.

258
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:12,769
The trade-off being that leaving his
blood pressure that high risks stroke,

259
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,370
- M. I., and blindness.
- I'm open to suggestions.

260
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:16,913
Solve the case.

261
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,396
- Kidneys could explain...
- Kidneys are clean.

262
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,513
Tell me he's a mutant/human hybrid.

263
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:27,121
It is a bleeding disorder. Clancy
tested positive for Von Willebrand's.

264
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:29,773
I didn't screw up.

265
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,921
How could he clot on his
own two out of three times?

266
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,150
- Maybe he cheated.
- Right.

267
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:40,862
Kids always cheat on
their bleeding time tests.

268
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,819
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

269
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:47,852
I have no idea what you meant, but
I could smell what the Rock was cooking.

270
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:51,116
I meant he's clotting right
now and he's in hypertensive crisis.

271
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,848
Maybe the two are related.

272
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,625
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times that he clotted?

273
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:58,290
Hypertensive crisis can
activate clotting factors.

274
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,762
Someone low on Von Willebrands
could theoretically clot.

275
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,936
And the first time Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up recounting

276
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,600
his alien abduction.
He could have easily been hypertensive.

277
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:10,983
I know I get worked up when I cut micro-
chip tracking implants out of my neck.

278
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,544
- Sounds like a cheat to me.
- Yeah, we get it.

279
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,976
Okay, what's the differential
for seven-year-old boys

280
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,977
suffering multiple hypertensive crises?

281
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,658
We think the problem
is in your son's heart.

282
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,252
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophegeal echo.

283
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:31,405
Okay, and that will fix his heart?

284
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:34,018
That will tell us where the problem is.
Hopefully.

285
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:35,776
Then we can fix him.

286
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,030
Listen...

287
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,945
this isn't really part of my job, but...

288
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,208
he's worried that you think he's crazy.

289
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,128
Well, isn't he?

290
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:58,731
There are still plenty of other
explanations for what's going on.

291
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,678
It's important he
knows you believe in him.

292
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,260
Even if you don't.

293
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,759
It's clean. His heart isn't the problem.

294
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,253
Why don't I have a hi-def in my office?

295
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:16,674
I'm a department head.

296
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,953
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.

297
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:23,804
Tissue characterization is impossible
when the pixels are the size of Legos.

298
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,363
See, this is what I'm talking about.

299
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,095
Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

300
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,796
Let me ring up one of the homies.

301
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,599
The clearer the image, the
clearer it is that there are no masses,

302
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
no clots, no tears.
The problem's got to be somewhere else.

303
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:42,176
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

304
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:50,952
You're wrong, House.

305
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,729
Think he'll make us break
into the IMAX before he admits it?

306
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:56,206
- There.
- Where?

307
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,838
Right there. Left side. No movement.

308
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:02,298
Well, don't freeze it.

309
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:06,986
Something's not moving. How do you see
something not move if nothing's moving?

310
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:08,188
I need a laser pointer.

311
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:11,177
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?

312
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,410
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have a laser pointer?

313
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:15,788
Right...

314
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,596
here.

315
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,655
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

316
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,251
So you found an arrhythmia.

317
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,483
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.

318
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:28,863
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

319
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:32,464
Go get me those myocytes.
I want to talk to them in my office.

320
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,104
How's the kid doing?

321
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:40,799
Heart nearly exploded.

322
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,023
Still beating, though.

323
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:44,854
Most of it anyway.

324
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:49,462
Why do they bother putting
age restrictions on these things

325
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,913
when all you have to
do is click "Yes, I am 18"?

326
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:54,335
Even a 17-year-old can figure that out.

327
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,882
What's going on with the leg?

328
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:00,372
First tell me what's
going on with the boobs.

329
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,723
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.

330
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,514
It's called an underwire.

331
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:08,657
- I wanna get a PET scan of your brain.
- I think it's hormones.

332
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:11,146
As long as there's no increased
activity in the thalamus--

333
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:14,122
Looks to me like those puppies
are going into the dairy business.

334
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:18,082
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.

335
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:22,064
After you work out, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the Ketamine failed.

336
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:23,865
Guess I should be saying mazel tov.

337
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:26,863
- Who gets to pass out the cigars?
- I'm not pregnant.

338
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,577
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.

339
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:30,142
Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?

340
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,861
- I'm not pregnant.
- My leg doesn't hurt.

341
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,635
- You're in denial.
- No, I'm not!

342
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:35,703
Oh, you got me.

343
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,393
If I thought that
my leg was deteriorating,

344
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,928
Don't you think I'd want
to take steps to prevent that?

345
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,421
Okay.

346
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:56,852
Gotta go.

347
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,269
Here's Clancy's DNA.

348
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:15,584
And here's the DNA from that
piece of his heart we just biopsied.

349
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,347
That is impossible.

350
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,178
- Run it again.
- We already did.

351
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,428
And once more after that.

352
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:34,835
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't
match the genes from the rest of his body.

353
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,294
Alien DNA.

354
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,668
Anybody watch any X-Files
that inspired an explanation?

355
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,102
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.

356
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,757
That much sun, he'd be
dying with a healthy bronze glow.

357
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,155
Nitrous acid or ethidium
bromide exposure.

358
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,482
First daddy was a rapist,
now he's a chemist.

359
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,115
Various species of fungus
have been proven mutagenic.

360
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:03,266
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels
of celery or living in Indonesia or both.

361
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,402
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?

362
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,824
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.

363
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,603
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.

364
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,130
Please, someone give me a plausible,

365
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:15,368
terrestrial explanation
for this kid's alien DNA.

366
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:18,753
We could search his home for toxins,
fungals, and radiation.

367
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,293
Who cares what caused it?

368
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:21,919
A kid comes in with a strep,

369
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,390
we don't conduct a search to see which
classmate he got it from, we cure it.

370
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:28,155
We know he's got this inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.

371
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:30,414
Where do we cut?
Chances are it's not just in his heart.

372
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,765
We got lucky with the heart.

373
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:34,766
Myocytes contract,
we could see that these weren't working.

374
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,208
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it anywhere else.

375
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,730
What if we take the heart cells
with the bad DNA and we tag them?

376
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:48,171
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

377
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,172
It's the same way we search for cancer.

378
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:53,458
The bad DNA creates a unique protein
on the surface of the affected cells.

379
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,162
We create an antibody that
recognizes only that protein.

380
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,813
We flush it throughout his system
and the similar cells light up like...

381
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:01,584
lightbulbs.

382
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:05,264
Okay. Let's do that.

383
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,429
- You have to tell him.
- He said he wasn't in any pain.

384
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,380
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.

385
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,421
- We need another plan.
- Don't talk about it that way.

386
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,372
What way?

387
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,019
Plan.

388
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:29,054
Sounds like we're
conspiring against him.

389
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:30,835
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.

390
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:32,995
Then come up with
a cunning plan and fast.

391
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:40,932
She's not nearly as delightful
as she thinks she is.

392
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,025
What's this machine do?

393
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:46,847
It makes a lot of noise.

394
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:50,563
And it's gonna help us
figure out what's wrong with you.

395
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:52,214
You think House has lost a step?

396
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:53,739
He's fine.

397
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:57,192
There,

398
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:00,058
a clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow of the femur.

399
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,802
Explains the intermittent
bleeding disorder.

400
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:05,424
'Cause I don't need to subject myself
to House's torture if there's no upside.

401
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:07,041
I'm telling you, he's fine.

402
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:12,480
We missed some affected
cells in his heart.

403
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,731
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

404
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:17,752
You said the last case really threw him.
And now suddenly...

405
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:18,703
I was wrong.

406
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,551
So you changed your mind.

407
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,381
Why?

408
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:26,367
His brilliant ideas on
this case have all been yours.

409
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:29,558
There's the reason
for him needing glasses.

410
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,770
Apparently it's a symptom.
Means the condition predates--

411
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,208
You don't change your
mind without a reason.

412
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,587
What do you know?

413
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:40,323
House...

414
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,357
didn't blow the last case.

415
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,147
Cuddy cured the guy using House's idea.

416
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,058
Cuddy and Wilson are trying
to teach him some humility.

417
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:57,588
Scan is complete. Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

418
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,936
House's original theory was right.

419
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,969
It is not neurological.

420
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,330
Is he gonna be able to walk?

421
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,911
His leg should be
functional after some rehab.

422
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,983
Functional? What does that mean?
He's be able to walk but not run?

423
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:14,395
He'll have a limp?

424
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:17,157
If everything goes well,
he'll walk, he'll run.

425
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:19,663
He'll probably be even
stronger than he is now.

426
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:24,373
When we close him up,
we'll move over to his other leg.

427
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:27,724
Snake a catheter up through
the femoral artery and into his heart.

428
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:32,971
Once the affected areas are removed,
his normal tissue will set back in

429
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:36,457
and do its job. He should have no
more problems with his blood pressure.

430
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:40,108
After confirming those areas are clear,
we'll start the final procedure.

431
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,879
I'm gonna insert a
needle through the pupil

432
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,330
and get rid of the abnormal
cells in the retina.

433
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,029
Close your right eye.

434
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,081
Can you see my face?

435
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,063
Yeah. It's clear.

436
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,719
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.

437
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,436
Get some sleep.

438
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:06,602
You're going home tomorrow.

439
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:08,649
Thank you.

440
00:28:21,928 --> 00:28:23,128
You wanna go for a run?

441
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:25,406
What do you want?

442
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,910
I want you to run.

443
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,590
When did you become an enabler?

444
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:36,968
I'm enabling you to exercise.

445
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:40,027
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab.

446
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:42,339
Muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

447
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,790
I'd rather not become dependent
on pain pills to get through my day.

448
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,500
You're just like any other patient.

449
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:53,842
Running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

450
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:55,833
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

451
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:58,827
You're scared the Ketamine
treatment's wearing off.

452
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,024
That it was just a....

453
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,072
torturous window to the good life.

454
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,403
What part of poop didn't you understand?

455
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,346
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

456
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:08,718
It's my leg.

457
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,361
We've known each other a long time.

458
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:16,903
You're not always right, House.

459
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,077
You've proven that lately.

460
00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:00,403
- What's happening to him?
- He's seizing. I need clonazepam.

461
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,380
I thought you got it all!

462
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:03,331
Yeah, yell at me. That'll fix the kid.

463
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:07,331
Obviously we missed some foreign tissue.
There's something still in him.

464
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,932
The hallucinations and seizures
indicate problems in the temporal lobe.

465
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,276
Sorry, House, it is neurological.

466
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,519
Looks like you were wrong, again.

467
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:16,835
We didn't miss anything.

468
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:19,147
The brain scan was completely clean.

469
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,081
Our tag must not have penetrated
the blood brain barrier.

470
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:30,968
Don't use an IV this time,
get it right into the brain.

471
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,248
No cells are lighting up.

472
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,830
His brain is clean.

473
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,003
It is not neurological.

474
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:51,716
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.

475
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:53,227
His scan was clean twice.

476
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,203
It's not there.

477
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,192
What if it is there,
but didn't show up on the scan?

478
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:03,593
What if the tag just
doesn't work in his brain?

479
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:07,224
Brain cells are structurally different.
They express a different protein.

480
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,137
So how do we find it?

481
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:14,904
Where are we going?

482
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:16,984
I am going to think.

483
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:55,128
Send the kid home.

484
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,223
What do you mean?

485
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,180
Make sure his blood pressure
is stabilized and send him home.

486
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,472
- Like nothing ever happened?
- We cured his bleeding disorder

487
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,062
and removed all the
damaged cells we could find.

488
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:11,693
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

489
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:14,389
Maybe these symptoms come
and go like the blood disorder.

490
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,940
It's more probable that
his remaining symptoms are

491
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,220
just a nightmare.

492
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,085
He had a convulsion.

493
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,158
Maybe epilepsy, maybe psychological.

494
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:24,569
Maybe nothing.

495
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:26,763
If the kid gets sick again,

496
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:30,741
that'll give us another clue and we'll
start searching again. If he doesn't,

497
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,120
it doesn't matter.

498
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:34,281
Send him home.

499
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:43,238
House!

500
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,631
You're just giving up on this kid?

501
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,114
You gotta know when to stop.

502
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:53,768
You don't stop.

503
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,798
You never stop, you just keep on going
until you come up with something so

504
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:00,031
insane that it's usually right.

505
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:02,077
Except on my last case.

506
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:04,637
Don't be pathetic.

507
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:06,813
Just forget the last case.

508
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:10,591
This kid obviously has
something wrong with him.

509
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:15,493
When did you develop such
strong opinions about my patients?

510
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:18,353
Last week you were convinced
that my patient wasn't sick.

511
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:21,554
- Now you're convinced this one is.
- This one is a young boy.

512
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:23,200
His parents are desperate.

513
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,625
Just get together with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

514
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:31,425
Well, I guess we could amputate his left
leg. It's where we found most of it.

515
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:33,798
Maybe we should just remove
his affected eye completely.

516
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:36,499
If you have reason to
believe that that might help...

517
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:38,990
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts.

518
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,036
But it's interesting that
you give me the green light.

519
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:44,687
I just want you to do something.

520
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:48,173
You've been overly
supportive this entire week.

521
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:51,919
Well, either you're hormonal
or you're guilt-ridden.

522
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:55,355
And it's too early in the
pregnancy for this to be hormonal.

523
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:57,906
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?

524
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,620
He had Addison's.

525
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,585
Your last patient. You were right.

526
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:16,801
I gave him one shot of cortisol
and he woke up like Rip Van Winkle.

527
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,849
Oh, your mommy's in such trouble.

528
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:25,526
She's such a liar.

529
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:29,526
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...

530
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,203
How does one person...

531
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,285
end up with two different sets of DNA?

532
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:46,232
- We've been through this.
- Our assumptions are faulty.

533
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,508
We've confirmed two different
sets of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.

534
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:53,209
I didn't say the lab work was faulty,
I said our assumptions were faulty.

535
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:54,513
We assumed he's a person.

536
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,184
Of course.

537
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,892
The aliens didn't just visit him,
they replaced him.

538
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:00,522
You're being silly.

539
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,998
What if he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?

540
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,272
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.

541
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:09,448
Chase said the mom used
in vitro fertilization, right?

542
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:12,790
- Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.
- Kid was right all along.

543
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,441
He was implanted with something.

544
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:18,333
Back when he was young. I mean,
really young. Like 12 cells young.

545
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:21,091
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

546
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:22,645
But he doesn't have a twin.

547
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:23,746
Not walking around...

548
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,350
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop.

549
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,012
So doctors implant two to six embryos
to make sure you get your money's worth.

550
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:34,613
The problem is, there's not always
enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

551
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:37,138
Two brothers get stuck sharing,
but there's no bunk beds.

552
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,939
So they cuddle up to keep
warm and they never untangle.

553
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,571
He's two people in one.

554
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:46,015
It's called chimerism.

555
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,136
Unfortunately, his brother's...

556
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,760
like a bad doubles partner.

557
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:55,994
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

558
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,396
Clancy's body thinks he's gonna put
away the easy winners, his brother just

559
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:02,442
keeps swatting the balls into the net.

560
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:04,882
We gotta get him off the court.

561
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:10,090
So does that mean that you can
find the bad cells in his brain or not?

562
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:13,873
Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine.

563
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:19,085
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother because he thinks.

564
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:21,846
If we induce an alien abduction...

565
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,724
Wait, what the hell
are you talking about?

566
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,762
The foreign DNA has got to
be in the portion of your son's brain

567
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,914
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

568
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,595
If we stimulate those
neurons with an electric probe,

569
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:34,096
we can trick your son's
brain into hallucinating.

570
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:35,893
Your son's neurons will light up,

571
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,210
and his brother's
cells will remain dark.

572
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:40,824
Those are the ones we cut out.

573
00:37:41,145 --> 00:37:42,945
You're talking about brain surgery.

574
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,831
I'm talking about really
cool brain surgery.

575
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:47,998
One of your sons will die.

576
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:50,848
But the taller one won't
be so annoying anymore.

577
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:55,223
- So I have a twin?
- Not really.

578
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:56,863
What's on the card?

579
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,227
Light bulb.

580
00:37:58,422 --> 00:37:59,472
Start us out at ten.

581
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,878
I'm not doing that.

582
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,757
It was all me, kid. Sorry.

583
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:10,393
You're in motor function.

584
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,259
Try two centimeters back.

585
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:15,378
- He lives inside me.
- Sort of.

586
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:20,195
That tickles. Stop tickling my feet.

587
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:22,576
You're in sensory. Getting closer.

588
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,708
- What do you see on this one?
- Moon and stars.

589
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:28,982
So...

590
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,713
I am kind of weird?

591
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:32,971
We're all kind of weird.

592
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,180
No!

593
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:40,942
- Clancy?
- We got something.

594
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,593
- What do you see?
- The light.

595
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:43,924
Here they come.

596
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,388
I think.

597
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,982
Brain waves indicate mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.

598
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:50,933
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.

599
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,972
Hallucination isn't strong enough.

600
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:53,923
Turn up the juice.

601
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:59,386
His blood pressure's already
at 160 over 110. Any higher and...

602
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,874
Riding the short bus
is better than not breathing.

603
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:02,825
Take us to 100.

604
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,359
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of distinction.

605
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Crank it up higher.

606
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:14,835
You've already exceeded
the pre-set maximum.

607
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:16,438
Next step's brain damage.

608
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:26,261
They're gonna get you.

609
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:28,354
They're coming through the walls.

610
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,329
They're gonna take you, torture you.

611
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:32,952
You'll never see your parents again.

612
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,399
Clancy,

613
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,482
can you hear me?

614
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,054
Clancy?

615
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,703
You got them.

616
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,196
We got 'em all.

617
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,512
Close him up.

618
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,402
Everything's gonna be normal again.

619
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:34,293
You believe what Cuddy tried to pull?

620
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:36,950
What now?

621
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:38,670
She lied to me.

622
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:42,649
She cured my patient with my diagnosis,
then she lied to me about it.

623
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,610
- That doesn't sound like her.
- You're right.

624
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:49,037
Does sound like you, though.

625
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,490
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?

626
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:59,176
Nothing that your body language
isn't telling me right now.

627
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,416
So what was the plan?

628
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:06,550
I'd feel so humbled

629
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:08,974
by missing a case that I'd

630
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:13,333
re-evaluate my entire life, question
the nature of truth and goodness,

631
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,769
- and become Cameron?
- Something like that.

632
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:19,158
More that if we told you the truth,

633
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:23,437
that you'd solved a case based
on absolutely no medical proof,

634
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:25,735
you'd think you were God.

635
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:30,633
And I was worried your wings would melt.

636
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:35,593
God doesn't limp.

637
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
