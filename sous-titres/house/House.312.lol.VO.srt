1
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,413
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:06,364
You got any cases?

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:07,998
Three.

4
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,881
I got a teenage,
african-american lung transplant--

5
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,806
Next few days you'll be
doing nothing but clinic work.

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,941
- I just said--
- You were lying!

7
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:17,363
Then why'd you ask?

8
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:19,371
Because if you told the truth,

9
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,705
I was only gonna give
you one day of clinic duty.

10
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:22,656
That's dishonest.

11
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,993
- I refuse to participate in this
- You'll do it.

12
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,844
You owe me. I kept you out of jail.
I can put you back.

13
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:34,285
Perjurer.

14
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,309
Felon.

15
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,785
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

16
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,062
I told the nurse I have a runny nose,

17
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,739
but I don't.

18
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:45,935
I-I think I have,

19
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:47,868
syphilis or gonorrhea.

20
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,214
I think I have an STD.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,023
I think I have a--

22
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,804
Who is here for a runny nose?

23
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,081
It's a cold!

24
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,277
It'll get better. Go home.

25
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,433
Those of you who have stayed
obviously do not have colds.

26
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,489
You will be assigned
a doctor who is not me,

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,582
'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches.

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,037
You're doing this.

29
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:40,387
Call security.

30
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,878
Should I get a sedative?

31
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:47,104
No, I'm good. Thanks.

32
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,812
Help. My head hurts!

33
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,947
- Need a team here!
- I have the sedative.

34
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:12,654
- A little late.
- Just in time.

35
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,620
- What did you give him?
- Paralytic.

36
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:17,136
- Why would you do that
- Somebody had to stop the screaming.

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,098
- Then he's still in pain.
- Yeah, but quietly.

38
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,599
The paralytic stopped his breathing.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,100
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever.

40
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:33,397
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates or

41
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,935
I can figure out if
this guy's delirium, pain,

42
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,734
and insanely high heart
rate are life-threatening or

43
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:40,624
just a personality quirk.

44
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:45,684
I think the latter choice
is better for all three of us.

45
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:51,494

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,847
He's sedated.

47
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,828
It took 5ccs of haloperidol to get
him down after the paralytic wore off.

48
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:27,563
So, the pain in his right ear,
psychotic behavior, and dizziness. Go!

49
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,074
Nurses said he was holding his head.

50
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,268
How do you know it
was specifically his ear?

51
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,531
Because he was dizzy. It means
the problem was affecting his inner ear.

52
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,141
Nurses said he was running in circles.
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

53
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:40,623
He wasn't running in circles.
He was running in oblongs.

54
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,624
Looked like a 3-year-old kid drew them.

55
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,447
Acoustic neuroma that
started to hemorrhage.

56
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,126
Explains the pain, vertigo, everything.

57
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,559
Get an MRI.

58
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,189
What else?

59
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:56,054
- If it explains everything--
- Might not explain everything.

60
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:59,905
Well, what if he was psychotic first,
then self-mutilated, damaged the ear.

61
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,569
Excellent.
We need a complete psychiatric workup.

62
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:04,478
Your turn.

63
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,289
Uh, I was gonna say what Foreman--

64
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,313
Well, say something else.

65
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:13,234
He came to the clinic.

66
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:15,363
Good.

67
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,699
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,563
especially given the rapid heart rate.

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,201
Lingering ear infection.
Pressure builds up in his inner ear,

70
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:25,035
bursts through the mastoid
bone while he's waiting in the clinic.

71
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,714
Yes. Get a head CT, draw blood cultures,

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,400
run a chem panel,
and get a complete blood count.

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,962
Oh, while you're at it,

74
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:34,963
pour some alcohol into his
ear and take out the cockroach.

75
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,202
He has a cockroach in his ear?

76
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:41,285
He was scratching that ear right
before the event, so I took a peek.

77
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,279
My guess is, it started biting.

78
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,339
Nothing else wrong with him?

79
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,157
Well, isn't that enough?

80
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,122
It's pretty gross.

81
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,058
So, why are we doing the tests?

82
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,433
Well, it's either that or
I have to keep doing clinic duty.

83
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,422
Do the tests,
or just stay out of Cuddy's sight.

84
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:57,773
I don't really care which.

85
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:11,986
Why are you here?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,450
Because it's not a hospital.

87
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,335
It's a jogging park.

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,720
You're not jogging. You can't jog.

89
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,107
I'm watching jogging.

90
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,156
I sit,

91
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:25,467
and I watch,

92
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,577
and I imagine.

93
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,751
So what do you watch for?

94
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:39,475
That guy's running in shorts.

95
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,207
He's not running. He's trolling.

96
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:45,897
You're good at this.

97
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,691
How long are you going to stay here?

98
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:55,213
The beauty of this place is
it's the last place Cuddy will look.

99
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:03,948
How can I help you?

100
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,607
The doctors gave me this.

101
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,130
- What doctors?
- At the other hospital.

102
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:13,018
Last month.

103
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,761
Do you know what this says?

104
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:22,833
Yes.

105
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:27,176
The patient has a 6-centimeter
mass in the right lung,

106
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,822
cancerous, inoperable.

107
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,013
Do you understand what this means?

108
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,942
Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?

109
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,474
It's cold outside.

110
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:52,607
What are you doing here?
I thought House had a case.

111
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,406
He doesn't.

112
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,170
You ordered a CT on a
patient with a bug in his ear.

113
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,980
- How'd you know I was here?
- Ran into Cameron in the clinic.

114
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:09,077
"Ran into"?

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,690
You ordered pointless tests just to--

116
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,615
It wouldn't have been pointless
if you had "run into" Cameron.

117
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:17,273
She got punished.
She's stuck with another dying patient.

118
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:19,362
- Is that vicodin?
- Breath mint.

119
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,461
- Thought you were gonna kiss me.
- What happened to rehab?

120
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,412
I got out.

121
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,858
- It was a scam?
- Enough foreplay.

122
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,002
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

123
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:32,373
You are going back to the clinic.
Or jail.

124
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,675
You perjured yourself to keep me
out of jail. How are you gonna

125
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,610
I only did that because
I thought you were getting clean.

126
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,513
So it's do clinic duty or go to jail?

127
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:43,560
Yes.

128
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:46,297
And then it'll be,
"finish your paper work or go to jail,

129
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,899
"help with fund raising or go to jail,

130
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,534
"do your job or go to jail."

131
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,209
I think I'd rather go to jail.

132
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,558
You owe me.

133
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,538
- Be-yootiful.
- Thank you.

134
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:10,532
It's dry.

135
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,102
Who cares? It's beautiful.

136
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:16,207
If my lawn were half
as well maintained as that,

137
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,608
pigeons wouldn't have
the nerve to poop on it.

138
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:20,763
Good grooming is important.

139
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:22,739
Was that a shot?

140
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,352
People do judge you on your appearance.

141
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,845
When you entered I noted
your shirt hadn't been pressed,

142
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,690
you hadn't shaved in quite some time.

143
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:33,836
I extrapolated you were a person
for whom detail was not a major concern.

144
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,481
I was worried you might apply
that same standard in your work.

145
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,306
Do you use toenail clippers up there?

146
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,280
They're longer, so they allow
me to better reach the upper hairs.

147
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:44,273
I'm wearing a rumpled shirt
and forgot to brush my hair this week.

148
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,274
You've got athlete's foot in your nose.

149
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:50,877
I'm ready to be judged.

150
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,536
Okay.

151
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:58,768
$50 to any patient who is
willing to leave here right now.

152
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,980
- You can't--
- My money.

153
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,087
I don't care. People do not--

154
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:09,164
If they'll leave for 50 bucks,
they're not all that sick.

155
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:13,118
Or they're poor and desperate,
which is why this place is here.

156
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:16,271
If they're that poor,
then they'd rather have 50 bucks.

157
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,372
Can I have the money?

158
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:19,574
Look, it's monogrammed.

159
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,077
He doesn't need money,
ergo he's not sick.

160
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,028
And the blood?

161
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:24,574
Could be anybody's.

162
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,515
The monogram's definitely his.

163
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,969
We need to talk.

164
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,111
It doesn't matter what you say,
do, or threaten,

165
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,454
I will find a way out.

166
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,417
How can we make this
more interesting for you?

167
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:42,327
How can we make the sky green?
How can we make the tall short?

168
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,728
You cannot make the
uninteresting interesting.

169
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,270
I'll pay you $10 for every
patient you diagnose without touching.

170
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:53,125
You pay me $10 for every
one you have to touch.

171
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,671
You're making this into a game for me.

172
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,939
From which I can only conclude
this isn't a game for you.

173
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,890
No.

174
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:02,544
Why?

175
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:05,795
You think if I deal with enough
people I'll find some humanity?

176
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,591
Yes.

177
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,023
Why do I ha-- to do thi-- mysel--?

178
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:14,852
I got a bum leg.

179
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,320
Say, "ahh.""

180
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:20,512
It feels rough.

181
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:25,186
Yes, it's a rash.
I'm gonna need more than "rough."

182
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,701
It-- it's just rough. Can't you feel it?

183
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,231
I could, but then what
satisfaction would you get?

184
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,175
Got it.

185
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,655
Start counting.

186
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,007
How many?

187
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,220
26.

188
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:46,859
Twenty--

189
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,500
Okay.

190
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:52,077
Either you suck at math or
you're gonna die in two seconds.

191
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,227
You suck at math.

192
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,869
Diagnosis.

193
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,945
Prescription.

194
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:02,769
You owe me 30.

195
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,521
I owe you ten.

196
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,265
Test results are back
for your STD patients.

197
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:27,359
And I'm not paying you for them.
You already touched them.

198
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,064
How old are you?

199
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,206
30.

200
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,525
And you've never seen an after
school special, Dawson's Creek?

201
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:40,827
How do you get to 30
and not know about condoms?

202
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,822
Oh, god, I-I have an STD.

203
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,837
No, but you will.

204
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:49,125
Every patient who comes in here
for an STD test has one thing in common:

205
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:50,952
They had SWS.

206
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,555
Sex While Stupid.

207
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:54,647
How old are you?

208
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,036
60.

209
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,128
You're lying. But that's not the point.

210
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:03,151
You've never seen Dawson's Creek?

211
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
And you've never seen
an after school special?

212
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:10,251
How do you live to your
age and not know about condoms?

213
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,598
I have an STD?

214
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,467
You're actually the first one today.

215
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:16,472
Lucky day.

216
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:18,784
Well, not for you. But,

217
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
you oughta feel good for everyone else.

218
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,784
It's chlamydia.

219
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,516
As bad news goes, it's about the best.

220
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:33,661
Oh, settle down.

221
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:35,273
It's treatable.

222
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,082
It's actually curable.

223
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:44,192
All you gotta do is take these pills--

224
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,143
Don't touch me!

225
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:52,594
Oh, god.

226
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:01,969
I need someone to cover a patient.

227
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,349
- House, you committed to--
- She was raped.

228
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,923
You think I'm the right doctor for her?

229
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:17,605
We've assigned another
doctor to your care.

230
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,731
I didn't mean to upset Dr. House.

231
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:22,334
He knows that.
That's not why we're doing this.

232
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,285
I'd like to keep being treated by him.

233
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,261
- Why?
- Just do.

234
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,721
Trust me, it's better if you deal with
somebody who specializes in--

235
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:30,672
I'm fine.

236
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,351
You told Dr.
House it's been less than a week.

237
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:36,352
You haven't told anyone other than him.

238
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:40,048
- Emotionally, you're still--
- You know what I'm dealing with?

239
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,699
You know what I'm going through?

240
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:44,676
No.

241
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,045
You think Dr. House does?

242
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,965
I'm not suggesting either
one of us be your doctor.

243
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,714
Dr. Stone is a psychiatrist.

244
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,826
If Dr. House is too busy, I could wait.

245
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:09,082
Why do you want me?

246
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:12,818
I don't know.

247
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,359
I don't want to treat you.

248
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,502
You're just saying that
so I'll see the psychiatrist.

249
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,203
True, except for the word "just."

250
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,497
I'm saying I don't want see
you so you'll see the psychiatrist and

251
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,248
because I don't want to treat you.

252
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,381
Why don't you want to treat me anymore?

253
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,353
I never wanted to treat you.

254
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,478
The fact that you were raped,

255
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,349
holds no interest for me.

256
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,406
It's nothing personal.

257
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,837
There's nothing to treat.
You're physically healthy.

258
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,600
Okay.

259
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,287
But I want you to be my doctor.

260
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,233
Why?

261
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:02,544
I don't know.

262
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,728
Well, you've gotta have a reason.
Everything has a reason.

263
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:10,980
I trust you.

264
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,405
Now, you see, that's a bad reason.

265
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,409
See, I'll lie to you. I'll tell you
anything just to get you out of here.

266
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,360
I don't care.

267
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,314
I want to talk to you.

268
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,896
Look, you were raped.

269
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,156
All control was taken away from you,

270
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,960
you're trying to
find that control again.

271
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,861
You want me because I don't want you.

272
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:35,159
I'm raping you?

273
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:40,024
In a very non-invasive, more annoying--

274
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,598
Get the hell out of here!

275
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,475
I'll send in Dr. Stone.

276
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,492
I didn't consent to all this medicine.

277
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,995
You've been out on the streets.
No treatment--

278
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,686
I'm dying.
There's no treatment for dying.

279
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,301
We can make you comfortable.

280
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,752
- Don't wanna be.
- Why not?

281
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,374
Because I screwed up my life.

282
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,767
So you want to punish yourself
for messing up your life?

283
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:09,499
Please.

284
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,323
Stop the treatment.

285
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:20,067
It'll go away on it's own.

286
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,520
It's not. Can't you-

287
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,070
Nope. It'll go away.

288
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,978
It's been all day.
There must be some treatment you can--

289
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,555
Nope. It'll go away.

290
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,264
Or it won't go away.

291
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,043
I read about a treatment.

292
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,134
Some doctor won a prize for it.

293
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,184
I read about it.

294
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:41,484
You don't have the hiccups, do you?

295
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,136
Make a note.

296
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:48,428
Drug-seeking behavior.

297
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,427
- Morphine?
- No.

298
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,749
Anal digital stimulation.

299
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,292
How long has Stone been in with her?

300
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,980
Are you concerned?

301
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,666
You know how many people
get raped every day?

302
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,833
So it's common, therefore boring?

303
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:07,346
If I were to care about every
person suffering on the planet,

304
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,990
- life would shut down.
- How about just the ones we meet?

305
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,172
They deserve our sympathy
more than the other people?

306
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,033
So your solution is not
to give a damn about any of them?

307
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,449
How do you do that?

308
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,406
How do you take that
theory and put it in practice?

309
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,709
You met her--

310
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,325
I paid these people 50
bucks to leave here an hour ago.

311
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:30,326
Yeah, we came back.

312
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:32,203
Well, then, you owe me 50.

313
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:33,354
The kid needs surgery.

314
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,625
And he could walk, way back then.

315
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,113
Stand up, kid.

316
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,076
He swallowed a magnet.
We gotta cut it out.

317
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,414
- How old are you?
- 8.

318
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:46,030
And he swallowed something
stuck to a fridge.

319
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,281
Darwin says let him die.

320
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:50,209
It's already below the stomach.
It should pass on its own.

321
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,925
Strong magnet. It's messin'
with the imaging. We have no way to--

322
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:57,837
You got x-ray vision, House?

323
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,539
Oh, you gonna cut him open? Right here?

324
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,572
It's well into the intestines.
He's fine.

325
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,880
I want my 50 back.

326
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:23,877
I need a crash cart, stat.

327
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,023
What happened?

328
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:37,122
Pills, benzos.
We need to get her stomach pumped.

329
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,093
- Respiration's shallow.
- What'd you say to her?

330
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,583
- Nothing that would make her want to
- Heartbeat's irregular.

331
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,465
- What'd she say to you?
- Nothing. I gave her

332
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,152
a couple of sedatives, turned around,
she grabbed the whole bottle.

333
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:48,961
- You must have said something.
- I said plenty. She said nothing.

334
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,912
I was with her for over an hour.
She didn't say one word.

335
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,009
Are you gonna do that again?

336
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,860
You're gonna be okay. Physically.

337
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,947
Which is all that interests you.

338
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,693
But you're here.

339
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:39,756
Under orders.

340
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:42,828
Why would you tell me that?

341
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,095
Because I don't like hypocrisy.

342
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,008
But you don't have
a problem with cruelty?

343
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,926
Which brings us back to,
why do you want me?

344
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:56,773
I don't know.

345
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,669
You tried to kill yourself,
because you couldn't talk to me.

346
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,750
You must have a reason.

347
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:04,951
Why does there always have
to be a reason? Can't we just talk?

348
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:09,405
There's a phone. Talk to a friend,
a family member. Call the police.

349
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,808
Do you want to talk
about what happened to you?

350
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:20,165
No.

351
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,488
Do you want to talk about your STD meds?

352
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:25,501
No.

353
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,670
You don't really seem to want to talk.

354
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:30,215
No, I do.

355
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:32,333
About what?

356
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:34,699
I don't know.

357
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:36,581
Anything.

358
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,880
The weather?

359
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:42,635
You were raped,

360
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:45,197
and you want to talk about the weather?

361
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,264
Yeah.

362
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,040
I'm not gonna talk
to you about the weather.

363
00:20:58,915 --> 00:20:59,865
You help her.

364
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,970
- She wants you.
- God knows why.

365
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:04,403
- She doesn't know what she wants.
- She knows she wants you.

366
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:06,336
You're the first person
she spoke to about this.

367
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,594
The fact that I was in
the wrong place at the wrong time

368
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,814
should be trumped by the
fact that I'm useless at this.

369
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:11,825
No, you're not.

370
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,445
You romantically wanting to believe
that is never gonna make it true.

371
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:19,464
I'm agreeing with you.

372
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,344
You are the last person
she should be talking to.

373
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:26,125
If she wants to talk about the weather,
talk about the weather.

374
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:29,149
She wants normalcy. She wants
to feel like the world didn't end.

375
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,100
Right.

376
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,324
I'll tell her that everything
went on without her:

377
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,225
Babies were born, people got married.

378
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,217
Thousands of people
will remember the day

379
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:38,226
she got raped as the
happiest day of their lives.

380
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,258
You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

381
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,208
You need to get her
to talk about what happened.

382
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,105
- No, he doesn't.
- Pretending it didn't happen

383
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:46,303
Wrong. Pretending this
didn't happen is the best thing,

384
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,522
- she could possibly do.
- She's gotta make this real.

385
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,086
You know what we should
be trying to make real or process?

386
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,683
The few decent moments in our lives,
not the crap.

387
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:57,002
Maybe you're right, except there's no
way she can pretend this didn't happen.

388
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,003
So she has no choice but to process it.

389
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:04,442
You've got to tell me what happened.

390
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,897
You don't really want to hear.

391
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,486
Sure I do.

392
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,365
You're lying.

393
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,314
This doesn't have to destroy your life.

394
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,385
I know.

395
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,186
It doesn't mean anything about you.

396
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,690
It wasn't your fault.

397
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:22,247
I know.

398
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:23,398
You did nothing wrong.

399
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,593
Some jerk hurt you. That's all.

400
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:26,991
I know.

401
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:30,086
You're worried that you
can never trust men again.

402
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:30,909
No.

403
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,274
Statistically, there was
always a chance this could happen.

404
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:35,634
The fact that it did happen
doesn't change anything.

405
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:38,561
The world doesn't suck any
more today than it did yesterday.

406
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:39,517
I know all that.

407
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,642
Well, what do you want me to tell you?

408
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:42,593
Nothing.

409
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:44,554
I just wanna talk.

410
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,090
About nothing.

411
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,376
If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change.

412
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:50,689
It might.

413
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,015
How?

414
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:53,496
Time.

415
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:57,733
Time changes everything.

416
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:01,342
That's what people say. It's not true.

417
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,731
Doing things changes things.

418
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:05,699
Not doing things...

419
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,732
leaves things exactly as they were.

420
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,244
Why do you have to suffer?

421
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:19,500
I gave my word.

422
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,318
- Who would make you promise that?
- My father.

423
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,330
He said I would die alone and miserable.

424
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:31,715
That's not a promise,
and even if it was, he's dead.

425
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,086
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care.

426
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:35,937
Why did your husband have to suffer?

427
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:40,557
- How do you know about my husband?
- Well, I just know.

428
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,955
You have to die in pain because
of a promise you made to your father?

429
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:51,859
If I'd say yes,

430
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:55,787
you'd use that as proof that I'm insane.

431
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,668
Force treatment on me.

432
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,556
Did the nurse tell you about my husband?

433
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:03,569
No.

434
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,146
- Nurse?
- Yes.

435
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,620
It's under control.

436
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:19,409
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,121
I was just trying to freak you out.

438
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:25,410
- Why?
- Because I need you to remember me.

439
00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:28,416
I need somebody to remember me.

440
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,520
- Where'd you go to college?
- Northwestern.

441
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,160
- You?
- Hopkins.

442
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:42,712
- What was your major?
- Comparative religion.

443
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,182
Why do you trust me?

444
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:45,953
I don't know. Can't we just--

445
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:48,180
- That's not rational!
- Nothing's rational.

446
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:50,231
- Everything is rational. - I was raped.

447
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,994
Explain how that makes sense to you.

448
00:24:56,514 --> 00:25:00,473
We are selfish,
base animals crawling across the earth.

449
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:03,847
But because we've got brains,
if we try real hard,

450
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,370
we can occasionally aspire to
something that is less than pure evil.

451
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,499
Has anything terrible
ever happened to you?

452
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,657
What do you want me to say?

453
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,136
You wanted this conversation.

454
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:28,373
You wanted to talk about
something that matters.

455
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:29,984
Talk.

456
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,918
She's waiting for your answer?

457
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:39,248
She's asleep.

458
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,909
I sedated her.

459
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,843
Why do you care what you say to her?

460
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,494
Because I don't know
how to answer these questions.

461
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:51,122
It's a simple question:
Has your life sucked?

462
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:53,545
Tell her the truth.
Tell her you were shot.

463
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:55,346
She doesn't want to hear the truth.

464
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:58,457
She's looking for something,
looking to extrapolate some--

465
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,967
She's looking to connect with you.

466
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:03,368
And that's what's scaring the
hell out of you. Tell her the truth.

467
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:04,393
There is no truth.

468
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,948
Are we role-playing?

469
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:10,099
Am I you? I don't want be you.

470
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,016
She's not asking for test results.
She's not asking what 2 plus 2 equals.

471
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:16,454
She's asking for my
personal life experience

472
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,277
so she can extrapolate to all humanity.

473
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:20,178
That's not truth. That's bad science.

474
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,327
It's not science at all.

475
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,251
Tell her the truth.

476
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,949
Tell her your life has been good.

477
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:31,949
It hasn't been.

478
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:33,789
Tell her anyway. She wants hope.

479
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:37,072
She wants to know that what
happened to her wasn't the norm,

480
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:41,085
that things can be okay, which means
maybe they can be okay for her again.

481
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,789
Tell her your life sucked.

482
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:46,777
It didn't.

483
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:47,898
Tell her anyway.

484
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,765
She wants to know she's not alone.

485
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,736
She wants to know she's
gonna survive this, that

486
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,993
other people have been through this
and worse and come out the other end.

487
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:56,944
She wants to know she's going to heal.

488
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:58,288
Act like...

489
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,549
you're healed.

490
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,155
Tell her...

491
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,630
Keep her asleep.

492
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:10,523
Thanks.

493
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,037
You've all been a huge help.

494
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:14,816
There's no wrong answer,

495
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,429
because there's no right answer.

496
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:18,773
Wrong.

497
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,131
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

498
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,690
Wake up.

499
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:39,795
It's not as bad as what happened to you,

500
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:41,743
I don't think.

501
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:43,767
I don't know what happened to you.

502
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:46,601
But given how lousy you're responding,
I assume it was worse than

503
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:48,402
getting abused by your grandmother.

504
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,670
What did she do to you?

505
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:57,703
My parents traveled a lot,

506
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,680
and they'd leave me with her.

507
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,664
She liked things the way she liked them.

508
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:06,304
And she believed in discipline.
She was right, I suppose,

509
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:09,126
because I hardly ever
screwed up when she was around.

510
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:13,272
Too scared of being forced
to sleep in the yard or

511
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,169
take a bath in ice.

512
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:21,647
Your turn.

513
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,039
Your parents,
they-- they never stopped her?

514
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:29,294
I never told them.

515
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,191
Why not?

516
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,663
Usual reasons: I was afraid
they wouldn't believe me,

517
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,514
and I was afraid they'd
think I'd done something wrong.

518
00:28:41,975 --> 00:28:43,925
I opened up to you, you open up to me.

519
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:46,885
- What did you call her?
- Oma.

520
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:49,639
And you kept calling
her that after this?

521
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:50,951
Dutch for "grandmother.

522
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,990
"She was still my grandmother,
and she was still dutch."

523
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,857
Is any part of that story true?

524
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,444
All of it.

525
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,797
You wouldn't keep calling her Oma.

526
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:08,926
Something would have to change.

527
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,164
- You don't know me.
- You wouldn't keep calling her Oma.

528
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,322
- Look, you're overreacting.
- Do not dismiss me.

529
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:18,111
I'm not dismissing you. I'm just
saying you're not acting rationally.

530
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:20,051
I'm angry because you are lying to me.

531
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,660
- No. You are--
- What can I do?

532
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,848
What the hell can I do
that you're not gonna dismiss

533
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,599
as just being because I was raped?

534
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:31,624
Nothing.

535
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:36,488
Your story...

536
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:38,585
is it true?

537
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,045
True for somebody.

538
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,005
But not for you.

539
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:47,055
These things happen.

540
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,451
It happened to somebody.
What do you care if it happened to me?

541
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:51,778
They're not in this room.

542
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:55,373
No! They're out there: Doctors,
lawyers... postal workers.

543
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:58,276
Some of them doing great.
Some of them doing lousy.

544
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:01,624
Are you gonna base your whole life
on who you got stuck in a room with?

545
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,675
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck in a room with.

546
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,343
That's what life is.

547
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:09,191
It's a series of rooms.

548
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,363
And who we get stuck in those rooms
with adds up to what are lives are.

549
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,564
You've got to get me out of this.

550
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,470
There's nothing to diagnose.
There's nothing--

551
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:42,971
You only tested her for STDs?

552
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:47,037
I had seven morons who forgot their
raincoats. It's all they asked for,

553
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,902
so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?

554
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:49,953
I wasted their time.

555
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:51,676
She's pregnant.

556
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,070
Do you understand?

557
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,444
Are you okay?

558
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,937
I mean, I know you're not okay, but

559
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,007
are you more or less not
okay than you were five minutes ago?

560
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:21,812
About the same.

561
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:24,077
Good.

562
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:27,104
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant.

563
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,560
I don't want to terminate.

564
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,099
You want to keep the baby?

565
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,553
Abortion is murder.

566
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:37,471
True.

567
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,477
It's a life, and...

568
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:40,899
you should end it.

569
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,871
Every life is sacred.

570
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:48,223
Come on. Talk to me.
Don't quote me bumper stickers.

571
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:50,178
- It's true.
- It's meaningless.

572
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:53,502
- It means every life matters to god.
- Not to me, not to you.

573
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,980
Judging by the number of natural
disasters, not to god either.

574
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,881
- You're just being argumentative.
- Yeah! I do do that.

575
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:03,126
What about Hitler?
Was his life sacred to god?

576
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,456
Father of your child,
is his life sacred to you?

577
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:08,329
My child isn't Hitler.

578
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:10,337
Either every life is sacred, or it--

579
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:13,290
Stop it! I don't wanna
chat about philosophy.

580
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:16,482
You're not killing your
rape baby because of a philosophy.

581
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,555
It's murder. I'm against it. You for it?

582
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:23,771
Not as a general rule.

583
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,858
- Just for unborn children?
- Yes.

584
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:33,817
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

585
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,753
It might make sense for us
to kill the ass that did this to you.

586
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,438
I mean, where do we draw the line?

587
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:43,239
Which asses do we get to kill, and
which asses get to keep on being asses?

588
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,466
The nice thing about the abortion
debate is that we can quibble

589
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:49,582
over trimesters, but ultimately,
there's a nice, clean line:

590
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:52,122
Birth.

591
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:57,157
Morally there isn't a lot of difference.
Practically, huge.

592
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,142
You're enjoying this conversation.

593
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,144
This is the type of
conversation I do well.

594
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,066
But the other type...

595
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,917
the personal stuff?

596
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:18,957
There are no answers.

597
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,499
If there are no answers,

598
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:23,166
why talk about it?

599
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:28,308
You're healthy.

600
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,048
You shouldn't be here.

601
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:34,963
I don't want to go.

602
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:39,703
Fine.

603
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,733
I won't discharge you.

604
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:49,533
You wanna go for a walk?

605
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:58,947
This is the last of my journey.

606
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:02,269
You don't deserve pain.
You're just an insane old man.

607
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,041
- No, no.
- I'm not gonna watch you suffer.

608
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,696
- I need you to remember me.
- I'll remember you!

609
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:09,276
- Why?
- Because you're a nice man.

610
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,580
You don't know that.
You don't know anything about me.

611
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,666
Either you are a nice
man or you're an ass.

612
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:18,025
Either way, you did something
to somebody that they're gonna remember.

613
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:22,957
I have no family. I have no friends.
I didn't even have a real job.

614
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:26,712
If I die in peace,
then I'm just another patient.

615
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,558
- But if I die suffering--
- It'll be horrible.

616
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:32,131
Don't do that to either of us.

617
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:37,015
No, I just need to die knowing
that something is different

618
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:38,814
because I was here.

619
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,207
Life goes on.

620
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:25,293
Is that the reason why we're out here?

621
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:27,642
You know why I come here?

622
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,005
I sit, I watch, I imagine.

623
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:35,318
Sounds nice.

624
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,534
I imagine that one
of them will break a leg.

625
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,513
Just one false step,

626
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,723
one crack in the sidewalk.

627
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,296
- You don't really.
- I'm evil.

628
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:49,087
Evil people don't say they're evil.

629
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:51,562
That sounds like an easy loophole.

630
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:58,574
People can do good things,
their instincts are not good,

631
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,023
either god doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

632
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:06,178
I don't believe that.

633
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:09,102
So what do you believe?

634
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,246
Why do you think this happened?

635
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:16,509
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Me neither.

636
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:18,631
Too bad.

637
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:23,778
You know,
I don't think there was a reason.

638
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,986
So god does exist,lets you get raped,

639
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,795
and needs you to keep
your rape baby for no reason.

640
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:34,533
Well, maybe he was challenging me.

641
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:36,797
He hurts you to help you.

642
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:41,264
I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

643
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,046
You're trying to convince
me there's no god.

644
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,914
Why would you even
say something like that?

645
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:46,468
Because you're throwing your life away.

646
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,869
- I'm doing what I believe.
- What you believe doesn't make sense.

647
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:52,899
This is not helping me.

648
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:54,884
Then I can't help you.

649
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,242
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

650
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:05,282
The same as a bug is irrelevant
in comparison to the universe.

651
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:12,064
If you don't believe in eternity,

652
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,470
then what you do here is irrelevant.

653
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,853
Your actions here are all that matters.

654
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:18,265
Then nothing matters.

655
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,396
There's no ultimate consequences.

656
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,036
I couldn't live like that.

657
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:30,599
So you need to think that the guy who
did this to you is gonna be punished.

658
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:34,641
I need to know that
it all means something.

659
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:37,423
I need that comfort.

660
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:40,268
Yeah.

661
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,366
Are you feeling comfortable?

662
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,080
You feeling good right now,
feel warm inside?

663
00:37:56,214 --> 00:37:57,164
I was raped.

664
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,535
What's your excuse?

665
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,203
Do you think the guy
who did this to me feels bad?

666
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:03,794
That'd help you?

667
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:06,419
It'll make you feel better?

668
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,169
Why do you always do that...

669
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,336
ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just answering the question?

670
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:14,937
The answer doesn't interest me.

671
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:19,936
I don't care what he's feeling.
I'm interested in what you're feeling.

672
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:24,046
You are?

673
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:30,538
I'm trapped in the room with you, right?

674
00:39:33,392 --> 00:39:34,542
Why did you choose me?

675
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:41,011
There's something about you.

676
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,458
It's like you're hurt too.

677
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,293
It was true.

678
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:06,084
What was?

679
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:10,052
It wasn't my grandmother,
but it was true.

680
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:15,754
Who was it?

681
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:20,446
It was my dad.

682
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:42,067
I'd like to tell you
what happened to me now.

683
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:48,351
I'd like to hear it.

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,446
It was my friends' birthday party--

685
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,358
She terminated.

686
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:52,914
She's been discharged.

687
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:57,323
She's gonna be okay.

688
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,692
Yeah. It's that simple.

689
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,483
She's talking about what happened.
That's huge.

690
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,390
You did good.

691
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,327
And everyone will tell you

692
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:11,466
that's what we gotta make her do

693
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,362
if we're gonna help her, right?

694
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:14,914
Except we can't.

695
00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:17,383
We drag out her story,

696
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:21,093
tell each other that
it'll help her heal,

697
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,861
and feel real good about ourselves.

698
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,297
