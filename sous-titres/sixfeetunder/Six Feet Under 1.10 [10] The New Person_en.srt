1
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:43,848
So I say to this guy, "I can't do anything
unless you give me an order number.

2
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,253
And I don't appreciate your taking that
tone of voice with me."

3
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,209
He says he doesn't have
an order number.

4
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,489
And I say, "Well, you should always
write down the order number."

5
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,211
Then he gets all pissy.

6
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:58,457
Says he wants to speak to the person
he ordered the Astoria floor lamp from.

7
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:02,937
And I say, "Well, do you
remember his or her..."

8
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,528
Right, you know? "...name?"

9
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,571
And he says, "Of course not."

10
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,569
And I say, "Then I'm sorry,
I can't help you."

11
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,893
He says this isn't the first time
he had a problem ordering from us.

12
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,253
Last Christmas he bought a CD holder,
and it arrived all broken.

13
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,134
When we told him, "Send it back"...

14
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:25,019
...he couldn't because he'd thrown
away the box it came in.

15
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:29,900
So I say... I say, "Boo-hoo, mister.
Ain't you got it bad."

16
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:32,459
And he says, "I wanna talk
to your supervisor."

17
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,020
And I say, "Of course
you can talk to him...

18
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:39,218
...but unfortunately, his hours
are only 8:30..."

19
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,061
So now the wife's in jail, according
to the cousin who arranged the funeral.

20
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,867
I bet he was abusing her. Maybe he had
some sick sexual thing he made her do.

21
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:15,141
Please, stop.

22
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:20,426
And you're wrong. All she told
the police was that he was boring.

23
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,826
That's it? That's all she said?

24
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:29,424
- The sick part is, I understand it.
- I do too.

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,424
- Sometimes I'm boring.
- I am too.

26
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:40,745
I should be at both intakes
with you this morning...

27
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,992
...but you'll have to do
the casket meeting...

28
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,153
...because I'm really backed up
down here.

29
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:50,067
David, maybe we need to think about
finding a replacement for Rico.

30
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,392
Why? We're doing just fine without him.
It's saving money, thank you very much.

31
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,073
Is there something you'd like to say
about my work?

32
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,076
Look, you do a great job...

33
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,748
...when it comes to people
who had peaceful farewells.

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,554
But the big reconstructions,
you're out of your league.

35
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,712
I see, so those who can't do, criticize?

36
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,957
We've got a body
that's a page-one rewrite.

37
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:13,995
We got two more coming in
from that nightclub fire in Valencia.

38
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:17,200
- How bad was that fire?
- Well, this is where they ended up.

39
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:18,676
Maybe the families want...

40
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:22,034
Open caskets. They already
put in the requests.

41
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:24,757
- I'll put an ad in the paper today.
- It's taken care of.

42
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:28,115
I've scheduled some interviews
for this afternoon.

43
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:34,397
As you can see from my r'esum'e,
I've had the good fortune to study...

44
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:37,279
...under a variety
of gifted restorative artists.

45
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,723
Oh, you worked over at Hope Valley.
I've known P.T. For years.

46
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,155
Look, that lawsuit about
the unembalmed arm was not my fault.

47
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:52,886
I took the fall for some bitch that was
supposed to cover me for leaving early.

48
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,523
Sometimes I wake up
with a feeling of panic...

49
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,084
...like my heart's gonna beat
right out of my chest.

50
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,044
You know what I'm talking about. But
after I spend a few extra hours in bed...

51
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,483
...and do my chanting,
the dark time usually passes.

52
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:10,366
I know it sounds funny,
but the first time I embalmed someone...

53
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,881
...it felt like I was coming home.

54
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:16,323
I just knew that this is
what I was meant to do.

55
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:18,291
That doesn't sound funny at all.

56
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:21,087
There's something very intimate about it.

57
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:25,845
I'm the last person on earth
who gets to know these people.

58
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:31,365
Anyway, I guess I take
what I do very seriously.

59
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,173
Well, I have no further questions.

60
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,652
Me neither. Thanks for coming in,
Angela. We'll be in touch.

61
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:39,451
Great.

62
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,694
It was very nice to meet you.

63
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,451
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:48,450
Okay.

65
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,097
I'll wait an hour before I call her.

66
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,369
We don't wanna look desperate.

67
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,492
Just find out if she can start tomorrow.

68
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,983
David,

69
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,019
David!

70
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,257
David!

71
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,459
Why are you standing there like that?

72
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,463
I was thinking.

73
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:52,142
Isn't a person allowed to think?

74
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,787
You're gonna wish you'd
gotten high with me.

75
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,381
I told you, I'm never getting high again.

76
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,310
Oh, doesn't Billy look great?

77
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,261
So handsome and confident.

78
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,829
Yo, Billy!

79
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:23,389
Would you excuse me for one moment?
Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it.

80
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:27,383
Thank God you're here. My mouth
is really dry, and is my breath bad?

81
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:28,710
No, it's fine.

82
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,828
So truth. Is this show good,
or is it just pretentious bullshit?

83
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,504
There're so many people,
it's hard to see the pictures.

84
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:37,515
This is Billy's best work ever,
very disturbing.

85
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:42,667
- Really?
- I'm so proud of you, God!

86
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,107
Why is my mother here?

87
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:48,798
Oh, God.

88
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,628
I invited her as part of my ongoing
campaign to get her to like me.

89
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,314
I didn't think she'd actually turn up.

90
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,309
You know that some stranger
just rubbed my ass?

91
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:06,232
Isn't this fabulous?
Oh, Billy, darling.

92
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,553
Thanks, Mom.

93
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:16,872
You can't keep him to yourself
all the time.

94
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:23,715
Okay, no offense, but your family
is fucked up beyond comprehension.

95
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,995
She's completely tanked.

96
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,400
I brought someone.
I hope that's okay.

97
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,915
- Hey, Nikolai.
- Hello, Nate, how are you?

98
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,799
- This is Brenda.
- Good evening.

99
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:37,317
- Hello, dear.
- It's good to see you, Mrs. Fisher.

100
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:41,521
- Where's Hiram?
- He's visiting his son in Portland.

101
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:46,604
I'm serious, darling,
this new stuff is really visceral.

102
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,607
Not at all left-brained like your father.

103
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,323
Yeah. Hey, so where is Dad?

104
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,001
Oh, honey, Bern sends his regrets.
He's just heartsick.

105
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,520
Unfortunately, he's treating
one of his patients...

106
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:04,487
...who's undergoing a complete
psychotic break at the moment.

107
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,522
That always seems to happen whenever
there's something important in my life.

108
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:12,328
I guess that's just typical Bernard...
I'm sorry, Bernard Chenowith behavior.

109
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,205
Pretentious dick.

110
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:17,372
Now, you just hush.

111
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,330
I thought this would be paintings.

112
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,207
I could take photographs.

113
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:25,213
That doesn't mean they'd be any good.

114
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:29,568
Mrs. Fisher, I've never seen you
having this much fun.

115
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,408
Oh, no, no, no, it's great.

116
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,006
I am having fun just watching you.

117
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:41,177
Hey, Mr. Seattle co-op hippie boy.

118
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:45,733
Oh, Margaret Chenowith. Who are you?

119
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,812
- Ruth Fisher.
- Nate's mother.

120
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,851
That explains why
you're looking at me...

121
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,096
...like I just took a giant dump
on your lawn.

122
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,490
If I knew you were
putting on a show tonight...

123
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,891
...I would've bought tickets
for all my friends.

124
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,934
Goody, there's Dr. Feinberg.

125
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,661
- Hi.
- What is he doing here?

126
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,176
I invited him.

127
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,338
Gareth Feinberg, the guy
who wrote the book?

128
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,740
Yeah, he wrote
Charlotte-fucking-Light and Dark,

129
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,333
He's a fucking evil dead fish
of a fucking Nazi fuck.

130
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:16,980
Darling, try not to act so adolescent.
It only makes you look bad.

131
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,143
As opposed to being drunk
and slobbering all over my boyfriend...

132
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,939
...who, by the way,
is completely not interested.

133
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:25,101
Isn't this fun?

134
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:27,940
Billy, Billy, Billy.

135
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,822
It's quite powerful stuff.
It's... It's potent.

136
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:35,941
That's a word Dr. Feinberg
likes to use a lot.

137
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:40,346
Brenda, I see a lot of you
in these photographs.

138
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:43,304
Hello, Gareth.

139
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,904
Margaret.

140
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:49,343
Does this have a theme?

141
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,506
I know you like your things
to have a theme.

142
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,340
Mother, nothing is more tedious than
when you look for meaning in my work.

143
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:58,190
I don't need your fucking approval.

144
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,902
Excuse me.

145
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,507
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Yeah, it is.

146
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,550
He's good.

147
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,314
Yeah, he is really good.

148
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,908
I only wish he'd believe that.

149
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,593
This one's got real attitude.

150
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,751
- Oh, my God.
- The light's spectacular.

151
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,353
Brenda, that is a picture
of me urinating on a wall.

152
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,514
- I realize that.
- Hey, what do you think?

153
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,272
So now you're stalking me?

154
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,158
No, I just saw you one day
when I was taking pictures...

155
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,033
...so I followed you.
- You were just out taking pictures?

156
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,915
You live in Venice! There's no reason
for you to be in my neighborhood.

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,918
You think the world revolves around you.

158
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,597
Bren, would you tell him, please,
this isn't about him?

159
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:02,631
It's what Billy does.

160
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,232
He takes pictures of people
when they're off guard.

161
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,992
- He's got a talent. It's art.
- No, it's fucked!

162
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,120
Thanks a lot.

163
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,917
Look. That's your son
pissing against a wall.

164
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,436
So I should let him humiliate me
whenever he wants?

165
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,838
Oh, God, Nate, don't make this
about you.

166
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,644
Why the fuck not? This is about me.
You make enough stuff all about you.

167
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:44,363
So what? There's a picture
of you pissing on a wall.

168
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,687
Who got hurt? Who died?

169
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,245
You don't think I have a right
to not be spied upon?

170
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:54,568
You're talking to someone
who was spied on her whole life.

171
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:59,482
God, Billy is severely fucked up, Bren.
I don't like being stalked by a psycho.

172
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:04,562
Billy is not psychotic. He has a disease.
He's fine when he takes his meds.

173
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,241
Yeah, well, when the fuck is that?

174
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:14,971
Look, has he ever done anything weird?

175
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:20,375
Yeah, he's bipolar.
His whole life he's been weird.

176
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,730
Has he ever done anything dangerous?

177
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:29,215
Oh, God. Nate, no.

178
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:36,332
The only person Billy would ever
be a threat to is himself.

179
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,217
- Has he ever tried to...?
- Yes.

180
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,528
When I was 18.

181
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,058
I went to Europe for three months.

182
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,539
It was this big reward for me
winning a scholarship to Yale.

183
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:57,977
When I got back to L.A.,
my mother was at the airport.

184
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:01,061
She told me that Billy
had committed suicide.

185
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:07,419
My whole life just collapsed
in on itself in that moment.

186
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:14,103
Of course, she meant to say that Billy
had tried to commit suicide.

187
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:19,023
She was drunk,
or else it was a Freudian slip.

188
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:23,779
You never went to Yale.

189
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,342
Billy was in a hospital in Pasadena.

190
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:31,581
I took some classes at UCLA
in the spring.

191
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:35,539
Then in the fall, he was diagnosed
manic-depressive...

192
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,501
...which kicks in in adolescence...

193
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,781
...so it probably had nothing to do
with me getting the scholarship.

194
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,585
I can't believe they pressured you into
sacrificing your life for your brother.

195
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,351
Nobody pressured me.

196
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,980
I wanted to stay.

197
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:01,381
- Morning.
- Morning. Pee on any walls lately?

198
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,823
Shut up.

199
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:08,266
So, Mom, what's with you and Nikolai?

200
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,148
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,867
And Dave, what'd you do last night?

202
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,475
Nothing.

203
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:19,190
Saturday night, what happened to that...?

204
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:23,349
Person you're seeing?

205
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,792
That person is no longer in the picture.

206
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:29,193
Sorry to hear it.

207
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:31,753
What about you?

208
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,355
- You dating anybody?
- No.

209
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,995
If you are, you don't need
to hide him from us like we're lepers.

210
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:42,990
I'm not dating anyone. I've just been
hanging out a lot with somebody.

211
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,761
Who is this person?

212
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,913
Nobody.

213
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,872
David, I'm ready to go to church.

214
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,433
Thanks, guys.

215
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:07,558
- Hey, Joey, the kid's ready,
- So am I,

216
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:16,560
This is the most terrifying
shower scene since Psycho.

217
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,201
That football game used to make
this obnoxious noise...

218
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,682
...when you scored a touchdown.

219
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,768
Do you wanna show me how to play it?

220
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,559
No.

221
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:39,004
You know, there's this...
There's this little kid next door...

222
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,768
...and the only toy he's got...

223
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,850
...is this stupid Mousetrap game
from when his mom was a kid.

224
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:49,162
Maybe, you know, he'd want
some of these.

225
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:04,292
It's a beautiful day. Why would you
waste your Sunday in here watching TV?

226
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,570
What are you doing?

227
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:18,049
I thought that Tony Rechner next door
might want some of these.

228
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,450
Just keep your hands off them.

229
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,850
She doesn't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

230
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:45,978
Come on, I wanna show you
something funny. Come on.

231
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,378
Come on.

232
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,778
We're going on a field trip?

233
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:59,424
This is like the first day of school.

234
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:02,092
I am so excited.

235
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:05,422
Oh, and I just wanna apologize
in advance...

236
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,093
...because I had calamari
last night for dinner.

237
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,900
- What do you mean?
- Let's just say this is one time...

238
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:15,179
...where the strong smell of
formaldehyde really comes in handy.

239
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,864
So then I said, "I don't care
if you have a low sperm count.

240
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,980
I mean, I'll just shove a turkey baster
up there if I have to."

241
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:29,707
I mean, I wanna have a child
before I turn 40. That's fair, right?

242
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,308
Hello, everyone.

243
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:35,901
Hi. How was church?
Nate told me you're a deacon.

244
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,670
That's adorable.

245
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,703
I see you've made yourself at home.

246
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:50,830
Angela doesn't like to feel constrained.

247
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,024
Well, you know, my glands
go double-time.

248
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,625
I find if I wear too much while I work,
I get all pitted.

249
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,952
Angela, we're sort of used to a more
professional appearance around here.

250
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:13,669
Give me a break, David,
they're just nipples.

251
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,232
I mean, we've all seen them.
We've all touched them.

252
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:20,033
We've all sucked on them. It's not like
this guy will be lying in the casket...

253
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,708
...and people will be saying, "Oh, my
God, the embalmer's nipples were hard."

254
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,831
They'll be saying, "How did they put
his face back together...

255
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,111
...after he went through
the goddamn windshield?"

256
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,118
I told Father Jack I'd help
with the food distribution downtown.

257
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,233
I just wanted to make sure
that your first day was going okay.

258
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:41,672
Well, thanks. I'm all gassy,
but that's not your fault.

259
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:45,473
Angela had calamari last night.

260
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:49,515
Boy, he's a barrel of laughs.

261
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,483
It's hard when a new person
comes into a situation,

262
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:57,716
It throws everything off balance.

263
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:01,517
Bren, I am not threatened
by your boyfriend.

264
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:06,196
Oh, yeah? Your behavior consistently
communicates otherwise.

265
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,635
You want the picture
out of the show, fine.

266
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:14,163
But don't spout psychobabble at me
like fucking Margaret and Bernard.

267
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,523
- You're, like, becoming them.
- Fuck you!

268
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:19,959
You know what you did was wrong.
That's why you didn't show it to me.

269
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:24,122
- Why are you making it such a big deal?
- Because I love him!

270
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:32,329
You're fucking with my life, Billy,
and it's not fair.

271
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,959
You have to stop.

272
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,040
- Or what?
- Goddamn it, Billy, what is it with you?

273
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:41,403
You like fucking with my brain
like Feinberg?

274
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,848
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

275
00:20:59,855 --> 00:21:01,732
Can I get you anything else?

276
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:06,012
I can always use a good blowjob.

277
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:12,370
Hey, do I get my fucking lunch or not?

278
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,009
- I'm going to get a drink of water.
- Yeah, sure.

279
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:24,214
Melinda Daner, Mark Whitman...

280
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,257
...Darryl Heinz, Keith Charles.

281
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,931
Okay, well, just tell them we'll meet them
at the usual corner on Tuesday. Okay.

282
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,292
- Hi, Tracy.
- Oh, hi, David.

283
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:39,531
- How have you been?
- Fine.

284
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,380
I love your new hair.

285
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,617
What are you working on?

286
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:49,853
St. Stephen's is sending over
some volunteers to help out next week.

287
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:52,453
Someone told me that you
used to go to St. Stephen's.

288
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:55,861
Not that I've been asking around
about you. It just came up naturally.

289
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,579
So did you? Go there, I mean.

290
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:03,422
- Yeah, just for a few months last year.
- They're a very progressive church.

291
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,577
Yes, they are.

292
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:13,419
The guy who took these
is a total psycho.

293
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,819
It's good.

294
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,819
Well, we should probably get going
if we wanna see that movie.

295
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,348
I should probably get home
and check on my mom.

296
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,111
I'm sure she's doing fine.

297
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:38,424
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,668
It's not like I was dying
to see a movie.

299
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:43,512
That's not what I'm talking about.

300
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,628
I'm sorry...

301
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:51,551
...about what happened between us.

302
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:55,913
I never meant for those assholes
to write shit on your car.

303
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,269
I shouldn't have told Andy about us.

304
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:04,590
I was just being stupid. That was me
being really, really, really stupid...

305
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:11,029
...and I'm sorry.

306
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,869
Well, thank you.

307
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,559
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this.

308
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,151
All I'm saying is,
I sat around last week...

309
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,558
...in that stupid getup
you wanted me to wear...

310
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:46,154
...and had to say all this, you know,
"Daddy this" and "Daddy that" bullshit.

311
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:50,243
When I tell you I keep reading articles
about having this one-hour orgasm...

312
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:54,114
...well, the least you could do
is try to help me have one.

313
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,718
I'm sorry men can't have it.

314
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:58,234
Since you guys get everything else
on the planet...

315
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:00,482
...it seems like a fair tradeoff.

316
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,085
Fine.

317
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:04,642
Goodbye.

318
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:10,681
You know, Angela, my brother
likes a certain decorum...

319
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:13,402
...when you're working
with someone's loved one.

320
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,679
Yeah?

321
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,449
Well, the personal calls are
probably a little uncool.

322
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,486
Oh, right, got it.

323
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,443
I won't do it when he's around.

324
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,127
Hello.

325
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,809
Hey.

326
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,689
Really?

327
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,360
Why don't you want me to come over?

328
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,565
Damn it, Brenda, you always do this.
You're shutting me out.

329
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:42,571
Look, the pissing thing is
no longer an issue, I swear.

330
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,572
Look, maybe you'd feel better
if I came over.

331
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:49,244
All right, fine, whatever. Fine.

332
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,409
- Girlfriend trouble?
- Not really trouble.

333
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:59,092
Tell me what the fight was about,
and I'll tell you what to say to fix it.

334
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,014
I mean, trust me, this is my thing.

335
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:02,690
We didn't have a fight.

336
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:07,288
She just pulls away from me
at the weirdest times.

337
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:12,293
Well, maybe she senses that
you're pulling away...

338
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:14,649
...so she just does it first.

339
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,736
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

340
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,336
Shoot. I guess this means
I can't ask about the pissing?

341
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,778
Because I had an ex who wanted to pee
on me, and I wasn't grossed out.

342
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,900
I mean, I just thought it was
kind of silly. But that's me.

343
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:53,456
Thank you for taking me to
the art gallery last night.

344
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:55,622
I thought you hated those pictures.

345
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:59,899
No, no, it's just that I don't
like them, that's all.

346
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:03,424
But it was nice to be
spending time with you.

347
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,058
I mean, outside of working together.

348
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:10,785
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?

349
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,578
- Is that like a date?
- Of course not.

350
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:18,863
Good, I pick you up
tomorrow night, 8:00.

351
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,182
I don't wanna go, okay?
Just stop asking me.

352
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,303
Okay, fine. I was only inviting you
to be nice.

353
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:32,788
Nobody even wants you there because
you've been acting so weird lately.

354
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,584
Gabe?

355
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:38,825
- We have to be someplace.
- Get lost, Morticia.

356
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:41,463
Shut up, peanut-testicle.

357
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,792
Fuck off, the both of you.

358
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,192
What's his problem?

359
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:53,674
Nothing. He wants me to go to this party
tomorrow. I'm just not in the mood.

360
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:56,308
We can do something if you want.

361
00:26:56,516 --> 00:27:01,068
Actually, I gotta go to Barstow tomorrow
and spend the night at my dad's.

362
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:06,069
I gotta ask him for money for my mom.
Not that he's gonna give it to me, but...

363
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:09,917
Well, do you want company?

364
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,428
Claire, you don't have
to keep taking care of me.

365
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,590
I'm not.

366
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,360
I just like hanging out.

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,633
We could just go for the drive.
Then you go see your dad...

368
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,159
...and I'll stay in some, like, creepy motel
and read a Stephen King book.

369
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,872
Okay.

370
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:32,278
Meet me after fifth period
tomorrow by the gym.

371
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,126
Oh, this is just what I need today.

372
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,924
I see this is payback time
for my missing your opening.

373
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,082
Just shut up!

374
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:25,689
Both of you, for once,
just shut your fucking mouths.

375
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:28,526
All that comes out of you
is garbage, garbage, garbage!

376
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,404
Okay.

377
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,923
Good, we have a dialogue.

378
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:39,407
- Where did you get this?
- From his office.

379
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:42,607
It's all the data Feinberg has
on Brenda. It's all destroyed.

380
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:45,409
He can go to where he came from
before he fucked her up.

381
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:50,007
You're off the hook. Obviously, this has
nothing to do with you missing his show.

382
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:53,049
Don't fucking talk about me
like I'm not here!

383
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,652
Even though I'm not
and never have been.

384
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:57,609
Son, what's wrong? Just tell us.

385
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:59,375
There's nothing wrong with me.

386
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:02,650
I didn't sell my daughter to some smug,
star-fucking psychiatrist...

387
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,326
...so he could pick her apart
like a goddamn cadaver...

388
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,776
...and turn her into shit and garbage
just like everything you touch!

389
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,930
- Billy, sweetheart...
- You bitch!

390
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,968
You're the fucking nurse. You wanna tie
us up, lock us in a room, leave us to die.

391
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,609
Well, you're the one that should die,
you and him!

392
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,692
You don't get to touch the children.

393
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:24,335
I refuse to be an audience for this.

394
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:37,501
Oh, boy. You can juice her, but you
better let me take care of that skin.

395
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,613
This guy has a really sinewy neck.

396
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,698
Sinewy. I love saying that word,
don't you?

397
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:47,621
- I don't know.
- I went out with this guy once...

398
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:51,023
...he had a really sinewy neck.
He was a total animal in bed.

399
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:54,344
I mean, the things he could do
with his tongue.

400
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:58,341
He thought he was God's gift to women.
I guess in that one respect he was.

401
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:02,547
- So do you like sinewy necks, David?
- I never really thought about it.

402
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,819
Hey, I'm just trying to figure out
your type.

403
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,940
Believe me, I can tell you're single.

404
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,221
And I know about a million people
I can set you up with.

405
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,149
So, what kind of guys do you like?

406
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,102
What makes you think that I like men?

407
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,388
Oh, please, let's not play that game.

408
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:21,425
- I think we should fire her.
- I'm thinking the same thing.

409
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,226
- Has she made a lot of mistakes?
- No.

410
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,309
She's a little hard to take.

411
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:28,743
She's a lot hard to take.

412
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,467
Sometimes people are hard to take...

413
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:34,871
...but only because the first side they
present is annoying or aggressive...

414
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:37,713
...because they're nervous.

415
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,707
After you spend some time
with them...

416
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:43,385
...you realize maybe there's another side
to them that's worth knowing.

417
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:50,192
Or not. I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

418
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:54,629
Sorry I'm late.

419
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:58,831
By the way, I won't be here for dinner
tomorrow, so everyone's on their own.

420
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,827
Actually, I'm going to be volunteering
with the food distribution.

421
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,554
Well, that leaves you and me, Claire.
You wanna go to the Apple Pan?

422
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,470
Can't. I have to do
this astronomy overnight thing...

423
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,514
...at the observatory for school.
- I didn't hear about this.

424
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,440
I told you.
You probably weren't listening.

425
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:20,679
That's the type of thing I would listen to.

426
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,793
David and Nate did it
when they went to Bonaventure.

427
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,154
David, you did this?

428
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:31,639
- Yeah, I had to.
- You too, Nate?

429
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:34,956
Back then we thought
Pluto was a planet.

430
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:38,521
- When did Pluto stop being a planet?
- A few months ago.

431
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:42,121
Well, I suppose it's okay for you to go.

432
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:48,561
Luckily, Gareth isn't going
to press charges.

433
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:53,363
But I did promise him that steps
would be taken to remedy the situation.

434
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,446
I wish I'd been there to see
the look on Feinberg's face.

435
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,957
I'm sure he started with
his whole blinking thing.

436
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,047
Brenda, we have a serious problem.

437
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:08,727
Okay, I'll talk to Billy's doctor, see if
he needs to be on different medication.

438
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,643
We were thinking of something
a little more involved.

439
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,321
Your mother and I feel that he needs
to go away for intensive therapy.

440
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:18,848
There's a very good facility in Colorado.

441
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:21,008
You wanna put Billy in an institution?

442
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:24,484
Oh, please, let's not turn this
into a 1950s B-movie.

443
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:27,770
This place is run
by excellent psychiatric specialists...

444
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:32,923
...who may have some creative solution
to help Billy.

445
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:35,566
You wanna give him shock treatment.

446
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:39,370
Darling, really, this dramatic streak,
aren't you a little old for it?

447
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:43,205
And just for the record, electroconvulsive
therapy's had a real resurgence...

448
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,771
...in the last 10 years
with very impressive results.

449
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:47,973
- You can't do this.
- We think it's best.

450
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,895
It certainly makes your lives easier.

451
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:54,017
God forbid Billy should embarrass you in
front of your stupid celebrity friends.

452
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,726
Unfortunately, he's an adult
which means you can't...

453
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:59,857
...have him committed
unless he does something dangerous.

454
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,414
Darling?

455
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,096
We were thinking if you talked to him,
explained how it would help him...

456
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,936
Fuck you both.
You're out of your minds.

457
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,620
Hi, I'm Angela. You must be Ruth.

458
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:24,213
Yes.

459
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,853
I spilled some beet salad
on someone's wig...

460
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:35,420
...so David said I should eat up here.

461
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,018
I got the stains out.

462
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:42,863
Everyone in my family gets cancer,
so I know tons about taking care of wigs.

463
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:49,176
Is that yours? The hair, I mean.

464
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:51,059
As far as I know.

465
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:52,860
It's beautiful.

466
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:55,104
Thank you.

467
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,983
I don't wanna be one
of those menopausal women...

468
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:02,341
...that goes all dykey
with the butch haircut.

469
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,384
So Nate says that
you're dating a hairdresser.

470
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,627
That is so lucky.

471
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:15,023
If he's good, I'd love to know
if he can do anything with this mop.

472
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,191
Does your boyfriend come around?

473
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,271
He's not exactly my boyfriend.

474
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:24,271
Oh, come on, you're blushing.

475
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:27,386
Must be pretty serious. Is it?

476
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:30,267
Is it serious, or is it just hot sex?

477
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:37,432
I'm really not in the mood
to discuss my personal life.

478
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,080
You have one new message,

479
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,679
Hey, it's me,

480
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,679
Look, it's better if I just go by myself,

481
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:10,157
You should probably just
not worry about it, okay?

482
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,995
Thank you for trying to... To,,,,

483
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:18,275
Look, just... Thank you,

484
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,271
So that's... That's it, I guess,

485
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:26,234
Goodbye, Claire,

486
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:32,759
This is disgusting.
You have crap in here from the '80s.

487
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,959
Billy, I'll get a plumber, somebody
who actually knows what they're doing.

488
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:43,236
Would you look at me?
I'd really like to talk to you.

489
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:48,446
I take it you spoke to Mom and Dad.

490
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:52,997
Look, I don't know what
happened that day.

491
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:55,598
You know, I was on new meds.
They weren't working.

492
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:58,084
It wasn't my fault.

493
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:04,206
But don't worry. I've already been
to my doctor and changed my dosage.

494
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,686
And I already feel more even.

495
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:10,680
Billy, I need to know if I should be
worried about you.

496
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,642
You shouldn't.

497
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,409
I swear.

498
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

499
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:51,973
My God, you could eat off this skin.

500
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:56,216
Angela does her job perfectly.

501
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:59,890
What about the hairs in her mole?
Rico would've never left those there.

502
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,614
Angela had a long philosophical debate
about it...

503
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,417
...and decided the nieces would wanna
remember her exactly how she was.

504
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,375
I'd like to know the meaning of this.

505
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:13,172
Nikolai is picking me up
to go to dinner...

506
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:15,897
...and I was planning to serve him
sherry beforehand.

507
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:19,459
I wanted to use the goblets I got
from my cousin Hannah's trip to Dresden.

508
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:22,815
Now I can't because someone broke this
and hoped I wouldn't notice it.

509
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:25,299
- Which one of you did this?
- It wasn't me.

510
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,575
Well, it wasn't me.

511
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:35,219
- It was Angela.
- Oh, it was definitely Angela.

512
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:43,626
Hi.

513
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,784
David. What are you doing here?

514
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,303
I volunteer with these guys
a couple times a week.

515
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:50,581
Oh, I just started.

516
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,743
- You need some help?
- Yeah, sure.

517
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:11,062
David. David!

518
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,510
- David.
- I'm dying.

519
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:18,993
No, you can't, not before we
make love one last time.

520
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,627
Okay.

521
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,110
I thought you were gonna help.

522
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:31,113
- So how've you been?
- Good. You?

523
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:33,466
I'm okay.

524
00:38:34,076 --> 00:38:37,513
I've driven by hundreds of times,
but I never knew this place existed.

525
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:42,189
Is best restaurant in all of Los Angeles,
and not outrageous prices too.

526
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,637
- Lotte, Irina.
- What a surprise this is.

527
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,637
You usually do not come in
on Tuesday night.

528
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:54,671
- Well, l...
- Can we join you?

529
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,110
Please.

530
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,833
Maybe another time.

531
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,635
No, no, she says it's okay.

532
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:07,391
So you must be Nicky's special friend
we all keep hearing about.

533
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,479
You must be thinking of someone else.

534
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,921
No. You lost your husband.
You work for Nicky.

535
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:16,114
You used to fix dead people.

536
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:19,122
Oh, I suppose that is me.

537
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:21,999
This is Ruth.

538
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,883
So that guy I saw you with
at the club, is that a serious thing?

539
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:28,997
Eddie?

540
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:33,321
Not really. Not yet.

541
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:36,439
Those drugs I saw you taking,
is that a serious thing?

542
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:42,439
No, no. I just tried them once.
I don't think I'll be trying them again.

543
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:44,127
I'm glad to hear you say that.

544
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:46,524
You know what that shit
has done to my sister.

545
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:50,085
It can seriously fuck up your life, David.

546
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:53,325
I'd hate to see that happen.

547
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,522
It was stupid, I know. I was just...

548
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,845
You know, Rico left.
It was just Nate and me.

549
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,691
Not that it's an excuse.

550
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:08,641
What's up with that kid
I saw you with at the club?

551
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:11,128
Let's just say it was
a learning experience.

552
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:15,327
Everyone else has gone home. I don't
know what you two are waiting for.

553
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:18,048
David, this isn't one
of your regular shifts.

554
00:40:18,254 --> 00:40:22,533
Is there any special reason
you showed up here tonight?

555
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:24,805
No.

556
00:40:25,735 --> 00:40:28,011
Oh, well...

557
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,734
Well, good night, you two.

558
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:35,007
Good night.

559
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,849
You hungry?

560
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:42,253
I'm always hungry.

561
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:18,139
You fucking bitch!

562
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:23,135
I would like to tear your heart out
like you have torn out mine.

563
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:27,700
There's supposed to be a picture
of Nate peeing on a wall.

564
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:30,780
- I see it.
- I don't.

565
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:33,463
Four from the left.

566
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,464
Oh, my God.

567
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,545
What'd your mom say
when she saw that?

568
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:41,263
She was kind of horrified, I think.

569
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,266
How is your mom?

570
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:48,146
She's dating. It's weird.

571
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,147
- Why?
- Because she's my mother.

572
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,818
She's not supposed to date.

573
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:58,022
People should be with people.

574
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:03,301
Yeah, sometimes people are
just too stupid to know it.

575
00:42:09,953 --> 00:42:12,104
How's your taco?

576
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:15,708
Disgusting.

577
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:21,872
I had no idea about you and Nikolai.

578
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:27,150
For six years, every Saturday night,
I cook for him dinner.

579
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:31,236
And then he take me
to a $2.50 movie on Fairfax.

580
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:33,945
Then you come along,
and he stop calling.

581
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:39,870
I have to see every goddamn film
this Freddie Prinze Jr. Does...

582
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,547
...and what do I have to show for it?

583
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:45,438
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,552
Do you want to marry Nicky or not?

585
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,158
Marriage is the last thing
I would ever want again.

586
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:58,156
Maybe I have an amusing flirtation
with Nikolai...

587
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:00,836
...but he scares me.

588
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:03,478
Best of all, I have this job...

589
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:07,073
...something I never would have
predicted for myself.

590
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:08,876
And I love it...

591
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:11,393
...because it's mine.

592
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:22,163
And I would never do anything
to jeopardize that...

593
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,476
...which means I should probably just
finish dinner with Nikolai...

594
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,520
...and go home.

595
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:38,159
Thank you. I've had the best time
coming to this funny restaurant...

596
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:41,327
...and having you yell at me
in the bathroom.

597
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,766
Do you realize the whole time
we were going out...

598
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,929
...I was never in your bedroom at night?
- Well...

599
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:57,452
...you're here now, aren't you?

600
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:11,771
Whoa, this is not the David I know.

601
00:44:11,974 --> 00:44:13,727
Maybe this is the real me.

602
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,366
- I'm not sure we should...
- Why not?

603
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:18,692
Well, I'm kind of seeing somebody
right now.

604
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:21,046
- I don't care.
- Well, I do.

605
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:25,652
Come on, David!

606
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:29,095
Why'd you come up here,
if you weren't into something happening?

607
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:33,086
To talk to you, to see how you
were doing, to be friends.

608
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:37,656
- I don't wanna be friends. I wanna fuck.
- Well, I'm not into that.

609
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:43,052
Can't we just have sex?
It doesn't have to mean anything.

610
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,372
It's getting late.

611
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,856
I should just go.

612
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,654
You take care of yourself.

613
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:10,695
Claire, what are you doing here?

614
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:14,341
I thought David and I covered for you,
so you could be out having fun.

615
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,056
What's wrong?

616
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:21,294
Shit, there's this really big hole
in my sock.

617
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:30,262
- Maybe Gabe just wanted to be alone.
- I know.

618
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:33,981
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

619
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,459
It's just...

620
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:40,858
...he needs me.

621
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,305
For the first time in my life, I felt
important, like someone needed me...

622
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,309
...you know, like, not just like some
annoying extra person...

623
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:52,470
...just lumped in with everyone else.

624
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:55,507
No one's ever needed me.

625
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,510
I need you.

626
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,669
Right.

627
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:07,826
I felt this really intense connection.

628
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:11,754
Now it's just gone.

629
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:15,271
And I want it back.

630
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:20,305
I want him back.

631
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:23,394
Is there something wrong with me?

632
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:26,908
Is there something about me that makes
me deserve something like this?

633
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,517
Deserve what?

634
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:33,315
Just feeling really close to someone
then having them just disappear...

635
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,272
...like I mean nothing.

636
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,357
Claire, Gabe just went to visit
his father for a day.

637
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,754
I think you're talking about Dad.

638
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:51,516
Look, we never talk about him.

639
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:54,190
And that's okay, if that's what you want.

640
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:57,873
But at some point you're gonna
have to deal with how you feel.

641
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:01,313
Oh, God, can't I just get upset...

642
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:05,358
...without having to focus on
what's really making me upset?

643
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:09,403
Well, it worked for me for 34 years.

644
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:12,761
Hey.

645
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,597
Hey, who 's this?

646
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,525
Jim. Who's this?

647
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:24,925
Steve, So, what do you look like?

648
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:29,326
I'm 6'2", 190 pounds.
I'm a professional boxer.

649
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:33,602
- Yeah? What's your dick like?
- Nine and a half inches, uncut.

650
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,325
- So, what are you looking for?
- A nasty top to fuck my brains out,

651
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,806
Found him. Now, get on your knees
and suck my cock, boy.

652
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:44,845
Oh, fuck, Yes, sir, Oh, yes,

653
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:47,645
I don 't care what time it is,
I need to be with someone,

654
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:50,611
Someone, that's comforting.

655
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:53,486
Okay, I wanna talk to you.

656
00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:57,525
If this is about Billy, I can't.

657
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:02,012
I've done nothing but talk about Billy
for two days.

658
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:09,488
Well, what's happening with him?

659
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:15,092
Look...

660
00:48:18,137 --> 00:48:21,368
...I know this is really hard for you.

661
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:25,212
I've had some time to calm down
about the picture...

662
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:29,458
...so you can just spill your guts
to me, okay?

663
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,698
I promise not to make it about me.

664
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,293
I'm too tired.

665
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:43,171
You know what?

666
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,493
I love you, and I need you.

667
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:53,102
And it's okay for you to need me too.
I want you to need me.

668
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm doing the best I can.

669
00:49:25,308 --> 00:49:27,903
Rough night, stud?

670
00:49:28,749 --> 00:49:31,309
You're fired.

671
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,711
Fuck.

672
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:43,021
Yoo-hoo, Brenda!

673
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:46,065
Brenda, I know you're home.
Your car's out front.

674
00:49:46,272 --> 00:49:50,710
I don't know what's so strange about
a spontaneous brunch. I think it's fun.

675
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:53,383
It's weird.

676
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,223
You don't do things like this.

677
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:59,232
You pay people to do things like this.

678
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:01,426
- Oh, hello, Nate.
- Hey.

679
00:50:01,635 --> 00:50:04,274
Now I see why you're so upset
that I'm here.

680
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:09,826
My mother's come over to see
if I talked Billy into committing himself.

681
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:14,229
She just loves saying that. It makes her
father and I sound more like monsters.

682
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:16,587
Well, I didn't do it, and I'm not going to.

683
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:19,113
Goddamn it!

684
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:24,397
I asked for chives,
and they give me this veggie crap.

685
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,910
Brenda...

686
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,596
...there's something
you don't know about Billy.

687
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:39,036
Oh, here we go.

688
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:45,835
You know when you were
in Europe that summer?

689
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:50,321
Billy didn't try to kill himself.

690
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,035
What?

691
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:57,123
Your father and I had gotten back from
a conference to find our house on fire.

692
00:50:57,364 --> 00:50:59,320
It started right below the family room.

693
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,595
Remember, we had it redone
when you were away?

694
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:04,365
Yeah, but Billy was...

695
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:07,319
I went to visit him in the hospital.
He was there all summer.

696
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:10,997
Your father and I put him there.
We had no choice.

697
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:14,444
That fire wasn't accidental, Brenda.
He was making a bomb.

698
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:18,561
This is getting really fucking desperate.
What, now Billy's the Unabomber?

699
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:23,644
He had written things. Ugly, violent
things about your father and me...

700
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:27,364
...about you. He was dangerous.

701
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:32,922
You let me believe for all these years
that Billy tried to kill himself.

702
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:37,085
We were only trying
to protect you, honey.

703
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:41,732
Get out of my house.

704
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:45,369
Get out of my house,
you fucking lunatic!

705
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:52,650
- It's a wonder I'm even alive.
- Hello?

706
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:56,767
- You're like fucking Medea!
- Dave, this is a really bad time.

707
00:51:57,975 --> 00:52:00,933
You know what the really
sick thing is, Mother?

708
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,974
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

709
00:52:05,216 --> 00:52:06,774
Brenda.

710
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:09,252
- Brenda, hang on.
- I'll call you later, Nate...

711
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:11,175
...when that asshole's out of my house.

712
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:13,607
Dave, I gotta go.

713
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:17,376
What, you fired her already?

714
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:19,648
Oh, for chrissake.

715
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:22,973
You should've lined up somebody.
Why are you whispering?

716
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:26,450
I'm hiding up here
until she finishes Mrs. Sarno.

717
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,260
So which of those other people
did you like best?

718
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,610
Look, let's not make
any quick decisions.

719
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,171
I guess I could probably live
with the panic-attack guy.

720
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:37,178
I've got a better idea,

721
00:52:40,662 --> 00:52:42,254
Hey, Rico.

722
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:44,416
Bad time?

723
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,500
No, everyone's at lunch
except me and Pam.

724
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,536
You're one of the Fishers, aren't you?

725
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,456
Cigarette break.
But I gotta be back in 10...

726
00:52:57,665 --> 00:53:00,941
...because I told Gilardi I'd have
this one done when he got back.

727
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:06,135
The subscriber you've called
is outside the service...

728
00:53:44,193 --> 00:53:46,627
Oh, great. Fucking hell.

729
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:52,188
Here, let me help you.

730
00:53:55,995 --> 00:53:57,633
Shit.

731
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:03,268
I don't know why I brought
so much stuff here.

732
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:06,275
I guess I'm just a nester.

733
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:13,030
I should've told you
that I broke the goblet.

734
00:54:13,278 --> 00:54:18,353
- It was a gift from my cousin.
- Yeah, trip to Dresden. I heard.

735
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:22,635
I don't know why I didn't just tell you.

736
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,077
It's totally unlike me.
I usually just say whatever I'm thinking.

737
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,111
I noticed.

738
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,273
But I saw that broken glass...

739
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:37,600
...and I just was overcome
with this feeling that it was...

740
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:41,079
...better to just ignore it...

741
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:46,278
...just pretend that it didn't happen.
I get that feeling...

742
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,714
...from all of you here.

743
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:52,002
Everyone is so fragile...

744
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,481
...and can't bear to hear anything.

745
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,358
Is that everything?

746
00:54:57,566 --> 00:55:01,844
I mean, all I did was try
to fix David up with this guy...

747
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:04,760
...and I thought he was gonna kill me.
I never met anyone...

748
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:08,198
...who was so uptight about being gay.

749
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,964
Thanks.

750
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,239
You know something?

751
00:55:20,689 --> 00:55:25,684
I never worked in a funeral home
that was this depressing.

752
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:36,207
Tell me you're happier here, and I'll go.

753
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:41,009
It's not perfect. These body farms
are a fucking assembly line.

754
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,807
And I've got like 12 idiots
breathing down my neck.

755
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,654
At Fisher & Sons you only get
two of those at the most.

756
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:48,606
And Gilardi lied to me.

757
00:55:48,814 --> 00:55:51,613
My hours are nothing
like he said they'd be.

758
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,765
And the work here is not even
as challenging, you know?

759
00:55:57,616 --> 00:55:59,493
Nate...

760
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:05,175
...it was Kroehner who burned down
the house across the street.

761
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:09,697
Gilardi's told people that he's not done
trying to drive you guys out of business.

762
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:12,611
Does that mean it doesn't make sense
for you to come back?

763
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:15,538
No, but if I do, you have to match
what I'm making here...

764
00:56:15,779 --> 00:56:18,452
...plus guarantee me flexible hours
for picking up Julio...

765
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:20,616
...and helping when the baby comes.
- Done.

766
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,249
And if I do decide to come back...

767
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,213
...it's not for good.

768
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:31,418
I'm never gonna become a partner, am I?

769
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:35,462
I can't offer you that...

770
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:39,656
...unless you wanna marry Claire.

771
00:56:41,503 --> 00:56:43,460
No, thank you.

772
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:47,015
Okay, I can start in a couple of days.

773
00:56:47,264 --> 00:56:51,383
Thank you. That makes me very happy,
and it will make David very happy.

774
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:57,019
Yeah. Hey, I heard there's some picture
of you in a gallery peeing.

775
00:56:57,226 --> 00:56:59,262
Is that true?

776
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:03,982
I just wanted to get Gabe's father's
number, so I could talk to him.

777
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:07,698
Well, why would Gabe's stepfather
know where Gabe was?

778
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:10,985
No, his father, the one
who lives in Barstow.

779
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,621
Yeah, Gabe's father died
when he was 4.

780
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,986
Yeah.

781
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,029
Oh, if you should run into Gabe...

782
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:27,588
...would you tell him I really don't
appreciate his staying out all night?

783
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:36,703
So that's... That's it, I guess,

784
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:40,431
Goodbye, Claire,

785
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:42,670
Mrs. Dimas?

786
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:46,391
Mrs. Dimas? Mrs. Dimas?

787
00:57:49,684 --> 00:58:23,639
