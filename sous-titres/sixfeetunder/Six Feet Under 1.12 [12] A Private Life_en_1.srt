1
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,067
I just remembered, I owe you money.

2
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,936
Well, thank you for sparing me
the awkward confrontation.

3
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:48,617
- Are you starting to feel exploited?
- Yeah, but in a good way.

4
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,292
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

5
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:57,937
- Are you looking at my balance?
- It's okay. Size isn't everything.

6
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,097
Funny.

7
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,970
So does bad music make people deaf...

8
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,608
...or do deaf people have
really bad taste in music?

9
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,252
Well, there is Beethoven.

10
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,727
- Come on, let's go.
- What the fuck is that shit?

11
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:11,965
- Hurry.
- My receipt.

12
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,013
- Come on, that's all right, just...
- Look, it's all yours.

13
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,763
Do you think you can do
that kind of offensive shit in public?

14
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:22,487
- We're sorry, man, we didn't...
- Oh, he's sorry, huh?

15
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,960
Look, Pete, let's go.

16
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,927
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you!

17
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,160
Fuck! Run!

18
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,278
Help!

19
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,516
The other one got away.

20
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,915
Fucking freak!

21
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,953
Fucking pervert!
Read a Bible, you pervert!

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,677
Johnny, come on. Come on,
let's go. Come on.

23
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,903
Okay, here we go with Uncle Nate.

24
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,863
- You got him?
- Just about.

25
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,698
- Put your hand under there. There we go.
- All right, I got him. I got him.

26
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,297
Okay, but don't hold him
like he's a football.

27
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,778
It's more like you're carrying
a watermelon.

28
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,102
- All right.
- See?

29
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,183
- Okay.
- Adjust, adjust, adjust. There you go.

30
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,462
Hey, there, little guy.
Who looks just like his daddy, huh?

31
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:36,779
When a baby's born
it always looks more like its father...

32
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,575
...which is nature's way
of establishing paternity.

33
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,379
We're hoping he grows out of it.

34
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:46,448
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he will.
Oh, yes, yes.

35
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,814
David, come meet Augusto.

36
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:52,208
I just have to get Mr. Perlmutter
dressed for his viewing.

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,451
David, please, come take
one look at him.

38
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,210
Nate was an extremely gassy baby,
always crying.

39
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,161
David, on the other hand,
hardly ever made a peep.

40
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:07,563
When are you guys gonna grow up
and make this woman a grandmommy?

41
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:15,241
Well, certainly not until after
Mr. Perlmutter's got some clothes on.

42
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:35,031
You know, it's kind of funny,
me coming back to school in a hearse.

43
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,513
It's hilarious.

44
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,273
This sucks.

45
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:45,672
Does everybody know?

46
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,342
I don't know. Who'd you tell?

47
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:54,149
No, I mean, like, did they make
an announcement or something?

48
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:58,468
Don't you think you would've gotten,
like, a couple of cards if they had?

49
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,341
No.

50
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:03,665
It's not cool to OD.
Freaks people out.

51
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,586
Who gives a fuck what
these people think?

52
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:09,459
Everyone's too obsessed with
what people think about them...

53
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,417
...to think about anyone else.

54
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,456
You're a freak.

55
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,892
Yeah, well, so are you.

56
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:23,329
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

57
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,212
- That's the guy who OD'd.
- Yeah, it is.

58
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,496
What the fuck are you looking at?

59
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,721
What, you called me over here to show
me a picture of you and the gravedigger?

60
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,327
I need your key back,
because you've crossed a line...

61
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:45,807
...and I don't feel like
I can trust you anymore.

62
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,917
- You think I took that picture?
- I will not play this game with you!

63
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,756
I won't deal with you
when you're off your meds...

64
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:59,916
...because I don't even know
who you are.

65
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,514
For someone with so much animosity
towards the psychiatric profession...

66
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:05,634
...you sure love to push pharmaceuticals.

67
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:08,595
Makes sense, as you're no stranger
to medication yourself.

68
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,634
You're sick, Billy. You have to
stay on your medication...

69
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,638
...or you get scary, okay?

70
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,913
You're not scared of me.

71
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,473
I'd never hurt you. You're the most
important person in my life.

72
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:25,469
Yeah, well, did you ever stop to think
that maybe that's fucked up?

73
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:33,866
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Just...

74
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,984
Just take the meds.

75
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,978
Okay. I promise.

76
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,298
Now give me the key.

77
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,815
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda.

78
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,494
I just... I just told you I'd take
the medication!

79
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:58,651
Jesus Christ, you don't have to be such
a bitch! When did you turn into Mom?

80
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,297
Okay. I don't give a shit.
You want your fucking key?

81
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,296
Great. Here, take all the fucking keys.

82
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:10,249
I could have an extra copy at home.

83
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,686
Yeah, I could always change the locks.

84
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:16,086
Do you know how easy it would be
to break into this place?

85
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,282
I'd like you to go now.

86
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:24,644
Get your wet suit, clothing, robes.
Take them.

87
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,238
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda!

88
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:37,440
I told you I would take
the medication, please.

89
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:43,998
You have to take care of yourself now.
I can't do it, not anymore.

90
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:46,637
Please, Brenda, you're the only person
I can talk to.

91
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,679
You're the only one that hears me.

92
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:52,635
Billy, you have to get a life
of your own, okay?

93
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,549
Please.

94
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,787
You probably read about it.
It was on the news...

95
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,027
...what happened to Marc.

96
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,186
Yes.

97
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:25,826
The coroner still has his...
They still have him.

98
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:31,063
In situations like this,
when there's been violence...

99
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:34,540
...the family may prefer
a closed casket.

100
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:38,172
- No.
- Honey, I think he looks pretty bad.

101
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,736
I have to see him.

102
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,130
I brought some pictures,
so you'll know what he looks like.

103
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:57,212
Wasn't he such a beautiful boy?

104
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,727
Why does a thing like this happen?

105
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:08,559
Come on, now, we all know
why this happened.

106
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,920
That is not a reason.

107
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,837
It's the only reason.

108
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,117
If he wasn't...

109
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:23,522
He'd be alive today.

110
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:27,274
You know, I was always
so worried about AIDS.

111
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:31,833
I never even thought that just being
out on the street...

112
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,951
What is wrong with people?

113
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,559
Could've told him this happens.

114
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,115
I would've too if he'd ever just
talked to us about it, ever come out...

115
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:45,629
...and told us what he was.
- Well, what do you expect, Marcus?

116
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,712
You can't even say it.

117
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,017
Hey, Dave.

118
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,581
I'll be right with you.

119
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:17,777
Okay, okay.

120
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:22,530
- Jesus.
- Oh, boy.

121
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:23,815
Okay, Cinderella...

122
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,170
...we're gonna have to work overtime
to get you ready for the ball...

123
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,768
...because men don't make passes
at girls with big gashes.

124
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:36,004
That was funny, right?
Daddy's Mr. Funnyman.

125
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:40,810
Let me just run Augusto upstairs,
and I'll be right back down to do him.

126
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:45,125
I can handle this, Federico. Why don't
you take the rest of the day off?

127
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,168
That's a pretty tough job, Dave.

128
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,928
The skull's all shattered up there.

129
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,404
You might have to rebuild
the tissue on his cheek.

130
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,327
I can do it.

131
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,516
Hey, thanks, man.

132
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,115
I'm so damn tired I can barely
see straight.

133
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:04,119
- Get some rest.
- You bet. Good luck.

134
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:08,952
Let's go, buddy. Let's go, buddy.
Let's go.

135
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:14,749
And I told him not to come around
for a while.

136
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,196
- That's it?
- Oh, what else could I do, Nate?

137
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:22,389
You could talk to the police.
You could get a restraining order.

138
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:26,469
I don't need you to tell me how to handle
this. That is so arrogant and patronizing.

139
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,393
I just need you to listen to me.

140
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:31,585
You can't just wait for the next
fucked-up thing Billy does.

141
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:34,260
You need to do something now.

142
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,988
Do you think that was easy for me,
just cutting him off like that?

143
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,982
Do you even comprehend
what it's like...

144
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,987
...to be responsible
for someone your whole life?

145
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:47,465
Do you even get the concept
of loving somebody that much?

146
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,103
Yes, I get that concept.

147
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:57,582
He's sick.

148
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,172
He's not just sick, he's dangerous.

149
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:05,293
He built a bomb. He broke into our hotel
room and took pictures of us in bed.

150
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,889
- What's he gonna do next time?
- I took his key away from him.

151
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,726
Yeah, well, he didn't have a key
in Vegas. That didn't keep him out.

152
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,174
I'm sorry. I know you don't trust
your parents...

153
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:20,253
...but I really think they're right on this.
He needs to be somewhere.

154
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:30,920
This is so not how I need you
to be right now.

155
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:39,760
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna discuss this with you.

156
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:43,924
In fact, you know what?
Why don't we just take some time off?

157
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,638
You dump Billy,
so now you're gonna dump me?

158
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:49,442
Don't you fucking analyze me!

159
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:53,710
You might as well throw away your key,
because I changed the lock.

160
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,546
Where's Claire?

161
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:13,541
Well, she claims to be at a movie,
but what do I know?

162
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:17,027
Nobody ever tells me
what's really going on.

163
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,660
That boy who got beat up
on the street...

164
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,659
...was he doing something?

165
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,334
He was getting cash.
Didn't you read the paper?

166
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,820
Yes, I just thought you might
know more about it.

167
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,100
Do you like the hen?

168
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:44,652
Yeah, very much.
What did you stuff it with?

169
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,691
Chestnuts, bread crumbs, celery.

170
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,296
Do you wanna know
all the ingredients?

171
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:53,808
No, thanks.

172
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,846
Are you going out tonight?

173
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,488
No, not tonight.

174
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:03,611
Are you?

175
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,805
Me? No.

176
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,839
But, you know...

177
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,723
...sometimes I do see Hiram
on occasion.

178
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,566
And I know you don't like that...

179
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:22,483
...but I also know you love me
no matter who I see in my private life.

180
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,996
Well, that's good, Mom.

181
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,510
Why'd you drop jazz vocals
sophomore year?

182
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,186
Because the music teacher
was a crackhead.

183
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,029
I'm serious, Claire.

184
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:52,704
So am I. He got busted and fired,
and then jazz vocals was discontinued.

185
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,267
Do your homework.

186
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,580
What happened
with the literary magazine?

187
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,218
Censorship. I wrote this totally,
like, harmless...

188
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:09,625
...like, cartoon story about this girl
who can make people's heads explode...

189
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,295
...and apparently it was
too disturbing to publish.

190
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,457
The debate team?

191
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:17,898
They debated what the prom theme
should be.

192
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:22,972
I mean, God, the people in this school,
they have the mentality of teenagers.

193
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:25,370
- You are a teenager.
- Yes...

194
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,656
...but I actually think about things
beside trying to figure out...

195
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:32,055
...how to puke after lunch
without anyone noticing.

196
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,569
So, what do you do for fun?

197
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:40,406
I don't know. What do you do for fun?

198
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:46,608
I go bowling with my friends.
I take hikes with my girlfriend.

199
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,769
- I bake.
- You bake?

200
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,809
Your turn.

201
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,963
I read.

202
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:01,206
I go online and make up
freaky cyber identities.

203
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,203
You know, sometimes
I'm a Scientologist.

204
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,360
Sometimes I'm a young, Christian wife.

205
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:11,553
What about friendships that are
based on the truth? Any of those?

206
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,988
Sometimes I hang out with
Parker McKenna. I kind of like her...

207
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,156
...even though she's pretty much
a split-personality freak.

208
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:26,026
Dating anyone?

209
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:30,423
Dating? You mean, like,
getting drunk and screwing?

210
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:35,947
- Lf that's what it is.
- Yeah, that's what it is. No, I'm not.

211
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,863
Keith, got a minute?

212
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:42,788
Yeah, sure. What's up?

213
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:46,378
I wanna put you on security
for the Marc Foster funeral on Thursday.

214
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,339
Okay, why?

215
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:50,377
The wackos turn out for these things.

216
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:53,374
- Why me?
- Come on, Keith.

217
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:55,779
You're a good, smart cop,
and you use your head...

218
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,702
...before you use your gun, all right?

219
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:03,140
So it has nothing to do with the fact
that I'm gay, right?

220
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,735
What do you wanna do,
sue me for discrimination...

221
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,612
...or show up and protect
this kid's family?

222
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:22,053
Oh, God, I look like something
Chef Boyardee makes.

223
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,165
So you never told your parents
you were gay either?

224
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:27,249
Oh, please, they knew.

225
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:31,443
I just didn't want my dad making me
feel guilty about it all the time.

226
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,164
Maybe he could've accepted it
if you'd given him a chance.

227
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:39,565
You heard him.
He thinks it's my fault I'm dead.

228
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,758
That's not what he was saying.
He was saying it's a sick world.

229
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,036
- I'm the one who was sick.
- Shut up.

230
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:50,758
So I liked men.
I never should've given in to it.

231
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,156
It's not what God intended.

232
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:56,557
I could've had a family and a normal life.
You could've too.

233
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,155
That life would've been a lie and
unfair to your wife and children...

234
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,235
...who would've hated you.

235
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:05,395
Not if I never looked back.

236
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,547
Not if I had faith.

237
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:11,030
God challenges us like this,
so we'll choose good...

238
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:14,424
...so we'll triumph over evil.

239
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:16,987
Only thing is, so few of us do.

240
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,786
It's not a choice.
God already made the choice for you.

241
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,904
That's just liberal propaganda
to justify your own depravity, Jim.

242
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:35,140
No matter how nice you fix me up,
I'm still going to hell, and you know it...

243
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:38,301
...because you're going there too.

244
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:57,005
Brenda, pick up the phone.

245
00:18:57,216 --> 00:19:00,366
Don't just lay there and say, "Fuck you."

246
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,923
Okay, I'm sorry I pissed you off.
I know you're under a lot of pressure...

247
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,804
...but so am I.

248
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,002
So let's talk about it, okay?

249
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,280
Call me.

250
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,356
Hey.

251
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:26,674
Yes, this is Fisher & Sons.
Can I help you?

252
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,758
I'm terribly sorry.

253
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:33,913
Yes, we can pick up the body...
The deceased.

254
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:36,156
Which morgue?

255
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,157
A residence, okay.
What's the address?

256
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:51,145
- Robbie?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did my tree hit you?

257
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:54,625
- Do you have a moment?
- Well, I don't know, Ruth.

258
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,505
I got a whole big bunch of ferns
out back I gotta cut up...

259
00:19:57,712 --> 00:20:01,419
...so you can make some more of those
beautiful, one-of-a-kind arrangements.

260
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,379
How did you tell your parents
you were...

261
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,306
Into flowers?

262
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:12,534
Well, it was obvious from the beginning.
My first word was "perennial."

263
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:17,741
How did you tell them you were gay?

264
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,974
What makes you think I am gay?

265
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,173
Just because I have
a refined aesthetic...

266
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:24,941
...you make assumptions
about my personal life?

267
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:27,769
I'm so sorry. You're not gay?

268
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,328
Yes, I'm gay.

269
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,771
But I certainly don't see
how that's any of your business.

270
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:36,576
Do I ask you about
your intimate sexual life...

271
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:40,450
...even though it is on full display
in the workplace? No, I do not.

272
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:44,083
I tolerate the repercussions,
but I don't pry.

273
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,489
I'm sorry. I'm asking because my son...

274
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:53,242
Oh, dear Lord, save it for Geraldo.

275
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,486
Someone in the family shows signs
of homosexuality...

276
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,566
...and suddenly it's a national crisis.
Coming out to my parents.

277
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:06,600
Honestly, why don't you tell me the most
horrible moment from your intimate past?

278
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:12,872
- It was horrible?
- It's none of your business.

279
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:16,198
I'm sorry I offended you, Robbie.

280
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:26,306
That is a shitty place for the lily.

281
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:34,427
Mr. Jacoby?

282
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,855
Oh, fuck.

283
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:37,459
Jesus, Billy, you fucking psycho.

284
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,409
Did I get you?

285
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:09,082
Come on, man, it's paint.
Why aren't you laughing?

286
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,610
I don't think it's funny.

287
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,488
Oh, no, it's just plain fun.

288
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,284
You know, if you mix up the letters
in "funeral," you get "real fun."

289
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,758
How much do you love that?

290
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:25,721
You stay away from my sister.
She's just a kid.

291
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,956
Now, that's kind of ironic,
don't you think? You telling me that.

292
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:37,550
What'd they tell you?

293
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,152
They tell you I made a bomb?

294
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,788
They tell you who it was for?

295
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,145
I know you wrote things
about your family.

296
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,544
Liar!

297
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:57,032
Don't fucking lie to me.

298
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:01,664
He thought he was such a genius,
everybody thought.

299
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:04,464
He even had Brenda fooled,
which blows my mind.

300
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,229
Well, okay, she was young.

301
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:10,904
- Are you talking about Dr. Feinberg?
- No, Trevor, you fucking moron.

302
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:15,338
Trevor. Perfect fucking Trevor.

303
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,461
He thought he was the king of Brenda,
which is such adolescent shit...

304
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:23,450
...as if you could know somebody for a
few months and replace their whole life.

305
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:26,016
Their family.

306
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,492
Brenda's not allowed to love anyone
as much as she loves you?

307
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,809
Able.

308
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:34,933
She's not able.

309
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,775
You know what? You're right.

310
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:46,251
Bren never even told me about Trevor.
She doesn't trust me.

311
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:48,044
You don't get to call her that.

312
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,004
You call her Brenda.

313
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:53,248
You know, she broke up with me today.

314
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,806
- Really?
- Yeah. Took away my key.

315
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:18,835
Well, it's probably for the best.

316
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:26,236
You and Brenda was never a good idea.

317
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:30,515
Yeah, tell me about it.

318
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:35,311
Listen, I gotta go, so you take care.

319
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,775
Hey.

320
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:56,539
Hey.

321
00:26:57,345 --> 00:27:01,302
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, just...

322
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,738
...give me a second to recover.

323
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:07,011
Still bad, huh?

324
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:12,213
It's just fucking tiring
trying to act normal all day.

325
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,693
I know what you mean.

326
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:21,164
So, what's the stupidest thing
anyone's said to you today?

327
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:27,923
Packy Walker told me that he once
had to get his stomach pumped...

328
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:31,806
...because he ate his dog's
deworming pills.

329
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,763
He thought they were ludes.

330
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:39,198
Well, isn't it comforting to know
that being miserable...

331
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,160
...is still better than being an idiot?

332
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,466
All right.

333
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:12,788
You wanna hear the most horrible
moment from my intimate past?

334
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:16,508
No, sister, I do not.

335
00:28:16,753 --> 00:28:20,188
I was married to my husband
for 30 years.

336
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:25,861
I never slept with another man until I
started having sex with my hairdresser.

337
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:38,899
And the first time my hairdresser
friend and I had intercourse...

338
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:42,891
...he asked me to pleasure
myself, so he would know...

339
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:46,491
...you know, how I did that.

340
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:51,853
And I couldn't.

341
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:57,050
Because I had never pleasured
myself in my life.

342
00:28:57,577 --> 00:29:00,534
I was 52 years old.

343
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:04,572
And I had to learn how to...

344
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:06,531
Masturbate.

345
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,808
From a hairdresser.

346
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:12,649
Oh, my.

347
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,686
Oh, my.

348
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:23,166
Well, Ruth, thank you for sharing that.

349
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:27,677
But I'm still not gonna tell you
about coming out to my parents.

350
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:32,115
- Why not?
- Because I never did, cupcake.

351
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,877
My daddy would've never spoken
another word to me...

352
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:38,675
...and my mother would've just gone
insane, right there on the spot.

353
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,429
How do you know?

354
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,751
A child knows what his parents
need him to be.

355
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:49,268
My mother is one of those women that
never did anything but raise children.

356
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:52,273
So, if you came out wrong,
like the opposite...

357
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:55,352
...of what she was trying to make
you into, then, you know...

358
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,431
...her whole life is a failure.

359
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:02,426
I'm not like that.

360
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,939
Did he ever actually threaten you?

361
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:13,944
Telling the new boyfriend you wanted
the old boyfriend dead...

362
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,820
...while you're playing with a knife.
Yeah, that seems like a threat to me.

363
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:29,734
How come you never told me
about Trevor?

364
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,134
It's such ancient history.

365
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,852
You said you'd never been
serious about anyone.

366
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:37,810
I was 18.

367
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,044
- Did you love him?
- Yes.

368
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:44,609
So, what happened?

369
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:47,451
Billy got sick.

370
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:49,643
Trevor went to Yale without me.

371
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:52,604
Billy got rid of him
because he was jealous.

372
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,161
Everyone was jealous of Trevor.
He was ridiculously gifted...

373
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,598
...one of those people everybody
secretly hates...

374
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:04,761
...because he's good at everything
and always gets what he wants.

375
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:09,634
- Well, he didn't get you.
- Oh, please. He could do better.

376
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:14,836
He did, actually. The woman he married
won the National Book Award last year.

377
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,278
You know, you're
ridiculously gifted too.

378
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,476
You could be one of those people
who has everything.

379
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:36,543
If you don't wanna deal with this,
I might have to wanna call your parents.

380
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:38,903
Well, you might have to wanna call
my parents...

381
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,784
...but unfortunately, they're
in South Africa at the moment.

382
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:44,067
I have absolutely no idea
how to contact them.

383
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,659
Would you stop fucking around?

384
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:49,457
I love you, and I'm sure
whatever you feel about me...

385
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,420
...you don't wanna see me dead.

386
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:01,579
Are you okay?

387
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,218
No.

388
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:08,374
Do you want me to take you
to a doctor?

389
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,375
What, now you think I'm crazy too?

390
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,574
No, no.

391
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:20,413
Goddamn it, why are you
shutting me out?

392
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:24,290
I just wanna be alone, okay?

393
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:30,044
I just wanna go to sleep.

394
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,249
Well, good night.

395
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:26,142
Why didn't you tell me about
your relationship with Gabriel Dimas?

396
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:31,907
I guess I just wasn't in the mood
for a lecture on inappropriate friends.

397
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,739
What makes you think I'd do that?

398
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:37,938
Well, some people don't think
he's the greatest influence.

399
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:40,612
And what do you think?

400
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:44,738
I think that I'm as much of an influence
on him as he is on me...

401
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:48,331
...so it's not like it only goes one way.

402
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:49,939
Right.

403
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,212
Relating to another person is a way
that we relate to a part of ourselves.

404
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:02,051
It's like, he's, like, an extreme version
of me, you know?

405
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:04,007
I can see that.

406
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:10,321
But what he's going through,
it's so much more.

407
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,523
But I understand, you know?

408
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:19,087
Feeling like you've got this shadow
over you all the time.

409
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:23,202
What's your shadow?

410
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,197
Death, I guess.

411
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:35,395
Death and silence.

412
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,232
Is that crazy?

413
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:40,993
What's the silence?

414
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,592
I don't know.
It's, like, sadness...

415
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:52,983
...or fear, maybe.

416
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:55,903
It's, like, you know, everybody's
so scared...

417
00:34:56,114 --> 00:34:58,946
...that they're gonna say
the wrong thing...

418
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:02,224
...because, like, you know,
when you bury someone...

419
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:05,502
...that's, like, the most sensitive time
in a person's life.

420
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,099
So it's, like, my family,
they're just so careful.

421
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:12,663
It's like they almost become invisible.

422
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:18,055
That was heavy.

423
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:28,859
What's going on?

424
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:32,975
Nothing. I'm just being a freak.

425
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:37,850
You don't have to be afraid
that you'll say the wrong thing.

426
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:41,048
That's just it. I'm not.

427
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:45,483
I mean, I do say the wrong thing.

428
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:48,685
But, it's, like, this is gonna
sound stupid...

429
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,685
...but, like, I talk so much shit
all the time, you know.

430
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:58,158
And that's just another way
to not say...

431
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,838
Whatever.

432
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,717
To not say what?

433
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,756
I'm not here for the school
or for your mom.

434
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,642
I'm just here for you.

435
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:22,230
This is confidential, right?

436
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:35,753
Gabe didn't OD by accident.

437
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:39,545
He did it on purpose, I think.

438
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:43,068
Well, most ODs aren't really
just accidents.

439
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,659
Right, so, what can I do
as the friend of a person...

440
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,462
...who would do something like that?

441
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,981
Like, I know all the "I can't save him"
stuff, and I went to the websites.

442
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:59,135
And it's all, like, what you can't do.
So, what can I do?

443
00:36:59,665 --> 00:37:02,303
Try not to make yourself invisible.

444
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:04,255
This isn't about me.

445
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,898
That's not a very good start, is it?

446
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:20,328
At least my tie can be straight, right?

447
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,245
You should've left me
the way I was.

448
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:27,764
Let the world see me
for who I really am...

449
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:29,725
...an abomination of nature.

450
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:32,008
Shut up.

451
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:34,846
Who you are is nothing
to be ashamed of.

452
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,405
That's a little hard to buy,
coming from somebody...

453
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,443
...who cruises for dick on the Internet
and has unsafe sex with prostitutes.

454
00:37:42,648 --> 00:37:44,842
They made a shrine at the place
where you died...

455
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:48,594
...with pictures of you and flowers.

456
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,558
People go there and hold candles
in your honor.

457
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:55,039
- What people?
- Your friends, your community.

458
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,437
Bleeding-heart faggots
with nothing better to do.

459
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,350
Guys who fucked me when they were
drunk and then never called me back.

460
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,113
There are people who love you.

461
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,316
But not as many as hate me...

462
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,112
...and you.

463
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,431
Nice job.

464
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,829
Man, that is the best work
you've ever done, David.

465
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:28,309
- Thanks.
- Nice, very nice.

466
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:37,421
Hey, there's, like, 200 homos
outside. Oh, shit.

467
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:40,423
Already? It's only a quarter of.

468
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:44,821
You'd think the family wouldn't want
all of that coming in here, you know?

469
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,614
All of what?

470
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:50,820
There's this one guy,
he's dressed like Jackie Kennedy.

471
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:54,574
You think this guy's mother
really needs to see that today?

472
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,534
How'd you get those abrasions
on his cheek so smooth-looking?

473
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,172
I used diaper rash cream.
You left some.

474
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,685
You know, Rico, I'm a homo.

475
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:16,882
I may not dress like Jackie Kennedy,
but I have sex with men.

476
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:30,318
Don't... Don't talk to me
about that. All right?

477
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:34,193
Why should I hide it from you? You
change your baby's diaper in my house.

478
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:37,195
You show me a videotape
of your wife giving birth.

479
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:39,915
Where I come from...

480
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:44,112
...if men need to do that sometimes...

481
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,878
...they don't talk about it.

482
00:39:47,238 --> 00:39:49,387
They don't leave their families.
They're men.

483
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,866
I am a man!

484
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:02,785
So I took the height of tree A and
divided it by the length of shadow B.

485
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:07,347
So do you see how I got
to tangent C?

486
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,701
Since when were you such a trig bitch?

487
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:15,104
Don't get me wrong.
I know it's totally pointless.

488
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:18,901
Just somehow, teaching you
makes it seem more interesting.

489
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:21,538
It must be the power.

490
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:27,657
Well, you are...

491
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:31,853
...a very stimulating teacher.

492
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,653
I love your grasp of the material.

493
00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:43,284
Well, maybe we should grasp
the next one.

494
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:45,645
Which one?

495
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:48,649
Number five.

496
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:51,728
Come on.

497
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:06,282
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

498
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:08,875
Allergies.

499
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:11,519
Hey, come on.

500
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:18,237
I'm scared.

501
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,714
It's okay.

502
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,912
I'm scared too.

503
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,427
I'm scared you're gonna disappear.

504
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,025
I'm not gonna disappear.

505
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:44,626
What are you scared of?

506
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,947
I'm scared I'm not gonna finish
my math homework.

507
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:56,822
Hey, I told you.

508
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:05,333
I'm scared that you...

509
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:06,976
...are too good for me.

510
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:11,010
Oh, you're crazy.

511
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:22,654
I finally find a woman I wanna commit to,
and she makes it totally impossible.

512
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:25,733
You think that's a coincidence?

513
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:28,448
What is that supposed to mean?

514
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:32,201
Maybe if she made it easier,
you wouldn't be so eager.

515
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,199
I need more garlic.

516
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,489
You've always been bored
with the girls you could have...

517
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:44,407
...and fascinated with
the ones you couldn't.

518
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:48,879
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?

519
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:01,274
Your brother's gay, isn't he?

520
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,831
I think that's a question for him.

521
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,598
Has he told you?

522
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:11,711
No, he has not told me.

523
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,749
But it's obvious. Everyone knows.

524
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:18,384
Am I supposed to say something?
I tried to discuss it. He wouldn't let me.

525
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,345
I guess he doesn't wanna talk about it.

526
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:22,702
It's not good for him
to skulk around like that.

527
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:24,823
He's very tense. It's not good for him.

528
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:27,624
- Breathe, Mom.
- I know how to breathe!

529
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:32,379
I don't appreciate you blaming me for
all your problems, thank you very much.

530
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:36,975
Your carrots are burning.

531
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,014
Haven 't you seen a little girl
called Bunny?

532
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:43,813
- About your age,
- No,

533
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,900
- A new girl,
- No,

534
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:47,501
With a dress, just like yours,

535
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:51,376
Look, there's no point
in questioning the children,

536
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,453
What are you doing here?

537
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,366
I know what to do.

538
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:15,410
I know how to fix it.

539
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,164
Yeah? Fix what?

540
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,367
Oh, it was a big mistake.

541
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:24,363
But I'm gonna fix it, okay?

542
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:27,680
Oh, my God, Billy, what have you...?

543
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:32,683
- Did you hurt him?
- No, no, no, I fixed it.

544
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:35,397
- Oh, God.
- See, I can't be him anymore.

545
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:38,241
He's somebody else now.
I did it for you.

546
00:44:38,482 --> 00:44:40,472
Now we can bury him.
And the best part is...

547
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:43,274
...now the nurse won't
ever be able to find him.

548
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,276
You've lost a lot of blood.

549
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:48,868
- Let me get a towel.
- We just have to get yours now.

550
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:54,190
This way, you'll be safe from her too
for the first time.

551
00:44:54,396 --> 00:44:56,909
Then we can bury them,
and you and I can be new people.

552
00:44:57,115 --> 00:45:00,264
And we can forget about everything
bad that they wrote.

553
00:45:00,473 --> 00:45:03,350
I don't want us to be new people.

554
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,543
I like us the way we are.

555
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:09,824
Well, I already did it, Brenda,
so you have to do it too.

556
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:13,424
Okay.

557
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,025
Give me the knife.

558
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:20,180
- I wanna do it.
- No, you did yours. I should do mine.

559
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,262
Nathaniel saved Isabel on the sailboat.

560
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:23,977
It's a book. It's fiction.

561
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:27,061
He saved her for the first time.
She always saved him before.

562
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:30,810
Nathaniel and Isabel are not real.

563
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:41,532
I need to do it.

564
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:49,409
Billy, get off!

565
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:51,962
Billy, get off me!

566
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:56,967
I'm warning you. This is gonna hurt.

567
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:07,800
Yes, hello. I need an ambulance.

568
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:03,182
- It's in the Bible.
- Your son's burning in hell.

569
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:05,779
- God hates fags.
- God hates morons.

570
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,133
- The wages of sin is death and AIDS.
- Amen.

571
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:11,937
You leave these people alone,
or so help me...

572
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:14,096
- It's my right to be here.
- This is America.

573
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,456
It's my right to tell the truth. God killed
Marc Foster, and I'm here to celebrate.

574
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,131
God just shoved your stomach into
your lungs, and I'm here to celebrate!

575
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:27,572
- Look, God just got you in the face.
- What's wrong with you?

576
00:47:27,815 --> 00:47:29,532
He started it.

577
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:31,803
- You all right?
- That man ought to be arrested.

578
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:35,209
- We'll take care of it. Watch yourself.
- I demand that man be arrested!

579
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:38,880
This is a funeral. Show some respect.

580
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,083
- What happened? Did something happen?
- No, nothing happened.

581
00:47:57,123 --> 00:48:00,194
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

582
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:04,871
Damn, you messed that guy up.

583
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,516
No, I'm sorry for how I've been.

584
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,954
I'm just...

585
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:14,027
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:19,310
You know, I have to work not to be
worrying about you all the time.

587
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:22,152
You could get yourself killed if...

588
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:26,945
- lf what?
- Lf that's what you want.

589
00:48:28,111 --> 00:48:30,988
- That's not what I want.
- Are you sure?

590
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,020
Yes.

591
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:40,458
I'm sorry for how I was with you
when we were together.

592
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:43,096
I don't know why it's so hard for me.

593
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:46,262
It's hard for all of us.

594
00:48:48,703 --> 00:48:52,376
But you know that you're right, that
you're a good man. For me it's like...

595
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,298
...I agree with them, you know?

596
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,854
Like it is my fault,
and I should be able to fix it.

597
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:01,609
- There's nothing to fix.
- But it's not who I wanna be.

598
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:04,525
I wanna be the guy at church
with the kid on his knee.

599
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,130
You can have a kid
on your knee, David.

600
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:11,333
That guy probably hasn't slept
with his wife in five years.

601
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,045
I feel like my father would hate me
if he knew.

602
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,367
You told me he did know.

603
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:23,480
And he never said anything.

604
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,838
Did you?

605
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:45,833
Would you shut up? My mother'll
fry your balls for breakfast...

606
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,757
...if she catches you in here.

607
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:49,357
Nice.

608
00:49:49,558 --> 00:49:52,151
So is that pretty much what you eat
in a funeral home?

609
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,711
Yeah, why?

610
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:11,282
Hey.

611
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:16,002
I had Billy committed.

612
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:42,869
Mom?

613
00:51:44,832 --> 00:51:46,629
Are you okay?

614
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:49,788
I have a terrible headache.

615
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,704
- Well, maybe we can talk later.
- What?

616
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,660
What?

617
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:59,062
I'm gay.

618
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,778
Why didn't you ever tell me?

619
00:52:02,305 --> 00:52:05,137
- I am telling you.
- Before, before.

620
00:52:05,344 --> 00:52:08,335
- Don't you trust me?
- What do you mean? I'm telling you.

621
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:11,741
But I've tried to discuss it with you
several times.

622
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,897
Look, I just wasn't comfortable, okay?

623
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:16,409
- What does it matter now?
- Why not?

624
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,975
- When I was clearly trying to be open?
- You know, Mom...

625
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:25,372
...you may be trying to be open now...

626
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,770
...and that's great.

627
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:31,847
But that's not how you've been
for all my life.

628
00:52:32,094 --> 00:52:34,527
You and dad, no one talked
about anything.

629
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:36,808
None of us are like that, except Nate...

630
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:40,969
...and that's just because he has
no other way to distinguish himself.

631
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,284
I've always loved you.

632
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:47,122
I know you love the part of me
that's your son.

633
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:51,360
What part of you isn't my son?
You're all my son.

634
00:52:52,006 --> 00:52:53,996
I don't think you know me very well.

635
00:52:54,245 --> 00:52:57,236
Well, whose fault is that?

636
00:52:58,003 --> 00:53:00,232
I'm sorry.

637
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:11,989
And, you know, when you've tried to
bring it up before or now even...

638
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:15,114
...it's like you've decided
you should know who I am.

639
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:18,188
You're willing to see me how
you look at something horrible...

640
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,784
...like a corpse, because it's
your job, your duty.

641
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,268
It revolts you,
but you make yourself bear it.

642
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:27,270
Well, you're wrong.
You don't revolt me!

643
00:53:27,472 --> 00:53:32,339
I don't choose which part of you I love,
like some kind of chicken!

644
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:40,776
It was just so much easier
when you were little...

645
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:43,744
...and you would tell me everything.

646
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:48,942
And when you were upset,
I could always fix it.

647
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:53,733
I don't know how to take care
of you anymore.

648
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,448
Just let me...

649
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,729
Just let me take care of myself.

650
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:01,851
But do you? I'm afraid that you don't.

651
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,056
I do.

652
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,212
I will.

653
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,441
Well, that's all that I wanted to say.

654
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:21,720
All right.

655
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,328
We're having veal.

656
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:40,637
Well, Mommy still loves you.

657
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:43,719
Does that make everything better?

658
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:48,549
- Yeah, I didn't think it would.
- What are you still doing here?

659
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:53,911
I could've come out to every mother
in the world, and I'd still be dead.

660
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,827
Oh, what, you're gonna interrupt him
and his matching love stud?

661
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:11,908
Both of them will be in hell
with us, by the way.

662
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,146
But something tells me they're gonna
have a lot more fun.

663
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,418
Stop, stop.

664
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:19,777
Make me.

665
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:29,932
Please, God, help me.
Take this pain away, please.

666
00:55:30,143 --> 00:55:34,134
Fill this loneliness with your love.

667
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:37,571
Help me, God. Please help me.

668
00:55:45,996 --> 00:56:38,750
