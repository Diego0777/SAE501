1
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:04,910
Damn, this house is cold.

2
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,387
Shit, Hattie,
it's like a goddamn icebox.

3
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:20,152
Well, no wonder.
Girl, are you crazy?

4
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,399
We live in the desert.
It gets cold at night.

5
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,479
You plan on sleeping all day?

6
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:32,234
I was planning to get me some
breakfast before nightfall.

7
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:35,354
Come on, bitch.
Get your lazy ass up.

8
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,522
Come on, now,
this ain't the old folks' home.

9
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,157
Hattie.

10
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:51,957
Hattie?

11
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,477
I hate this client.

12
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,725
Every time she gets dumped by a guy,
she gets a puppy.

13
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,159
So now she's got, like, 15 dogs.

14
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:18,520
They're all male, they're all huge
and they sit there and watch...

15
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,289
...with their tongues hanging out
while I work on her.

16
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,201
It's like being in some live sex show
for Asian businessmen and frat boys.

17
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:33,251
Which I actually did for a while,
back in the '80s, to make some money.

18
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:38,526
I got this great thing going
with Ping-Pong balls you'd really like.

19
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,247
I'm gonna
show it to you sometime.

20
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:46,324
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I got some
hedge clippers and cut off your dick?

21
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,447
- What?
- Do me a favor, okay?

22
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:51,214
- Don't read that shit in front of me.
- You gave it to me.

23
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:55,408
- Yeah, come on, I'm late.
- I'm at the part with the doll.

24
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,526
Why is your doll angry?

25
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,134
Because she got raped.

26
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:03,011
- Really? By who?
- By you.

27
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:06,329
Brenda, do you know
what "raped" means?

28
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,086
It means she was forced
into sexual intercourse against her will.

29
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:15,294
It's so cool. You're doing it to scare
them into leaving you alone, right?

30
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:18,132
- What do you want from me? I was 8.
- Did it work?

31
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:21,570
No, it didn't work.
I just got a whole new level of scrutiny...

32
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,293
...by a different set of vultures,
only they were women.

33
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:27,014
I'm leaving.
You still want a ride?

34
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:44,497
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

35
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,493
What are you doing today?

36
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:53,134
Well, the cabinets.
I'm gonna try to organize the cabinets.

37
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,743
Good.

38
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:03,581
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

39
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:06,705
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah.

40
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,420
Bring the Lincoln Town Car
around front.

41
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,699
So you're the other Fisher boy, huh?
The one from where, Oregon?

42
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:15,626
- Seattle.
- Right, with the health-food thing.

43
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:18,740
- Yep.
- I remember your dad talking about you.

44
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:22,862
I'm sorry to hear about him, man.
He was a funny guy.

45
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,940
Yeah?

46
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,027
- No, you don't pay.
- Don't pay?

47
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,422
Yeah. Your dad buried my brother
a few years back. It's in trade.

48
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:40,023
My father traded a funeral
for oil changes?

49
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,792
Yeah, guess so.

50
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:53,143
Bye, Mom.
Have a good day.

51
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,629
So would you like us to take care of
finding you a cemetery plot, Mr. Jones?

52
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,067
- Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
- Would you like a double plot?

53
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:10,669
What for?

54
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:16,706
Well, one for your wife, and one for you.
Next to each other.

55
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:20,228
It this what you do all the time?
Sell people their own graves?

56
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:24,787
- Yes, sir. This is my job.
- Don't try to pull that shit with me, boy.

57
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,308
I want a simple box, no frills.

58
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,512
You can't take advantage of me
because I'm old. I'll kick your ass!

59
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:35,148
Just a single plot, then.

60
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,078
No. Double plot.
Shit.

61
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,992
Will you want Mrs. Jones
prepared for viewing?

62
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:49,672
Yes, I wanna see her, but I don't
want you messing with her none.

63
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:54,274
I don't want you to cut her
or stick her or pickle her like an egg.

64
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,081
If you want a viewing,
I recommend...

65
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,401
That's my wife, boy!
I don't want you to touch her!

66
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:04,600
Mr. Jones, I can guarantee
that you will not want to see her...

67
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,603
...nor will anyone else,
unless she's been embalmed.

68
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,643
I would beg you to consider
what your wife would want.

69
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:12,882
She's dead, fool.
Don't matter what she wants.

70
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,281
Well, yes, sir, but...

71
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:20,677
After death, the body immediately
begins to decompose.

72
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,845
Much quicker than you might think.
The skin begins to separate.

73
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:25,680
There's quite an unpleasant odor.

74
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:29,682
Should you choose to forgo embalming,
my recommendation would be cremation.

75
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:32,966
As soon as possible.

76
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,004
That's just the way it is,
Mr. Jones.

77
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,247
I don't wanna burn her up.
I wanna see her.

78
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,403
Fine. You do understand, however,
that means she'll need to be embalmed.

79
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,531
- I ain't paying for that.
- Sir, the cost is minimal.

80
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:02,643
I will waive the embalming fee,
Mr. Jones. All right?

81
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,774
That was a good sermon,
I thought.

82
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,416
- Did you?
- You didn't?

83
00:08:56,622 --> 00:09:00,582
- I didn't really listen to it.
- Hello!

84
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,341
- Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,057
Hello, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm Tracy Blair, David's friend.

86
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:06,663
Tracy.

87
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:09,332
I keep asking him
when we're gonna meet his fianc'ee.

88
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:11,694
- Does she go to another church?
- Yes.

89
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:13,623
What fianc'ee?

90
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,737
Tracy, I told you, Jennifer and I
had broken it off years ago.

91
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:20,700
You did?
So there's no fianc'ee now?

92
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:22,897
Excuse us.

93
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:27,296
- It's really a sore subject for us all.
- You're hurting my arm.

94
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:28,735
Ruth.

95
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,943
- Hiram.
- How are you?

96
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:35,147
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you been coming to church?

97
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,949
- I haven't seen you.
- I wanted to give us some space.

98
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,623
Please don't sacrifice anything
on my account.

99
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,299
Little late for that.

100
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,786
- I miss you. Can I see you?
- No.

101
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,983
Ruth, haven't you
punished yourself enough?

102
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,386
Shall we go?

103
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,900
- Hi, I'm David Fisher.
- Hiram Gunderson.

104
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,148
Nice to meet you.

105
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:03,306
- You're the hairdresser.
- It's nice to meet you, son.

106
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,987
- Don't call me that.
- David!

107
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:07,865
What?

108
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:14,228
- I'll go get the car.
- No, I'm coming with you.

109
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:18,470
It's good to see you.
You look well.

110
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:32,276
Okay, I hear you.
Jesus!

111
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,512
Who are you?

112
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,477
- I live here. Who are you?
- I wanna see my wife.

113
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,275
Oh, I'm sorry. We're not open yet.
Everyone who knows anything is gone.

114
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,919
I wanna see my wife.

115
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,472
Sir, I don't deal with the dead people,
so you're just gonna have to come back.

116
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,751
Bitch, I don't need
your permission.

117
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,117
Sir, you're just gonna
have to come back later.

118
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,640
- My foot.
- What?

119
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:03,757
Help! Help! There's a white girl
trying to cripple an old black man.

120
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,032
Honestly.

121
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,316
Look, sir, you can't go in there.

122
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,241
Hello?

123
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,881
Hello, is anyone home?

124
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,996
Yes, in here.

125
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,724
- Who's your friend?
- Hell if I know.

126
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:34,442
His wife died, and he wanted to see her.
I guess she isn't ready yet.

127
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,445
He was about to keel over,
so I helped him sit down.

128
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,919
Then I had to listen to him bitch
about public transportation forever...

129
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,119
...then he just, like, passed out.

130
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,559
Now I can't get his fucking hand
to let go.

131
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,401
- Maybe he died.
- Very funny.

132
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,521
No, he's still breathing and farting.

133
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,727
- Can you help me pry his hand loose?
- Sure.

134
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,205
Is Nate around?

135
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:01,403
I just bought this fabulous antique chest,
weighs a ton.

136
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:05,446
- I'm gonna need a hand getting it home.
- No, I haven't seen him.

137
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:09,611
- I can help you move it, though.
- No. Thanks.

138
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:17,450
So I'm no good because the cabinet
moving thing's just foreplay for you...

139
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,531
...to fuck my brother?

140
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:22,851
No. I'm just not into babysitting
high-school girls.

141
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:25,563
- No offense.
- Let go of me!

142
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:29,324
Damn, what you all doing?
Trying to steal my watch?

143
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,606
Ought to call the goddamn cops.

144
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:35,445
Why? You're the one who's
breaking and entering.

145
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:38,091
Look. We've gotta go
move a chest.

146
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:41,534
Someone should be back soon
to let you see your wife.

147
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,377
- Hey, little girl.
- What?

148
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,328
You ain't fooling nobody.

149
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:52,890
Great. Thanks. I'll work on that.
I'll be, like, one minute to change, okay?

150
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,697
Are you gonna be okay here alone?

151
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,376
Everybody's alone.

152
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,852
You born alone,
you die alone, goddamn it.

153
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,699
I'm sorry about your wife.

154
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,536
You didn't know her.

155
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,375
Jessica Wilcox?

156
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,465
I'm Nate Fisher.
Nathaniel's son.

157
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,140
I wondered why I hadn't heard
from Nathaniel in quite a while.

158
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:54,901
I hate this. I hate that I'll never
see him again. He was such a kook.

159
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,379
A kook? Dad?

160
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:00,388
I don't think anybody
ever made me laugh like that.

161
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,626
He had such a sense of humor.

162
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,262
- So I hear.
- He was really proud of you.

163
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,903
- I'm Nate, not David.
- I know who you are.

164
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:14,741
You're the one who took off.
Your father really respected you for that.

165
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,832
Said he wished he'd had the guts
to do that when he was a kid.

166
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:26,273
Ms. Wilcox, did you have some kind
of arrangement with my father?

167
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:29,824
- Arrangement?
- In our ledgers, some of the funerals...

168
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,425
...were marked differently,
and your mother's was one.

169
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:37,675
It seems my father sometimes traded his
services for payments other than cash.

170
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:44,547
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but can I see some kind of identification?

171
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:49,353
- Driver's license would do.
- Sure.

172
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:59,310
Libra, huh?
I would've taken you for a Capricorn.

173
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,069
- You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,433
Better be careful.
Give you kidney stones.

175
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:25,921
Come on. Surely you wouldn't begrudge
your father such a minor indulgence.

176
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:31,523
- My father never smoked pot.
- Not in front of you, he didn't.

177
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:36,355
It's the finest organic.
Grown up in San Francisco by my son.

178
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:41,325
Take it.
It's your father's monthly supply.

179
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,645
How is your mother doing
with the grieving, David?

180
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:55,002
She's fine. As far as I can tell. You know
her, she likes to suffer in silence.

181
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,166
That seems to be a family trait.

182
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:01,566
You know, it's God's will
for us to live our lives fully.

183
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,887
Breathing in the joy around us,
not just shouldering the pain.

184
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,809
God wants you to be happy.

185
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,888
I call them "energy buns."
They're my own recipe.

186
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,083
Well, not really. Adding the peppers,
I picked up on my honeymoon.

187
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,849
- Have you ever been to Brazil?
- No.

188
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:20,522
Oh, my God, Brazilians
are the most beautiful people alive!

189
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,962
They're like these fabulous mongrels...

190
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,290
...who've incorporated all the very best
attributes from every race.

191
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:29,291
I mean, all that
crossbreeding. Hello!

192
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,768
I had a half-breed mutt
who lived to be almost 20.

193
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:36,411
Then I got this purebred corgi, and its
hips disintegrated before it was even 2.

194
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,846
- Here you go.
- Fuck you, church freaks.

195
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:46,251
Well, enjoy.

196
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:50,335
Do you cook?
I hate cooking just for myself.

197
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:53,097
That's the worst part
about being divorced.

198
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:56,607
That and the whole
no-regular-sex thing.

199
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:00,572
David? Could I talk to you
for a moment?

200
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:04,768
- Alone?
- Excuse us.

201
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,496
- What do you want?
- Ruth won't talk to me.

202
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,770
I'm worried about her.
I was hoping you could...

203
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,619
You were fucking my mother
while my father was still alive...

204
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,335
...and now you want me to...?
- I understand if you're upset...

205
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,330
Understand this. Whatever you have with
my mother is between you and her...

206
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,375
...but I have no interest in helping you.

207
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,815
Table for one?

208
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,614
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

209
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,181
Did you know my father,
Nathaniel Fisher?

210
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:47,184
This used to be our storeroom...

211
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:52,335
...but when I finally got a loan from the
bank, I put an extension out the kitchen.

212
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:54,696
Your father buried my wife
seven years ago.

213
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,818
I had very little money
for the funeral.

214
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:59,336
He asked if he could have
this room as his own...

215
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:02,307
...and that would
be my settlement.

216
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,303
What did he do here?

217
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,507
I don't know.

218
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,979
- Stay as long as you like.
- How often did he come here?

219
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,465
Sometimes, we wouldn't see him
for months.

220
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,946
Sometimes, he was here every day.

221
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,969
Mrs. Fisher.

222
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,293
Good afternoon, Nikolai.

223
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:15,058
I don't believe I've had a chance
to thank you yet.

224
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,818
When Kroehner started pressuring
everyone to cut us off...

225
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,415
...most of our suppliers
just abandoned Fisher & Sons.

226
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,571
- You stuck with us.
- Of course I stick with you.

227
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,498
Here.

228
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,132
Thank you.

229
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:34,736
These flowers are not going
to plant themselves.

230
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:38,491
Such delicate skin.
You have Russian color.

231
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:41,698
I do?

232
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:44,503
You don't like the beauty you have?

233
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:53,374
The front door is open.
You can leave the flowers inside.

234
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:55,183
Okay.

235
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:03,182
Okay. That is where
that is going to have to stay.

236
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:07,618
- God, that shit was heavy.
- You wanted to help.

237
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:13,182
Oh, my God.
Is this yours?

238
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:16,743
No. That's Nate's, but he keeps
leaving it in my car.

239
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,667
- I love this book.
- You've read it?

240
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,702
Yeah. My friends and I were
all over it three summers ago...

241
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:26,180
...before they all turned into pretentious
drama nerds and abandoned me.

242
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:28,619
Thank God.

243
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:33,062
- What's your favorite part?
- Oh, they're too numerous to mention.

244
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,109
Where's that part where she, like,
stops speaking for a month...

245
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,903
...and just barks at them?

246
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,260
Brenda...

247
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,781
Brenda, I know you're angry.

248
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,869
Can you talk to me?

249
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:07,028
You know they put me in therapy
because I stole that foot?

250
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:09,306
Yeah. Nate told me.

251
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:12,986
God, I would love to go into one of those
sessions and just bark.

252
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,310
Just to see the look on his face.

253
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:23,306
So do you totally identify
with this book too?

254
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:26,591
Of course she does.
It's about her.

255
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,668
What?

256
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,315
She's Charlotte.

257
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,311
You're shitting me.

258
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,681
Is he for real?

259
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,235
Completely.

260
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:45,119
Oh, my God.

261
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:46,556
Oh, my God.

262
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,878
This is like meeting Gandhi or Jesus.

263
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:51,995
Don't tell me.
The book spoke to you.

264
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,512
Like it was written specifically for you.

265
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:58,438
Well, yeah, in a way.

266
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,316
Have you been to the website?

267
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,754
- There's a website?
- Oh, yes.

268
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,636
There's a fan club.

269
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:09,003
Yeah. Those lonely little girls
desperate for something to emulate.

270
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:12,602
Apparently, they're not original enough
to come up with anything on their own.

271
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:17,480
Well, that's what I like to see,
drinking before sundown.

272
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:29,363
Hi, I'm Billy.

273
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,206
- I'm Claire.
- How do you know my sister?

274
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,880
Through my brother Nate.
They're dating.

275
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,608
Oh, yeah? Dating?
Like what, going steady?

276
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,006
He give her his ID bracelet?

277
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:48,203
She carve his initials in her arms
so they'd be there forever?

278
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:53,082
Yo, Bren.

279
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,328
You should've seen me
out on the ocean today.

280
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,491
All those Venice dicks
taking themselves so seriously.

281
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:05,567
- You surf?
- Me? Do I look like I surf?

282
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:08,090
Do I?

283
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:12,365
You'll freeze your ass off
at this time of year, wearing that thing.

284
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:14,725
So? It's my ass.

285
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:18,851
Oh, fine. You wanna get pneumonia
again, go right ahead.

286
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:22,933
Claire, I should take you home.
I got stuff to do.

287
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:25,816
- That's all right, I'll take her.
- Great.

288
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:29,693
Oh, no, I've got time.
We just need to go right now.

289
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:31,889
If you have stuff to do,
don't worry about it.

290
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,329
Yeah, do your stuff.

291
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,416
I just have to take a shower.

292
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:56,453
So I'm walking along one day, and this
asshole stops me and asks if I'm all right.

293
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:58,653
He says I got a look.

294
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:03,937
He'd seen a man with that same
look once and had ignored it.

295
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:08,854
And that man had jumped out
a nine-story window.

296
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,618
Do you know the reconstruction
involved in a death like that?

297
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:22,858
This business gets under your skin.
It's like a fucking virus.

298
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,456
You can even see it on your face.

299
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,459
Smell it on you.

300
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,659
What the hell is this place?
This music?

301
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:34,664
Since when do you listen
to the Classics IV?

302
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,419
What did you do here?
Who the hell are you?

303
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:42,861
So many questions. Why couldn't you
ask them when I was still alive?

304
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,184
It's okay. I couldn't have answered
most of them anyway.

305
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,064
Unlike now.
Now I'm a fucking prophet.

306
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:52,704
Right.

307
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,300
You think I'm kidding, buddy boy?

308
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,865
That's one of the perks of being dead.
You know what happens after you die...

309
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:07,782
...and you know the meaning of life.

310
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:13,584
- That seems fairly useless.
- Yeah, I know.

311
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,389
Life is wasted on the living.

312
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:25,746
- Could've told me you were proud of me.
- You were never around for me to tell.

313
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:29,069
Which is exactly
what I was proud of you for.

314
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:34,036
Therein lies your Catch-22.

315
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,908
- So, what's the meaning of life?
- You really wanna know?

316
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,675
I don't know.

317
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,155
Will it fuck me up if I do?

318
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,802
Oh, David, you make
such a handsome deacon.

319
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:48,321
All those old stiffs.
Finally, a dose of Viagra to the place.

320
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,681
Oh, I don't mean that literally.
Not like you'd need it.

321
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,006
Thank you, Tracy.

322
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,202
So... No fianc'ee, huh?

323
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,084
No, no. That's over.

324
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,408
But she broke my heart,
and I'm just not ready...

325
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:06,126
...or interested in any sort
of relationship now.

326
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:09,688
- Come on, any relationship?
- I'm just not ready.

327
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:12,453
And I doubt that I will be
for quite some time.

328
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:16,931
Well, what if Cindy Crawford
were to walk up to you and say:

329
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:19,011
"Just use me for sex"?

330
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:23,970
- I would say no.
- Liar.

331
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:35,129
Is it so wrong
to want a little human contact?

332
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:39,814
You're lonely too.
I can tell.

333
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,973
For chrissake, Tracy.

334
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:45,656
What does it take?
No.

335
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:49,134
Well, you don't have to be
so mean about it.

336
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,773
Apparently, I do.
I come here to feed these people...

337
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:54,618
...because I don't want
to talk to anybody.

338
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:59,052
Do us both a favor. Go to a bar.
Pick somebody up.

339
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:12,735
- No. We just met.
- I know. I'm sorry.

340
00:30:12,982 --> 00:30:14,894
I'm just so turned on by you.

341
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,619
Shut up.

342
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:23,819
- I have to go home.
- Hey...

343
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,415
- I wanna see you again.
- Good.

344
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:33,942
But I'm not some skank
for you to fuck.

345
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:37,184
If that's what you're into,
go and find that somewhere else.

346
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:39,661
That's not what I'm into, Claire.

347
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,337
I swear.

348
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:50,940
If you're lying, I swear to God,
I will kill you.

349
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:53,940
I will kick your ass.

350
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:57,582
You do not want to mess with me.

351
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:46,545
- That ain't her.
- Excuse me?

352
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:51,794
That ain't my wife. That ain't my Hattie.
What did you do with my Hattie?

353
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:54,351
Mr. Jones, with all due respect...

354
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,631
I don't want your respect.
I want my wife.

355
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,875
Sir, that is your wife.

356
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,229
- You married?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,757
She all young and pretty,
know how to treat you right?

358
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,713
Yes, sir.

359
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:19,153
You can't believe how lucky
you are.

360
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:22,395
How life can be so good
to you, right?

361
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,877
She gonna turn to that.

362
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:31,753
We all do.

363
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:34,319
Well, don't that piss you off, boy?

364
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,918
Not yet.

365
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:43,279
- He used this how long?
- Seven years.

366
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:47,801
It's weird how you keep showing me
rooms people used to live in.

367
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,923
I think it's fucking weird. He'd sit in this
sad little room, doing God knows what.

368
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,724
Why does it have to be sad?

369
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,000
Look around.

370
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,439
- I think it's fascinating.
- Really? Why?

371
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,043
It's such a mystery, you know?

372
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,324
- You'll never know what went on here.
- That's exactly what's driving me crazy.

373
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:17,168
So, what if you did know?
Had it all explained to you.

374
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,284
I bet it wouldn't be nearly
as interesting or fun.

375
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,286
Your father would be a lot more boring.
You enjoy this.

376
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:27,132
Come on, don't you pick up
on something?

377
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:31,121
I thought things left marks in people,
in places, in time.

378
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,370
What, you think I'm a witch?

379
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:38,890
You really don't get any kind of vibe
from this place at all?

380
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,412
You wanna know what I think?

381
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:51,127
I think your father...

382
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:55,967
...wanted someplace
that was just his and nobody else's.

383
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:05,211
Nate, if you didn't know him
when he was alive, you never will.

384
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:10,490
I don't want to be somebody who,
when I die, nobody knows who I was.

385
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,571
So don't be.

386
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,981
How are you doing, Mr. Jones?

387
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:25,936
I'm sitting here, holding my dead wife's
hand. How do you think I'm doing?

388
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:29,931
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

389
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:35,500
- Oh, hello.
- For Jones.

390
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:40,462
Mr. Jones, see the beautiful flowers
for your wife's viewing tomorrow?

391
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:45,181
I don't know why you so excited.
They're just gonna shrivel up and die.

392
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:48,862
Well, thank you.

393
00:34:53,506 --> 00:34:55,543
I'll see you out.

394
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:07,065
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but I'll have my sons...

395
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:10,227
...order flowers from another florist
if this behavior continues.

396
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:11,663
Which behavior?

397
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,748
This is our place of business.
There are grieving people here.

398
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,426
I can't have you skulking around
with that look in your eye.

399
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,462
What look?

400
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:23,226
That sex look.

401
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,667
Maybe you like it.

402
00:35:43,114 --> 00:35:46,585
Lady wear red, she mean business.

403
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,753
This is just what was clean.

404
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:55,154
Lady, I can see it from here.
And I'm blind and deaf.

405
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:58,109
You need to get yourself laid.

406
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,235
Whoa. Time warp.

407
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,397
I told you.

408
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:33,078
It's pretty cozy.
For a morgue.

409
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:37,960
- It must be weird.
- You get used to it.

410
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,313
You ever done it with anyone here?

411
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,874
Yeah, right, and have
my mother walk in? No.

412
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,040
Wow, you look great!

413
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:50,043
- Shut up.
- Come on, seduce me.

414
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,725
There you go.
Oh, yeah. There you go.

415
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,281
Don't pretend
like you haven't done this before.

416
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:02,639
You are a natural. Look at you.
No, no, don't hide.

417
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,200
Wait.

418
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,965
Is this what you do?
You, like, shoot models and stuff?

419
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,841
Hardly.

420
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,962
Hurry, it's on a timer.

421
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,762
Just something to remember me by.

422
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,883
Hey, what do you think about Brenda and
your brother? Think they have a chance?

423
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:37,842
I hope so.
She's pretty amazing.

424
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:39,644
He'd be a real idiot to let her go.

425
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:42,208
Then again, he's capable
of being an idiot sometimes.

426
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:44,927
Yeah, so why is she into him?
Just hot sex?

427
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:48,410
I think he's really in love with her.

428
00:37:51,054 --> 00:37:54,047
- How could he not be?
- Shit, I'm thirsty.

429
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,047
You got any beer?

430
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,052
- No, sorry.
- It's all right.

431
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:01,851
- I should be heading out anyway.
- Oh, okay.

432
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,375
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

433
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:09,370
- Let's do this again.
- Okay.

434
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:21,692
Okay. Mr. Boelson is all juiced up.

435
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,857
I'll be in around 7 tomorrow
to airbrush him...

436
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,130
...get him ready for the viewing.

437
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,696
Unless, you know,
you want me to do him now.

438
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:37,211
I was kind of hoping to get home
before Vanessa put Julio down.

439
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,095
That's fine. Good night.

440
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,942
Need any help?

441
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,412
No, Federico.
Go home to your family.

442
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,335
Don't work too hard.

443
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,146
Mr. Jones.

444
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,743
Time to go home.

445
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,103
Who the hell are you?

446
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,945
I'm Nate. I work here.

447
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:45,863
- That's my wife in that box.
- I know.

448
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:49,025
- I'm very sorry.
- Fifty-six years I spent...

449
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,589
...sleeping in the same bed
with that woman.

450
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:59,668
Fifty-six years of listening to her
talk about the same shit.

451
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:02,673
Day in, day out.

452
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,753
- It's late. Maybe I should drive you home.
- Shut the fuck up, boy.

453
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:09,631
- Let an old man speak.
- Okay.

454
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:14,469
She...

455
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:20,150
...chased me across the front yard with
a steak knife once. Tried to cut my ass.

456
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:23,549
We spent close to a year apart.

457
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:26,592
That time like a hole in me now.

458
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:34,958
She the only one who really knew me.

459
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,550
Your wife will always be with you
in your memories.

460
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,519
You love someone that much,
they never...

461
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:47,681
You sell that shit to somebody
who buying it, because I ain't.

462
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:50,957
You don't know nothing about love.

463
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:56,837
Some pretty little thing catches your eye,
next thing you know, it's been 56 years.

464
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:59,433
And you done shit all over yourself
in a movie theater...

465
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:02,283
...and she the only one
to help you clean it up.

466
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:04,555
That's love.

467
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:15,040
You don't know nothing.

468
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,046
I won't argue that.

469
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,197
Can I get you anything to drink?
I have beer, red wine, a little vodka.

470
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:30,719
No, just water, thanks.

471
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:35,286
I don't usually go out on a school night,
but you know how it is sometimes.

472
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:37,162
Yeah.

473
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,640
Here you go.
My ex.

474
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,161
We were together nearly two years,
then he dumped me for a 22-year-old...

475
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,761
...stand-in he met on location.

476
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:53,726
I think that's the only picture
I had of him I didn't tear up.

477
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,243
It's funny, you think
you know somebody, and...

478
00:41:58,293 --> 00:41:59,931
I hear he's in AA now.

479
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,170
So are you in the business?

480
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:10,646
No. No, I'm a lawyer.
I'm from Boston.

481
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:13,729
God, how refreshing.

482
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:16,245
You tend to forget sometimes,
living in L. A...

483
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:20,250
...that there's this world
outside the entertainment industry...

484
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,652
...and that's the real world.

485
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:27,291
So, what do you do?

486
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:31,850
- Production accounting. I told you that.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:33,537
It's okay.

488
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,931
So, Jim...

489
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,376
...what do you like to do?

490
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:52,218
- Can we sit down?
- Sure.

491
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,019
Had a little too much
to drink there, Jim?

492
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:06,302
- You okay?
- Yeah.

493
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,420
I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

494
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,779
It's okay.

495
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,551
I should never have lashed out
at you like that. It's...

496
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,867
I don't know
what's wrong with me. L...

497
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:58,461
I was holding a saucepan
the other day...

498
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:03,864
...and all of a sudden, I remembered
making creamed corn in that pan.

499
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,822
Some night
when it was raining outside...

500
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:10,265
...and both the boys had colds and my
husband was on a call...

501
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:12,032
...picking up a body.

502
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:15,146
And then yesterday,
I was cleaning out the cabinets...

503
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:17,744
...and I found a jar of baby food
in the very back.

504
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:21,385
Strained carrots
from when Claire was a baby.

505
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:25,589
That jar had been sitting there
for over 15 years.

506
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:29,753
I am surrounded by these...

507
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:34,827
These relics
of a life that no longer exists.

508
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,157
We're here for the Jones viewing.

509
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,197
Right this way, please.

510
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:06,517
- Yeah?
- Oh, shit, Billy, did I wake you?

511
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:10,193
- I'm sorry. Fuck.
- Who is this?

512
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:12,439
It's Claire.

513
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:18,673
- Who?
- It's Claire. Nate's sister.

514
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:25,038
I just wanted to see if maybe you wanted
to hang out after school again today.

515
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:27,157
Not really,

516
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:31,160
Come on, Claire,
you're what, 16?

517
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:35,555
What do you think I am, a pedophile?

518
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,404
Well?

519
00:46:05,372 --> 00:46:07,932
I don't know
what you want me to say.

520
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:11,091
I don't want you to say anything.
I just thought you should see it.

521
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,009
Well, I've seen it.

522
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:19,844
So Dad traded a room for a funeral.
No wonder we never had any money.

523
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:22,090
Didn't Dad ever say anything
about this place?

524
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:26,174
Dad and I never talked
about anything but work.

525
00:46:26,415 --> 00:46:28,883
That's exactly the relationship
you and I have.

526
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:33,412
Nate, people are allowed
to have private lives.

527
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:35,208
So what if Dad had a secret room?

528
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,453
I don't care if he brought
women here to fuck.

529
00:46:37,657 --> 00:46:40,774
I don't care if he brought men
back here to fuck.

530
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:45,291
You think we should tell Mom
about it?

531
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:48,775
Sure, why not? You won't be happy
until this whole family is in therapy.

532
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,529
That's kind of a leap.

533
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,376
I know you're pissed off
about a lot of shit.

534
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,572
But I didn't make any of that shit
happen. Right, I abandoned you.

535
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,341
Well, you know what?
I'm not your father. I'm not the one...

536
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,817
...whose responsibility it was not
to abandon you, so get over it, please.

537
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,292
Life is just too fucking short.

538
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:15,179
Thank you, Nate.
I appreciate your honesty.

539
00:47:15,383 --> 00:47:18,295
Wrapped, as it was,
in such a bouquet of condescension.

540
00:47:20,023 --> 00:47:25,178
If I were you, I'd pack this place up
before they start charging us rent.

541
00:48:21,513 --> 00:48:23,743
Quite a hottie, huh?

542
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:25,626
This is Mom.

543
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:30,307
You have no idea how beautiful
she was, buddy boy.

544
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:33,629
I have no idea who you were.

545
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:37,314
I really wasn't that interesting.

546
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,874
No, I think you probably were.

547
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:46,831
I think you were this great guy,
who was funny and weird and high.

548
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:53,110
I was just always so afraid
of everything you did.

549
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:54,797
Death.

550
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:03,509
I made the decision to become a fucking
undertaker because I thought it was...

551
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,517
...something you believed in.
Now I find out...

552
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,075
...you think running away
is the best thing I ever did?

553
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,036
- Maybe.
- I kept us from selling to Kroehner.

554
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,600
And I'm taking the funeral director's
license test next month.

555
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:23,400
Maybe I was just covering up for how
embarrassed I was when you left.

556
00:49:25,123 --> 00:49:27,717
Is that why you left half
the business to me?

557
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:32,273
- To get back at me?
- Maybe.

558
00:49:32,524 --> 00:49:35,198
Maybe I wanted to see if you
had the balls to go against me.

559
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,954
Or maybe I really wanted you to have it.
You'll never know.

560
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:43,318
Goddamn it! When are you gonna stop
fucking with me?

561
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:45,881
When are you gonna stop caring
what I thought?

562
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:49,039
"I never knew my father."

563
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,805
Get over it, please.

564
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:57,246
Life is just too fucking short.

565
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,649
My brother is a very complicated man.

566
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:14,126
And very high-maintenance.

567
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:17,681
Don't get me wrong,
I love him dearly.

568
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:21,168
But I pity the woman
he ends up with.

569
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:23,767
See, that's the same thing
I'd say about my brother.

570
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:26,771
Nate is not even
in the same league.

571
00:50:26,973 --> 00:50:29,567
Was I crazy?

572
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,572
I mean,
Billy was really acting like...

573
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:35,845
Did you fuck him?

574
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:38,369
No.

575
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,330
Well, you dodged a bullet there.

576
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:44,214
Is every man alive a total asshole?

577
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:48,887
At some point or another.
Then again, so are we.

578
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,492
Come on, we gotta go.

579
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:57,448
I still cannot get over the fact
that you are Charlotte, Light and Dark,

580
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:00,047
You have to,
because it's very irritating.

581
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:11,139
- Mr. Jones is still downstairs.
- I know.

582
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,571
This silver has been in
your father's family for three generations.

583
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,381
I don't believe I've ever used it.

584
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:24,372
I'm going to put an ad in the paper
and see if I can sell them.

585
00:51:25,142 --> 00:51:28,373
Mom, I found something
you probably should have.

586
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:48,622
- Where did you find these?
- In the office, among Dad's things.

587
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:52,703
Look at what a child I was.

588
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:59,424
Your father was leaving for Vietnam.

589
00:51:59,627 --> 00:52:02,381
He'd volunteered as a medic.

590
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:04,943
Your grandfather was furious.

591
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,707
You don't remember
your grandfather, do you?

592
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,137
No.

593
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:14,907
He was a very unhappy man...

594
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:18,826
...and he wanted everyone else
to be unhappy too.

595
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:22,865
We were all living in this house.

596
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:29,788
You were a baby,
and there was no privacy, so...

597
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:33,191
Nathaniel and I got a room
at a motel.

598
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:37,912
Some seedy place in the valley.

599
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:48,913
And we made love like maniacs.

600
00:52:51,595 --> 00:52:54,156
Like it was the last time.

601
00:52:57,996 --> 00:53:00,989
Your father took these pictures...

602
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:04,556
...in that dank little room.

603
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:12,995
Told me he kept them in his pocket
in Vietnam to protect him.

604
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,511
It's frightening
how much we change.

605
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,357
Are you staying for dinner, dear?

606
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:36,435
Yeah.

607
00:53:42,403 --> 00:53:45,362
Mr. Jones. Probably should think
about heading home.

608
00:53:45,564 --> 00:53:49,159
You've got a long day ahead of you
tomorrow with the funeral and...

609
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:52,004
Mr. Jones?

610
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:54,002
Mr. Jones.

611
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,997
Mr. Jones?

612
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:07,044
Oh, shit.

613
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:42,349
