00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,738
<i>... a report by this entertainment industry</i>
<i>analyst released today...</i>

2
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,372
<i>showed a severe drop in the summer</i>
<i>box office results at the major studios.</i>

3
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:32,417
<i>A Warner Brothers spokesperson</i>
<i>pooh-poohed the projections...</i>

4
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,037
Previn?

5
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,370
Previn, are you in there?

6
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:39,116
It's George, the building manager.

7
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,381
I started to smell something
a few days ago...

8
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:45,014
but I just thought
someone was cooking cabbage.

9
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,059
See? You can still smell it. I'm not crazy.

10
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:49,992
Oh, my God!

11
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,242
I'm just surprised.

12
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:11,578
Why? I told you I was going to write a book.

13
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,244
- No, you didn't.
- I thought I did.

14
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,855
- What?
- I need to get in there.

15
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,754
So you're just gonna sit down today
and start writing?

16
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,729
Yeah, I think that's how it's usually done.

17
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,663
Except for Hemingway. He stood.

18
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,797
- What?
- I need to get in there now.

19
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,703
- What? You think I can't write a book?
- No, of course not.

20
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,717
It's just a book is so big.

21
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:49,850
Not all of them.

22
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:53,549
Well, it's just the last time we talked
about you doing something new...

23
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,152
you mentioned getting Billy's friends
to help you open an art gallery.

24
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,958
Yeah, well, I got to thinking.

25
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,522
I don't need to help others
express themselves.

26
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,465
I should do it myself.

27
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,468
I think this is great.

28
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,369
Charlotte finally speaks.

29
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,308
Your fucked up childhood from your
point of view. People will want to read that.

30
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:15,278
No way. I'm not gonna write a memoir.

31
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,275
What is it, then?

32
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,109
- Fiction.
- Really?

33
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,256
That's so ambitious. I love it.

34
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,791
I hope I'm going to be in it.
I've always wanted to be thinly veiled.

35
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,594
You might be in it...

36
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,960
if you ever do anything interesting.

37
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,740
I need help.

38
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:47,037
Do you think the hair
on Mr. Peterson's forearms is sexy?

39
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:50,309
Or is it too unkempt?
Sometimes he gets all tufty.

40
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,350
I really don't have time for this.

41
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,909
This weekend is my last chance
to take the SATs. I have to do well.

42
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,252
Just take a break.
It'll keep you from burning out.

43
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:04,189
Every fall,
I rate the male teachers' fuckability.

44
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,258
I've been doing it since the sixth grade.

45
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,130
I am, like, 400 times smarter than you.

46
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,500
Why aren't you panicking more
about this test?

47
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,539
Because I know how to play the game.

48
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,439
I have a tutor. I've taken practice tests.

49
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,042
And my mom's life coach is advising me.

50
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,977
Your mom's life coach?

51
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:26,149
Parker, do you have any idea
what a parody of yourself you are?

52
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,545
I feel bad for Mr. Van Kirk.

53
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,023
If he hadn't stopped working out,
he could've easily cracked the top 10.

54
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,226
Give me that.

55
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,988
Gitterman's coming in at 22?

56
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,692
I was feeling generous.

57
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,167
- Hey, Claire.
- Gary, hi.

58
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,565
- See you this afternoon?
- Yep.

59
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,872
Gary has a great ass.

60
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,716
- You think he has a great ass?
- Yeah.

61
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:03,477
Like you haven't noticed.

62
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:08,114
My mom calls them buns.
She's so not of this century.

63
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,185
I don't care how much she pays
her life coach.

64
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,357
I could fuck Gary. Easy.

65
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:24,601
So this woman in her 40s
just died alone in her apartment?

66
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,640
Just out of the blue?

67
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,847
I mean, she must have had
some kind of medical condition.

68
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,884
No, she choked to death.

69
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:37,050
She lay there for a week
before anyone found her.

70
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,522
Why didn't anybody notice sooner?

71
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,689
Maybe they thought she was on vacation.

72
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,958
Here are the arrangements for her funeral.
They're self-explanatory.

73
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,090
You should be able to take care of it.

74
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,033
Shouldn't I talk
to whoever's gonna bury her?

75
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,866
Nate, it's a pre-need. She buried herself.

76
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,499
She bought everything she wanted
ahead of time.

77
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:00,238
You have her contacts for family
and friends, directions for the service...

78
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,678
and the specifications about her restoration.

79
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,545
She knew exactly what kind of service
she wanted.

80
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:08,415
You'll need to order the sheet music
for the organist.

81
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,081
<i>And I am telling you I'm not going.</i>

82
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:15,148
She certainly had a sense of humor.

83
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,326
What song is that?

84
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,420
It's from <i>Dreamgirls.</i> You know it:

85
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,227
<i>And I am telling you</i>

86
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,028
<i>I'm not going</i>

87
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,729
<i>You're the best man I've ever known</i>

88
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,409
It must be weird
to fill one of these things out for yourself.

89
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,273
I had fun doing mine.

90
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,496
I have a test on Monday,
I have an art history paper due next week.

91
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:37,406
I know I could do a good job on both
if I had more time, but I don't.

92
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,037
- Do I have something on my face?
- No.

93
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,708
You're giving me this look.

94
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,313
It's just nice to see you so involved.

95
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,423
Are you taking the SAT this weekend?

96
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,617
I saw the books in the library.

97
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,184
- I don't know why I didn't tell you.
- It's okay.

98
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:00,595
- I just signed up for it. I wasn't sure.
- No, it's great.

99
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:04,465
You're taking school more seriously,
and you're gonna take the SAT.

100
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:08,035
- It shows you're nurturing yourself.
- Give me a break.

101
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:11,540
I'm so scared of having my own thoughts
or going my own direction...

102
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,976
that I need some safety or approval.

103
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,775
This stuff is just cop-out distractions.

104
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,549
You know what?
This session's given me some clarity.

105
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,587
I should just blow this test off...

106
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:26,283
and look really hard inside myself
for what I really want.

107
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,528
Claire, you're obviously frightened
by taking this test. Why?

108
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,168
I don't know.

109
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,135
It's like, when I think about the test...

110
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:45,202
I see this nasty fluorescent light.

111
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:49,337
The kind that shows all your pockmarks
and tiny scars that you wish you could hide.

112
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,574
I see.

113
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,147
So it's very safe in the darkness, isn't it?

114
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,110
Okay, you're getting kind of corny.

115
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:04,621
All I'm saying is you're finally in a place
where you're coming into your own.

116
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:10,198
You're afraid if people see the real you,
it'll be scary. And guess what? It is scary.

117
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,802
For all of us. Isn't it?

118
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,567
<i>Don't be silly, David.</i>

119
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:24,512
You don't need to apologize
for what you said about the plan.

120
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,016
If you live in a neighborhood
for a long time...

121
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:31,021
and somebody moves in
and renovates the house across the street...

122
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,422
that could just make you feel
your own house is shabby.

123
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:35,652
I see.

124
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:38,661
- Did you just insult me?
- Of course not.

125
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,996
You'll see.

126
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,200
When you're ready,
you're going to live in a palace.

127
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,596
Claire, wash your hands. We're about to eat.

128
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:49,162
Don't set a place for me. I'm not staying.

129
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,240
- Who are you having dinner with?
- No one.

130
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,438
I'm having coffee
with someone I met at St. Stephen's.

131
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:58,505
David, if you have a date, just say it.

132
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,052
Nothing ever gets built
if the materials aren't labeled properly.

133
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,013
Okay, I have a date.

134
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,526
David, I'm having a problem
with the Emily Previn funeral.

135
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,083
Let's hear it.

136
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:15,321
I've called her entire contact list, and
the friends she listed have moved or died.

137
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,025
She has two distant relatives.

138
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:20,833
One of which I can't reach, and the other
has this phobia about funerals.

139
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,702
Some people are so sick.

140
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,675
Now we know why she wasn't found
for a week.

141
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:29,004
- I don't think she had anybody in her life.
- How awful.

142
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,447
Have you called her job
to notify her colleagues about the service?

143
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:35,975
No. She worked at a temp agency,
so she just had jobs here and there.

144
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,579
She must have had someone
that she forgot to list.

145
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:41,853
Try her high school.
Everyone has friends from high school.

146
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,450
No, they don't.

147
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,395
Maybe they have people they talk to,
or do things with...

148
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,398
but they're not really friends.

149
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,229
They're just filler.

150
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,162
What? It's true.

151
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,273
I want a glass of wine.

152
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,737
Oh, God.

153
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,634
It's so weird.

154
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,876
Who the hell was Emily Previn?

155
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,843
Nate, are you okay?

156
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,953
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- 'Cause your eyes look really weird.

157
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:16,953
Yeah, it's just this medication I'm taking.
It makes me a little drowsy. That's all.

158
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,258
Honestly.

159
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,033
Maybe Emily Previn was autistic.

160
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:30,973
I read an article about a high-functioning
autistic person who didn't need people.

161
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,341
She just had a job
designing these big cattle slaughterhouses.

162
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,040
At night, she came home
and sat in a machine...

163
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,310
that made her feel
like she was being hugged.

164
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,909
And that was all the intimacy she needed.

165
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,613
That's really upsetting.

166
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,350
I don't see why
this person has to be mentally ill...

167
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:50,884
just because she had a life that doesn't
conform to a familiar image in our heads.

168
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,824
Maybe she was living the life she wanted.

169
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,093
A life without the hassle of other people.

170
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,294
What kind of a life is that?

171
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,802
"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor...

172
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,039
"but how was I supposed to know
it was your car?"

173
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,672
- I don't think I could be a public defender.
- No? Why not?

174
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,844
I just don't think
I could defend people who are guilty.

175
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,083
I guess I could be
a some-of-the-public defender.

176
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,059
So, what do you do?

177
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,021
Me? My family owns a business.
Actually, it's a funeral home.

178
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:34,837
But I got out of that really quickly,
and now I'm in textiles.

179
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,831
I like fabric.

180
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,976
I have to be in court in the morning.
I have a lot of work...

181
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,813
- Okay. Maybe we'll see each other around.
- David, relax.

182
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:50,946
It's fine. I understand.
I guess there's not much of a spark here.

183
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,820
I thought there was. You don't?

184
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,558
No, I do. I was just worried.

185
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,657
I'm sorry, Ben.
I get a little nervous at these things.

186
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,725
If I seem calm,
it's only because I take a beta-blocker...

187
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:09,205
before I have to get in front of a jury
or first dates.

188
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,803
You're still nervous on the inside,
but you don't show it as much.

189
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,743
Do you have any extra?

190
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:23,944
Let's go on a real date next time.
Like, for dinner.

191
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,546
Okay, that would be nice.

192
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:31,127
You seem a little...

193
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:36,092
- Are you coming out of a bad breakup?
- No, I'm coming out of a bad celibacy.

194
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,863
I was in a relationship, but that ended.

195
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,303
Well, whatever happened, I blame him.

196
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,840
You shouldn't. He's a great guy.

197
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:52,849
You get your spoiled little ass
into that bed right now! Do you hear me?

198
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:53,941
You suck!

199
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,043
Right now! I mean it!

200
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,112
I'm not tired.

201
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:03,118
When I'm at my real home,
I don't have to go to sleep until I get tired.

202
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:06,721
I'm going to turn off the lights now,
and soon you'll be tired.

203
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,288
What if I never get tired?

204
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:12,234
Then you'll lay awake for hours and hours
wondering why life is so hard.

205
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,134
That's what the rest of us do.

206
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,934
That sounds boring.

207
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,969
You get used to it.

208
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,319
Do you want to talk about anything?

209
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,550
Like how you feel about staying here?

210
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:37,794
Or being scared, because your mom's
been in Oakland so long?

211
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:38,886
No.

212
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,327
Okay. But we don't know how long
you're gonna be here.

213
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,632
So why don't we both try
and ease up on each other a little bit, okay?

214
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,600
You guys have bad toothpaste.

215
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:55,735
My first instinct is to get angry with her.
I open my mouth, I hear my father.

216
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:01,144
Stop being so hard on yourself.
That child is not easy.

217
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,121
I swore to myself I would never be like him.

218
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,924
I'm not in the mood.

219
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,460
Fine.

220
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,778
<i>Get up!</i>

221
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,995
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Melissa. It's Brenda.

222
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:02,300
Chenowith.

223
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,273
Your massage therapist.

224
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,906
Hey, how's it going?

225
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,510
Listen, I was just wondering
if you hadn't eaten yet...

226
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,549
<i>if you wanted to have lunch.</i>

227
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:15,108
Actually, I'm at a restaurant right now.

228
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:20,323
<i>Look, I'm probably breaking</i>
<i>all these client/masseuse boundaries.</i>

229
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,859
I'll see you
at your regular appointment tomorrow.

230
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,919
No, I was just gonna say I'm by myself.
I'd love the company.

231
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,328
<i>Thank God.</i>

232
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,974
Oh, Jesus!

233
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,741
This one's gonna be one hell of a ride.

234
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:46,214
I'm sure you'll be able to take care of it.

235
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,751
Yeah? Well, don't be.

236
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:51,276
She must've been laying out for a week
in a partially-ventilated space.

237
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,846
Why can't everyone die
in an air-conditioned room?

238
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:56,257
Her face is discolored from being lain on.

239
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,955
That I can fix,
although it's gonna take me hours.

240
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,466
Her abdomen's all distended.
This woman's got a lot of gas in there.

241
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,127
When I poke a hole,
we're gonna get some major fumes.

242
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,636
Whew, Nellie!

243
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,036
I have no idea why I came in here.

244
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:11,904
- Maybe you have Alzheimer's.
- Yeah, maybe.

245
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,714
We really are just biology, aren't we?

246
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,455
You may need to talk the family
out of an open casket.

247
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:33,122
- There's only so much I can do, man.
- She doesn't have any family.

248
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,963
- No one?
- No friends, or anybody.

249
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:40,029
I ran an obituary in the paper today.

250
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:42,732
I'm just praying
someone will read it and come tomorrow.

251
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,069
Pre-need?

252
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:50,004
If she wanted an open casket,
we'll try to give her one.

253
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:53,674
I'll boost up the fluids
and see if that'll bring the swelling down.

254
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:58,017
There's a good chance we're going to get
some skin slippage, and then we're screwed.

255
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:04,552
Maybe she was just some vicious asshole,
you know?

256
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,889
Just twisted and evil. Maybe that's why
she didn't have any people in her life.

257
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:10,991
No.

258
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,536
You can tell what kind of life people lived
even when they're dead.

259
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,210
Yeah, she was all right.

260
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:29,212
Please have your IDs out and ready
so we can speed things along.

261
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,488
- Claire Fisher.
- ID?

262
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:37,558
- Sign right here.
- Name?

263
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:40,096
- Parker McKenna.
- Let's see.

264
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,290
Parker. Sign here, please.

265
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:45,927
Next?

266
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,403
Does anybody have
an extra number two pencil?

267
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,871
Here you go.

268
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,477
So it sounds
like a pretty serious relationship for you.

269
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:57,707
It is.

270
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,941
I love Nate. I really do.

271
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:06,850
But, lately, I feel kind of separate from him.

272
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,785
Which I know is healthy on one level.

273
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,790
But, on another, I kind of miss how it was.

274
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:17,229
When we started seeing each other
and weren't together...

275
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:20,566
I'd be wondering,
"What is he doing," all day long.

276
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:21,829
Now?

277
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,733
I never even think about it.

278
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,942
I don't know exactly when I changed.

279
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,849
But at some point,
he became less present with me.

280
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:41,587
<i>Sometimes I think it's because</i>
<i>I don't give him enough to be present for.</i>

281
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,619
<i>But then I think, maybe he's not present</i>
<i>because he knows if he was really present...</i>

282
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:49,727
then I'd leave him.

283
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,769
<i>You know, it's just so sad</i>
<i>that you can love somebody so much...</i>

284
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,140
<i>and have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what's going on in their head.</i>

285
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:07,773
- Relationships are fucked.
- That's what I always say.

286
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:11,350
I haven't had a real relationship
in over a decade.

287
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,418
- Is that because you...
- Because I blow guys for money?

288
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,654
I'm so sorry. That was...

289
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,127
It's okay.

290
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:24,424
I've only been doing that
for about five years.

291
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:25,901
So why, then?

292
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:30,195
I'm just not built for it.
Some people aren't, I think.

293
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,539
It's not healthy or unhealthy. It just is.

294
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:39,844
Oh, shit.

295
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,482
I'm being paged by a client.

296
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:51,284
I am not driving out to Calabasas
in this traffic.

297
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,262
Let the jerk whack off.

298
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,795
You know, I'm really glad
you could have lunch.

299
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,062
Me, too.

300
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,098
You know, it means a lot to me
that you're so normal around me.

301
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,104
Most people have preconceived notions
about what I do.

302
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:11,410
Yeah, well, people can be
such judgmental assholes.

303
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,313
You don't have to tell me that.

304
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,511
You want to know what's worse?

305
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:19,719
Most girls want to be my friend
so that they can pump me...

306
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,123
for all the gory details
about being a lady of the evening.

307
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:27,930
It's just question after question,
like I'm some kind of freak.

308
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:39,401
- All right, you get three questions.
- Oh, goody!

309
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,472
There's that one.

310
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:45,104
No, I think that one makes you look fat.

311
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,547
Very funny.

312
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:49,880
Which one do you think
will look better on Miss Previn?

313
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:50,978
The pink one.

314
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:54,252
Didn't she specify which gown she wanted,
or did Dad slip up?

315
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:58,022
No, Dad didn't slip up.
She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.

316
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:01,656
- The outfit she came in with was shot.
- Give her the blue to get rid of it.

317
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,131
It's coming apart in the back.

318
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,360
David!

319
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,367
- Mom, did you want something?
- I was dusting your casket wall.

320
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,769
If this woman wanted to be buried
in her own clothes...

321
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:15,971
then one of you boys should go to her home
and pick something out.

322
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,673
Isn't that a bit much?

323
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:22,276
I remember Dad doing it once or twice.
You get the building manager to let you in.

324
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,947
Fine. I'll pick out something dressy.

325
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,123
Considering the shape her body's in...

326
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,489
I should pick
whatever covers her up the most.

327
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,959
I'll come with you.

328
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,758
- You don't have to do that.
- I know that.

329
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:40,002
Aren't the guys scary?
It must get dangerous.

330
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:42,771
To tell you the truth, it doesn't.

331
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:47,141
You just have to trust your instinct.
It's never wrong.

332
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,071
We're kind of like animals that way.

333
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:54,683
When I first meet a client,
I take a good long look into his eyes.

334
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:57,880
That stupid stuff they say
about looking in people's eyes is true.

335
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,446
- You just look into them, and you know.
- Know what?

336
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:04,324
You know, whether someone is right,
or whether they're...

337
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:07,797
you know, wrong.

338
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:12,397
And if they're wrong,
you just get out of there immediately.

339
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,165
No. I think everyone has the answers
to everything in life.

340
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,209
- It's a matter of knowing how to listen.
- You're fantastic!

341
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:20,903
Fuck, you are!

342
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:25,745
There is no bullshit with you!
You are just who you are. Period.

343
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,845
Even the way you talk about your work.

344
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,514
You provide a service
for which you're well-compensated.

345
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:35,486
- Unlike the rest of us losers.
- Please.

346
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,862
If there was anything else that paid
this much, I would do it in a heartbeat.

347
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,024
But there's not a touch
of victimhood about you.

348
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,601
It's almost like it's empowering, in a way.

349
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,002
I went through that whole
feminist rationalization stuff at first.

350
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,507
Now I'm just a little more honest.

351
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,776
It's just a way to pay the bills.

352
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,306
Sorry I can't make it to the funeral.

353
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,681
My kid's got a soccer game.

354
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:05,120
She was one of your tenants,
for God's sake.

355
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,418
She lived among you.

356
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,823
Hey, come on. I just started, all right?

357
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:12,384
She only lived among me for a week.

358
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:15,960
She never even got to finish
her crossword puzzle.

359
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,126
All right, look.

360
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,628
- Five minutes?
- Yep. Great.

361
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,168
Mom!

362
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:31,078
Eddie needs to adapt
to how things have changed.

363
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,548
I have a lot more responsibility now.

364
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:37,576
He needs to be more understanding
that sometimes I'm gonna be tired, man.

365
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,385
- Yeah, kids come first. Period.
- Exactly.

366
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,323
Have you had this conversation with him?

367
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:47,797
He'd just say I need to make more time
for him, which would piss me off.

368
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,233
So why bother talking to him about it?

369
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,167
Because you keep everything bottled up
inside you, my friend.

370
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,205
That's not good. That creates cancer.

371
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:56,739
- Give me a break.
- It does.

372
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,970
My wife's cousin was a very angry person,
but she never showed it.

373
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,241
She just cleaned all day,
then she lost both her breasts.

374
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,439
It's weird.

375
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,141
You get away from me, dickless fuck!

376
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,686
- You don't own me.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

377
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,052
You know, you fucking lie to me, bitch!

378
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:16,354
Bitch, I'll blow your fucking brains out,
you stupid cunt!

379
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,190
I wish you would,
but you don't got the balls to shoot me!

380
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,323
- Police! Drop the gun!
- Stay out of this! Fucking cops!

381
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,457
Drop the gun.

382
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:26,435
You shoot me, they'll shoot you.
Then you'll be dead!

383
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,937
You know what?
The world will be a better place!

384
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,031
- Shut up!
- Drop the gun now!

385
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,872
What is wrong with you?
What did you do that for?

386
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,577
What's wrong with you?

387
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:52,123
I like all of these, but they seem so flat.

388
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,398
I wish one had a little more oomph.

389
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:59,027
- Just grab that one. That one has oomph.
- No, it doesn't.

390
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:02,432
Don't rush me, Nate. I'm not nearly done...

391
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:05,998
and I haven't even started
with the shoes and the jewelry.

392
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:11,378
Nate Fisher.

393
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:15,614
Yeah, hi. I left a message there
for Father Martin Farrell.

394
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,287
He was requested by the deceased
to officiate at her funeral.

395
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,858
Great! Well, I'm fucked.

396
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:26,989
I'm sorry, Sister.

397
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,994
Are there any other priests
you'd recommend for a funeral tomorrow?

398
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:16,469
Mom?

399
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,942
- What, are you hungry?
- Of course not.

400
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,818
- Then, are you ready to go?
- I don't know.

401
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,215
Maybe she liked solitude.

402
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,928
Maybe she was living the life she wanted
and was happy.

403
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,327
I hope so.

404
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,134
But what if some nights,
she wanted to talk to someone...

405
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:39,965
and she picked up the phone...

406
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:44,406
and realized she didn't have anyone
she could call? What then?

407
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:49,939
We don't know that she didn't have
anyone to call. Maybe there was someone.

408
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,344
I hope so.

409
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:28,384
No one thinks you did anything wrong.
You were just doing your job, okay?

410
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,322
Now I know what's different.

411
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,791
You're not wearing your glasses tonight.

412
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:40,695
I was getting dressed,
and nothing looked right...

413
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:43,358
and I realized it was all my glasses' fault.

414
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:46,828
So I put in these contacts,
which I actually hate...

415
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,668
but I thought it was worth it, if you'd...

416
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:55,539
This is me without beta-blockers.

417
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:57,378
It's good.

418
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,982
Maybe it's even better.

419
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:09,786
- I still work in the family business.
- Excuse me?

420
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,990
I'm a funeral director, that's who I am.

421
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:21,026
I have to say, I'm glad you're not in textiles.
That sounded really dull.

422
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,931
Why did you lie?

423
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,670
Well, come on.

424
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:30,041
People always get that look in their eyes,
like there's something wrong with you.

425
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:34,982
They wait about 5 seconds before bringing
the conversation around to necrophilia.

426
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,346
I just liked you too much,
and I was scared it would repulse you.

427
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:41,582
So what made you tell me now?

428
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,495
Because on our last date,
I just sort of liked you...

429
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,355
and now I really like you.

430
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:55,397
- So I didn't screw things up because I lied?
- No, I think it's cute.

431
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:01,633
- And I'm gonna wanna take this slow.
- All right.

432
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,907
Can we just make out, already?

433
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,932
We had plans to meet tonight. At the Tiki Ti.

434
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,262
Did we?

435
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:29,094
Claire, why did you blow me off?
And why didn't you return my phone calls?

436
00:33:29,172 --> 00:33:31,436
Because I have nothing to say to you.

437
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:36,469
Look, I know this is about the SATs,
but it wasn't my fault.

438
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:40,679
It was my mother's idea. She heard
about this girl through one of her friends.

439
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:44,016
She's this genius from Westlake
who's going around taking the test.

440
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:46,055
And let me tell you, it works.

441
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:49,523
She got three people into Yale
and five into Harvard.

442
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:53,287
- This is so gross.
- What was I supposed to do?

443
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:58,267
My mom came into my room last night and
told me she'd already paid the girl $1,000.

444
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:01,168
You make me so sick. Just get out of here!

445
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:04,530
Okay? I don't feel like
ever seeing you again.

446
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,636
- You're serious?
- Yeah, I am.

447
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,771
Fine. Fuck you, Claire!

448
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:17,383
By the way, I flirted for 45 minutes with
Gary Deitman outside of school yesterday...

449
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:19,547
and he's this total horny little freak.

450
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,352
And I'm gonna bag him, big time.

451
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:25,919
Congratulations. I hope you and
his stupid buns will be very happy together!

452
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:35,000
<i>"David Fisher and Benjamin Cooper</i>
<i>invite you to a holiday open house. "</i>

453
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>"Merry Christmas from Ben and David."</i>

454
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:42,409
<i>"Happy Holidays from the Cooper-Fishers."</i>

455
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,508
"Fish & Coop, <i>new this fall on ABC."</i>

456
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,087
Keith, what's wrong?

457
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,250
I'm not sure.

458
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,896
Okay. Come in and sit down.

459
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:09,601
I shouldn't have even come here.

460
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:10,901
It's fine.

461
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,807
You want a beer?

462
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:16,368
- I have Rolling Rock or Amstel Light...
- I killed someone today.

463
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,142
- Oh, my God.
- It was this guy...

464
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,784
Him and his woman were having a fight.

465
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:27,386
They were obviously
both high on something.

466
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:29,355
He had a gun and...

467
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:32,486
I'm sure whatever it was,
you did the right thing.

468
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,620
He's dead, you fucking idiot!

469
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,966
I should have aimed at his arm or his leg.

470
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:42,603
I'm stupid.

471
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,707
I'm so fucking stupid.

472
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,141
I never killed someone before.

473
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,751
I can't live with this.

474
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,022
I don't know how to help you.

475
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,184
Do you want to pray?

476
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,458
Maybe that would do something.

477
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,685
David's not up yet?

478
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,760
So where's Emily Previn?

479
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,888
She's in there.

480
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:47,632
So she's not gonna have an open casket.

481
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:52,266
- I couldn't do it.
- Okay.

482
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:56,835
I was supposed to take the kids to dinner
so Vanessa could have the night off.

483
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,904
But instead, I was here.

484
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,181
Until 9:00 last night.

485
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:04,646
Skin was fricking pouring off
that woman's face!

486
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:08,521
I get all this shit from Vanessa,
and I wasn't able to restore the poor lady!

487
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:09,991
Nobody could have.

488
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,221
But, here, you think you can do it?

489
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,224
Here's some tools.

490
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:17,664
I want to watch you swim in that skin.
Go ahead!

491
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,497
All I said was okay.

492
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:29,909
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:35,379
I just wish I could've done her
the way she wanted.

494
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:40,082
If it'll make you feel any better, I don't think
there are even gonna be any mourners.

495
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,820
Thanks.

496
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:57,064
Hello?

497
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,702
It's me.

498
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:03,735
- I thought you were still here.
<i>- I had to get back home.</i>

499
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,074
Are you okay?

500
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,252
Yeah, I'm fine.

501
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,454
Listen, what happened last night,
that was wrong.

502
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:18,091
<i>I don't know why I went to you,</i>
<i>but obviously I wasn't thinking right.</i>

503
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:20,293
Obviously.

504
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,289
I'm in a relationship.

505
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,296
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

506
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:28,269
I just thought you and I could be friends...

507
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,669
but I was just kidding myself.

508
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:36,243
<i>Look, I don't think that you and I</i>
<i>should see each other anymore.</i>

509
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:43,543
David?

510
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,687
Yeah, I'm here. Sure, whatever you want.

511
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,852
I knew you would understand.

512
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:54,721
Goodbye.

513
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:56,891
Bye.

514
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:08,008
Thank you. That was intense.

515
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,873
You're practically like jelly.
You don't need this.

516
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:13,677
Maybe not, but I love it.

517
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,950
You're gifted, you know that?

518
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:20,148
Hello?

519
00:39:21,758 --> 00:39:25,854
Don't give me that bullshit.
I want your ass there in half an hour.

520
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,226
Okay, fuck you.
You are officially dead to me now.

521
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,494
Everything okay?

522
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:36,164
I have a client at 2:15,
and my watcher just cancelled.

523
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:37,637
Your watcher?

524
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:40,733
He likes to be watched
by another girl while I do him.

525
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,108
It's the easiest $100 in the world...

526
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:47,281
and this asshole just blew me off
for a runway audition.

527
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,079
God, I hate models.

528
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,678
Fuck.

529
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:56,454
If you're sitting in the corner depressed,
pick up.

530
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,254
Pick up.

531
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,396
All right, be depressed.

532
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:07,100
Listen, if you're in a jam...

533
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,499
This isn't a science project, honey.
This is business.

534
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:13,098
Please. You think I can't handle it?

535
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,511
Like I said, it's pretty easy.

536
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:25,349
Actually, it's like you're invisible.
Just sitting and watching.

537
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:26,684
I can do that.

538
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:29,953
I sit and watch all the time.
In fact, that's mostly all I do.

539
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:33,154
I guess you've been
in three-way situations before.

540
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,322
- I mean, who hasn't?
- Yeah.

541
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,761
Fuck.

542
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,900
I've never seen you this angry before.
It's terrific!

543
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:47,374
- No, my nephew made that.
- Sorry.

544
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,071
Here, talk to me.

545
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:53,343
This girl cheated on the SATs,
and now she's gonna get away with it.

546
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:56,247
Okay, what's this girl's name?

547
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,820
When I realized what was going on,
I just wanted to run and not take the test.

548
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,417
But I did. I took it, like an idiot.
And what was the point?

549
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:06,462
It's all just some stupid game.

550
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:08,963
I don't know what I want,
but I don't want this.

551
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,727
And this is your excuse to bail?

552
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,394
Bail? What's that?
Some hip lingo you think kids say?

553
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,304
- You are so lame sometimes.
- Direct your anger at me, if you need to.

554
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:21,776
By the way, you can fuck Parker McKenna,
but if I were you, I'd wear a condom...

555
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:24,439
because I'm sure she has hepatitis,
at the very least.

556
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,607
What are you talking about?

557
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:30,816
If you're referring to the conversation
I had with Parker, that's all it was.

558
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,218
A conversation.

559
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:36,281
I have conversations with lots
of young women. They approach me.

560
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,289
Claire, I'm worried about you.

561
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:42,122
Why?

562
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,860
You're getting your life together,
and it scares you.

563
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:48,734
So you want to slip into the old habit
of focusing on someone else's drama...

564
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:52,571
instead of concentrating on yourself.
You need to stop doing that.

565
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,147
You're right.

566
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:09,223
And now is probably as good a time as any
to talk about the sexual tension between us.

567
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,360
- What?
- It exists.

568
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,525
It's a part of transference
and counter-transference...

569
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:19,295
so we should acknowledge it's out there,
and it'll never be acted upon...

570
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,827
because to do so
would be irresponsible and destructive.

571
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:31,380
Do you have anything
that you would like to contribute?

572
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:34,049
No, I don't.

573
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:37,544
Okay.

574
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,955
I bet you I could glue this together
if I tried hard.

575
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:50,059
I know people
don't really glue things together anymore...

576
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,363
but I could probably fix this.

577
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,372
<i>You've reached the private line</i>
<i>of David Fisher.</i>

578
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:07,814
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

579
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:12,716
<i>Hi, David. It's Ben. I'm calling to figure out</i>
<i>what time's good for you on Saturday.</i>

580
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:17,392
<i>And I had a really good time last night,</i>
<i>especially the making out part.</i>

581
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,786
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

582
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,363
Yeah, honey.

583
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,200
You know exactly how I like it.

584
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:39,077
Come on. Move your tongue around it.

585
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:46,485
Yeah.

586
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:31,359
<i>And I am telling you</i>

587
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:35,226
<i>I'm not going</i>

588
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:40,035
<i>I'm the best man you'll ever know</i>

589
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,207
<i>There's no way I could ever go</i>

590
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,441
Nate, I love you!

591
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:03,889
Now that I've heard this song five times
in a row, I can honestly say I dislike it.

592
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:05,957
I'm here for the service.

593
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:09,830
Look around, nobody's here.
There's not gonna be any service.

594
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,431
I couldn't even get a minister,
and they get paid.

595
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:16,535
I've taken care of that.
Father Jack is on his way here right now.

596
00:45:16,612 --> 00:45:19,103
- Just give me 10 minutes.
- For what?

597
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,179
- Federico?
- Yes, Mrs. F?

598
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:29,155
Could you come upstairs, please?

599
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:36,057
Keith?

600
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:42,527
David, I need you for a few minutes.

601
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:45,005
- Mom, I have a headache.
- Too bad.

602
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:50,839
- But I'm in the middle of a show.
- Just do what I say!

603
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:53,381
And get out of those ragamuffin clothes.

604
00:46:00,656 --> 00:46:02,521
Why is this happening?

605
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:05,826
I don't know.
Our structures probably need new fencing.

606
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:09,854
- And our roofs had bad shingles.
- I had shingles once.

607
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:15,665
She was supposed to have an open casket.

608
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,767
I did the best I could, okay?

609
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:22,743
I didn't see you down there helping me out.

610
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:25,976
Leave it alone.

611
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:35,649
We gather to mourn
the passing of Emily Previn.

612
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:38,418
I did not know Emily Previn.

613
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:41,395
>From what I gather, few, if any, people did.

614
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:46,363
People might wonder what point there is
in leading a life...

615
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:48,835
where you don't touch any other lives.

616
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:52,164
But it would be arrogant of us
to assume that.

617
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:57,536
Every life is a contribution.
We just may not see how.

618
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,774
I'm glad to encounter Emily Previn,
even if it is in death.

619
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,617
Everyone comes into our life for a reason...

620
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:10,716
and it is our responsibility to learn
what they have to teach us.

621
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:16,988
Now, in accordance with Emily's wishes...

622
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:20,001
I will read
from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.

623
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,799
<i>Strange, but somehow I feel like Emily won.</i>

624
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:26,537
She remains a fucking question mark
right up to the bitter end.

625
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:31,444
Basically all I know about her is that
she kept Wheat Thins in her refrigerator.

626
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,108
That's something.

627
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:37,152
So, tell your mother
I have to get back to work.

628
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,116
Unlike some people.

629
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:44,217
I'm sorry, Federico, but I have a headache.
Am I not allowed to have a headache?

630
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,731
- It's so good to see you.
- Hello, Father.

631
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,870
How is everything at St. Stephen's?

632
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,737
It's okay.

633
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,944
Apropos of what I said earlier,
I wanted to thank you, David.

634
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:08,109
I'm really glad you came into my life.

635
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:11,312
You will never know
how much you taught me about myself.

636
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,151
Really? How so?

637
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,087
Another time, maybe.

638
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,627
- You look a little sad.
- I have a headache.

639
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:24,493
Well, God bless.

640
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:32,635
David, come over here. There's something
I want to say to the three of you.

641
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:36,903
Oh, Lord, our gutters are clogged. I think
we need to see about removing the leaves.

642
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:38,708
That's very funny, Claire.

643
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:41,142
I know you think the plan is ridiculous.

644
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,947
- No, we don't.
- We just think it's weird.

645
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:48,214
Did any one of you wonder why I felt
the need to change the structure of my life?

646
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,986
Did you even care?

647
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:56,022
At first I didn't understand
why I was so upset about Emily Previn.

648
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:59,295
Then it hit me. I don't want to turn into her.

649
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,629
Life is hard enough
without not having people to help you.

650
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:05,299
- But, Mom, you have us.
- I do not.

651
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:09,537
Nate, you've been walking around
like a zombie for months.

652
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,170
You're lying in bed during the day,
God knows why.

653
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,909
I have a headache.

654
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,415
Claire, I can't even look in your direction...

655
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,545
without you acting like
it's some incredible imposition.

656
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:23,991
All I want is for us not to be strangers.
I want some intimacy.

657
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:26,723
Give me intimacy.

658
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,890
Won't any of you have intimacy with me?

659
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,998
Okay, I guess I have my answer.

660
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:40,968
Mom, wait.

661
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:45,309
I just think that intimacy should happen
a little more organically than this.

662
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:48,782
Fine. Then I'll simply wait for it
like I have been.

663
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:53,720
I just pray that it happens
before I end up like Emily Previn.

664
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,923
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

665
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:09,732
<i>When I saw you typing at your computer,</i>
<i>you had the strangest expression.</i>

666
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,707
I was writing. It's called flow.

667
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:15,906
You know all about flow, don't you?

668
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,206
Let me ask you a question.

669
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,378
Do you think you and I have
as much intimacy as you want?

670
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,721
I don't have as much of anything as I want.

671
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:35,129
That's not really much of an answer.

672
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:38,064
It wasn't really much of a question.

673
00:50:40,669 --> 00:50:42,864
Did you remember to lock the door?

674
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:46,430
Yes, I did, for the second time.
You've been acting strange tonight.

675
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:49,603
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've been all jumpy.

676
00:50:58,721 --> 00:50:59,847
Oh, God.

677
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,481
Okay, something has been on my mind.

678
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:21,432
Nate Fisher...

679
00:51:23,846 --> 00:51:25,677
would you be my wife?

680
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:30,917
My God, this isn't what I was expecting.

681
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,687
- Is that a no?
- No, of course not.

682
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:40,961
It is kind of an ugly ring.
It's got these Greek letters on it.

683
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:45,122
Delta Phi Delta.
It's my grandfather's fraternity ring.

684
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,726
I found it when I was cleaning up...

685
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,472
and that's when I got the idea...

686
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,200
to propose to you.

687
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:00,138
So why today?

688
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,482
I don't know.

689
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:06,445
I just started thinking...

690
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,150
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

691
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:15,857
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,461
Promise?

693
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,014
Of course I'll marry you.
I love you. Absolutely.

694
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:35,510
I love you. Yeah, let's get married!

695
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:38,519
Yes! Let's get married!

696
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:39,849
Come on!

697
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:44,283
I love you, too.
