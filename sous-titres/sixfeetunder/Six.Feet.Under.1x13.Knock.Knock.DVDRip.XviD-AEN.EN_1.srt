1
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,094
Expansion has slowed,
but then the economy has slowed.

2
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,495
It's only natural.

3
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:47,420
No, growth is the only thing
that is natural, Mr. Gilardi.

4
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,420
And growth is the only thing
that is acceptable.

5
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,461
Now, I know that may sound harsh,
but it's the truth.

6
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,615
To accept anything less
is sheer laziness.

7
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:59,622
And if there's one thing
I can't abide, it is laziness.

8
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:01,462
I've been watching you.

9
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,781
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. You're smart.

10
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,253
You're ambitious.

11
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:12,183
You're also shallow and amoral.
I like that in a man.

12
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,976
Kroehner needs new funeral homes.
We got a serious cash-flow problem.

13
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,656
We need new real estate that we can
unload at a profit.

14
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,541
Because we're not exactly liquid
at the moment. Understand?

15
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:23,546
- I do.
- I need at least three new homes...

16
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,626
...in L.A. Before the end of the year.

17
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,342
- Three?
- That's right, three.

18
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,859
And I'm making you responsible
for finding them.

19
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,461
Now, I would only do that
if I thought that you were up to it.

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,100
- Any questions?
- No, ma'am.

21
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,745
Fuck you with the "ma'am" shit!

22
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,581
Call me that again, I'll have your balls
on a plate, your spleen on a stick...

23
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,387
...and your heart wrapped and FedEx'd
to your mama, all right?

24
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:47,153
- All right.
- All right.

25
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,348
Fuck.

26
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,388
Mrs. Huntley, are you all right?

27
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,587
Yeah, I'm fine.

28
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:02,348
I shouldn't have had escargot at lunch.
Little fuckers always give me heartburn.

29
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:09,227
Hey, let's quit after this hole.

30
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:11,270
I need a drink.

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,309
Goddamn it, I hooked it!

32
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,768
Hi.

33
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,283
David, something awful's happened.
I didn't know where else to turn.

34
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,250
Tracy, I'm sorry you're having trouble,
but I thought it was clear...

35
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,727
I need to arrange a funeral.

36
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,412
Yes, my Aunt Lilian.

37
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:26,003
She was only the most important
person in my whole life.

38
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:29,570
What? You thought I was here
for some other reason?

39
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:34,054
Oh, David, please.
You need to get over yourself.

40
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:37,015
All right, this won't be hard.
I'm massively organized.

41
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,571
I'm a professional party planner.
Did you know that?

42
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:43,133
I did this huge party for New Line
for the Golden Globes last year.

43
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:47,809
The Hollywood Reporter
called it "resplendent." And it was.

44
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:51,847
Aunt Lilian's funeral needs
to be equally resplendent.

45
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,734
I need these programs by tomorrow
afternoon at the latest, George.

46
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,377
You've been such a good supplier to me.
I'd hate to see that relationship end.

47
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,820
Oh, great. Thank you.
Okay, bye, now.

48
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,057
All right, that takes care of that.

49
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:08,981
Now I have to go to Harry Winston's,
see if they'll loan me...

50
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,332
...something fabulous
for Aunt Lilian's viewing.

51
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,613
- I just need you to sign...
- I'm serious, David.

52
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:18,739
Don't worry about the cost.
She practically raised me. I owe her.

53
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,297
Besides...

54
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:21,654
...she was loaded.

55
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:24,425
And also I intend to sue
the pants off that country club.

56
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,140
- I still need a signature...
- I've had it out for them...

57
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,940
...ever since my debut,
when one of the Chinese busboys...

58
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:34,538
...made a really inappropriate comment
about the neckline of my dress.

59
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,586
I'll be faxing you.

60
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,420
Jesus Christ, Nate,
what took you so long?

61
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,464
I told you, I was taking
the Funeral Directors' Licensing Exam.

62
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,464
I had to finish or wait
until next March to take it again.

63
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:54,582
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

64
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,944
It's just...

65
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,751
I have to go see Billy in the hospital.

66
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,864
I have to, Nate.

67
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:09,032
- All right.
- He needs me. I can feel it.

68
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:14,428
- Will you come with me, please?
- Of course.

69
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:16,868
Thank you.

70
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:21,669
- So, what're you up to this weekend?
- I don't know.

71
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:24,789
Probably come up with some
creative way to avoid my family.

72
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:28,388
- Why?
- I'm having this big party on Saturday.

73
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,031
Yeah?

74
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:33,709
Yeah, my dad and my stepmom
are renewing their vows in Hawaii.

75
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,354
- You're not going?
- No way.

76
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,678
They do this, like, every six months.
It's so not a big deal.

77
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,033
And guess who has the keys
to her dad's total party house in Bel Air.

78
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,154
I'm beginning to see how this
Little Miss Perfect act pays off.

79
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,672
Yeah, why do you think I do it?

80
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:54,637
So, what's up with you and Mr. OD?

81
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:57,916
Shut up.

82
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:01,801
No, I was just wondering
if he's, like, you know...

83
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,597
...over it.

84
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:07,081
Yeah, he is.

85
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,516
He's incredibly strong.

86
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:12,922
He's much stronger than he thinks.

87
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,478
Well, that's a good thing, right?

88
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:19,959
I guess.

89
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:23,366
Bring him to the party if you want.

90
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,366
Okay, I will.

91
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,008
I'm sure he hates me.

92
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,527
The one person he thought he could
count on, and I had him committed.

93
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,848
Well, it was for his own good.

94
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:41,286
He always felt the entire world
was against him.

95
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,211
It's all because
of my fucking mother.

96
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,769
She had children as, like,
fashion accessories.

97
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:50,252
You had no choice. He could've
harmed himself. He did harm himself.

98
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,963
I'm so afraid of what
he's gonna say to me.

99
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,815
Brenda, you cannot let
him hurt you anymore.

100
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,448
For your good and for his.

101
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:03,888
What if he thinks I hurt him?

102
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,967
- What if he's right?
- You saved him.

103
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,615
I'll go by Bristol Farms and pick up some
of those dried Porcini mushrooms.

104
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,894
You wanna take me out to dinner?

105
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,060
No, there's nothing wrong
with that, it's just...

106
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:30,539
Hiram, do you realize that you've
never taken me out before?

107
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:35,021
I suppose because of Nathaniel we just
always got in the habit of staying in.

108
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,101
I have to run.

109
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:40,615
Can you pick me up at...?
Is 8 too late?

110
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,339
No, at the house. Bye, now.

111
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,695
- I need you to stay and work tonight.
- What?

112
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,863
It's very busy right now.

113
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,183
We have three unfilled orders,
that's nothing.

114
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,379
And Robbie's coming in
at 6 tomorrow morning.

115
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,626
It's coming up on Father's Day,
very busy time.

116
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:04,139
No one sends flowers for Father's Day,
which is the day after tomorrow.

117
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:06,420
You think we'll get
a rush of orders tonight?

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,541
Yes, you have to stay.

119
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,102
Change your plans.

120
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,389
No.

121
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,865
This is my business!
I am boss here.

122
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:22,748
I'm not debating that. But your authority
does not extend to my personal life.

123
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:26,230
I don't care about
your ridiculous personal life.

124
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:30,103
Going to sleep someplace
outside in a tent, like refugee.

125
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:33,352
Yes, you do. You don't like me seeing
Hiram because you're jealous!

126
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,707
It's no longer flattering.
It's just irritating. I have chosen Hiram!

127
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,353
I'm sorry if I somehow made you
feel that's not the case, because it is!

128
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:43,589
I wish you'd stop behaving
like a spoiled child!

129
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,675
I've dealt with enough children
in my life.

130
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:50,316
I'm finally at the point where they get
along without me, and I won't go back!

131
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,555
You are fired!

132
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,599
- You can't do that.
- I just do do that!

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,396
Now you can go. Get out of here,
you're fired. Go on, get out!

134
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,313
It's a piece of cake.

135
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,598
Just the one bump on her head
and a pretty big bruise.

136
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,517
But most of it's covered by her hair,
which, lucky for us...

137
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,158
...is remarkably thick
for a woman her age.

138
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,003
What?!

139
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,435
Tracy wants to change the casket,
the flowers...

140
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:28,241
...the music and the times
of the viewing. And the ceremony.

141
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:31,723
How am I supposed to put together
a resplendent funeral in two days...

142
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,806
...when she can't make up
her fucking mind?

143
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:39,206
By telling her that once she signs
a contract she can't pull any of this shit.

144
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:43,920
- That's what I'd do. If I was a partner.
- Which you're not, so let me handle this.

145
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:48,840
I need you to do everything you can to
make her look the best she possibly can.

146
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,525
- I always do that, David.
- Of course you do, Federico.

147
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:55,930
It's just that it's a very important funeral,
and we stand to make a lot of money.

148
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:59,887
- Which I won't see any of.
- We just gave you a raise.

149
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,006
Do you want me to come with you?

150
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,574
No, I don't want him
to know that you're here.

151
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,251
I'll be right out here
if you need me.

152
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,019
Okay.

153
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,462
Billy?

154
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,623
Hi.

155
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:04,819
Hi.

156
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,097
How're you doing?

157
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,459
- Fine.
- Yeah?

158
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,259
Yeah.

159
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:17,424
Whatever I was feeling before
I'm not feeling now.

160
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm so sorry, Billy.

161
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,906
It's so weird.

162
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,508
I love you more than anything...

163
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:32,183
...and I could've seriously hurt you.

164
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,830
It all made sense at the time.

165
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:47,426
- You know...
- I hate this.

166
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:52,146
I hate that my blood
makes me crazy.

167
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,354
I hate that I can't function
without being chemically altered.

168
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:58,946
- I hate that I fucked up your life.
- You haven't.

169
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:03,551
- I did that on my own.
- No, you deserve to be happy.

170
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,356
I don't.

171
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,954
I must have some weird-ass karma.

172
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,077
- We both do.
- No, it's just me.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,913
The fact that I could've
hurt you like that...

174
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,953
...upsets me like nothing ever has.

175
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,119
And when I look at you...

176
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:32,757
...all I want to say is I'm sorry.

177
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,920
Please forgive me.

178
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:44,001
And inside I feel like tears
are streaming down my cheeks.

179
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,284
But they're not, are they?

180
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:54,159
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

181
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:57,563
Just because I can't.

182
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,646
You be happy.

183
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,406
I want you to be happy.
I'll be happy if you are.

184
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,441
Okay.

185
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:15,409
I'm so lost...

186
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:18,283
...inside.

187
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,527
I wish that I could get out.

188
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,806
- But I don't think I ever will.
- You'll be all right.

189
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,613
- You'll be okay.
- It's all right.

190
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,175
It's okay.

191
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,814
You're so beautiful.

192
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,328
How come there's no home movies
of me when I was a kid?

193
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,293
I'm not sure.

194
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:05,050
After I bought that new super-8 camera,
we filmed everything the boys did.

195
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:08,853
After you came along, I guess
we sort of felt like, you know...

196
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,531
...been there, done that.

197
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:16,215
Yeah, I know. Which made me feel,
like, totally secondary, thank you.

198
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,621
Cheer up, kitten.

199
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:22,376
Maybe some of that attention
you never got will motivate you...

200
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:26,898
...to get off your lazy ass and do
something interesting with your life.

201
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:37,698
I got fired today.

202
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,786
- That sucks.
- Yes, it does.

203
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,147
If you wanna know the truth,
I was a victim of sexual harassment.

204
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,944
- What?
- Nikolai wanted me to work late...

205
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,223
...to keep me from dinner with Hiram.
When I refused, he fired me.

206
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:53,703
- Oh, my God. What a dork!
- I know. Can you believe it?

207
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,470
I have a good mind
to call a lawyer.

208
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,947
Well, it sounds like you're
better off out of there.

209
00:15:58,153 --> 00:16:00,872
I have a certificate in floral arranging.
I can get a job anywhere.

210
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:03,872
- Screw Nikolai.
- Exactly.

211
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,713
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

212
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:18,426
- Sure, I've thought about it, but...
- We've been together almost a year.

213
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:23,314
And you practically live at my house.
You've seen me at my worst.

214
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:27,227
- What other information do you need?
- We've been together six months, Bren.

215
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,549
I didn't realize you
were counting the days.

216
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,750
- I'm not...
- What, you mark them off at night?

217
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,430
Like a prisoner in his cell,
like the Count of fucking Monte Cristo?

218
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,676
Since when are you so hot on marriage?

219
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:42,916
Well, I need to know where this is going.
I need to know if I'm wasting my time.

220
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:46,512
- What if I wanna have children?
- Well, you said you didn't.

221
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:50,841
Well, do you?
I mean, you're what, 35?

222
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,399
What's the longest relationship
you've ever been in?

223
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:55,356
- This one.
- Yeah, well, that's pathetic.

224
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:58,557
You haven't had a serious
relationship since fucking high school.

225
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:02,115
At least I've had a serious relationship.
At least I know what one is.

226
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,284
You know how many guys would've left
after all the psycho shit...

227
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:08,160
...you've put me through?
- Now we're getting to the point.

228
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:10,437
This is what's really going on,
you wanna bail.

229
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,558
No, you want me to bail!

230
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,087
Look out!

231
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,921
Hey, Augusto's christening
is Sunday afternoon.

232
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,601
We're thinking about
having a party afterwards.

233
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:34,531
For my folks and Vanessa's and...

234
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:39,092
Well, our place is a little small.

235
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:45,251
You think we could have it here?

236
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:50,809
Right now, Lilian Montrose's viewing
is scheduled for 3 to 6, so...

237
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:54,128
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I was thinking after that.

238
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:58,006
I'm only asking because I...

239
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,215
I still think of your family
as my family.

240
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:04,417
And...

241
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,854
I really want you all to be there.

242
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,818
Sure.

243
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,250
We'd be happy to let
you have the party here.

244
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,216
Thanks, boss.

245
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:20,857
Could you load me a hypodermic
with some phenol solution for this bump?

246
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,859
Wouldn't you rather
start with a compress?

247
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:26,975
Why? An injection will get rid of the
swelling and take care of the bruising.

248
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:31,699
- You're getting better at this, Dave.
- Thank you, Federico.

249
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,337
Oh, great, now what? Tracy's decided
to have Aunt Lilian cremated...

250
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:38,979
...and her ashes placed
in a Faberg'e egg?

251
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,653
Can we do it by 7 tonight?

252
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:45,495
- I think you should look at this.
- Well, what is it?

253
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:49,582
Oh, good grief.

254
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,667
Adult female, unrestrained driver,
unconscious upon arrival.

255
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,985
Now responsive only
to painful stimuli.

256
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:04,069
Blood pressure, 86/40. Pulse, 130.
Respiration, 36 and shallow.

257
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,420
- Brenda?
- She has a large scalp emulsion.

258
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,947
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Trachea's midline, neck veins are flat.

259
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:13,827
- Lactated ringers.
- What happened? What happened?

260
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:15,903
Patient two, adult male...

261
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:19,947
Sir, you've been in an accident.
Just stay calm, okay? Everything's fine.

262
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:23,624
Adult male, he's alert now
but confused, no memory of accident.

263
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:27,625
- Why is her head in that thing?
- She had an injury. She's gonna be okay.

264
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,945
- Is she dead?
- She's fine. She's gonna be fine.

265
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:41,746
- How's your sea bass?
- Delicious, thank you.

266
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:47,351
Ruth, I need to tell you
something, and...

267
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,510
- I'm not proud of this.
- What is it?

268
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,110
I've met someone.

269
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:02,313
I never meant for this to happen.
I wasn't looking.

270
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:06,151
Yes, well, that's always
when it does happen.

271
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:10,792
Well, I'm not sure quite how to...
Oh, boy.

272
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:15,122
- I'm not quite sure how to say this.
- For heaven's sake, spit it out.

273
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:19,039
I'd like to pursue it.

274
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:23,285
Things between you and I have felt...
Well, not exactly...

275
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:26,805
And I feel a bond
with this new person that...

276
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,082
Well, the beginnings of a bond,
that could be something quite profound.

277
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,926
All right.

278
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,963
I thought you'd be more upset.

279
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,400
I would've thought the same thing.

280
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,330
Hiram, please. Go, explore.

281
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:51,039
You owe it to yourself
and whoever she is.

282
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,080
Maybe the two of you could have
something, as you say, profound.

283
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,682
Lord knows we don't.

284
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:00,965
Well, if it was, this would be a lot more
difficult, wouldn't it?

285
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,812
Oh, it is difficult...

286
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,812
...for me.

287
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:10,883
Let's order dessert.
That'll cheer you up.

288
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,331
Hey, you.

289
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,736
Doctor says you're gonna be okay.

290
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:32,813
Well, I like hearing that.

291
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,218
- What about you?
- I'm okay.

292
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,089
Banged up, but apparently
nothing broken.

293
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,220
I'm sorry I almost killed you.

294
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:48,734
Goddamn it. This is gonna send my
car insurance premiums through the roof.

295
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,141
When you were unconscious,
I prayed.

296
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,661
You know how long
it's been since I prayed?

297
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,663
And I've never prayed like this.

298
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:06,945
So because of me,
you've become...

299
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:09,217
...born again.

300
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:11,305
I'm so sorry.

301
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,941
You are one incredibly difficult
and sometimes infuriating woman.

302
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,218
And I cannot imagine
my life without you.

303
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,664
Promise me you'll be a better driver.

304
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,384
Promise me you'll take care of yourself
and you'll live as long as you can.

305
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:31,823
Because I don't know
what I'd do if I lost you.

306
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:35,703
So if you wanna get married,
I'm all for it.

307
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:38,746
Okay, maybe I was overreacting.

308
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:45,705
Let's just take one step
at a time, shall we?

309
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,513
Okay.

310
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:59,635
- Oh, my God. What a bad dream.
- Yeah.

311
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,672
Father Jack doesn't deny he performed
a commitment ceremony for two lesbians.

312
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,471
Privately, not in the church.

313
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,798
The Lambeth Conference resolution
on sexuality expressly condemns...

314
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,798
...the blessing of same-sex unions...

315
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,437
...and councils against ordination
of those involved.

316
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:22,678
Whether or not we agree
with this resolution...

317
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:28,799
Do we really want our children learning
from a man that ignores God's laws?

318
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:32,041
I think we should ask Jack to leave.

319
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:36,073
And so do James and Owen,
and I'm guessing David feels the same.

320
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,477
Actually, I don't.

321
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:48,245
The church rejects homosexual practice
as incompatible with Scripture.

322
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:51,485
So because of their random genetics,
gay people should be denied...

323
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:55,044
...any romantic or sexual love?
- That is liberal claptrap.

324
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:58,207
It's not genetics.
It can be overcome.

325
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:00,765
Walter, the only way you could
know that for sure...

326
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:06,284
...is if it's something that you overcame.
- And the only way you couldn't know...

327
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:10,963
...is if it's something you're not strong
enough to overcome.

328
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:14,848
Are you gay, David?

329
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:19,045
Yes.

330
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,569
Then his vote cannot be counted here.

331
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,653
That's ridiculous.
He's a deacon. He gets a vote.

332
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,971
David does not obey
the laws of the church.

333
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,566
Without his vote, it's an even split.
How do you plan to resolve the matter?

334
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,767
I think we should
get the bishop involved.

335
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:35,490
You sure you wanna do that?

336
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,409
Okay, we talked about the flowers.

337
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:40,769
I gave you the CD I burned
with music for the viewing.

338
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,616
I wish David were here.

339
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:47,734
I'd much prefer to go over things with
him than with some underling, but...

340
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,616
Oh, no. No.

341
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,413
No. This won't do.

342
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,054
What?

343
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,651
Well, this right here,
there's a nick in the wood.

344
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,615
Oh, no, that's part of the grain.

345
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:05,495
I don't think so.

346
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,854
All right, well, we'll just have to return it
and then get a new one.

347
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,816
That's not possible.

348
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:14,142
I'm sorry?

349
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:18,055
There's nothing wrong with this casket.
Even if there was, it's too late...

350
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:21,542
...to get another like it by tomorrow.
- I don't care how much it costs.

351
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:24,704
This isn't about cost. There's not
another one of these available.

352
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:27,546
We had to ship this one down
from San Francisco as it was.

353
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:30,786
I'm very unhappy about this.

354
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:37,307
If you want to call it off,
I can bring your aunt's body up...

355
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,386
...and you can take it
somewhere else.

356
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:41,148
Okay?

357
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:47,709
Hello?

358
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,992
Hiram, there's nothing to talk about.

359
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,389
No, I'm not angry.

360
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:56,426
Oh, Mom, I'll probably be spending
tonight at a friend's house.

361
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:58,112
What friend?

362
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,384
- Parker McKenna.
- I don't know any Parker.

363
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:03,427
- Well, you haven't met her yet.
- Oh, good grief!

364
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:05,944
Hiram, you're the one
who wanted to break up.

365
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:10,312
I'm sorry if you're having
second thoughts, because I'm not.

366
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:13,746
Men can be so stupid.

367
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,071
Yeah.

368
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:19,075
I'd like for you to have
Parker's mother call me, okay?

369
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,829
Okay.

370
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,762
Oh, Nate, glad you're here.

371
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,277
Need to talk to you later.

372
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,711
- About what?
- In private.

373
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:51,121
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

374
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,554
Oh, God.

375
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:58,957
I was having the most
incredible dream.

376
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:01,956
I was swimming with dolphins.

377
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:05,125
Only we weren't swimming,
we were flying.

378
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:09,005
Oh, and Drew Barrymore was there.

379
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,358
Whatever you are on,
I would like some of it.

380
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,365
She was like my best friend.

381
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:16,083
- How's your headache today?
- It's better.

382
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,325
Oh, my God, and there
was this shark following us...

383
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,760
...and I think it was Courtney Love.

384
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,520
- How'd she look?
- She was in Versace.

385
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:30,565
Are we supposed to believe
that the same God who made us...

386
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:34,048
...wants us to be lonely and frustrated
while the rest of the world's...

387
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,450
...free to make love and have families?
- No, God isn't that cruel.

388
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:41,647
- Good for you for marrying two lesbians.
- My high school girlfriend.

389
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,571
Who do you think sent that fax?

390
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:46,686
Walter swears it wasn't him.

391
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:49,615
I am so fucking tired
of being ashamed.

392
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:03,608
We'll just fight back, you and me.
We'll fight them. Walter's just a bully.

393
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:07,732
- We'll just bully him back.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

394
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,090
I've agreed to not officiate
at any other gay weddings.

395
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,334
And you get to stay.

396
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:21,978
- How do you feel about that?
- Relieved.

397
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:24,817
I've put in almost six years
here at St. Bart's.

398
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,901
And I'd really prefer not to have
to start over somewhere new.

399
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,776
Not at this point in my life.

400
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:34,415
And I have a favor to ask of you.

401
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:39,136
I need you to resign as deacon.

402
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,225
Otherwise, Walter will keep making
noise until he gets his way...

403
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:46,941
...and I'd really prefer
not to get the bishop involved.

404
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:50,504
- Jack, you can't give in to them.
- I know which battles can be won, David.

405
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,300
This is not one of them.

406
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:57,827
I guess I just thought
that you were...

407
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,942
I don't know, braver than that.

408
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,549
I'm tired.

409
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:09,866
I'm tired of trying to make it better here
and never succeeding because of politics.

410
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,868
I just don't have it in me right now.

411
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:14,665
But how can you...?

412
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:17,345
You're gay.

413
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,185
No, I'm not.

414
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,713
I'm not.

415
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:25,554
People have always assumed that.

416
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:27,473
But I'm not.

417
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:29,834
Sorry.

418
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,115
More Scotch?

419
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,956
No, thanks.

420
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:45,358
I...

421
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,314
- I really don't wanna be here.
- Oh, get over yourself.

422
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,912
I know you and Parker had sex, so what?
You're not the first guy I slept with.

423
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:56,874
Right, but am I the last?

424
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,640
Maybe.

425
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,791
If he's gonna get me
in here, I'll use it, but...

426
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,722
Oh, my God.

427
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:10,798
What the fuck do these people do?

428
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:15,078
Her father's, like, some movie bigwig.
I think.

429
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:20,719
Invitation only.

430
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,885
- Okay, this is tragic.
- We can always leave.

431
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:27,318
Let's just find the bar.
Excuse me?

432
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,243
Excuse me, do you know
where the bar is?

433
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:32,797
- Over there.
- Right.

434
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,280
- Where's Parker?
- It's not her house.

435
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:41,039
This is a porn party. I'm telling you,
they're shooting a porno here.

436
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:47,401
What the fuck is that?

437
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,681
- Faggot.
- Hey, shut up. My brother's a faggot.

438
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,566
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

439
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:59,283
Let's just say hi and leave, okay?

440
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:03,044
Oh, no, this could be kind of fun.

441
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:04,734
Come on.

442
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:07,091
- Hey, Parker.
- Hey.

443
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,252
This is a really nice house
you've got here.

444
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:12,368
I know. So, like, of course
I don't get to live here.

445
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:14,772
I just get to trash it
when they're gone.

446
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:17,891
This is Warren. This is Claire.

447
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:19,850
- Nice to meet you.
- And...

448
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:21,411
Gabriel.

449
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,371
This is what concerns me, this area
of decreased attenuation. It's very faint.

450
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,371
Doesn't look like there's an acute injury,
but something's not right.

451
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,652
Well, she's gonna be all right,
isn't she?

452
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:42,416
These are your CAT scan results,
Nate.

453
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,541
- Mine?
- Don't worry about Brenda.

454
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,734
Hers was totally clean.

455
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,655
So, what do you think it is?

456
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:55,425
I'd like to give you a shot
of contrast dye...

457
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,743
...and do another CAT scan
to really know.

458
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,059
Oh, hello, Mrs. Fisher?

459
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:09,056
This is Elise McKenna, Parker's
stepmother. Claire asked me to call you.

460
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:12,305
Yes, I just wanted to be sure
there's proper adult supervision...

461
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:15,660
...if she's staying there.
- Oh, absolutely. Yes, of course.

462
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,188
Don't worry for a minute.

463
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:18,539
All right, then,

464
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,899
I don't want her drinking.

465
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,907
There isn 't even any liquor
in the house,

466
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,227
You see, my husband
and I are both alcoholics.

467
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:28,345
And Parker's fresh out of rehab.
So we'll take really good care of Claire.

468
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,981
I promise, Kisses,

469
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:38,945
- That was mean.
- What?

470
00:32:40,314 --> 00:32:42,066
A Hollywood ass-waxing party.

471
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:46,154
- Everybody's wearing leather or rubber.
- Seriously, bro, seriously.

472
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:49,826
- Rip those fucking nipple-rings out.
- No shit.

473
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:54,315
Where were you last night? I called you,
and your mom was all, "I don't know."

474
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,594
I was hanging with my girl.

475
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:01,513
Okay, well, while you were
getting your toes sucked...

476
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:05,029
...we sucked down a free sixer
from 7-Eleven.

477
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,190
- Fuck, we pulled a beer cow.
- A beer cow, dude, that's the shit.

478
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,437
Hell yeah, a fucking beer cow.

479
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:15,917
Dink, shut the fuck up, dude.
What the fuck is a beer cow?

480
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,239
Oh, shit, it was mad.
So we go to buy some beer, right?

481
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:22,355
And we get to the counter,
but it's like, nobody has enough cash.

482
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:27,558
So Dink just starts fucking mooing
at the top of his lungs at this guy, right?

483
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:30,557
So I'm like, "Fuck it."
So I start mooing too.

484
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:32,517
Oh, yeah, but really fucking loud.

485
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,317
Like we just might totally go nuts.

486
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,322
The guy was so fucking scared of us.

487
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,801
It was hilarious, man.
It was a total movie moment.

488
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,679
Fuck yeah, and then we grab
all the beer and we fly.

489
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,323
We laughed for, like, five straight hours.
It was the shit.

490
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,758
Yeah, dude. A beer cow, right?

491
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:50,087
We gotta do that shit again, man.

492
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:53,008
I haven't had that much fun
since I was, like, 6.

493
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,289
- Fucking beer cow, right?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:57,969
Fuck.

495
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,210
Well...

496
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:08,849
...we did find something
that concerns me.

497
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,652
My guess would be that it's AVM.

498
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,324
- Arteriovenous malformation.
- What the fuck is that?

499
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:24,686
Abnormally enlarged and intertwined
blood vessels in your brain.

500
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,692
Have you been experiencing
any headaches?

501
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,445
Yeah, I get headaches.
I take Advil, they go away.

502
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:33,206
Any vertigo, nausea,
problems with your balance?

503
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,406
Nope.

504
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:37,815
- Any fluctuation in your field of vision?
- Like what?

505
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:40,896
Like a fluttering
in your peripheral vision?

506
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,093
- Once.
- Do the headaches seem to affect...

507
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,256
...one side of the head
more than the other?

508
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,008
The left side. Sometimes.

509
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,658
Well, I would like to schedule
an MRI for you as soon as possible.

510
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:56,940
What's the worst-case scenario
here?

511
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:02,054
- Nate, it's way too early for that.
- You fucking tell me.

512
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:08,973
Not all vascular malfunctions
of the brain become symptomatic.

513
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,257
Some, however, carry
a significant risk of hemorrhage.

514
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:13,818
So I could have a stroke?

515
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:17,063
You could be at a higher risk
for stroke or seizure than most.

516
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:20,019
We need to do more tests
to be certain.

517
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:25,982
Could I die from this?

518
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,622
It's possible. Yes.

519
00:35:31,188 --> 00:35:34,261
There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
I mean, I don't smoke.

520
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:37,780
I haven't had any red meat since 1989.
I run three miles a day.

521
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,709
Don't blow this out of proportion.

522
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,948
There are treatments,
surgical options.

523
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:48,111
Even if it is AVM,
you could live for another 50 years.

524
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,709
However, I would like to run
a full cardiovascular profile on you...

525
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:54,427
...before you continue
with the running, okay?

526
00:35:56,193 --> 00:36:00,312
This happened yesterday? For heaven's
sake, why didn't you call me earlier?

527
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:02,671
Because I thought I was okay.

528
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:07,114
- Well, you are okay, aren't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

529
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,511
I'm a nervous wreck.

530
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:12,106
Are you all right, dear?

531
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,670
Yes, thank you.

532
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:17,507
Well, I want you both to promise me
that you'll be more careful from now on.

533
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,515
We promise.

534
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:22,191
Oh, boy.

535
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,996
This time it's personal.

536
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,391
What's wrong?

537
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,879
Nothing.

538
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:43,513
- So how old did you say you were?
- How old do you want me to be?

539
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,396
Parker?

540
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,676
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
- What do you want?

541
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:51,837
Nothing, I was just looking
for Gabe. I'm sorry.

542
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:03,480
You drop a beer,
you have to pay for it.

543
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,160
No, no, no, no.

544
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:07,357
Moo.

545
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,677
Moo.

546
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,159
Hey, say "moo."

547
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,403
- Where the fuck did you get that?
- Say "moo."

548
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:26,571
- Moo.
- Now get the money out of the register.

549
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,721
Go get the fucking car!

550
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:38,252
Moo.

551
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:46,253
- So do you think I should resign?
- What do you want to do?

552
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,924
I don't wanna belong to a church
that's so intolerant.

553
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,970
And I don't wanna waste my time
with a fight that can't be won.

554
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:53,974
But I don't wanna just take it either.

555
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:58,376
I've been doing that my whole fucking
life, and I'm fucking sick to death of it.

556
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:03,255
And to top it all off, I'm scheduled to do
a devotional reading in Mass tomorrow.

557
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:06,258
- You gonna do it?
- Of course.

558
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,577
They're not gonna intimidate me
into just disappearing.

559
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,616
Oh, I came out to my mother.

560
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,655
- You're kidding.
- It was really uncomfortable.

561
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,572
- How's she taking it?
- Hard to tell. She's as weird as always.

562
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:29,934
Thanks for meeting me here today.
I just had to talk about it to somebody.

563
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,375
And I could always talk to you.

564
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:37,424
Well, I'm glad that we've managed
to remain friends.

565
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:42,581
Listen, I gotta run.
I'm meeting Eddie later.

566
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:47,306
Hey, he said he saw you
at the candlelight vigil for Marc Foster.

567
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:51,977
Yeah, yeah, I was driving by
on my way home.

568
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,021
Okay. Well, thanks again.

569
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,389
Yeah, well, let me know
how it all turns out.

570
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,144
I will.

571
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,828
- Take care, David.
- You too.

572
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:14,143
Tell Eddie I said hi.

573
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:39,275
Don't you wanna do what those
really cool kids in there are doing?

574
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,037
No.

575
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,595
Where's your boyfriend?

576
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,997
I don't know.

577
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,916
I like him.

578
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:53,954
- You do?
- Yeah, something about him.

579
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,312
Can't quite put my finger on it.

580
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:15,636
- Hey.
- Hey. Where'd you go?

581
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:18,920
We just went to get
some more beer.

582
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:25,160
- Why, did you miss me?
- Not that much, ego man.

583
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,210
Hi.

584
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,365
Can I help you?

585
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,643
I'd like to speak to David,
if at all possible.

586
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,684
Well, he's not here right now.

587
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:56,648
- Well, where is he?
- I'm not sure. Perhaps I can help you.

588
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,129
Perhaps you can.
That remains to be seen.

589
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,530
My aunt's viewing is tomorrow.

590
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:04,933
And I'm not at all satisfied
with the state of her casket.

591
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:08,014
I spoke to one of your other employees
about it earlier today...

592
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,414
...and he didn't seem to be the slightest
bit concerned. I'll show you.

593
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:13,175
I'll show you.

594
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:19,975
See? Right here. It's been nicked.

595
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,331
How about we take 100 bucks off?

596
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:26,813
- I want a new casket.
- Well, I'm not sure that's an option.

597
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,094
Why does nobody around here
seem to care about doing things right?

598
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:35,775
If I'm not mistaken, you haven't
even signed a contract, right?

599
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:38,655
- That's not the point.
- So you could turn around in the end...

600
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:42,333
...say, "I never agreed," and not pay?
- Of course not, that's ridiculous.

601
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,375
Yeah, that is ridiculous.

602
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,899
So I'm gonna go get
that contract right now...

603
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,575
...and until you sign it, you don't
get to complain about anything else.

604
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:52,903
I resent your implication.

605
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:56,894
You ought to be thanking your fucking
stars that you're alive and healthy.

606
00:41:57,106 --> 00:42:02,022
And that you don't work like a dog
just to starve or get shot in the street.

607
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,024
I'll be right back
with that contract.

608
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,907
I thought this is what you wanted.

609
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,228
It's too little too late.

610
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:31,502
What, are you trying
to get your wings?

611
00:42:33,393 --> 00:42:37,148
- Where's your boyfriend? I do like him.
- Yeah, you said that already.

612
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,665
He'll be headed over to my neck
of the woods pretty soon.

613
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:50,506
Right here. Look at this.

614
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:53,629
- Yeah.
- I like it.

615
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:21,284
Why you are here? You're fired.

616
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,771
Dear Lord, have you been here
all night?

617
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:27,176
Go drive in the woods
with your man...

618
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:30,767
...who burns chicken
in the funny little toy car.

619
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:35,134
I came here to get my things
before I go to church.

620
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:38,971
I thought this would be a safe time
not to run into you.

621
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,328
- Is he rich?
- What? No.

622
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,381
So he is a good lover, yeah?

623
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:51,617
That's none of your business.

624
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:57,301
Because you are the kind of woman
who needs a good lover.

625
00:44:57,622 --> 00:44:59,614
Oh, and why is that?

626
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:04,423
Because you're so scared of feeling.

627
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:11,778
You are scared of your own heart.

628
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,140
You should have a man
who can touch you there.

629
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,417
Who sees your beauty.

630
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,579
I hoping...

631
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,027
...he is this man for you.

632
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:57,504
In your steadfast faith and love,
that through your grace...

633
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,309
...we may proclaim your truth
with boldness...

634
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:03,189
...and minister your justice
with compassion.

635
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:07,674
For the sake of our savior, Jesus Christ,
who lives and reigns with you...

636
00:46:07,876 --> 00:46:12,029
...and the Holy Spirit, one God,
now and forever.

637
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:13,557
Amen.

638
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:15,191
Amen.

639
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:43,442
"In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.

640
00:46:43,644 --> 00:46:45,919
Let me never be ashamed.

641
00:46:46,244 --> 00:46:48,964
Deliver me in thy righteousness."

642
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:59,127
"Let me never be ashamed."

643
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:04,925
There's a concept.

644
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,009
I've been ashamed my entire life.

645
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:21,969
I grew up thinking I was unworthy in the
eyes of God instead of trusting God...

646
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,040
...not to be an ignorant,
frightened bigot.

647
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:30,287
Because of this,
I've made myself crazy.

648
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:33,327
I've put myself in danger,
I've made a lot of mistakes.

649
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,252
Big mistakes.

650
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:39,284
Which all could've been avoided
if I'd just had faith.

651
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:43,569
Faith that maybe God really is love,
like we say.

652
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:51,369
How am I supposed to spread
God's love throughout the world...

653
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,853
...when I deny it to myself?

654
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,810
God be with you all.

655
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:42,906
- Really nice job.
- Thanks.

656
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:45,941
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

657
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:50,581
- Oh, David, wonderful. Good to see you.
- Thanks.

658
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:03,709
Thank you.

659
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:05,391
David!

660
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:08,462
I am so proud of you.

661
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:11,064
That was great, David.

662
00:49:11,273 --> 00:49:14,710
- I didn't even know you were here.
- I had to see what you were gonna do.

663
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,515
We're gonna get something
to eat, why don't you come?

664
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:21,469
Yeah, Fred 62 in Los Feliz.
Maybe a movie afterwards.

665
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:24,072
No, I can't. I've gotta work.

666
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:27,868
Okay, well, congratulations.
You spoke the truth.

667
00:49:28,117 --> 00:49:29,266
Thank you.

668
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:34,950
Take care.

669
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,589
Okay, well...

670
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:40,517
...don't be a stranger.

671
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:59,271
We go for big breakfast now, yeah?

672
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:01,474
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

673
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,481
But it's Sunday.

674
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:05,874
I can't believe I missed church.

675
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:08,838
My son was giving a reading
during the service.

676
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:13,563
- You are happy, no?
- Yes, I'm very happy.

677
00:50:19,807 --> 00:50:22,686
- I'm never gonna marry you.
- What?

678
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:27,886
I will be your friend and your lover,
but I will never be your wife.

679
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:32,049
I spent the first half of my life doing that,
I don't need to do it again.

680
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,168
- Maybe I can convince you.
- Nope.

681
00:50:38,491 --> 00:50:40,925
Not going to happen.

682
00:51:01,055 --> 00:51:02,535
Nate.

683
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:05,051
Mom told me about the accident.
Are you all right?

684
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,857
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

685
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,214
Thanks for making Tracy
sign that contract.

686
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:15,569
I don't know if you've noticed this,
but she's kind of crazy.

687
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,935
Yeah, I got a whiff of that.

688
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,938
And thanks for staying in L.A.
And helping me run the business.

689
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,969
Things have been a lot more fun
around here since you've been home.

690
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:32,491
Why, thank you, Dave.

691
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:45,576
Look, I'm gonna be late for
Augusto's christening. I gotta run.

692
00:51:45,784 --> 00:51:50,415
Oh, that crazy-ass niece
is upstairs crying and won't come down.

693
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:57,145
Oh, no, I think this one is yours.

694
00:51:58,307 --> 00:51:59,535
Okay.

695
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:02,660
But I'm warning you,
I might just fucking punch her.

696
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,791
Tracy?

697
00:52:47,357 --> 00:52:52,193
My Aunt Lilian was the only person
who ever really loved me.

698
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,710
My parents didn't.

699
00:52:56,919 --> 00:52:59,638
My husband certainly didn't.

700
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,510
And now she's dead.

701
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:08,760
Her husband died,
then her daughter died too...

702
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:12,557
...in this car crash
on her 17th birthday.

703
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:16,756
But Aunt Lilian just went on.

704
00:53:17,763 --> 00:53:22,474
She raised Welsh corgis
and she took up watercolors...

705
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:27,554
...and she loved me.
And now she's dead.

706
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:37,961
I've never felt this alone
in the world.

707
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:41,004
And I'm used to feeling alone.

708
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,518
I know what that's like. And...

709
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:47,723
...now I find out that there's this...

710
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,920
...whole new level.

711
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,085
Why do people have to die?

712
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,209
To make life important.

713
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:16,454
None of us know
how long we've got.

714
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:19,448
Which is why we have
to make each day matter.

715
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:24,370
And it sounds like
your Aunt Lilian did exactly that.

716
00:54:25,857 --> 00:54:29,486
- Yeah, she did.
- Then you can be happy for her.

717
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,694
For a life well-lived.

718
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,128
That's the most any of us
can hope for.

719
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,174
I go to funerals sometimes.

720
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,900
Funerals of people
I don't even know.

721
00:54:52,262 --> 00:54:56,461
Harold and Maude is, like,
my favorite movie of all time.

722
00:54:56,663 --> 00:55:01,658
I saw it when I was in junior high
and it profoundly affected my life.

723
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:03,777
It's a great movie.

724
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:10,177
You're very kind.

725
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:16,097
Are you married?

726
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,705
Sort of.

727
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:29,982
Come on in.

728
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,663
Julio! Get over here, man!

729
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:37,511
Baby, does that dead lady
have to be in here?

730
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:40,180
No. No, I'll take her
downstairs right now.

731
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:41,711
Get over here.

732
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:09,948
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

733
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,363
What's up with you?

734
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:07,242
I'm just thinking about
how lucky I am.

735
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,685
I love you.

736
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,722
You know that, right?

737
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:18,448
Yeah.

738
00:58:14,833 --> 00:59:08,989
