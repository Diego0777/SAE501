1
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,676
Sleek, Sophisticated, Seductive,

2
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:51,878
The new Millennium Edition
Crown Royal funeral coach,

3
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:58,320
Because your loved one deserves
the very best in style and comfort,

4
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,438
- Nathaniel Fisher.
- Nathaniel?

5
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:36,761
It's Ruth. Did you take your
blood pressure medication today?

6
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,481
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me.

7
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,522
I took it, What do you want
me to do, OD on it?

8
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,086
Oh, and I just realized we don't have
any of that soy stuff Nate drinks.

9
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,440
You know, since he gave up milk.
I don't know what it's called.

10
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:53,040
Why not just cut some milk with tap
water? He'll never know the difference,

11
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,525
Look, if you don't want to go, I'll go.

12
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,960
It's not as if I don't have enough
to do already.

13
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,967
I'm kidding, I'll get some.

14
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,766
But it has to be after I pick up Nate
at the airport. I'm already running late.

15
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:06,370
Nathaniel!

16
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:08,289
- Are you smoking?
- Nope.

17
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:12,325
- Yes, you are. I heard you.
- I'm not, No, I'm not.

18
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:16,729
Look, forget you'll give yourself cancer
and die a slow and horrible death.

19
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,492
You should not be stinking up
that new hearse,

20
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:23,162
- I told you not to let him take it.
- Like I could've stopped him.

21
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:27,206
He's as proud of that thing as your fool
brother was of that damn motorcycle.

22
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,130
And who still has a pin in his foot?

23
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:33,612
Nathaniel, people want things
to be nice when there's a funeral.

24
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,691
They don't want their loved ones riding
in something that smells like an ashtray.

25
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:42,526
All right, look. I'm quitting right now.
I promise.

26
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:44,486
Okay? I'll see you tonight.

27
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,693
That new hearse
was a total waste of money.

28
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:18,535
There was nothing wrong
with the old one.

29
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:22,776
I think your father's having
some sort of midlife crisis.

30
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,889
It would've made more sense
to invest in repaneling the chapel...

31
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,974
...or adding coffee bars
to the slumber rooms.

32
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:31,089
Well, I'd much rather he buy himself
a fancy new hearse...

33
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,937
...than leave me for a younger woman.

34
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:37,050
Or a woman my age,
for that matter.

35
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:42,127
Or heaven forbid, a man,
like my cousin Hannah's husband did.

36
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:45,331
God sure has dealt that woman
some blows in this life.

37
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,091
Mom.

38
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,492
Can I do anything to help?

39
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,691
No, no, honey. I'm fine.

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,414
Besides, don't you
have a viewing tonight?

41
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,091
- You should probably be getting ready.
- Right.

42
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:19,050
So I enjoyed talking to you
about that whole shiatsu thing.

43
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,172
I really hope that pans out for you.

44
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,976
You should let me
work on you sometime.

45
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:28,221
Here's my cell number.
I'll be here until the 29th.

46
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:30,572
Here you go.

47
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,573
My dad was supposed
to meet me here.

48
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,775
- I could give you a ride.
- I'm sure he'll be here soon enough.

49
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,816
I wasn't talking about that kind of ride.

50
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,179
You've done a nice job.

51
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:56,382
- She looks so peaceful.
- Well, she is at peace now.

52
00:05:56,584 --> 00:06:03,024
If there's any justice in the universe,
she's shoveling shit in hell.

53
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,621
Excuse me.

54
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,738
- David Fisher.
- David, it's Claire.

55
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,618
- Is Nate there yet?
- Nope.

56
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,498
I thought he was coming
so we could do,,,

57
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,901
...the forced Christmas Eve family thing.
- Well...

58
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,825
There are some really excellent parties
I could be going to.

59
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:22,062
Claire.

60
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,816
This is one of the few times
we're all together.

61
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:27,587
Don 't get all Pat Robertson on me,
I'll be there,

62
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,656
I have to drop some stuff off at a friend's
house before I head over, okay? Bye.

63
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:33,982
Fucking Boy Scout.

64
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:41,787
Attention, passengers of flight 71,,,,

65
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,262
This is kind of disgusting.

66
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:47,541
- Disgusting good or disgusting bad?
- Disgusting very good.

67
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,864
I know.

68
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,186
- You are so fucking hot.
- You're so sweet.

69
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm a sweet guy.

70
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:58,421
Shut up and fuck me.

71
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,109
Hello.

72
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,384
This is Ruth Fisher.

73
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,387
Yes, I'm his wife.

74
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,899
What is this about?

75
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,902
What?!

76
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:34,588
Excuse me.

77
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,991
Mom, what the hell are you...?

78
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,985
There's been an accident.

79
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:49,105
The new hearse is totaled.

80
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,426
Your father is dead.

81
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:57,709
Your father is dead,
and my pot roast is ruined.

82
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:59,427
Oh, my God.

83
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:04,312
You carry a lot of tension
around in your lower back.

84
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:07,787
Not as much as 20 minutes ago.

85
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,384
Just so you know...

86
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:17,394
...I never do this.

87
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:21,430
Oh, yeah. Me neither.

88
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,307
So...

89
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,428
...were you ever gonna
tell me your name?

90
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,151
Probably not.

91
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:38,032
Why not?

92
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,751
Because I'm a realist.

93
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:46,835
That's my father looking for me.

94
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,877
Hey, Dad.

95
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:59,072
Oh, Dave, hey. Merry Christmas.

96
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,114
Of course I'm okay.
Couldn't be better in fact.

97
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,637
What?

98
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,632
I'm so sorry, Nate. I hate
to have to be the one to tell you.

99
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,880
This is just speed, right?
Promise me this isn't crack.

100
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,596
I'm having Christmas Eve dinner
with my demented family.

101
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:38,032
It'll be weird enough
without being high on crack.

102
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:44,477
No, it's just crystal meth. It just makes
everything burn a little bit brighter.

103
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:49,157
And it makes sex, like, totally primal.

104
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:54,202
Here. It's all right.

105
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:05,561
Oh, well, it's too late now.

106
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,153
It's mine.

107
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:12,441
Hello? David, hi.

108
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,919
Hang on a second.

109
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,721
So is Nate there yet?

110
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:25,954
No, he's still at the airport.
Claire, I've got bad news.

111
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,719
What?

112
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:41,404
Yeah, sure.

113
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,280
Okay, I'm on my way.

114
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:54,083
I have to go.

115
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,756
- No fucking way!
- Excuse me.

116
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:58,686
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

117
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:03,040
- You're coming back, right?
- I don't think so.

118
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:09,688
My dad just got hit by a bus,
and it broke his neck, and he's dead.

119
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:15,279
I gotta pick up my mom and bring her to
the morgue so she can identify his body.

120
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,245
No, I'm not kidding.
This is actually happening.

121
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,678
And now I'm high on crack!

122
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,928
- Crystal.
- Whatever!

123
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,726
So I guess this whole hellish experience
I'm about to go through...

124
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:32,206
...is just gonna burn
a little brighter now, right?

125
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:36,086
Great! Thank you! Fuck!

126
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,605
You really didn't have to do this.
I could've rented a car.

127
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,690
It's okay.
You're in no shape to drive.

128
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:54,888
I'm in no hurry to get home to my
family's annual Christmas Eve massacre.

129
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,489
Parents who stayed together
for the children...

130
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:01,242
...but really because they got off
on tormenting each other so much.

131
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,173
Manic-depressive brother...

132
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:07,571
...who always chooses the holidays
to go off his medication.

133
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:12,894
And an ancient springer spaniel who's
completely blind, deaf and incontinent.

134
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:17,328
What about you?

135
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,049
Actually, we're pretty normal.

136
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,530
My mom's a control freak.

137
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,090
My brother...

138
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,604
...well, he's a control freak too.

139
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,808
And my sister...

140
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:35,846
Well, I left home before she was born
so I never really knew her that well...

141
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,128
...but she's kind of wild like I was.
- Was?

142
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:47,253
My dad really rode my ass
when I was a kid.

143
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:50,771
I couldn't go rafting because
he buried a girl who drowned.

144
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:54,687
He buries this dipshit loser who OD'd
at a Flock of Seagulls concert...

145
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:57,173
...and I'm not allowed to go
to concerts for a year.

146
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,936
Your dad worked in a cemetery?

147
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:03,097
How could a man who's so scared of
everything, who never had an accident...

148
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:07,611
...or a speeding ticket in his entire life,
how could he have a car wreck?

149
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:13,291
Are you mad at him,
or the fact that we're all gonna die?

150
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:19,218
- Are you a shrink?
- No! God, no. No!

151
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,173
Both my parents are.

152
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,932
So, what else do you
want to talk about?

153
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,017
The weather?

154
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,850
Or the fact that we both
just fucked a perfect stranger?

155
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,849
And that we both lied
when we said we never did that.

156
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:50,531
- Wonderful service.
- Yes, it was. Very nice.

157
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,974
She looked so peaceful.
Thank you so much.

158
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:06,095
- You're welcome.
- Wonderful job.

159
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,942
Did you know that
before you were born...

160
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,102
...funeral homes
ran the ambulance business?

161
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,260
No.

162
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:22,983
Hearses were the only vehicles
that could transport people lying down.

163
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,098
Your father used to joke about that.

164
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:31,456
"Just drive him around the block
a few more times.

165
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:35,215
We won't need to stop
at the hospital."

166
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,704
You're kind of freaking me out
right now.

167
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:41,056
Claire...

168
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:45,340
...are you having sex?
- What?

169
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:48,141
Or doing drugs?

170
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,986
Why are you asking me this right now?

171
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:53,906
Your father is dead.

172
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:59,341
I can't even remember the last time you
and I talked about anything important.

173
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:02,460
I need to know you're okay.

174
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:06,386
Oh, yeah.

175
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,780
Believe me, I'm okay.

176
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,947
You know, considering.

177
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:23,622
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

178
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,298
I wanted to compliment you
on the music.

179
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,220
I've been to three funerals this year.
Cancer, stroke, pediatric leukemia...

180
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,628
...and the music is always
that same sad organ music.

181
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,901
It reminds me of soap operas
my mom watched...

182
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:41,662
...before I started kindergarten. Oh, God,
you're probably too young to remember.

183
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:47,184
Anyway, I so prefer this light classical,
you know, chamber orchestra stuff.

184
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,862
It's still spiritual, but doesn't
seem so dated or depressing.

185
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,221
I studied music appreciation.

186
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:55,424
You think I'm really boring, don 't you?
Well, get used to it,

187
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,145
Now that your father is dead,,,

188
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,422
,,, you can forget
about going to law school,

189
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:03,512
It's just you and dead people and freaks
like me for the rest of your life!

190
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,590
Mom.

191
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:19,346
Mom, I'm so sorry.

192
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,787
Who's she?

193
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:27,391
- This is...
- Brenda Chenowith.

194
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,790
Brenda Chenowith.

195
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:34,430
Brenda, this is my mom,
Ruth Fisher.

196
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,185
And my sister, Claire.

197
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:42,311
- Nate, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, just give me a minute.

198
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:45,030
- Mom, did you already do the...?
- I can't.

199
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,508
I've seen too many dead people
in my life. They're work.

200
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:53,586
I won't see your father that way.
I need you to do it.

201
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:58,074
Nate, I need to talk to you now,
please. It's urgent.

202
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:07,354
- So how did you and my son meet?
- In cooking class.

203
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,715
I have to tell somebody.
I am tweaking.

204
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,991
- Yeah, we're all upset.
- No, I'm high on crystal.

205
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,838
I smoked some with some friends
before David called me.

206
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,234
- You did what?
- Don't worry, it's the first time.

207
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,031
But I think I'm having a meltdown...

208
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:27,027
...and I can't tell if it's Dad being dead
or the crystal, but...

209
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,960
I'm really scared.

210
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,628
You cannot do this to me right now.

211
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,990
Don't be a narc.
We smoked pot at Thanksgiving.

212
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,556
Look, I have to go identify
our dead father's body.

213
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,198
I'm sorry you're having
a bad drug experience, but deal with it.

214
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,518
Well?

215
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:16,553
Well, well,

216
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,994
The prodigal returns,

217
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:22,674
This is what you've been running away
from your whole life, buddy-boy.

218
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,796
Scared the crap out of you
when you were growing up, didn't it?

219
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:31,163
And you thought you'd escape,
well, guess what?

220
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,715
Nobody escapes.

221
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:42,524
- Well?
- Yeah, that's him.

222
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:49,604
Okay, let's get out of here.

223
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,516
How'd he look?

224
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,763
Dead.

225
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:01,084
Will there need to be
a lot of reconstruction?

226
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,881
David's not that skilled
at the really hard stuff.

227
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:08,160
Federico usually does that.
He's quite gifted.

228
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:12,163
You don't think we'll have
to have a closed casket, do you?

229
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,836
- I would hate to send that message.
- What message?

230
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,562
That we're not equipped to handle
a major restoration...

231
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:20,966
...or that we're not proud of our work.
- Can we talk about this later?

232
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:25,481
We should really get Nate home.
He's probably exhausted. Let's go.

233
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,639
Thanks for driving me here.

234
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,686
Please. I'm just avoiding my own hell.
I'm a big coward.

235
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,126
Me too.

236
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:54,250
I don't know if I can handle this.

237
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:58,445
Well, you're about to find out.

238
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:02,244
I wish you the best, Nate.

239
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,204
Goodbye.

240
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,651
Claire.

241
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:29,408
- You're driving too fast.
- This isn't fast. You wanna see fast?

242
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,562
Pull over!

243
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,285
Listen, do you do a lot of drugs?

244
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,249
What? No.
And it's none of your business.

245
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:51,650
Yes, it is my business.

246
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:54,814
You were driving like a maniac.
You could've gotten us killed.

247
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:57,894
What the hell is this?
You're not my father.

248
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,052
You split as soon as you could.
You don't even know me.

249
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:04,296
So don't start thinking you can
tell me what to do, okay?

250
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:24,855
So where's Dad, downstairs already?

251
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,050
He's still in the morgue.

252
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,496
You didn't bring him back with you?

253
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:32,054
Oh, dear.

254
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,893
That didn't even cross my mind.

255
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,934
We should've taken the van
so we could bring him home.

256
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,770
I'm sorry.
That was very stupid of me.

257
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,976
Nice going, Dave.

258
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:53,741
Like she doesn't have enough
to feel bad about right now?

259
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:57,217
Things have to be done.
Federico's downstairs, ready to start.

260
00:21:57,421 --> 00:22:00,936
Every second we wait will only make
Dad's restoration more difficult.

261
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:05,772
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you, bag boy?

262
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:08,411
"Bag boy"?

263
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:13,174
I'm assistant manager of organic produce
at Seattle's highest volume food co-op.

264
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:17,058
Jesus, pull your dicks out and measure
them. Let's get this over with.

265
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:21,577
Were we supposed to throw Dad
in the back of Claire's car?

266
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:23,853
It is a hearse!

267
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:26,896
Yeah, hi. It's David Fisher.

268
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:29,493
Yeah, so I need to come
pick up the body.

269
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,740
These people mean nothing to me,

270
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:35,414
Know you not the family of the man
who has slaved for you,,,

271
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:38,058
,,, from dawn to dark
these many years?

272
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:40,141
They appear to be so happy,,,,

273
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:43,974
- I made you some dinner.
- I'm so not hungry.

274
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:48,781
We have to eat, Claire.
We didn't die.

275
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:51,858
What is that?

276
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:56,662
- For your father,
your brother, Tiny Tim,

277
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:09,777
On three. One. Two. Three.

278
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,103
Really sorry, man.

279
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,586
Thanks.

280
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:44,778
For a body that's firm, yet flexible,

281
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,221
For skin that begs to be touched,

282
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,742
For the velvety appearance
of actual living tissue,,,

283
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,502
,,, top morticians rely on Living Splendor
embalming fluid,

284
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:02,785
Living Splendor,
Only real life is better,

285
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:55,906
Hey, buddy-boy.

286
00:24:56,315 --> 00:24:59,228
Come on in, it's okay.

287
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:03,305
Say hello to Mr. Bloomberg.

288
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:09,067
There isn't anything to be afraid of, Nate.
Mr. Bloomberg's dead.

289
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:12,349
I'm getting him ready so his family
can see him for the last time...

290
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:15,549
...and say goodbye to him.
It'll make them feel better.

291
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:18,465
That's what Daddy does.

292
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,468
What do you got?

293
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:25,711
You got me.

294
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:31,071
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

295
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,554
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

296
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,232
Nate!

297
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,309
What's up?

298
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,032
- Hey, Rico.
- It's good to see you.

299
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,835
Really sorry about your dad, man.

300
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,193
But, well, you know,
when your time's up, it's up, right?

301
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,357
How's he doing?

302
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:09,035
So far so good.

303
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:12,233
I really appreciate you coming in
on Christmas Eve, Federico.

304
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,912
It's the least I could do for Mr. F.
Everything he did for me.

305
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:20,038
I was gonna be up all night anyway,
putting together useless shit...

306
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,994
...Santa Claus is bringing my kid.

307
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:25,274
We don't use that kind of language
in here. Show some respect.

308
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:35,671
- You need something?
- No.

309
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,953
I just...

310
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:39,959
David Fisher.

311
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,393
Hey, I just want to remind you, don't
eat too much with your family tonight...

312
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,677
...because I am making you something
totally decadent and fatty for dessert.

313
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:53,360
Hold just a second, please.

314
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,000
Hi.

315
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:06,042
Keith, I'm sorry, I can 't make it,

316
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,361
Why not?

317
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:11,482
My father was just killed
in a car accident.

318
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,325
Oh, shit. David, I'm so sorry.

319
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:16,198
What can I do?

320
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:19,126
Nothing, thanks.
But I have to stay here.

321
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:24,003
Listen, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call me.

322
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,323
Sure,

323
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:30,646
I mean it, David. You don't
have to go through this alone.

324
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,803
I gotta go.

325
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,725
Okay, here it goes.

326
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,443
This is the one I'm most proud of.

327
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:47,484
The husband, okay?
He got fired, flipped out...

328
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:51,125
...shot his wife point-blank in the head,
then shot himself in the mouth.

329
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,528
Some seriously closed-casket shit, right?
Now look at this.

330
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,329
Like the bride and groom
on top of a cake.

331
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,640
And then we cremated them.

332
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,888
What a fucking waste.

333
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:12,286
Actually...

334
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,643
...this right here is...
This is my best work.

335
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,040
Wait a minute, this kid
was born just last month.

336
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:24,450
He'll be 4 fucking years old in April,
can you believe it?

337
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:28,847
Vanessa's pregnant again.

338
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:31,884
You stud!

339
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:36,930
Hey, it wasn't planned. You know what?
Neither was this one.

340
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,443
And he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

341
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,770
Keep an eye on those chemicals,
Federico. We don't want him to burn.

342
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,014
Hey.

343
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,611
- Where's Mom?
- She went to bed.

344
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,367
Was she feeling any better?

345
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:14,569
Yeah, Nate, she was on top
of the goddamn world.

346
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:24,412
- Where's David?
- He's downstairs, working.

347
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:27,177
On Dad?

348
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:31,048
Yeah, well, him and Rico.

349
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,771
He said not to wait up for him.
We should try and sleep.

350
00:29:35,978 --> 00:29:38,811
Yeah, as if that were a viable option.

351
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,777
- You want to go to the grocery store?
- Yes. Anything to get out of here.

352
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:33,421
Well, it's about to start
raining frogs here.

353
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:34,896
How are things on your end?

354
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:38,015
- God, I'm glad you called.
- Really, why?

355
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:41,101
I don't know.
Because you...

356
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:43,134
You have a calming effect on me.

357
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:48,134
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "projection"?

358
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:50,699
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "blow me"?

359
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:55,659
Come on, You grew up
with all that psychobabble,

360
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:58,332
You rebelled against it
every chance you got, Still do,

361
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:01,935
And that includes having sex
with strangers in closets at airports.

362
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:05,054
And you think you're
not easy to read?

363
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:08,541
Coasting by on your looks and charm
isn 't working like it used to,,,

364
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:12,579
,,, but you have no idea what else to do
because you've never had to learn,

365
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:15,698
Any woman with half a brain
looks at a guy like you and thinks:

366
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:19,103
"Good for a hot fuck."
But believe me, that's it.

367
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,177
L...

368
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,865
Nate, can we go home?
I really gotta take a shower.

369
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:36,699
Oh, God, Jesus Christ! Am I not allowed
to have even a single moment to myself?

370
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,343
Okay.

371
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:45,258
It's okay.

372
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,744
What can I do?

373
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,179
Nothing. No one can do anything.

374
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,585
- You'll have to pay for that cantaloupe.
- You fuck off!

375
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,984
She looked her best
every day of her life,

376
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,820
Don 't let one horribly disfiguring
accident change that,

377
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:20,023
Use new Wound Filler
cosmetic molding putty,

378
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,791
Now faster setting and self-sealing,,,

379
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,222
,,, to help make masking
unsightly wounds a breeze,

380
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,027
Ma, you remember that stuffed dog
I used to have?

381
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:49,703
I dragged it around until its ears fell off,
then you made new ears out of a towel.

382
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:54,226
I hated that dog after that.
And I threw it up on the roof.

383
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:55,992
No.

384
00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:59,343
I wanted it back and begged Dad
to get it, but he said no...

385
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:02,751
...if I really wanted it, I'd never
have thrown it in the first place.

386
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:07,506
Your father did so many wonderful things
for you, and that's all you can think of?

387
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:11,748
- I just remembered it.
- He was a good man!

388
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:19,384
I'm going running.

389
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:36,628
Oh, no, you're doing me?
You're the worst one we've got.

390
00:33:36,837 --> 00:33:39,226
- Thanks, Dad.
- Where's Federico?

391
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:43,146
It's Christmas morning. He's with
his wife and kid. He'll be in later.

392
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,872
Couldn't this wait?
I don't want you ruining my face.

393
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:48,638
- It's a little late for that.
- Not funny.

394
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:52,547
- I need to stay busy right now.
- So go reorganize some files.

395
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,955
Or develop a new bookkeeping system.
That's what you're good at.

396
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:59,788
You never really had any aptitude
for this stuff.

397
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,355
I know.
And what did I do with my life?

398
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,393
I went to school to learn
exactly how to do this stuff.

399
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,070
Other kids my age were going
to frat parties, I was draining corpses...

400
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,272
...and refashioning severed ears
out of wax.

401
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,029
Thank God I didn't lose an ear. I can
only imagine what you'd do with that.

402
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,073
And I did it all for you.

403
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:25,955
I did it to make you happy,
you ungrateful son of a bitch.

404
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,438
Dave?

405
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:34,719
I just wanted to let you know
I was here.

406
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:59,079
We'll deal you in next hand.

407
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:30,769
- I'm about to jump out of my skin.
- Don't.

408
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:34,202
I'm just barely holding it together.
Are you still high?

409
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:39,486
- I don't know. Am I sweating?
- I know I am.

410
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:44,726
This is too fucking weird.
It's been three days...

411
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:49,050
...and I'm still trapped in zombie world.
- This is all happening to you.

412
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,812
Fuck off!

413
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:55,370
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one
who wasn't prepared for this.

414
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:58,804
I came expecting to sleep late and chow
down on Mom's cooking for six days.

415
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:01,686
And now I find myself feeling like...

416
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:05,807
...I'm not even a part of this family.
- I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat.

417
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,448
At least you got out of here.

418
00:37:08,654 --> 00:37:11,885
I live in a shitty apartment
which was supposed to be temporary.

419
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:14,324
I work at a job,
also supposed to be temporary...

420
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:18,448
...until I figured out what I wanted to do
with my life, which apparently is nothing.

421
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:22,204
I have lots of sex, but my relationships
don't last more than a couple months.

422
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:26,806
I don't even have the self-discipline
to floss daily. I've had four root canals!

423
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:30,770
I'm 35, I've had four root canals.

424
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:36,928
I'm gonna be a loser who ends up
in his deathbed saying:

425
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:39,252
- "Where'd my life go?"
- No, you won't.

426
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:43,614
You'll be saying,
"Where the hell's the morphine?"

427
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:45,936
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

428
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:49,254
I've spent my whole fucking life
being cheerful.

429
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:53,973
I'm sorry about your father,
but he's in a much better place now.

430
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:57,056
You are so right about that.

431
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:02,936
Who the hell is that?

432
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,535
I know, Ruth.

433
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,779
I know everything.

434
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,770
I've known the Fishers
for years from church.

435
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:37,132
- You know them too?
- Yes, yes. I work here.

436
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,899
Oh, you work here.

437
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:52,542
- What are you doing here?
- I just got off duty. I came...

438
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:56,894
...to pay my respects to your father.
- You never even met my father.

439
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,663
Exactly. And you've met my parents
how many times now?

440
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:02,696
- We spent the weekend at their house.
- Don't do this to me.

441
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:05,178
- This is not your high-school reunion.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:07,055
This is not the time to be political.

443
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,778
- You think I'm here to be political?
- Keep your voice down.

444
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:13,738
What is this? We can fuck, but I can't
be a shoulder for you to cry on?

445
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:16,856
- I'm not crying.
- So, what am I? Am I just sex to you?

446
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,543
Jesus!

447
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:21,497
Do we really have to have
this conversation now?

448
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:24,936
Oh, shit. Here comes my mother.

449
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:31,140
- I'm so tired.
- I know, Mom. It's exhausting.

450
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:34,018
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

451
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:37,855
This is Keith Charles, a friend of mine.
He came to pay his respects to Dad.

452
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:41,979
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm really sorry about your husband.

453
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:48,897
- You're friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

454
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,096
Nice to meet you.

455
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,299
I'd like to see your father now.

456
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:05,903
Who's that cop?

457
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:11,027
- My Aunt Shirley was laid out here.
- Aunt Shirley, huh?

458
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,858
Shirley Hamilton.
Terrible accident, lost her ear.

459
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,220
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know Shirley.
I remember Shirley.

460
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:19,464
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:24,618
I was the person who sewed her ear
back on. That was me. That's my work.

462
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,711
What? She's sad,
so he has to get her out of sight?

463
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:41,866
They always do that.

464
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:45,347
The second someone starts to lose it,
they take them off into that room.

465
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:47,746
It makes the other people uncomfortable,
I guess.

466
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,944
This is not about the other people!

467
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:53,108
Volume.

468
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:03,710
When I went backpacking through Europe
after I quit school...

469
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,429
...I went to this island
off the coast of Sicily.

470
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,625
It was this volcanic island,

471
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,552
And on the boat over,
there was this pine box,

472
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:15,666
Somebody from the island
being returned to be buried there,

473
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:19,191
And there are all these old Sicilians
dressed up all in black...

474
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:21,672
,,, waiting, lined up on the beach,

475
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:24,024
And when they got
that coffin to the beach,,,

476
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:28,228
,,, those old Sicilian women went apeshit,
screaming, throwing themselves on it,,,

477
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:31,586
,,, beating their chests, tearing
at their hair, making animal noises,

478
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,672
It was just so,,,,

479
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,752
So real,

480
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:38,515
I mean, I'd been around funerals
my entire life,,,

481
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:42,106
,,, but I had never seen such grief,

482
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:45,626
And at the time,
it gave me the creeps,

483
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:51,146
But now I think it's probably
so much more healthy than...

484
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,867
...this.

485
00:41:57,837 --> 00:42:00,635
That cop is hot.

486
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:04,626
- Oh, David, David.
- I know, Mom.

487
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:07,306
It's going to be okay.
It just takes time.

488
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:10,988
- I've done a terrible, terrible thing.
- What?

489
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,154
I've done a terrible thing.

490
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,474
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

491
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:20,673
I'm not fine. I'm a whore! I was
unfaithful to your father for years!

492
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:24,508
And now he knows.
He knows.

493
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:31,035
I met a man at church once
when your father didn't come with me.

494
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,912
- Mom...
- And he invited me for coffee...

495
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,588
...and he said he liked my hair.

496
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,633
He's a hairdresser, a widower.

497
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,473
Well, they divorced before she died,
so technically I guess he's divorced.

498
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,911
He invited me to accompany him
on a hike.

499
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:50,440
This is really not the time.

500
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:53,314
- Maybe she needs to get this out.
- I don't want to hear it.

501
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:57,310
I used to love hiking when I was
younger, and being outdoors.

502
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,638
I always wanted
to take you kids camping...

503
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:03,835
...but your father would never
leave the business!

504
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:09,959
Well, I can tell you. I went camping
with this man from church several times!

505
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,477
Told your father
I was visiting my sister.

506
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:15,082
If he'd ever thought to call...

507
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:17,672
Can you even begin to fathom
the impropriety of this?

508
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,475
Your husband is lying
in a casket.

509
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:21,959
David, she's grief-stricken, okay?
Fuck propriety.

510
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:24,280
We don't say that word!

511
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,555
Did you know him?

512
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,403
No.

513
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:41,755
Did you?

514
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:44,195
He was my father.

515
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,601
You're Claire?

516
00:43:47,286 --> 00:43:49,197
- Yeah.
- Keith Charles.

517
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:50,885
I'm a friend of your brother's.

518
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,520
- Of Nate's?
- No, David's.

519
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:57,402
- David's friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

520
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:00,724
- David plays racquetball?
- Excuse us.

521
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:06,764
You want me to cry
on your shoulder? Fine.

522
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:09,720
My mother just confessed
she was having an affair.

523
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:12,158
- Wow.
- Yeah, with some hairdresser...

524
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:16,077
...who likes to hike. Now Nate is in there
playing Mr. Sensitive with her...

525
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:19,803
...while her dead husband
lies in the next room. It's disgusting.

526
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:22,967
- Breathe. You're gonna get through this.
- Oh, I know.

527
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:27,048
I'll be the strong, stable, dependable one,
because that's what I do.

528
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:31,162
Everyone around me will fall apart
because that's what they do.

529
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,965
Don't you get exhausted being so hard
on everyone? And yourself?

530
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,923
Oh, shut up.

531
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,643
- She met him at church.
- You met me at church.

532
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:51,285
Hands.

533
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:02,841
I didn't even realize how lonely I was...

534
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:07,842
...or how long it had been
since a man touched me like that.

535
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:14,723
Well, loneliness is a terrible thing.

536
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:18,403
I'm still a woman, you know.

537
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,649
Yes, I know.

538
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:27,293
And now your father sees me.
Like God sees me.

539
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:33,171
He knows everything.
I'm so ashamed.

540
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,607
You didn't do it to hurt anybody.

541
00:45:38,815 --> 00:45:42,125
You were lonely.
I'm sure Dad forgives you.

542
00:45:44,215 --> 00:45:50,371
- And God doesn't?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure he does too.

543
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,531
Look, it's okay.

544
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:03,128
Everybody forgives everybody.
For everything.

545
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,653
Fuck.

546
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,373
If you're looking for the olives, honey,
they're right here.

547
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,737
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,,,

548
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:05,981
,,, is easy as pie with Franklin 's
new leak-proof earth dispenser,

549
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:08,696
Say goodbye to soiled fingers forever,

550
00:47:09,182 --> 00:47:14,654
Only from Franklin Funeral Supplies,
We put the fun back in funeral,

551
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:21,781
In the midst of life,
we are in death.

552
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:25,293
Of whom may we seek for succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

553
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:29,337
Who for our sins art justly displeased?

554
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:32,900
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

555
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:35,777
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayer.

556
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:40,853
But spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty.

557
00:47:41,064 --> 00:47:46,697
O holy and merciful savior,
thou most worthy judge eternal.

558
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,544
Suffer us not, at our last hour...

559
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:54,580
...through any pains of death,
to fall from thee.

560
00:47:58,386 --> 00:48:03,062
In the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life.

561
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:06,379
Through almighty God
we commend our brother...

562
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:08,703
...Nathaniel Samuel Fisher...

563
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:12,422
...and we commit his body
to the ground.

564
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:15,266
He looks like he's salting popcorn.

565
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:19,062
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...

566
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:21,224
...dust to dust.

567
00:48:21,428 --> 00:48:23,737
The Lord bless him and keep him.

568
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:28,021
The Lord make his face to shine
upon him and be gracious unto him.

569
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:35,108
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace.

570
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:05,469
- Nate...
- No!

571
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:08,026
I refuse to sanitize this anymore.

572
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:11,466
- This is how it's done.
- Yeah? Well, it's whacked.

573
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:14,345
What is this stupid saltshaker?

574
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:18,943
What is this hermetically sealed box?
This phony AstroTurf around the grave?

575
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:25,467
Jesus, David, it's like surgery.
Clean, antiseptic, business.

576
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:27,989
- He was our father!
- Please don't do this.

577
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:31,469
You can pump him full of chemicals,
you can put makeup on him...

578
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,346
...and you can prop him up
for a nap in the slumber room...

579
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:40,424
...but the fact remains that the only
father we're ever gonna have is gone!

580
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:43,432
Forever.
And that sucks.

581
00:49:43,634 --> 00:49:46,626
But it's a goddamn part of life,
and you can't really accept it...

582
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:48,712
...without getting your hands dirty.

583
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:51,827
Well, I do accept it, and I intend
to honor the old bastard...

584
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:57,667
...by letting the world see how fucked
up and shitty I feel that he's dead!

585
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,436
Goddamn it!

586
00:50:03,196 --> 00:50:04,231
Amen.

587
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:07,029
Wait.

588
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,750
Let her.

589
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,000
Let us pray.

590
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:22,072
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

591
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:28,120
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

592
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:32,794
Give us this day, our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses...

593
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:36,393
...as we forgive those
who have trespassed against us.

594
00:51:36,603 --> 00:51:40,916
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

595
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:46,357
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

596
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:49,284
Amen! Amen!

597
00:51:50,204 --> 00:51:53,083
The Lord be with you.

598
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:02,802
Mom, Federico's gonna
drive you back, okay?

599
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:06,715
I just need to go over a few details
with Nate. We'll be right behind you.

600
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:09,360
Put her there, Mrs. F.

601
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:15,439
You have such delicate hands, Federico.
Like a statue.

602
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:19,083
Or an illustration in an antique book.

603
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:24,236
Or one of those little ceramic hands
they use to display gloves.

604
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:37,081
You want to be the alpha dog,
Nate, is that it?

605
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,722
Coasting toward mid-life
with nothing to show for it.

606
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:42,840
You wanna come back and be the rock
for this family to lean on?

607
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:44,767
- Fuck you.
- That is not what I'm...

608
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,767
You want to get your hands dirty?
You sanctimonious prick.

609
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,927
Talk to me when you've had to stuff
formaldehyde-soaked cotton...

610
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,689
...up your father's ass
so he doesn't leak.

611
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:55,448
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

612
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,404
Well, I'm sure you just would've
tossed him out with the garbage.

613
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,884
It may seem weird to you...

614
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,162
...but there is a reason
behind everything that we do here.

615
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,759
We provide people
with a very important...

616
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,202
...and sacred service
at the darkest time in their lives.

617
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:13,209
Because maybe they don't wanna
make a spectacle of themselves.

618
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:15,925
Because maybe they'd prefer
to grieve in private.

619
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:17,086
Why?

620
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:21,808
Why does it have to be such a secret?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

621
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:26,242
- Dave, please...
- You know nothing!

622
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:28,643
Nothing!

623
00:53:31,732 --> 00:53:34,645
You had a responsibility
to this family...

624
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:36,809
...and you ran away,
and left it all for me.

625
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,130
Don't blame me if you're
not living the life you want.

626
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,006
That is nobody's fault but your own.

627
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:50,363
Okay, fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

628
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:52,804
You got out...

629
00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:55,482
...stay out.

630
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:03,524
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher, sir?
If I could get a moment of your time.

631
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:06,374
- What?
- I'm from Kroehner Service International.

632
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:09,931
I'd like to talk to you about joining
our family of death-care facilities.

633
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:12,491
- I cannot believe this.
- Lf you'd just hear me out...

634
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:14,493
We're not selling.
Get the fuck out of here!

635
00:54:14,696 --> 00:54:16,414
We wouldn't change
the name of the business.

636
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:18,493
We would retain you
as a salaried manager.

637
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:23,407
Look, I really want to hit somebody
right now, and it might as well be you!

638
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:33,571
I'll call you when you've had some time
to recover from your loss.

639
00:54:37,258 --> 00:54:41,695
- You're really lucky, you know that?
- You kidding? It was over in a second.

640
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:44,890
I didn't have to be afraid of it
or even think about it.

641
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:48,375
- No more bullshit.
- No more responsibility.

642
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:51,491
- And no more having to care.
- No more boredom!

643
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,537
No more waiting to die.

644
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:23,618
Hi.

645
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:30,493
Well, after four days with my family,
I'm ready for shock therapy.

646
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,820
I'm just waiting to see
if my HMO covers it.

647
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:41,735
- How's it going with you?
- Oh, it's great. Great.

648
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:44,935
My father's dead, my mom's a whore,
my brother wants to kill me...

649
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:49,421
...and my sister's smoking crack.
I think I win.

650
00:55:50,023 --> 00:55:51,980
Four days ago,
I was a relatively happy guy.

651
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:55,301
Now it's like I don't even know
who that guy was.

652
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,982
I'm a fucking mess.

653
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:05,779
If you want to know the truth.

654
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:09,184
But I think you're already aware of that.

655
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,696
Well, here's my number.

656
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:21,424
If you ever want to, I don't know,
go out on a real date?

657
00:56:21,626 --> 00:56:25,380
You know, where you buy me dinner
before I put out.

658
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:32,584
Maybe I'm a woman that meets a man
who seems emotionally conflicted...

659
00:56:32,787 --> 00:56:36,541
...no relationship skills, and I figure,
"Hey, that's for me."

660
00:56:36,747 --> 00:56:40,217
- I don't even live here. I live in Seattle.
- That makes you more attractive.

661
00:56:40,427 --> 00:56:42,100
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:46,862
Well, I also happen to be a serial rapist.

663
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:50,219
I've got 10 nurses
buried under my house.

664
00:56:50,548 --> 00:56:52,140
Now you're making me wet.

665
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:34,790
I... I need...

666
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,588
I need...

667
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:55,707
It's okay. It's okay.

668
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,589
Good morning.

669
00:58:57,558 --> 00:59:00,392
Thank God you're here.

670
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,830
Yeah, well, of course I'm here.

671
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,033
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Oh, I'm gonna go for a run.

672
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,630
- I'll eat when I get back.
- Nate?

673
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,153
You don't have to go back to Seattle
right away, do you?

674
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,156
I guess not.
I could make a few calls.

675
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:35,434
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:38,670
Just for a few days.

677
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,919
Okay.
