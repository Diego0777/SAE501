Episode 2x02
Out, Out, Brief Candle

2
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,217
100 yards, 10 times.

3
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,767
80 yards times 8.
60 by 6.

4
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:55,703
40 by 4. 20 by 2.
All in under 14 minutes.

5
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:57,954
You know the drill.
Let's toe the line, gentlemen!

6
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:00,143
Listen I gotta make this cut to get that scholarship.

7
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:02,614
Look, man, just don't stop running.
Don't stop running for nothing.

8
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:06,018
You keep on with me,
you'll be on the startin' line with me.

9
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,974
Come on, baby.

10
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:10,790
- Do you want to play football?
- Yes, sir!

11
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,164
- I said, do you want to play football? I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

12
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:15,059
Set.

13
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,835
Plus vite.

14
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,488
On se dépêche, lavettes !

15
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,114
Courez. Vous me comprenez,
ou je parle chinois ?

16
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:34,608
- How you doin', Sam?
- Just worry about your own self

17
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:43,345
Touchez cette putain de ligne !

18
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,561
Tu traînes, Josh.
Avance ! Avance !

19
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:53,169
- This is me beatin' you
- Dream on, faggot!

20
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:03,432
Vous y êtes.
Allez, allez !

21
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:08,402
Man down! Man down!
We've got a player down!

22
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,011
Fight through it, Sam.

23
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,997
Sam ?

24
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,402
Sam ?

25
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,602
Okay, he's breathing.

26
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,307
Fuck!

27
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:42,336
Give a hand for Sam, everybody.
This is the spirit of a real football player here!

28
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,706
Do you think caviar
is too pretentious?

29
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,810
Well, with the foie gras and the smoked salmon,

30
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,406
it might seem like you're trying
a little too hard to impress him.

31
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:04,864
Fuck.

32
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:09,980
I do want to impress him without it looking like
I could give a shit, which, actually, I don't.

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,556
So, why do you want to impress him?

34
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,047
I don't know.

35
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,652
Because Trevor was a big part of my life once.

36
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:22,604
Cause his wife won a fucking National Book Award.
Because I have nothing else to obsess about.

37
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,231
Well, you have me.

38
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,907
You I take totally for granted,
don't you know that?

39
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,593
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

40
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,626
Yeah, you and me both,
fuck-o.

41
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:36,903
That's the thing about depression.
If you really allow yourself to feel it,
it gets very boring very fast.

42
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,878
You're not jealous, are you?

43
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,967
Of Trevor ?

44
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:44,704
Should I be?

45
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:47,458
No. Of course not.

46
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:52,017
So what if he's the man whose masterly
touch ushered me into womanhood?

47
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:55,208
The one I ultimately compare all other men to?

48
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,957
Okay, okay, fine.

49
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,074
But, just so you know, you'll only have yourself to blame

50
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,384
when I go all alpha dog and beat him
to a bloody pulp in front of his wife and kid!

51
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,099
Oh, my Hero !

52
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,672
I'm gonna kick his ass.

53
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,108
Fucking Trevor.

54
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,384
Fucking Trevor.

55
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,086
Good morning, Mrs. Huntley.

56
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:28,354
Looks like another scorcher, huh?

57
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:32,726
Where are my new acquisitions, Mr. Gilardi?

58
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:33,992
I'm on it.

59
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:37,227
What you're on is my shit list, cowboy.

60
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,503
I made you personally responsible
for finding three homes

61
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,180
that we can dump at a profit,

62
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,047
and what do I get from you?
Diddly squat!

63
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,449
I already closed
McKenzie Bros. and Dayle Montgomery!

64
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,046
Three new homes, Mr. Gilardi.

65
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,833
Apparently,
I misjudged your capabilities.

66
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:57,758
What about Fisher & Sons?
You've been after them for months now.

67
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,458
Well, they're more resilient
than I expected.

68
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,755
Jeez Louise!
Man, play like you've got a big dick!

69
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:06,345
Can you get them for me or not?

70
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,348
You said I had till the end of the year.

71
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,141
Well, Christmas came early this year.
You're fired.

72
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,147
What ?

73
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:17,172
Your presence is no longer required.
You're hereby rendered irrelevant.

74
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:20,238
You can't be serious! Mitzi!

75
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:25,141
I can do this. I swear.
Now just give me another chance!

76
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:29,446
You know, just because I fucked you,
that doesn't put us on a first name basis!

77
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,919
Well, you're dressed early.

78
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:44,579
We have an intake at 9:30.
Josh Langmead.

79
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,202
Am I supposed to know who that is?

80
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:47,588
Don't you watch the news?

81
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,567
Not if I can help it.
It's too depressing.

82
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:53,324
Josh Langmead is the Cal State football player
who died of heatstroke yesterday.

83
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:57,747
21 years old. In perfect health.
Till his brain fried.

84
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,815
Fuck.

85
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:04,147
Well, I'm off to Torrence.

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,069
I have a breakfast meeting with
the Living Splendour sales rep.

87
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,365
Wait a minute. That means...

88
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,018
Now that you're a licensed
funeral director,

89
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,872
we can get twice as much work done around here!

90
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:17,472
Just do me a favor.
Don't even mention the word "cremation."

91
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:20,579
Okay.
Can I mention the word "condescending"?

92
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,497
Be back by noon!

93
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,910
We thought Josh would want to be wearing
his number for the viewing.

94
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,077
Well, of course.

95
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:52,288
I took him to his first Rams game
when he was 3.

96
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,368
It wasn't long after
that he started wanting to play football.

97
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,302
He had...

98
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,290
He had NFL sheets.

99
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,682
Curtains. Pajamas.

100
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:13,429
Five Halloweens in a row,
he went as Bo Jackson.

101
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,834
It was his dream to play pro.

102
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:25,456
I bet he could've, too.
I think he was good enough.

103
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:28,240
He was certainly motivated enough.

104
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,573
You ever play ball?

105
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:35,317
Football. No, no way.

106
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:37,536
My dad wouldn't let me.
He said it was too d...

107
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:40,478
I played a little baseball in high school.

108
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:50,085
Have you made a decision about a casket?

109
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:52,417
We'd like the Titan 4.

110
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,059
How much is that?

111
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,697
9200 $.

112
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:05,606
What the hell?
It's only money.

113
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,659
Well, granted,
1400 square feet is a bit cozy,

114
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,854
but the layout is so ergonomic
that it feels twice as large.

115
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,342
Honey, it's got a sun roof!

116
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,961
- Girl's gotta get a better poker face.
- Yeah, too late.

117
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:28,573
It's very good that you brought
your own inspector.

118
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:31,860
Uh, no, he's my cousin.
He's in construction.

119
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,587
- So what's with the foundation?
- Oh, nothing. Perfect shape.

120
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:41,975
Well, part of it was rebuilt two years ago,
to the tune of 20,000.

121
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:44,268
So, it's better than new now.

122
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:45,692
Excuse me.

123
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,004
What do you think, man?

124
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,944
I'm not living here, man.
I've got a house.
What do you think?

125
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:54,098
I don't know.
Vanessa likes it.

126
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,004
Yeah, Vanessa likes dragging you around by your crank,
too, is what I think.

127
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,825
You're talking about my wife, man.

128
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:04,315
Vanessa and me are tight, man. You know that.
It's not about her.

129
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,397
I'm just breaking it down to you the way
the guys have been telling me.

130
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,924
You've been acting like a candy-ass bitch
ever since you got married.

131
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,580
Screw you, Ramon!

132
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:14,572
Hey, screw me all you want!

133
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,218
You know I'm right.

134
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,041
What are all these people doing in our new house?

135
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,831
Baby,

136
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,936
- do you really like the house?
- Yes! Yes!

137
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,678
Rico, the house is good.

138
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,441
It's got some little problems,
but nothing I can't fix.

139
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:35,729
Rico, there's a yard for the boys. They'll be able
to walk to school. You're closer to work.

140
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,510
Ramon, can we use your truck to move?

141
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,648
Nate Fisher.

142
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,506
Hi there, Nate,
this is Sheri from Appleby Caskets.

143
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:30,016
We received your fax order,
and I'm awfully sorry,

144
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:31,941
but the Titan 4 is no longer in production.

145
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,692
Oh, you've got to be shitting me!

146
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,162
Well, you must not have our 2002 catalogue!

147
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,765
- I can pop it in the mail if you'd...
- Well, what's the closest casket to the Titan?

148
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:44,775
Oh, that would probably be our Haven 2.
4100 wholesale. Usually retails for about 11600 $.

149
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:48,163
- Son of a motherfuck!
- Sir!

150
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:50,930
Alright, I'll have to get back to you.

151
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:08,918
I swear, I fuckin' hate public school!
This year-round shit? Fuck!

152
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,861
Well, we get October off, and six weeks in the spring.
What do you want?

153
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:17,643
This Persian girl who used to be my best friend at Archer,
till I fucked her brother,

154
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,881
she's spending the entire summer in France!

155
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:24,598
Where the fuck is Gabe?
He was supposed to meet us here like 10 minutes ago!

156
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,065
Dink, it's gonna be alright, man.

157
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,837
Everything is chill.

158
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,263
It's not chill.

159
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:33,874
The cops have that fuckin' video
at every school in L.A.!

160
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:38,265
Which means they haven't ided us yet, okay?

161
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,103
Which means they probably can't id us,

162
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:42,690
and anyone who could is
gonna keep quiet if they know what's good for him.

163
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:44,870
You'd better fuckin' hope so...

164
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:48,237
You fucker! Did you fuckin' tell somebody?

165
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:51,226
Because if you fucking told somebody,
I will fucking kill your bitch-ass, do you hear me?

166
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,543
- No, asshole!
- What about Andy?

167
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:57,069
How am I supposed to know?
He's your fuckin' best friend!

168
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:03,372
What ?

169
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:07,392
Uh, you were supposed to meet us like 10 minutes ago.
We're waiting.

170
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:10,004
Jesus, Claire, don't pussy whip him.

171
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,368
You gotta act like you don't care.

172
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,687
Guys hate it when they're pussy-whipped.

173
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:16,176
Like you've ever stuck around
long enough to find out,

174
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,721
Wonder Slut!

175
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,618
What, Squirrel Nut?

176
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,700
Your soul's on fire.

177
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,684
I know.

178
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,133
Your souls are on fire.

179
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:32,636
Whoa, you are not on the list of people
who get to touch my tits!

180
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:40,585
Andy, what is wrong?

181
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:50,319
- Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
- This is so fucked up!

182
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,355
Oh, God!

183
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,199
Andy, Andy, say something to me.

184
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,311
I don't know what to do right now!

185
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,016
Andy! Oh my God!

186
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,088
Andy! Look at me!

187
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,423
Go get the nurse!

188
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,470
- Did he take something?
- Go!

189
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:09,906
You stop it, stop it, you fucking bitch,

190
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:12,048
or I will kick the shit out of you.
Do you hear me?

191
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,697
What the fuck are you looking at?

192
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,718
I told you last week that the Titan Series
was out of production.

193
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,919
Yeah, well, I think that you should have torn
the damn page out of the catalogue!

194
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,217
It was an honest mistake.
We'll give them the Haven 2 for 11600$ instead.

195
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:28,346
- David, they're already paying more than they can afford.
- You don't know that.

196
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:31,169
God, I cannot tell you how much
I hate it when you patronize me!

197
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm being understanding. You want patronizing?
I'll give you patronizing!

198
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,282
Hey, guys.

199
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,766
Hey, Rico.
Langmead's in the reefer.

200
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,986
Yeah.
You guys got a moment?

201
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,782
Yeah, what's up?

202
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,088
Vanessa and I found a house.

203
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,465
Oh, Rico, that's great!

204
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:49,475
Yeah, yeah, we really like the house!

205
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:53,069
And, uh, we can swing the monthly payments,

206
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,340
if we put down 20%.

207
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:58,910
What are we talking about?

208
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,771
Well, we pieced most of it together,

209
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:05,268
but we're about 11 grand short.

210
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,304
11.000 ?

211
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,240
Yup. By tomorrow.

212
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:15,151
Look, we'll pay you back,
over 18 months, at 7% interest.

213
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:18,708
Now, that's a lot better than the bank,
and not too far off the market.

214
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:22,395
We'll let you know by tomorrow.

215
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,397
Thanks.

216
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,453
But right now, Mr. Langmead needs your attention.

217
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,973
I'm on it.

218
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,750
See? I am understanding.

219
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:44,768
That's a lovely arrangement.
What is it?

220
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,869
Scalene vase.

221
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,636
Didn't they teach you anything at Daffodil University?

222
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:56,763
Actually, it's...

223
00:15:56,764 --> 00:16:00,606
a combination of inverted T and scalene.

224
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:02,767
It's my own design,

225
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:07,896
and it's yours.

226
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:11,471
No. I just wanted to learn how to make one.

227
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,676
It's a gift from my heart.

228
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:15,450
Seriously.

229
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:19,567
Thank you so much, Robbie.

230
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:24,556
Okay, Ruth,

231
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:31,528
this is going to be hard for me to say, but...

232
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,029
I forgive you.

233
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,110
Forgive me? For what?

234
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:41,321
You destroyed the natural order
of the universe, cupcake.

235
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:44,856
Everything was perfectly quiet and boring
around here before you came,

236
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,402
and now Nikolai's all aflutter,

237
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:50,871
wanting to make improvements.
I'm expected to work.

238
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:53,767
For his own carnal reasons,
he favors you over me.

239
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:57,340
And for that, I forgive you.

240
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,366
I resent that!

241
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:03,733
I've always conducted myself
with complete professionalism!

242
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:07,323
Whatever, Ruth, I forgive you.

243
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,976
I don't need your forgiveness!

244
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:15,976
Oh, no, no, goddammit!
It's not supposed to go this way!

245
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,203
What isn't?

246
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:22,482
OK, Ruth, I'm graduating from The Plan tomorrow,

247
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:25,588
and I would really like it if you would be my witness.

248
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,770
The Plan? What is The Plan?

249
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,171
It's a multi-disciplined course that allows you

250
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,640
to think way beyond yourself,

251
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:36,858
and rebuild your life, from the ground floor,
plank by plank.

252
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,665
That sounds awful!

253
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,954
It teaches you how to feel really good about yourself

254
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,728
and get what you want out of life.

255
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,344
Do you want to go?

256
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:53,461
It would really mean a lot to me, Ruth.

257
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,924
- Wow!
- Pretty sweet, huh?

258
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,835
Each portal is lit by recessed halogens.

259
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:20,610
Tasteful signs for the model name,
materials, and pricing.

260
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,173
And this little drawer here?

261
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:26,135
This displays your interior upholstery fabric.

262
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,331
Point of purchase
does not get any better than this, my friends.

263
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:31,137
It's very impressive.

264
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,163
Impressive?
It's fucking gorgeous!

265
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:36,147
It's a completely interactive retail experience!

266
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,336
'Cause human beings,
we're tactile.

267
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,533
We like to touch the fruit before we buy.

268
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,096
I can't believe you guys!
You're still using a catalogue!

269
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:47,372
Now these caskets here,
there're on the upper level.

270
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:50,405
They appeal to men.
It's at their average height.

271
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:52,596
Down below are the ladies' favorites.

272
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,770
I have seen the future, and this is it!

273
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,388
Dave, where would it go?

274
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:58,038
We put it in the second viewing room!

275
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,496
What, the room that we've been using for storage?

276
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:00,979
David, that room needs serious work.

277
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,520
So? We use this as a reason to do it! Haven't we been
planning to do that with the money Mom gave us anyway?

278
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,982
Dave, that money is almost all gone.

279
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:14,357
A two by five like this will not break your back.
21500 $.

280
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:19,114
I'll tell you what.
20500.

281
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:23,700
That includes installation.
I'll even throw in a fresh coat of paint for your room.

282
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,551
You cannot beat that with a stick.

283
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:28,542
Nate, you always say we need
to spend money to make money.

284
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,078
Alright, how long to install?

285
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,630
Give me the word, and you'll be
making sales in two days.

286
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:38,006
- You really like it?
- Who wouldn't?!?

287
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:44,197
I've never seen David happier.
It was like Christmas morning when we were kids.

288
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,303
Whoa! Working out a little aggression there?

289
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:57,168
We're having chicken piccatta.
It needs to marinate over night.

290
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,182
You never cook like this for me.
You never even cook.

291
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:05,743
And when Trevor goes back to New Haven,
I need you to forget that I can!

292
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,995
Alright. What should I wear?

293
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:12,143
Speedo? Hair extensions?
Wear what you want. I don't care.

294
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,691
Don't wear one of your funeral suits.

295
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,644
Oh, I thought you don't care.

296
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:23,543
Wear something that makes you look like
the sexy bad boy you really are.

297
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,782
Something that makes Mister Wife and Kids

298
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,265
question all of his middle-class choices.

299
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,860
I'm all for that, just as long as you wear something low-cut in the back,

300
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:34,019
so he can see my name branded on your ass!

301
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,238
Hello! Hello?

302
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,614
Hello?

303
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,734
Hello?

304
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,862
Hey. New casket wall, huh?

305
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,710
You boys are doing better than I thought.

306
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:30,014
I'm Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

307
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,580
David Fisher.

308
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,377
Do you need to plan a funeral?

309
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,653
You have no idea who I am do you.

310
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:46,768
I'm Southwest Regional Director
for Kroehner Services, International.

311
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:52,550
I was hoping that maybe you and your brother
might share a cup of coffee with me.

312
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:05,173
Well, hello!
Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

313
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,382
Nate Fisher.

314
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:11,074
You're a runner, huh?

315
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,746
It's bad for your knees.

316
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:15,692
Yeah, well, everything's bad for something.

317
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,797
So I hear.

318
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:20,700
Why are you here?

319
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:24,099
I made it abundantly clear to Matt Gilardi
we're not interested in selling.

320
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,386
Oh, Matt Gilardi is no longer with Kroehner.

321
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:29,860
Yup. I fired his worthless ass,

322
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:33,002
because I didn't like the way
that he was representing our company.

323
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,197
And that is why I'm here today.

324
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:41,163
To do a little damage control,
and apologize to you boys.

325
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:42,239
Right.

326
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,055
Oh, I don't blame you for not trusting me.

327
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:46,439
Frankly, I'd be worried about you if you did.

328
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,754
- Cream with three sugars.
- Well, thank you.

329
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,537
You didn't put rat poison in here, did you?

330
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,334
Drink it and find out.

331
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,889
Oh, please!

332
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,899
You boys aren't afraid of Big Bad Mitzi,
are you?

333
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,583
Come on.

334
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,821
The economy is in a tail spin.

335
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:11,273
Corporations are downsizing, and resizing,
and reorganizing,

336
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,455
including Kroehner.

337
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:15,867
We can't afford to take you over.
Honey, we've got problems of our own.

338
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:18,001
Okay, let's just cut the foreplay.

339
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,792
But that's the best part.

340
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,594
It's not that we don't trust you.

341
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,565
We despise everything you stand for:

342
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,769
corporate profits over personal service,

343
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,580
stockholders over clients,

344
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:29,219
greed over everything else,

345
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,081
so I think you should take
your gesture of good faith,

346
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,542
and shove it up your ass!

347
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:36,602
Ooh, well that's one opinion.

348
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:39,607
Anything that you would care to add, David?

349
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:43,412
No, I think Nate pretty much summed our position up.

350
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,591
Well, alrighty then.

351
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:50,086
I'll just show myself out.

352
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:56,776
By the way, you might want to clean out your coffeemaker.

353
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,229
Your coffee sucks.

354
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,642
This is not so good.

355
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:09,554
Well, who the fuck is named Mitzi anyway?
That sounds like something you name a fuckin' chiuaua!

356
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,264
Pretty bitchin', huh?

357
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,352
When did you start getting all excited over caskets?

358
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:27,243
You're turning into David!

359
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,192
Don't ever say that again!

360
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,331
Very nice.

361
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:35,319
Oh, welcome to Casketeria!
May I take your order?

362
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,860
So, Mr. Langmead is all ready to go.

363
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,501
Great.

364
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:47,478
Yeah. So, Nate, have you guys had a chance
to think about what we...you know?

365
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,316
- Uh, yeah...
- yeah?

366
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,071
- Yeah, let's go in the office.
- Okay.

367
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:01,910
So do these really open?
Can you, like, hide shit in here?

368
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:04,010
Can you close the door?

369
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,020
Close the door doesn't sound too good.

370
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,347
We can't give you a loan right now, Rico.

371
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:20,556
Look, we just spent a fortune
on the new casket wall,

372
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:22,407
and now we have to maintain an emergency fund

373
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:26,444
in case Kroehner starts acting up again,
which suddenly looks very likely.

374
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,753
It was a tough choice, I'm sorry.

375
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,537
How much did that casket wall cost?

376
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:39,242
Rico, our first priority is
keeping this house open.

377
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:40,832
The more income we make, the more you can make.

378
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:45,853
Tell me one thing. Did you and David decide to buy that wall
before or after we spoke.

379
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:55,214
Wow. You know, first you won't make me a partner,
now you won't even...

380
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:57,994
God, you know, I've had it with you moping
about not being a partner.

381
00:25:57,995 --> 00:25:59,460
It's not happening, alright?

382
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:02,126
I wish I could help you, but I can't.

383
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:07,723
I mean, fuck, we're your employer, alright!
We're not a goddamned savings and loan!

384
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:14,623
I'm sorry, Rico.

385
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:19,592
If it were my money,
I'd give you all of it, you know that.

386
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:29,238
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll pass it along to my kids,
after playing in a parking lot next to a dumpster!

387
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,911
Fuck!

388
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:05,492
I'm scared.

389
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:09,210
What's gonna happen to me now?

390
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,516
Well, that''s not my problem, pal.

391
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:19,388
What?

392
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,587
I was so young.

393
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:23,417
Why me?

394
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:26,497
Well, why the fuck not you? What?
Did you think you were immune to this?

395
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:28,903
Everybody!

396
00:27:28,904 --> 00:27:32,155
What makes you so fuckin' special?

397
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:47,020
What do you think?

398
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:49,230
I'm not signing up for anything.

399
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:53,931
Oh, I'm not selling anything.
I'm a visitor, just like you.

400
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:59,001
Do you know how you can tell?
The Elevated wear plastic tags.

401
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:00,353
The Elevated?

402
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:02,196
Oh, you'll learn the lingo.

403
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:05,944
My daughter is graduating today.
You?

404
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,785
My business associate is graduating.

405
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:11,018
So what exactly is this?

406
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,814
Well, I don't know for sure myself.

407
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:16,686
But Shelia has never been happier,

408
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:19,705
so I wanted to see what it was all about.

409
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,674
<i>Let's get started.</i>

410
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:25,295
<i>Today just might be the most important day
of your entire lives.</i>

411
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:28,986
Come sit with me.
There's safety in numbers.

412
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,560
You cannot design a life that works
without first drafting a clear blueprint.

413
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:43,672
And you cannot construct a life that has meaning
without first laying a solid foundation.

414
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:47,603
You are the architect of your life.

415
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:50,295
Not your emotionally distant father.

416
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,209
Not your overly critical mother.

417
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,864
Not your petty, fairweather friends.

418
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,205
You !

419
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,892
It was hard the first time I stood up for myself.

420
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:15,813
I always wanted everybody to like me.

421
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:19,890
Even though I hated myself, you had to like me.

422
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,316
When I rebuilt my foundation,

423
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:27,200
and I was able to honor
and elevate the better part of me,

424
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:30,481
I realized I really like me.

425
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:33,631
So you don't have to!

426
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,631
I'm not a salvage job.

427
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:43,877
I am not a teardown.
I am not junk.

428
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:49,107
It's taken me many years to say that.
To believe it.

429
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:53,990
There are days that I slip,
and I treat people like shit.

430
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,837
Like I treated myself for the last 30 years.

431
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,944
But then I swear I'm going to win this.

432
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:08,717
I'm going to build the life that
I always wanted to live.

433
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:20,540
I thought it was too late.

434
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,503
Two terrible marriages.

435
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:29,009
Children who won't even return my phone calls.

436
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,774
It hurts.

437
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:34,487
I'm 41 and I feel like I'm 80.

438
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,115
But I have value.

439
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:40,622
I'm still here.

440
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:44,297
And as long as I believe in myself

441
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,603
and speak fiercely from the Eye,

442
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:50,053
then there's still hope.

443
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:53,092
There's no mortgage on my life.

444
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,374
I own it.

445
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,614
Thank you, Mom.

446
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:32,964
Well, that was humiliating.
As if my self-esteem wasn't low enough.

447
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:34,196
It's kind of funny.

448
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:36,270
All that time we were racquetball partners,

449
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,214
we actually never played racquetball.

450
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:42,181
I am serious about wanting to learn how to play.
Are you available Thursday afternoon?

451
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:44,333
I don't know. I'll check.

452
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:48,362
Hey, wanna drop by my niece's
birthday party later?

453
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:51,203
- Eddie's on call.
- Uh, sure.

454
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:55,180
I got a couple of errands to run.
I'll call you later.

455
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:59,283
I've got nothing to do.
I'll just tag along, if that's okay.

456
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:05,311
Oh my God. Did you hear?
Andy was doing Fry!

457
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:06,554
I'm sorry. In English?

458
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:09,388
Fry ! Wet ! Illy !

459
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:11,718
You're telling me you've never heard of Fry?

460
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:16,230
I'm sorry. My parole officer frowns
on controlled substances.

461
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:19,496
Okay. You take your standard garden
variety doobie, right?

462
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:23,885
You dip it in embalming fluid,
cut it with God knows what, and BAM!

463
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:27,617
All your states are altered and you see God!

464
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:32,641
Or...you're in tweaker hell,
bouncing off lockers, and swallowing your own tongue, like Andy.

465
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:35,527
Embalming fluid?
Are you kidding me?

466
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:38,191
I've smelled that shit! It's like lethal!

467
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:39,990
You oughtta get out more.
Live a little.

468
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,361
- You've done this?!?
- No.

469
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,913
But if you ever wanted to make a quick buck...

470
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:48,904
Oh, fuck off, Parker! I am not getting
into the pot and embalming fluid business!

471
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,135
I've had enough run-ins with the police, thank you!

472
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:56,331
At 50 $ a pop, you might change your mind.

473
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:02,633
Oh my God! That fuckin' asshole!

474
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,890
Right?

475
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:08,837
I mean, Andy's gonna be in detox for like a week!

476
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:13,518
Look okay?

477
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,228
It looks fine.
It looks like a page out of Gourmet Magazine!

478
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,597
Excellent !

479
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,657
You know they put hairspray on food
before they photograph it sometimes?

480
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:23,658
Really?

481
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,978
Yeah, I used to go out with this food
stylist in Seattle.

482
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:31,990
I mean, they do stuff to food that is way worse
than what we do to bodies, believe you me.

483
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:42,620
Okay. Tell me I look beautiful.

484
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,550
You are beautiful.

485
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,632
You even mean that. Okay.

486
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,728
- Hi!
- Hi!

487
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:03,916
Will, at least say "Hello!"

488
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,253
Hello!

489
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:10,440
Wow, Bren, it's great to see you!
It really is.

490
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:14,332
Oh my God! I'm gonna cry!

491
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:18,425
- You must be Dawn!
- Hi! Oh, it's nice to meet you.

492
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:22,362
Thank you so much for letting us bring Will.
Trevor really wanted you to meet him.

493
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,967
Oh, I really wanted to meet him.

494
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:27,568
Hey, hi, Will!

495
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,356
Will, can you say hi?

496
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:32,256
He'll crash in a little while. I promise.

497
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:34,648
- Hi. I'm Trevor.
- Nate.

498
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:35,966
Oh! Nate. Dawn.

499
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,159
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

500
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,222


501
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:43,148
This place is really cool.

502
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:49,025
- Yeah. So, wine anyone?
- I'd love a glass.

503
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:50,263
...

504
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:51,534
<i>I want wine!</i>

505
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:55,829
Oh, you do? Well, what do you say?

506
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,235
<i>Hi, Mr. Pooh Bear. Do you remember
what we discussed in the car?</i>

507
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:02,132
....

508
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:05,582
"I want wine, please!"

509
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:06,800
Please

510
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,576
So, how's the press tour going?

511
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:14,708
Oh, God, I feel like such a sell-out!
I actually did "Politically Incorrect" last night!

512
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,144
Wow! Was it fun?

513
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:19,006
Oh, hardly. It was me, Kobe Bryant,

514
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:22,826
that emaciated chick from "The Practice,"
and some twelve year old rap singer

515
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:24,950
I'd never even heard of!

516
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:29,051
I read your first book.
I thought it was brilliant.

517
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:30,415
Thank you!

518
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:34,563
- I can send you a copy of the new one, if you'd like.
- I would. Thank you.

519
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:37,289
You know, I read "Charlotte: Light and Dark."

520
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,514
Oh, dear! Why?

521
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,950
In grad school. I had this idiot
professor who insisted

522
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:48,712
that it was the perfect profile of
a classic borderline personality.

523
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:51,923
You've heard that before, right?

524
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,122
I actually went to the library,
looked up the symptoms

525
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:57,655
and started behaving like that
just to fuck with them!

526
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,191
Seriously?

527
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:02,585
That's brilliant!
How old were you?

528
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,416
I must have been 9 or 10.
It was towards the end.

529
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:08,686
Personally, I think it's a crock of shit.

530
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,684
Did you ever notice how the majority
of borderlines are women?

531
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:15,712
I see it as just a misogynistic
attempt to pathologize women

532
00:36:15,713 --> 00:36:18,606
who refuse to toe the patriarchal line!

533
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:24,466
Yeah, yeah, I spent 6 months in Seattle
on a teaching fellowship.

534
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:25,655
Ever do any cliimbing up there?

535
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:29,926
Oh, yeah, some boulder climbing.
Normal climbing with ropes but...

536
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:31,698
Are you a cragger?

537
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:35,619
Eh. Rank amateur urban kind, but I love it.

538
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,724
You done climbing rock?

539
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:42,161
Yeah, that's where I learned.
I never knew 30 feet was so high off the ground.

540
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:44,030
30 feet? That's nothing!

541
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:46,871
I've got a couple of buddies.
They're real thrillseekers.

542
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,221
I mean, they climb high,

543
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:51,184
but no way I can do that.

544
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,743
Gotta think about more than just myself now.

545
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,631
Bren looks great.

546
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,528
How's she doing?

547
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:08,534
Oh, she's doing great.

548
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:11,344
- Man, she is so fucking smart!
- Yes, she is!

549
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:15,106
She used to run circles around me,
I can tell you that.

550
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,976
Everybody expected such great things from her.
551
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,915
How's her brother?

551
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:28,596
He's in the hospital
right now.

552
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:44,025
I just really wanted to get out of my head,

553
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:47,712
so I took 18 months of classes,
down at the Shiatsu Institute,

554
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:51,358
thinking I'd do it until I figured out
what I really wanted to do.

555
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,278
And here we are 10 years later.

556
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,393
- But you love what you do, right?
- I do.

557
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:58,678
That's the key.
And you know what?

558
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:02,241
There is this girl in my health club.
She doesn't do shiatsu,

559
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:06,238
but I swear. She is gifted.
Gif-ted!

560
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,334
You know, there's a science to shiatsu.

561
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:12,777
Chinese medicine dates back over 2000 years.

562
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:19,688
Hmm...This is delicious, Brenda.
You know, I never cook like this.

563
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,969
I can make pasta, but that's about it.

564
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,048
She's got me beat. I can make toast.
And ice cubes.

565
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:28,640
Nate does pretty good microwave popcorn.

566
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,871
What do you do, Nate?

567
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,826
I'm a funeral director.

568
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,946
Really?

569
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:45,473
What--what--what makes one to decide to--uh--
become a funeral director?

570
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,115
Well, I was born into it, actually.

571
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,703
Sort of like being born into the Mafia.

572
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:05,313
Hey, not so fast there, hotshot!
It's a tow road!

573
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:29,084
Will ! Will !

574
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:30,384
Time out.

575
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:34,637
Sometimes he becomes completely irrational
just to gain attention.

576
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,865
Hell, sometimes I do that.

577
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,903
Oncle K !

578
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:50,972
Hey, baby girl!
Happy birthday!

579
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:52,508
I'm 9.

580
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:55,121
Oh, well, I guess that means
I can't call you "Baby Girl" anymore.

581
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,790
You better not!

582
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,889
This is my friend, David.

583
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,281
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

584
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:03,367
So where's the party?

585
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,370
You want some? It's good.

586
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,024
This is for you, sweetheart.

587
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:36,567
I saw this in the store!

588
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,939
Yeah, I can't believe they still make these!

589
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,561
- I thought you'd like it.
- Thanks, Uncle K.

590
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,265
- Where's Mommy?
- In the bedroom, sleeping.

591
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:54,225
- I'm going to go and talk to her for a little bit, alright?
- Okay.

592
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:14,562
Carla !

593
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,301
Carla !

594
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,045
Hi...

595
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:32,221
Thought you wasn't comin' till later.

596
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:36,136
It is later.
What happened to Taylor's birthday party?

597
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:38,945
Shit!

598
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:42,476
I got home from work and was bone-tired.

599
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:45,822
I'll take her to the flea market on the weekend,
get her something.

600
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:47,260
That's all you did for her birthday?

601
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:48,883
Buy her an Entennmann's cake?!?

602
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:50,579
It's her favorite.

603
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,225
What are you on?

604
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,914
- Don't lie to me!
- I ain't on nothin'! Ok?

605
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:02,138
What? You think I'm suicidal or
just plain stupid?

606
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,266
I think you need to stop living just for yourself,
and start thinking about that little girl in there.

607
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:10,233
I am 7 months clean! I work 2 jobs
and take care of my kid!

608
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:13,516
What? I forgot her motherfuckin' birthday!
Do you want to arrest me for that?

609
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:16,759
Look, you can do all the damage you want to yourself.
I can't stop that.

610
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,682
But I'm not gonna let you fuck up her life!

611
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:21,456
- Take your hands off me.
- Carla...

612
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:25,548
I will file an assault charge,
and you do not want that.

613
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,498
My sister had one of these when she was a kid.

614
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:34,802
But I broke it.

615
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:36,392
On purpose?

616
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:39,678
No. I wanted to make a pizza,

617
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,480
and I put in a 300 watt bulb,
and the whole thing melted!

618
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:45,122
That's dumb!

619
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:47,447
Yeah, I know, and I was 17.

620
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:52,985
<i>You don't give a fuck about her!
I'm talkin' to you!</i>

621
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:55,310
<i>You don't know shit!
Get the fuck out of my house!</i>

622
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,047
<i>I do! I do!</i>

623
00:42:57,048 --> 00:43:01,000
- Do you live in a house?
- Yup.

624
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:02,835
A big house?

625
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,720
Not that big.

626
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,666
Got a daddy?

627
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:11,443
I used to.

628
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,859
- We gotta go, okay?
- Okay.

629
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,417
Alright, listen, uh...

630
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,827
I'll come back tomorrow

631
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:28,063
as soon as I get off work,
and we'll go to the movies, okay?

632
00:43:28,164 --> 00:43:29,809
Okay.

633
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,286
We gotta go.

634
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:51,737
Oh, my God!

635
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:54,412
What was I thinking?

636
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:57,797
Well, I was only 19.

637
00:43:57,798 --> 00:44:00,127
Aw, come on, it wasn't that bad.

638
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:05,448
"There's this girl at my health club.
She is gif-ted!

639
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:07,157
Gif-ted".

640
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,766
What a dork!

641
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,104
His ears were filthy.
Did you notice that?

642
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,289
No.

643
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,792
Now, her I liked.

644
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:16,094
That kid! What a freak!

645
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,687
tart saving up for therapy now!

646
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,341
We need some friends.
Some couples we don't hate.

647
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,488
We have each other.

648
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:33,303
Maybe we should volunteer some place.

649
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:36,131
No, I'm serious.

650
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:39,294
Do something good for the world.

651
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:42,174
Exchange Program.

652
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:46,150
Habitat for Humanity. Meels on Wheels.

653
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,558
Just give more, consume less.

654
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,824
Brenda, I'm dying.

655
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:56,871
What? What did you say?

656
00:44:56,872 --> 00:45:02,911
After the auto accident, I had x-rays, MRIs,
and they found something.

657
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,822
They found... it's called AVM, I don't know.
And I think I'm gonna die from it. I don't know when.

658
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:15,316
I'm so scared.

659
00:45:20,744 --> 00:45:22,602
Are you listening to me?

660
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:23,778
Yeah.

661
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,437
Meels on Wheels.

662
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:29,122
You really wanna do that?

663
00:45:29,523 --> 00:45:32,260
I don't know. I have to do something.

664
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:35,097
I hate my fucking life.

665
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:36,939
What's wrong?

666
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,271
I was watching Trevor and Dawn tonight,

667
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:47,145
thinking...
they're just so...so complete.

668
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:51,682
Like they have something
that I will never have, ever.

669
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:55,416
Either I wasn't born with it,
or it was beaten out of me,

670
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:57,579
or maybe,

671
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,630
maybe I made myself into a self-fulfilling prophecy,

672
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,485
and I really am a borderline personality.

673
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,975
Now, wouldn't that be ironic?

674
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:07,367
Hey, what's going on with you?

675
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:11,431
Je ne sais pas.

676
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:15,413
I don't know. I spent my childhood performing
for clinicians,

677
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:18,347
the rest of my life taking care of my trainwreck
of a brother,

678
00:46:18,348 --> 00:46:22,187
and I have no idea who I am.

679
00:46:25,547 --> 00:46:28,365
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
Want one?

680
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:31,889
No thanks.

681
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:45,910
God, I can't wait until our next funeral!

682
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,038
What do you think, Mom?

683
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,164
It's very modern.

684
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:53,275
We figure it'll pay for itself in less than 8 months.

685
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:55,669
What did we spend on this?

686
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,409
About 20000 $.

687
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:03,644
How much is left in the reserve fund
I gave you?

688
00:47:03,645 --> 00:47:05,026
I'll have to check.

689
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:08,199
I want a full accounting of how you spent that 93000 $.

690
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,092
I'm an investor in Fisher & Sons.
That wall is part of my investment, and I want a return!

691
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:14,280
Well, of course, Mom.

692
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:17,898
I am speaking fiercely from the Eye!

693
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,143
Do you mind?

694
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:25,740
I don't know.

695
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,054
I just need one of you to sign right here,

696
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:29,543
and we'll be done

697
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:33,366
Do we need to write you a check right now,
or can we just mail it to your office?

698
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,210
Uh, you might want to open this first.

699
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,387
It's beautiful.

700
00:47:39,388 --> 00:47:41,463
- It's great.
- It's great.

701
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:50,683
"Enjoy the new casket wall. It's on me.
Kisses. Mitzi Dalton Huntley.".

702
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:52,819
Why would she pay for our wall?

703
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,608
She didn't pay for it.
Appleby Caskets is owned by Kroehner.

704
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:58,368
Since when?

705
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:00,397
Since three weeks ago.

706
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,446
Enjoy.

707
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:09,112
She has us selling Kroehner caskets!

708
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:11,649
Wow. She's good.

709
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:14,706
Well, I guess we can at least help out Rico now.

710
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,255
Yeah, that's a good idea.

711
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:20,305
Then we go under, and he's out of work,
and he can't afford to pay us back.

712
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:22,381
Which won't matter
because we won't exist anymore.

713
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:25,407
David, we just saved 20000 $.

714
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:29,138
We didn't save 20000 $ !
We just didn't spend it!

715
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,434
Actually, we just lost 1600 $

716
00:48:31,435 --> 00:48:36,640
because we had to give the Langmeads the Haven 4 for 10500,
thank you very much!

717
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:47,793
Honey, of course I love the house,

718
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,444
but, believe me,
they are never gonna give us the money.

719
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:52,331
You love the house, though.

720
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:54,901
We just have to keep on looking, baby.

721
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:58,505
No, we don't. I went to the realtor this morning,
and we got the house!

722
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:02,241
I wrote a check for the down payment,
and now Julio can have his own room!

723
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:06,054
What? Where did you get the money? What do you mean?

724
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:09,017
Okay, don't be mad.

725
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,058
You went behind my back and asked your sister for the money?
Are you crazy?

726
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:26,235
- Rico, I wasn't about to lose that house.
- I provide for this family, NOT HER!

727
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:27,923
I've gone 8 to 10 hours a day

728
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,140
missing my kids
to get us what we need.

729
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:31,500
I DON'T NEED HER FUCKING HANDOUTS!

730
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,245
Please, I don't want to hear
any machismo bullshit today!

731
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:40,174
What did you say to me?

732
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,294
Baby,...

733
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:48,259
we have a house.

734
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,693
It's our first house.

735
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:53,232
Can you be happy?

736
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,758
I'm cancelling that check.

737
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,850
Listen to me.

738
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:00,442
When the transmission went last month,
where'd the money come from?

739
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:04,203
When I chipped my tooth
and we couldn't afford the dentist,
who paid for it?

740
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:08,104
Angelica's doing good. She has extra money.
She's family.

741
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,201
She loves us. She wants to help us.

742
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:14,297
So please,

743
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,216
put down the phone.

744
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,897
We have a house.

745
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:36,460
Everything is good.

746
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:57,731
How's Andy?

747
00:50:59,294 --> 00:51:01,445
He's gonna be okay.

748
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:04,846
What was he on?

749
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:07,971
Some weird shit.
I don't really know.

750
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:13,492
Because I heard he smoked
a joint dipped in embalming fluid.

751
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:15,858
I wouldn't know.

752
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:19,298
That wouldn't be embalming fluid
that you stole from my house, right?

753
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:23,281
What the fuck is wrong with you?

754
00:51:23,282 --> 00:51:25,779
Do you have any idea how much
trouble this could get us in?

755
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,180
I mean, first of all, he could've died.

756
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:33,025
And my brothers could be getting a fucking phone call
from the cops right now,
and you're gonna bring this on my head?

757
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:34,823
Would you stop?

758
00:51:35,436 --> 00:51:38,971
Look, I gave Andy 5 or 6 to sell,

759
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:41,372
and he fucking smoked them all.

760
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:43,329
I am sorry that I fucked with you.

761
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,562
But you took me down there, and I saw the stuff,
and I just wasn't thinking.

762
00:51:47,763 --> 00:51:51,211
Oh, you were thinking.
You were thinking about yourself!

763
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:54,541
Claire, listen to me.
Listen to me.

764
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:58,138
Look, the cops have a videotape of me and Andy and Dink
766
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:59,394
robbing a fucking convenience store,

765
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:02,886
and now I'm worried that Andy's gonna turn me in.

766
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:09,575
Who the fuck are you?

767
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:17,006
Fuck! Everything I touch turns to shit!

768
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:22,168
Everything is shit!

769
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:26,552
Everybody was right about you.

770
00:52:28,095 --> 00:52:32,729
You are the only good thing that I have left.
Please don't give up on me.

771
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,299
Please.

772
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,925
No.

773
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,298
Oh, Christ.

774
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:14,841
You know, you're really starting to piss me off.

775
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:18,564
What? What? What?
What the fuck do you want from me?

776
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:21,118
I want you to see me!

777
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:23,249
Look at me!

778
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:43,600
Look at me!

779
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:57,093
That's more like it.

780
00:54:25,322 --> 00:54:27,380
You done with your run already?

781
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,694
Uh--I didn't need it.

782
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:32,992
Well, the Langmead viewing is at 6.
You're ready, right, because if you're not...

783
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:35,617
Dave, I need to tell you something.

784
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:38,394
What have you done now?

785
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,629
I think we should sit down.

786
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:56,876
What is it?

787
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:07,648
Um--Listen, if I've been a dick or something,
I'm really sorry.

788
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:16,018
I found out that I have a condition, called AVM.

789
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,484
It basically means...
