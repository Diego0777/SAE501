1
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,939
Okay, let's go then.

2
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,036
Are you packed?

3
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,074
Don't forget the dog, honey.

4
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,049
Don't forget the dog, honey.

5
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,122
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,893
He's not in the car, is he?

7
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:19,298
- Why is he talking about a dog? What dog?
- We had a dog in Boulder.

8
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,907
- What is this?
- We're in the hospital.

9
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,749
You're sick, remember?

10
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,146
But you're gonna be just fine.

11
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,950
Rita, lying to him
doesn't help anybody but you.

12
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,757
Stop it.

13
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,362
- Nurse!
- It's okay to let go.

14
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,999
I'm going to beat it.

15
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,634
But maybe you can't. You don't have to.

16
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,476
Why would you say that?

17
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,510
I don't want you to be scared.

18
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,548
I don't want to die.

19
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,751
I'm not gonna die.

20
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,086
That's just your body. It's not you.

21
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,488
That's bullshit, Eileen.

22
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,300
Excuse me.

23
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,229
Here you go.

24
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:31,037
We're going to increase your morphine,
all right, Mr. Piper?

25
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,889
Do you see?

26
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,828
Rita, above his head.

27
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,162
The light.

28
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,658
Oh, yes, he's a good boy.

29
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,231
Better hurry up.
We've got Mrs. Piper at 8:30.

30
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,359
Yeah, I'll be right there.

31
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,828
What are you doing, Dave?
Downloading pics from mansluts. Com?

32
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,473
Great, Dave, thanks.

33
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,569
I thought we should have
all the information.

34
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,377
- I have all the information.
- I don't think you do.

35
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,848
If you don't get this treated...

36
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,580
you could have seizures with
muscular twitching, loss of verbal skills.

37
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,317
You could even have
some kind of hemorrhage at some point.

38
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:56,122
Or I could be in the wrong airplane
at some point, or so could you.

39
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:57,855
All right? Come on.

40
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:08,272
The Parliament. It's very elegant.

41
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,641
Yes. I like it.

42
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,142
But Michael thinks it's tacky.

43
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:28,083
That's the Cleveland.
It's a more affordable choice.

44
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,288
But, as you can see,
it's not quite as gracious.

45
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:35,957
Really? No, but it's just so self-effacing.

46
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,432
But why?

47
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:42,039
- Mrs. Piper?
- I'm sorry.

48
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:46,703
Can you excuse me for a moment?
I can't carry on two conversations at once.

49
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,214
It's exactly like that horrible IKEA couch
your mother bought us.

50
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,654
Michael claims to love this one.

51
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,420
In my opinion, he's trying to do
what he thinks his mother wants...

52
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,519
which is typical, really.

53
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,029
Fine, deny it. Why change now?

54
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,434
Would you like to sit down for a minute?

55
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:14,063
I'm fine. It's just Michael's here.

56
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,303
He didn't want to deal with this stuff
when he was alive.

57
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,241
You know, the funeral.

58
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,537
Now he's very opinionated.

59
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,148
I'm a psychic, so, you know...

60
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,914
That must be very interesting for you.

61
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,415
It's just more information.

62
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:42,233
This room has a lot of pain in it.

63
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:45,968
Well, yes.

64
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:52,003
You have a lot in your mind.
On your mind, I mean. Don't you?

65
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:56,011
Yeah, I guess so.

66
00:06:56,681 --> 00:07:00,412
Don't worry. It's okay, all right?

67
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,881
It's all gonna be okay.

68
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,884
Thanks.

69
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,456
Okay, honey, if it's what you want.
It's your funeral.

70
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:28,337
Look, she gave me her card.

71
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,610
"Spiritual Consultation
and Past Life Regression"?

72
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,412
For God's sake, who does this?

73
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,546
Who spends $100 to be told
they were once Eleanor of Aquitaine?

74
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,356
Or whoever, the Marquis de Sade.

75
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,555
So what do you think happens
after we die? Heaven?

76
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,119
- Or Hell.
- Really?

77
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,261
But with angels, devils, or brimstone,
or whatever?

78
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,531
I don't know what it looks like,
or who's there...

79
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,200
but I do believe there are consequences
for the way we live our lives.

80
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:05,739
You know,
sometimes I kind of feel like Dad's around.

81
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,453
Do you ever?

82
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,250
Nope.

83
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:21,032
You know we have the Independent
Funeral Directors' lunch today, right?

84
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,896
Why do I have to go? That's your thing.

85
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,665
It's your thing, too, now. These are
your colleagues. You need to know them.

86
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:29,764
I know who they are. I met them in Vegas.
They're freaks.

87
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,470
- They're not freaks.
- Nobody likes the Brazil nuts, David.

88
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,046
Not the local guys.

89
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:39,606
I'm sure the LA morticians
are a lot more fun than those from Montana.

90
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,653
You're an LA mortician now, Nate.
This is your community.

91
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:46,520
It's polite for the first person downstairs
to make the coffee.

92
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,252
Even if that person has a penis.

93
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,261
It's also polite for the first person
who uses the bathroom...

94
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:55,265
to spend less than 45 minutes in there.
Even if that person has a vulva.

95
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,996
- Oh, goodness, everyone's here.
- With all their genitalia.

96
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,904
- Excuse me?
- Mom, would you like some toast?

97
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:06,137
No, thanks.
I have to be in the Valley by 10:30.

98
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,372
- What's in the Valley?
- I'm going to a seminar.

99
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,973
- What seminar?
- Something Robbie invited me to. The Plan.

100
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,074
Isn't that a cult?

101
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,177
No, it's one of those
self-actualization things from the '<i>7</i>0s...

102
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:19,348
where they yell for 12 hours
and don't let you go to the bathroom.

103
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,086
Oh, no. Really?
Should I bring some kind of jar?

104
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,357
- A jar?
- I suppose that's not much of a solution.

105
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:31,263
You're on your own for dinner.
I won't be back until after midnight.

106
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:35,461
The thought of Mom being self-actualized
is kind of making me nauseous.

107
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,703
You sure it's not the thought
of Mom pissing into a jar?

108
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,271
<i>So, Tahira,</i>
<i>why can't you forgive your father?</i>

109
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,043
<i>When I was 16...</i>

110
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,478
<i>he had a dream</i>
<i>that I had given myself to a man...</i>

111
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,682
<i>who was not the husband</i>
<i>I had been promised to.</i>

112
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,518
<i>For that, he set me on fire.</i>

113
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,820
<i>I was able to save myself.</i>

114
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:03,156
<i>But I had to leave the country</i>
<i>so he would not kill me.</i>

115
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,027
<i>And always...</i>

116
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,333
<i>I will have the scars from this.</i>

117
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,003
<i>That's horrible. Truly horrible.</i>

118
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,236
<i>How could he do this to me?</i>

119
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:19,511
<i>But as long as you hold on to that anger</i>
<i>toward your father...</i>

120
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,347
<i>you will be on fire.</i>

121
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:26,781
<i>You may have left the country,</i>
<i>but you are still living in the same house.</i>

122
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:30,593
<i>And in that house,</i>
<i>there is a room that is still burning.</i>

123
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,527
<i>Who lives in this room?</i>

124
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,033
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Your father is still living in this room.</i>

125
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,870
<i>So you never invite anyone in,</i>
<i>and you go through life alone.</i>

126
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,575
<i>You must open that door.</i>
<i>Put out the flames.</i>

127
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:49,704
<i>You must invite your father</i>
<i>to come visit you.</i>

128
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:54,980
<i>- But he won't even speak to me.</i>
<i>- That is your old blueprint.</i>

129
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,651
<i>That is what you want to believe...</i>

130
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:02,056
<i>because you are too afraid</i>
<i>to tear down the walls and rebuild.</i>

131
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,424
Come on.

132
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,053
Stop blaming the victim.

133
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,293
<i>All right, who here thinks I'm being unfair?</i>

134
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,601
<i>Be honest.</i>

135
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:23,345
<i>Ruth, do you agree?</i>
<i>Until Tahira forgives her father...</i>

136
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:26,613
<i>she will never feel safe in her home.</i>

137
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,181
- Well, maybe, but...
<i>- Speak up.</i>

138
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,584
<i>We all paid to hear you.</i>

139
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,654
<i>Why don't you stand?</i>

140
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:41,191
Her father did such a terrible thing.

141
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,495
I don't see why she has to have him
as a houseguest.

142
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,834
<i>If you don't agree with me,</i>
<i>why didn't you raise your hand?</i>

143
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,407
I was just trying to understand your point.

144
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,069
<i>Or do you think</i>
<i>that your opinion doesn't matter?</i>

145
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:55,874
<i>That perhaps you are just a guest here?</i>

146
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,415
<i>Are you a guest in your own house, Ruth?</i>

147
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,575
I don't think so.

148
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,315
Yes, she tiptoes around herself
like she's afraid of waking someone up.

149
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:07,013
<i>The only person sleeping</i>
<i>in your house is you.</i>

150
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:10,323
- I do have three children.
- See? She's not even listening.

151
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,920
<i>Ruth, you have to get out of bed...</i>

152
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,592
<i>open the windows,</i>
<i>and let some light into your house...</i>

153
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:19,660
<i>so that you can see the way things are.</i>

154
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,600
<i>Then, and only then...</i>

155
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,640
<i>can you begin renovating your life.</i>

156
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:31,305
<i>So, Tahira, are you ready to renovate?</i>

157
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,009
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

158
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,377
<i>So, when you call your father,</i>
<i>what will you say first?</i>

159
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,049
<i>Hello?</i>

160
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:41,249
Sorry, my beaker exploded.

161
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:44,056
That's okay. Catch your breath.

162
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,724
How's it going?

163
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:54,936
I have hydrochloric acid in my hair,
but other than that, I'm fine.

164
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,200
Really?

165
00:12:57,175 --> 00:13:00,474
No, but I'm incredibly bored
with myself right now.

166
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:06,380
Let's talk about you.
How's your girlfriend? What's her name?

167
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,544
Jenny. Fine, thanks.

168
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,615
How's it going with Gabriel?

169
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:13,987
I have no idea.
I haven't even talked to him in two weeks.

170
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,495
Is that her?

171
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,230
- What does she do?
- She's a jewelry designer.

172
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,236
Really? Does she have a store?

173
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,933
No, she has clients and she caters.

174
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,976
But we're not here to talk about Jenny.

175
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:41,184
It might help to tell me
what you're going through right now.

176
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:44,616
It's no big fucking mystery. I mean, it sucks.

177
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:51,220
It sucks to be pretty much in love
with a guy who's too fucked-up for life.

178
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,927
- What happened?
- Nothing really. Just...

179
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,464
Whatever.

180
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,135
It's not even his fault.

181
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:02,935
And it fucking pisses me off.
His whole family thing is so fucking unfair.

182
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,773
And I really just thought he needed...
I don't know.

183
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,475
- You?
- No.

184
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,543
But someone, maybe.

185
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:15,346
Some person on the planet who gives a fuck
about him, for once in his life.

186
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,081
Yeah, I did think that would matter.

187
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:20,556
It does matter.
No one can ever solve someone else's life.

188
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,755
So, basically, your job is totally pointless?

189
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,899
No one but a guidance counselor, I mean.

190
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:34,528
There they are.

191
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:37,074
That's the community?
I thought this was an event.

192
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,631
It's an event.

193
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,681
- Didn't I meet one of those guys in Vegas?
- Bobo from Peaceful Haven.

194
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,548
- Right. He spits.
- Yes, he does.

195
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,713
Stan, Jack, Bobo. This is my brother, Nate.

196
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,955
- Nice to see you, Nate.
- Nice to meet you, Jack.

197
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,660
Good seeing you, Bobo.

198
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:02,063
Congratulations.

199
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:05,569
We heard you just got your license
to operate a moving funeral.

200
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,761
Yep, finally went pro.

201
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,773
- Well, sit.
- No, go ahead.

202
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:12,639
- No, after you. Age before beauty.
- Right.

203
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,210
David tells us that you are very gifted.

204
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:17,843
He does?

205
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,114
We were just giving Stan grief...

206
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,154
for poaching our customers
with false advertising.

207
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,355
That sounds like something
Kroehner would do.

208
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:31,020
Fucking Kroehner. Those cocksuckers.

209
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,090
Sorry. Those cunts.

210
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:39,101
So this family goes off the 405.
We get five bodies, right?

211
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,365
In truth, my walk-in only holds three.

212
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,204
So my guy is working overtime
to get everyone juiced.

213
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:49,110
But sometimes you have to leave them out
for an hour or two beyond regulation.

214
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,308
It happens, right?
But those Kroehner fucks...

215
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:57,377
are just waiting for a chance to send in
their flacky at the DCA, and boom!

216
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:00,322
I get hit with a giant fine and a lawsuit.

217
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:04,354
I will ram a plastic screw up my anus...

218
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,489
before I give in to those fucks. No offense.

219
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:14,327
- Do we have a waitress?
- Yeah, she'll be back with the fries.

220
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,105
Those fucks.

221
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,734
They are fucks. They're fucking evil fucks.

222
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,870
They're sucking up all the mom-and-pops.

223
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:24,574
Businesses that people
spent their lives building up...

224
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,742
They don't care about people and lives.

225
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,048
All right, we appreciate your passion, but...

226
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,489
No, all they care about is money.
It's not just our industry. It's everywhere.

227
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:36,356
When corporations try and squeeze out
all the competitors...

228
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:40,261
the further management gets from labor,
the more alienation in the workplace...

229
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:43,300
- the more meaningless all our lives become.
- Fuck, yeah!

230
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:46,166
- It's hopeless, isn't it?
- No, I don't think it is.

231
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:49,229
We have to stick together
and save our energy to fight Kroehner.

232
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,743
- You know, Stan?
- Yes. I love this guy. Terrific!

233
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,043
I don't know, Gary. Twice in one day?

234
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,779
Claire, this is Detective Reese.

235
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,547
Why don't you sit down, Claire?

236
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,764
Any idea where Gabriel Dimas is?

237
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,601
- Why would I?
- He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

238
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,829
Yeah, so I know where he is
every second of the day?

239
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:26,240
You have noticed that he hasn't been
in school for the last two weeks?

240
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,744
Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

241
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,343
I don't.

242
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,950
Did you know that he held up
a convenience store with a gun?

243
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,049
- No.
- Did you give or sell him embalming fluid?

244
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:42,456
No. My God.

245
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:47,160
- So how do you think he got it?
- I don't know. The Internet?

246
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:50,434
- Don't they have catalogs for that stuff?
- Maybe.

247
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:54,963
Be a lot easier to get it from you,
don't you think?

248
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,106
No, because I would never
do anything like that.

249
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,572
I don't even know
where they keep that stuff.

250
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:15,156
So it's between Ethics of Evolution
and Biogenetics, I think.

251
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,727
- Biogenetics? Really?
- What?

252
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,354
Yawn, kind of, right?

253
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:26,163
Biogenetics might sound dull to you,
but it's actually very smutty.

254
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,738
It's all about sperm competition
and cryptic ovulation.

255
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,044
Oh, yeah? What else you taking?

256
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:38,242
- I'm only doing one class.
- I thought you were going back to school.

257
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,114
I said I was gonna take a class.
I still have to work, you know.

258
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:46,948
Fuck, if it's only one class,
why not pick something interesting?

259
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,384
How about this religious studies class?

260
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,587
"Cross-Cultural Perspectives
on the Afterlife."

261
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,788
Yawn.

262
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,032
- It's not boring. It's spiritual.
- Double yawn.

263
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:00,602
Why don't you sign up for that
and we can meet in the quad for lunch?

264
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,802
That would be so fun.

265
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,441
We could make out in the stacks...

266
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,009
sneak into the pool at night
and go skinny-dipping on acid.

267
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,742
Sounds like you did a lot of work at college.

268
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:15,115
I was only in school for two years,
but I learned a few things.

269
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:18,451
About breaking into school property
while tripping?

270
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,483
That'll help you in life.

271
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:28,958
What?

272
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,293
Come on, Bren.

273
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:38,066
- I was just in the middle of something.
- Look, it's been a while.

274
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:39,609
It's not that long.

275
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:43,312
It's been three-and-a-half weeks,
and on Tuesday it'll be four weeks.

276
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,440
Not that you're counting.

277
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:49,009
Yeah, I'm counting.
I mean, have you not even noticed?

278
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:53,014
It's normal, after a certain point,
for sex to slow down.

279
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,723
Yeah, slow down, okay. But stop?

280
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:58,919
People can go months after a certain point.

281
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:03,160
After a certain point, okay.
Like, six years, maybe. But six months?

282
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,902
- Seven.
- Not that you're counting.

283
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,369
You've never been with anybody
long enough to know this...

284
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,809
but there is a certain ebb and flow
that happens.

285
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,374
- Not for everybody.
- It does.

286
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,817
There will be times
when you are not attracted to me at all.

287
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,155
It's just a normal ebb.

288
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,955
How long does a normal ebb last?

289
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:33,486
I don't know, but that's the kind of question
that prolongs the standard ebb.

290
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,606
<i>Did you hear about the guy</i>
<i>at the nuthouse that walked around naked...</i>

291
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,938
<i>except for a hat and gloves?</i>

292
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,808
<i>And this nurse came up to him and said.</i>

293
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,847
<i>"What do you want?</i>
<i>You can't walk around..."</i>

294
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,973
Mom?

295
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,541
<i>And the guy says, "It's okay.</i>
<i>Nobody comes around here, anyway. "</i>

296
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,681
<i>And the nurse says, "Well, what do you</i>
<i>have on the hat and gloves for?"</i>

297
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:03,682
- It's so late. I was kind of worried.
- It goes until midnight.

298
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,952
Was it fun?

299
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,791
It was horrible.

300
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,763
- So you're not going back?
- No, I'm going back.

301
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,430
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't want to be rude.

302
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,634
They don't care about that.
They already got your money.

303
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,645
Well, there's that, too.

304
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:30,144
<i>- Don't you get bored around here?</i>
<i>- Well, sometimes.</i>

305
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,258
Do you want some tea or something?

306
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,421
All right, what did you break?

307
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:43,322
Nothing. I was just being nice. God!

308
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,533
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,865
I was imposing my old blueprint on you.

310
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,144
Excuse me?

311
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,977
In the old blueprint of my old house...

312
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:03,085
you're only nice to me
when you've done something bad...

313
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,281
or when you want something.

314
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:09,991
- That makes me feel like shit.
- I'm sorry.

315
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:13,591
But it really does seem that way to me.

316
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,998
I should go do my homework.

317
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,742
They give you homework?

318
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,342
I have to write a letter to my dead mother...

319
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,849
and forgive her
for all the terrible things she did to me.

320
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,545
That sounds fun.

321
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,315
And then I have to write
a private letter to myself...

322
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,187
outlining how I want to renovate my life.

323
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,321
Good night, dear.

324
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:46,828
Good night.

325
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,696
<i>The shovel's in the truck!</i>

326
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,154
- That's good.
- Rico, you forget something there?

327
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,025
Shit.

328
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:28,427
Sorry, man.
I got about two hours of sleep last night.

329
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:31,470
- Augusto?
- No, Angie, Vanessa's sister.

330
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:33,299
She walks out on her boyfriend...

331
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,210
and comes over to wail
in our living room all night long.

332
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,544
- Women.
- Yeah, I'm telling you, man.

333
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:42,916
And she shows up with this suitcase,
like she's got some right now that...

334
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:47,415
She has fancy Hollywood friends
who flash their money around all the time.

335
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:50,892
I'm like, "What, you can't go
somewhere there's a guest room?"

336
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:55,293
Rico, I'm really sorry about that loan.

337
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,366
It's just a really tight budget.

338
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:03,100
That's okay. We got the house.
Something else came through.

339
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:06,334
- That's great.
- Yep, the escrow closes next month.

340
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,475
That is super, man.

341
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:14,006
You and Vanessa
have been together, what...

342
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,013
five years now?

343
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:19,453
Married five, together eight.
Man, can you believe that shit?

344
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:25,928
Okay, so this is sort of a personal question.
You don't have to answer...

345
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,964
but do you guys still, you know...

346
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:35,268
pretty much have sex?

347
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:42,072
We've got two kids now,
so it slows down a bit.

348
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,539
Right.

349
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,880
How slow?

350
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:52,620
Right after the baby, Vanessa's got
all the wrong hormones and stuff.

351
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:57,755
So now, maybe three or four times a week.

352
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,665
- That's too bad, man.
- Yeah, that sucks.

353
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:10,899
It's not like the first two years.

354
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:15,036
- Yeah, you better enjoy it while you got it.
- No kidding, right?

355
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,277
This moron always goes over.

356
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,618
I should go in and correct his selfish ass.

357
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:27,179
Let them finish their game.
We go over sometimes.

358
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:43,162
- So how's Eddie?
- He's good. Things are good, I guess.

359
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:52,348
Keith, what's going on?

360
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:56,643
I think my sister's
fucking using that shit again.

361
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:03,950
My mom's come up from San Diego to watch
over her, like that's gonna fix anything.

362
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,790
According to her,
everything is just fine now.

363
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:09,230
I'm the one that's overreacting.

364
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,334
I don't think you're overreacting.

365
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,466
Thanks.

366
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:26,678
- Eddie hates racquetball.
- Really? Why?

367
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:29,184
Poor depth perception.

368
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,845
Can't play pool, either.

369
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:36,391
That's too bad.

370
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:47,701
Let's not beat around the bush, shall we?

371
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:52,433
Biology has a long history of being abused
as an ideological instrument...

372
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,007
to justify social inequities
and amoral behavior.

373
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,445
For those of you
who have not yet read my book...

374
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:00,244
the central argument I posit...

375
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:03,684
in <i>Genes Out of the Bottle.</i>
<i>Evolution in Biotechnology...</i>

376
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:07,155
is that genetic engineering is,
in and of itself...

377
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:11,854
the most effective argument
against biological determinism. Why?

378
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:15,363
The thesis that you present so brilliantly...

379
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:18,196
is that though biology manifests
in behavior...

380
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:22,728
as we can see in the instinct of human
males to seek a variety of sexual partners...

381
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:26,264
the fact that we have
the technology to modify genetics...

382
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:29,278
confirms the supremacy of culture
over biology.

383
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,405
Excellent. Other thoughts?

384
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,615
I have a question.

385
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:38,587
Isn't natural selection still operating
though, since members of the species...

386
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:43,025
who have access to genetic technologies
are more likely to survive and procreate?

387
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:48,259
That kind of reasoning leads us
into a very questionable ethical terrain.

388
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:51,460
- Other comments?
- What kind of reasoning? Scientific?

389
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:55,369
You can call it scientific, but
as I discussed at great length in Chapter 2...

390
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:59,341
your argument is a political assertion
that privilege is biologically determined.

391
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,037
I haven't actually read your book...

392
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:04,103
but you can't tell me
that survival isn't easier for people...

393
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:07,275
who are born with a private chef
and health insurance.

394
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:11,048
Maybe you should read the book
before commenting on its thesis.

395
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:13,947
Other comments?

396
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,417
- Yes?
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

397
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:21,255
Are we not allowed to disagree with you?
I'm just asking because I'm new in the class.

398
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:24,664
We certainly don't interrupt our classmates.
Go ahead.

399
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,729
In your discussion of bisexual
genital rubbing among pygmy chimps...

400
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:33,072
you note the exchange of sex for meat.

401
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,613
I was wondering how this might pertain
to contemporary human behavior.

402
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,943
Any theories?

403
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,222
So, where do you think he is now?

404
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:53,391
According to his wife, he's still here.

405
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:58,457
There's a big chunk of dead meat
in a cheapo box that's still here.

406
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:02,663
But do you really believe that's him?
The essence of who he was?

407
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,439
The part of him that hoped and dreamed,
and all that other crap?

408
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,775
You tell me. You're the one
who has all the answers now.

409
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,145
I never said that.

410
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:16,380
You'd think getting hammered by a bus
would make you a little less of a dick.

411
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:20,720
Sure, it's possible that we go on
after we die.

412
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:26,860
It's also possible that,
once the light goes out, it stays out.

413
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,060
You'll never know, buddy boy,
till it's your turn.

414
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,295
See, that's what you were hanging onto.

415
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,136
Excuse me?

416
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:37,668
- Michael.
- Is he here?

417
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,167
He's been with me the whole time.

418
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:44,742
- You think he'll stay with you?
- Not like this.

419
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,610
He's just helping me get used to it.

420
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:55,588
I hope you don't mind, but do you
get a sense of my father at all around here?

421
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,408
No. I'm sorry.

422
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,779
That doesn't mean he's not here.
This room is packed.

423
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,814
I can't get to everyone.

424
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,143
I think everything is ready.

425
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:26,285
- I do see a child coming into your life.
- No.

426
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,018
- Well, it might be you.
- I seriously doubt that.

427
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,163
I'm not sure which one of you I'm reading...

428
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,132
but I'm quite sure
there's gonna be a child here very soon.

429
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,960
I'm heading out now, okay?

430
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,372
This is Federico Diaz, our embalmer,
and his baby, Augusto.

431
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:46,875
This is Mrs. Piper.

432
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,009
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

433
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:55,009
- You made his body look very nice.
- Thank you.

434
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,953
Actually, his body gave me
a lot to work with.

435
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,046
Hardly any decay for a cancer death...

436
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:04,423
- Okay, Rico, see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

437
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,765
Here we go.

438
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:21,905
Eileen asked that I close with a reading
from Michael's favorite poet, Walt Whitman.

439
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:28,080
"What do you think
has become of the young and old men?

440
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:31,517
"And what do you think
has become of the women and children?

441
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:34,452
"They are alive and well somewhere

442
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,092
"The smallest sprout shows
there is really no death

443
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:41,130
"And if ever there was, it led forward life

444
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,723
"and does not wait at the end to arrest it

445
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,268
"And ceas'd the moment life appear'd

446
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,500
"All goes onward and outward
nothing collapses

447
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:54,237
"And to die is different
from what any one supposed

448
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,511
"and luckier"

449
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:00,515
Let us pray.

450
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,218
O Lord, bless the departed soul
of our brother, friend, and son, Michael...

451
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,224
I'm just hanging around
to help you get used to it.

452
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:13,656
I am used to it, Dad. It's been six months.

453
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,398
Seven. Not that you're counting.

454
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:21,936
God is strength. In him, I will trust.

455
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,768
Amen.

456
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:39,947
- Are you done?
- Pretty much. What's up?

457
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,890
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Okay.

458
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,724
Get this. Bobo sold to Kroehner.

459
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:49,197
- Bobo sold? My Bobo?
- Your Bobo.

460
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:53,031
I can't believe this. He was so committed.

461
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,798
Think he's got a plastic screw
in his anus about now?

462
00:32:56,873 --> 00:33:00,104
- I hope so.
- That old son of a bitch. I'm gonna call him.

463
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,415
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

464
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,251
- Where's Karla?
- She's just working late.

465
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:17,760
- Why are you fronting?
- Go to your room now, Taylor.

466
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:20,620
Mama hasn't been home since Tuesday.

467
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:22,794
- What?
- Now.

468
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:26,566
- But my stomach hurts.
- I'll get you some Pepto-Bismol.

469
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:30,732
- I don't want none of that nasty shit.
- Then go on.

470
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:34,439
Shit, bitch, I gotta get my goods.

471
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:36,841
Don't talk to your grandmother like that.

472
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,316
Is she sick?

473
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:45,480
She says that every night.
She just wants the attention.

474
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:48,547
Can you blame her? Her mother's off,
doing God knows whatever.

475
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,788
Karla's fine. She just had to go out of town.

476
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,490
- You talked to her?
- I wasn't in when she called.

477
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:57,692
But she left several messages.
Besides, I'm here with Taylor.

478
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,999
Don't blow this out of proportion
like you always do.

479
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:04,133
<i>Hey, Mama, I'm not coming home tonight.</i>

480
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,141
<i>Derek needs some papers, and I gotta go...</i>

481
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:09,643
- Can't she send him his papers?
- You remember how Derek was.

482
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:12,079
Always getting her
to do this and that for him.

483
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,550
Yeah, like raise his kid
without a dime from him.

484
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,780
<i>Sorry, I dropped the phone. Shut up!</i>

485
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,346
<i>Anyway, I'll call you as soon as I can, okay?</i>

486
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:23,318
<i>Give Taylor kisses for me.</i>

487
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:27,159
To get the phone company records,
we'll have to file a missing persons report.

488
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,666
Keith, why must you always
think the worst of her?

489
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,032
Let's just wait till she gets home.

490
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,071
- We don't even know...
- What are you gonna do?

491
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:37,333
Move up here
and take care of her all your life?

492
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:39,398
She has a child! Jesus, she needs help.

493
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:44,004
- You covering up for her is not what I mean.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

494
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,639
I am your mother...

495
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:49,776
and you will respect that
or I will smack the black right off of you.

496
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,463
Hi, there.

497
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:07,692
Hi.

498
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:10,669
Hard day?

499
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:15,070
How can you tell?

500
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,742
I'm good at people.

501
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,213
- Are you?
- Gotta be. Tax law.

502
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:29,654
I'm Scott. Scott Axelrod.

503
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,951
Candace Bouvard.

504
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:35,289
Nice to meet you, Candace.
Are you an actress?

505
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,360
No.

506
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:46,306
- I teach sign language to the newly deaf.
- Really?

507
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:55,947
- How noble.
- No, it's very lucrative.

508
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,419
And I really enjoy
communicating with my body.

509
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,925
I get that.

510
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:15,465
You know what? My friend is here,
but it's been great getting to know you.

511
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,202
I would love to take you to dinner sometime.
Can I give you my card?

512
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:20,766
You sure can.

513
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,141
How was school?

514
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:37,617
<i>All right, you have 20 minutes to do</i>
<i>what's most important in your life now.</i>

515
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:40,690
<i>What did you write to yourself</i>
<i>in your private letter?</i>

516
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,925
<i>Where are you locked out of your own life?</i>

517
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,968
<i>If you learn today</i>
<i>that your relationship with your mother...</i>

518
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:49,437
<i>has been blocking the door</i>
<i>to your happiness, then make that repair.</i>

519
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:53,602
<i>Right now. Waiting only gives you</i>
<i>more chances to make excuses.</i>

520
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:57,979
<i>There are phones in the hall.</i>
<i>See you in 19 minutes.</i>

521
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,949
Where can I find a Snickers bar?

522
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:06,111
Can't you think of more productive ways
to use this time?

523
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,316
Like what? Taking up smoking?

524
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,292
Why not try rebuilding
with someone right now?

525
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,494
I read your private letter to yourself.
If you really want closeness in your life...

526
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,866
you're gonna have to start
major renovations.

527
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,667
- In fact, I would gut.
- You read my private letter?

528
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:28,210
- Why don't you try calling your kids?
- I don't even know where my kids are.

529
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:31,212
The last thing they want
is for me to call on a Friday night...

530
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,044
so I can put in new flooring.

531
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:36,643
I've wanted to hear that my whole life, Dad.
Oh, fuck!

532
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,848
I love you, too, you sadistic old fuck.

533
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,983
Start with Claire.

534
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:48,790
Only you can be the architect of your life.

535
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,330
I was 12 years old.

536
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,382
This is your mother.

537
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:15,116
Yes, well, I just wanted to tell you that...

538
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,751
I feel like even though
I've been trying to be closer to you...

539
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:21,888
it hasn't really been working.

540
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,864
I wish you felt you could confide in me...

541
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:29,869
and maybe you don't
because you feel my opinion is worthless.

542
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:34,072
Because I don't really live in my house...

543
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:39,074
and so I suppose
that's the infrastructure I built.

544
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:42,514
And so I'm sorry.

545
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:45,912
- And?
- And I love you.

546
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:50,015
That's so good. I gotta pee like a racehorse.

547
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:53,689
<i>You have exceeded the time limit.</i>

548
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:57,392
<i>If you know the name of the movie</i>
<i>you'd like to see, press 1 now.</i>

549
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:17,913
Hello?

550
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:21,083
<i>- Claire?</i>
- Where the fuck have you been?

551
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,586
<i>- I'm fucked up.</i>
- Gabe, what is going on?

552
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,258
<i>Everything is all fucked up, Claire!</i>

553
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:31,926
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You just have to calm down right now.

554
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:35,596
<i>Look, I need you to come and get me.</i>

555
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:37,199
<i>Please.</i>

556
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,402
You know the cops
are seriously looking for you?

557
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:47,681
<i>I know that, okay? Why do you think</i>
<i>I need you to come out here and get me?</i>

558
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,309
Where are you?

559
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,318
<i>I'm up past Woodland Hills.</i>

560
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,180
Academia is one huge circle jerk.

561
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,026
All the sequestered people
desperately defending...

562
00:39:58,094 --> 00:40:01,063
the one good idea
they have ever had in their lives.

563
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,428
So, what, that's it for going back to school?

564
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,297
Yep. Next?

565
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,009
- How was your day?
- It was weird.

566
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:18,980
Buried that psychic woman's husband,
and she was still talking to the guy.

567
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,982
- That's sad.
- Not for her.

568
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:25,487
I mean, she really believed he was there,
you know?

569
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:29,616
Well, she has to say that, right?
If she claims she's a psychic.

570
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,751
You don't think that that's possible?

571
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,956
What about you saying
that things happen that leave marks...

572
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:38,364
- in people, in places, in time?
- That's physics.

573
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,929
Energy affecting matter.

574
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:43,734
Talking to dead people is delusional.

575
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:47,470
So you definitely don't believe
in any kind of a life after death?

576
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:51,678
I think people live on
through the people they love...

577
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:54,678
and the things they do with their lives.

578
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:57,951
If they manage to do things with their lives.

579
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,190
But that's it? That's all there is?

580
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:04,124
There's nothing more?
There's nothing bigger?

581
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,386
Just energy.

582
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,898
- But there's no plan?
- No, there's definitely no plan.

583
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,767
Just survival.

584
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:21,476
- Should I have ordered the salmon?
- I don't know.

585
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:27,981
How can you live like that? What if you
found out you were gonna die tomorrow?

586
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:31,487
I've been prepared to die tomorrow
since I was 6 years old.

587
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,049
Really?

588
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:38,952
- Pretty much. We never got butter.
- Why since you were six?

589
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:43,458
Because I read a report on the effect
nuclear war would have on the world...

590
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:47,970
and it was pretty clear to me at that point
that this was definitely gonna happen.

591
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:49,803
When you were six?

592
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:54,066
And I wake up every day
pretty much surprised...

593
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:57,680
that everything is still here.

594
00:41:57,747 --> 00:42:00,443
I don't understand
how you can live like that.

595
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,809
Well, I thought we all did.

596
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:21,461
- Who was that?
- I went to high school with him.

597
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,198
He's clearly had a nose job.

598
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,136
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

599
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,740
<i>Go on.</i>

600
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:36,111
<i>And imagine that everyone in this room</i>
<i>thinks you're an idiot.</i>

601
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:38,847
<i>Total fool. Complete moron. Absolute ass.</i>

602
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:42,556
<i>Feel familiar?</i>

603
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,956
<i>It's how you feel in the world, isn't it?</i>

604
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:48,127
<i>I want you to feel it deeply now.</i>

605
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:52,065
<i>Really feel that everyone in this room</i>
<i>thinks you're an idiot.</i>

606
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,935
<i>Close your eyes, Ruth. Feel you're an idiot.</i>

607
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:10,309
<i>Now tell me when you get the joke.</i>

608
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:26,095
<i>- Do you get the joke, Ruth?</i>
- No. I'm an idiot.

609
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:29,627
<i>Who wants to explain the joke to Ruth?</i>

610
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,471
<i>So we all feel the same way, right?</i>

611
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:39,815
<i>So who's really the asshole?</i>

612
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:43,550
- We all are?
<i>- Ruth, stand up.</i>

613
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:49,985
<i>Tell me what you wrote</i>
<i>in your private letter to yourself.</i>

614
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,890
It was a private letter. To myself.

615
00:43:52,962 --> 00:43:56,056
<i>Tell me where your house needs repairs.</i>

616
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:58,896
Yeah, and don't bullshit the lady, cupcake.

617
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,095
I have a very nice house.

618
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:07,001
I have nice children, and a nice job,
and a nice gentleman friend.

619
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:11,136
Can't anyone just be happy? I'm happy.

620
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:13,175
<i>Who's buying Ruth's house?</i>

621
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:18,548
<i>We don't believe your house</i>
<i>is structurally sound, Ruth.</i>

622
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:21,351
Who knows better:
Me or a room full of complainers?

623
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:24,085
<i>What do you really</i>
<i>want to complain about, really?</i>

624
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,358
The fact that the blood stopped circulating
to my rear end four hours ago.

625
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:29,996
<i>Okay, what else?</i>

626
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,224
You want me to complain?

627
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:34,928
All right, then. Fuck this.

628
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:38,799
Fuck you. Fuck all of you,
with your sniveling self-pity.

629
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,207
And fuck all your lousy parents.

630
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:44,207
Fuck my lousy parents, while we're at it.

631
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,545
Fuck my selfish bohemian sister
and her fucking bliss.

632
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:50,450
Fuck my legless grandmother.
Fuck my dead husband...

633
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,421
and my lousy children
with their nasty little secrets!

634
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:56,617
And fuck you, Robbie,
for dragging me to this terrible place...

635
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,627
and not letting me have a Snickers bar!

636
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,890
I'm going to get something to eat!

637
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:03,926
<i>Congratulations, Ruth.</i>

638
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,265
<i>You have just leveled your fleabag hovel.</i>

639
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:11,004
Now you can build the house
of your dreams from the ground up.

640
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:13,267
Yes! Fucking yes!

641
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:15,537
Excellent.

642
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,671
Congratulations.

643
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:46,200
Jesus.

644
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:48,768
Okay, let's hop.

645
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:53,914
- Hi?
- We should just get going.

646
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:56,076
Okay.

647
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:58,683
But you could tell me
where the fuck you've been...

648
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,450
Yeah, like you care.

649
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,352
What?

650
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,225
Why did I just drive my ass
way the fuck out to nowhere?

651
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:11,062
Can we just talk about this
while we're driving, okay?

652
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:15,527
Jesus, it's hot as hell in this car.

653
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,081
Can you tell me where we're going?

654
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:37,254
Let's just head out to Angela's Crest
or something.

655
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:40,227
Angela's Crest? That's where serial killers
go to dump bodies.

656
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:42,787
You think you can think up
someplace a little creepier?

657
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:44,298
I don't care where we go.

658
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,530
I just want to go somewhere
where we can be alone for a minute...

659
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:50,265
and we can just talk, you know? Whatever.

660
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:56,271
- Are you fucked-up right now?
- What the fuck do you expect, Claire?

661
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:59,875
I'm freaked out. Everything's really
fucked-up for me right now.

662
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:02,008
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

663
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,382
- I'm trying to it figure out.
- What's to figure out?

664
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:06,978
Claire, just chill out, okay? Jesus.

665
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:13,094
Look, they know you gave Andy the fry,
or whatever the fuck it's called.

666
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:15,494
They know you robbed that store, Gabe.

667
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:18,297
You have to turn yourself in.

668
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,568
That is a genius fucking plan.

669
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,466
Hey, baby, you like to drink blood?

670
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:31,104
- That's incredibly original.
- Shut the fuck up, scumbag!

671
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,648
Look, you got a corpse in the front seat.

672
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:36,774
- I said, shut the fuck up!
- Oh, God!

673
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:40,315
Go.

674
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:45,216
Is he all right?

675
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,393
It's okay.

676
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:51,026
Just keep driving.

677
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:00,236
What are you doing?

678
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:03,945
- We have to go back.
- Are you insane?

679
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:06,277
We have to go back
and make sure that guy is okay.

680
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:09,216
- I didn't hit him, all right?
- How do you know? Are you sure?

681
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:11,150
I saw. He's fine, all right?

682
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,018
Then let's just go back
and make sure that he is all right.

683
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,058
I cannot go back there!

684
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,761
- God, I am fucked!
- You know this is just making it worse.

685
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:25,591
Listen to me. I need you
to just help me right now, okay? Please.

686
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,666
I can't help you!

687
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:32,303
I can't help you anymore! I can't.

688
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,739
Let's just keep going, okay?

689
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,075
Let's just keep going,
I'll figure out what to do.

690
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:39,842
I will figure it out.

691
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,383
Come on, please.

692
00:48:42,818 --> 00:48:44,342
I'm going back.

693
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,615
- Claire, don't do that.
- Get off me.

694
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:51,689
Claire, give me that.

695
00:48:52,628 --> 00:48:54,562
Okay, you have to get out now.

696
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,623
- Don't do this to me.
- Get out!

697
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,403
- Get out.
- Okay.

698
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:09,201
I'm just gonna get my bag, all right?

699
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,177
Thanks.

700
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:27,657
Oh, my God.

701
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:14,368
So, where do you think I am?

702
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:17,636
Heaven or Hell?

703
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:20,680
Apparently, you're here at the moment.

704
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:23,179
You think I'm in Hell.

705
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,784
Yeah, sure, I went to church.
That was just for business.

706
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:28,653
I didn't really believe in God.

707
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:32,751
I mean, not as anyone who you had
to please or impress to get promoted.

708
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:39,125
The only God I know
is a mean-spirited comedian in ugly pants...

709
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,802
whose every joke
has the same damn punch line.

710
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:46,535
And I'm thinking, that kind of attitude
lands me straight in Hell.

711
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:52,609
On the bright side, that means...

712
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:57,251
you'll have a familiar face waiting for you.

713
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,045
Look it up.

714
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:04,592
Leviticus 20:13.

715
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:07,654
I don't believe that anymore.

716
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,539
And I don't think you're in Hell.

717
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:28,242
But you can't quite see me hanging around
with Gandhi and Mother Teresa up there.

718
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:33,146
I miss you, Dad.

719
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:41,796
I thought you were at Brenda's.

720
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:45,862
She had a late client,
so I thought I'd, you know...

721
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:48,367
- help clean up.
- Thanks.

722
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:52,463
At this hour? That is a late client.

723
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,635
Some of them like her
to put them to bed, you know?

724
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,070
That's very sad.

725
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:01,982
- How long did you go out with that cop?
- About six months.

726
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:08,621
- Sex ever slow down?
- I was hoping you weren't gonna go there.

727
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:11,020
I'm sorry. Forget it.

728
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:16,990
- David, I need some help.
- What happened?

729
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:24,266
"Fuck my legless grandmother.

730
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,400
"And fuck you, Robbie,
for not letting me have the Snickers bar."

731
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,706
Oh, my goodness, the language.

732
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,111
I was so rude.

733
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:39,520
It was fantastic. <i>Quel</i> breakthrough.

734
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:43,181
Robbie, I don't even know how to thank you.

735
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,783
Don't thank me.

736
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:47,495
Just change.

737
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:53,326
So, what are you gonna do tomorrow
to start the renovations?

738
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:55,893
That's none of your fucking business.

739
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,026
Any idea where he'd go?

740
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:26,229
What was he wearing?

741
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,364
You know,
it's gonna be much easier on him...

742
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:36,468
if we can bring him in
before something else happens.

743
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:40,413
- But he doesn't even have the gun.
- You think he can't get another gun?

744
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:50,453
He was wearing jeans
and a green T-shirt, I think.

745
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:54,992
You're doing the right thing.
You know that, right?

746
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,327
- I feel like shit.
- You'll feel worse if someone else gets hurt.

747
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:05,771
Oh, my God.

748
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:11,009
When that cop asked me if I knew about
the <i>7</i>- Eleven thing, I said I didn't. But I did.

749
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:13,913
- Is that really bad?
- It's not great.

750
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:17,448
But you're telling the truth now, right?
So don't worry about that.

751
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,716
They wouldn't make me testify against him
or something, right?

752
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,316
That's not up to me.
But, anyway, that's a long ways off.

753
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:27,924
Okay, 'cause I don't wanna
do anything like that.

754
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:31,829
- Why are you still protecting this loser?
- Because she loves him.

755
00:54:35,604 --> 00:54:37,902
And we understand that, Claire.

756
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:41,902
I really wish
you'd told us about this sooner.

757
00:54:41,977 --> 00:54:44,241
How long did you know
about the embalming fluid?

758
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,907
Not that long. And I tried to tell Nate.

759
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:49,177
When the fuck
did you try and tell me about this?

760
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,549
She's telling you now, all right?

761
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:53,779
Okay, I'm sorry.

762
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,191
I'm sorry.

763
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:04,827
When you're ready, we're gonna get in
the car and drive down to the station.

764
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:10,267
A couple of detectives there are gonna
ask you pretty much the same questions.

765
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,075
- Will you be there?
- Yes, I'll be there.
