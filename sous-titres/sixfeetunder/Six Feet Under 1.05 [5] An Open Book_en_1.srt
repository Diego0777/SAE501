1
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:54,566
So I want you to meet this guy
I'm going out with tonight. Okay?

2
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,328
He's kind of a dork,
but in a sweet way.

3
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:03,094
He seems real, at least.

4
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:06,205
And he's kind of rich, I think.
Kind of.

5
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:11,726
Of course, so was Kadeem, and that was
a fucking waste of two years of my life.

6
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:19,844
And you know what?
I knew you never liked Kadeem.

7
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:23,086
So I'm gonna bring this guy
home to meet you.

8
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,883
And this time...

9
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:29,881
...I swear I will pay attention
to what you think.

10
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:34,007
Because I am
one fucking hot-shit bitch...

11
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,327
...and he'd be fucking lucky to have me.

12
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh, does that feel good.

13
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,642
Hey, Tito!

14
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,724
Come hang with me. Okay?

15
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,284
Thank you.

16
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:20,034
Who's my lover?
Yes.

17
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,556
Yes. Aren't you glad I rescued you?

18
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:31,918
You better be fucking glad.
Cost me 800 bucks in vet bills...

19
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:37,397
...at a time when things were particularly
tight for Mommy, I might add.

20
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,073
One good thing about this guy tonight...

21
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:45,117
...is, he's got a big, fat dick,
and he fucks like a jackhammer.

22
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:51,550
Those never last.

23
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:05,868
David, I'm so glad to see you here.

24
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,110
It's always nice when someone
comes back.

25
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:12,346
Oh, I've been going to church.
I was just going to a different church.

26
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:14,828
- Really, which one?
- St. Stephen's.

27
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:19,703
- In the Palisades?
- No, St. Stephen's in West Hollywood.

28
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,549
Well, I hope you always feel
as welcome here as you did there.

29
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:27,868
- Thanks.
- Your father was a deacon here...

30
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:29,823
...and we still haven't replaced him.

31
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,262
I think it would be good for this church
to listen to a younger voice.

32
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,905
If you're at all interested,
I could submit your name.

33
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,500
Me? A deacon?

34
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,749
David, that's wonderful.
Your father would be so proud.

35
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,267
Well, sure, I'd be honored
to be considered.

36
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,382
- Ruth, how are you holding up?
- I'm doing okay, Father.

37
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,986
- Each day is just a little bit easier.
- That's what I love hearing.

38
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,225
Wow, what a small world!
Do you go to this church?

39
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:02,899
I just joined. I was raised Catholic,
so I like the whole ritual part of it.

40
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,144
You smell good. What is that?

41
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:06,827
Who are you?

42
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:10,144
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I never introduced myself.

43
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:14,386
It seems like we've known each other
forever. I'm Tracy Montrose Blair.

44
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,976
- Hi, I'm David...
- Fisher, I know. I know who you are.

45
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:19,175
Okay. Why?

46
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,782
Because my Uncle Walt
was buried at your funeral home.

47
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:26,013
Old guy? Cancer?

48
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,540
Had a tattoo of a roulette wheel
on his back?

49
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:29,894
Oh, yes.

50
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,861
I have a tattoo.
A butterfly.

51
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:37,416
I think that you should know
that I'm not really available.

52
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,098
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

53
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,537
- Serious?
- We're engaged.

54
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:47,179
Well, good for you.

55
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,381
Most men your age are so
commitment-phobic, it's pathetic.

56
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,740
- Yes, men are pigs.
- Or they're gay.

57
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,661
Well, I'm certainly glad
to find out you're not gay.

58
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,535
I have to go. My mother's waiting.

59
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:02,695
Bye-bye!

60
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:06,890
- She seems nice.
- She seems nuts.

61
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,978
Hello?

62
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,051
Out here!

63
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:25,574
Hey.

64
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,413
- This is the life, huh?
- Apparently.

65
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,695
So how often do Mommy and Daddy
go away?

66
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,890
Oh, constantly.
They're very important people...

67
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,447
...with very important places to go.

68
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:40,128
Lucky for them, I have
absolutely nowhere to go.

69
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,250
- How are you?
- I'm good.

70
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:45,250
- It's chilly today. Aren't you cold?
- Nope.

71
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,249
Jesus, it's like a hot tub in here.

72
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:53,489
Mommy and Daddy keep it
this hot all the time, even in summer.

73
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,846
They're very wasteful.

74
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,648
That's just wrong.

75
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:09,643
Oh, man, you are...

76
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:11,891
What?

77
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,245
You're unlike any woman
I've ever met.

78
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,331
Good.

79
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,843
- You scare me a little.
- Why?

80
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,210
I don't know.

81
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,607
It's just...

82
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,889
...so much I don't know about you.

83
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,529
Me?

84
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,440
I am an open book.

85
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,199
I'm so glad you're bringing
your friends home.

86
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,604
You know, you haven't
done that in years.

87
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,083
You said you'd be gone
through the weekend.

88
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:10,641
Yes, it's Sunday.
It's the end of the weekend.

89
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:15,363
Nate, these are my parents,
Margaret and Bernard Chenowith.

90
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:21,563
Margaret and Bernard, this is Nate Fisher,
the man I am having sex with.

91
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,239
Hello.

92
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,236
Brenda has told us absolutely nothing
about you.

93
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:31,882
You know what? I'm not surprised.
I'm not sure there's that much to tell.

94
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,882
Oh, don't be so modest.

95
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,883
Nate's studying for
his funeral director's license.

96
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,645
Well, Nate, you'll have to tell us
all about that.

97
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,199
- Will you stay for lunch?
- At least a drink or two?

98
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:45,914
I'd like to, but...

99
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:49,124
...I really have to study.

100
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:54,438
Well, then you'll have to join us
for dinner sometime.

101
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,913
That sounds great.

102
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,153
Great!

103
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,437
Okay, Mrs. Fisher.

104
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:14,989
I asked you here today so we could
talk about your relationship with Claire.

105
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,433
- I told her it wasn't my idea.
- No.

106
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,029
Claire feels that,
being the youngest child...

107
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,115
...perhaps she might have missed out
on a time when the family was happier.

108
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,992
No, you said that.

109
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,032
I don't think there was a time
this family was ever happy.

110
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,878
That is not true.
There was lots of happiness:

111
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:38,111
When the boys were young,
when you were young, Claire.

112
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:41,037
You were a very happy little girl,
and you know it.

113
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:44,196
That's because I was too young
to realize what freaks we were.

114
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,037
Why would you tell this man
we were never happy?

115
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,707
Because I grew up in a house that was
usually filled with total strangers...

116
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,636
...who were crying all the time?
- Oh, boo-hoo.

117
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,755
I grew up in a two-room apartment
over a barbershop...

118
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,595
...and I spent my teenage years
taking care of my grandmother...

119
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:02,105
...after her legs were amputated.
Life's hard!

120
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:05,428
You had a roof over your head.
You didn't go hungry.

121
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:08,667
She gets up on this cross,
and then there's just no talking to her.

122
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,912
You did not have to go begging
for food on the streets of Calcutta.

123
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:15,584
Because I wasn't dropped in a dumpster,
I shouldn't want things to be better?

124
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,548
This is good. This is good
for you two to talk like this.

125
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:23,713
These are obviously things
you need to say.

126
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,791
So we're just supposed to fight
and get on each other's nerves?

127
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,426
I prefer the not-talking thing.

128
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:32,143
I think you should try to
have more of a dialogue.

129
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:37,107
Make time for it. Schedule it.
Remember, any relationship is work.

130
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,751
Okay, excellent session.

131
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,190
- That's it?
- That's up to you, isn't it?

132
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:52,229
He does this for like
five different schools.

133
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,626
She should look spectacular.
That's the most important thing.

134
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,300
We'll make sure that she looks her best.

135
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:09,025
She was the real deal, you know?
She was a star.

136
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,300
And I can assure you
we will give her a funeral...

137
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:15,386
...that befits the star that she was
and always will be.

138
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:18,938
- You know who she was?
- Absolutely.

139
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:22,184
And I'm a big fan of hers.

140
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,023
Hey, Rico.

141
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,865
- Holy moly.
- Feel them.

142
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,421
- They're really hard.
- No, thanks.

143
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,545
Like a rock.
See how they're all cockeyed?

144
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:43,219
They got this low-cut thing they want
her in, and they said absolutely no bra.

145
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,939
Shit, I don't know what
the heck I'm gonna do.

146
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,500
Maybe I could, like,
tape them together somehow.

147
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,662
You know where this goes? I put it
in the wrong place, David will bitch.

148
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:54,253
Top left, above the purple stuff.

149
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,899
Well, boys, this just might be our
highest profit margin funeral this year.

150
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,663
- She's rich, huh?
- The guy who's paying for it is.

151
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:06,618
- She looks so familiar to me.
- She's an actress. Viveca St. John.

152
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,894
Oh, my God, you're right.
That's her!

153
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:14,221
- Apparently, she was quite talented.
- She was a porno star.

154
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:17,458
- What?
- She was huge in the mid to late '80s.

155
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,094
You never saw any of her videos?

156
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,219
- No, Nate, I missed those.
- This chick fucked a snake.

157
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:26,050
- This chick fucked 30 guys at one time.
- I saw that. I saw that!

158
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,251
My cousin Ramone showed me
when I was like 12.

159
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,537
On the diving board. Okay?
They were wrapped around the pool.

160
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,971
Did you see the one where the guy's
riding this motorcycle, so he's...

161
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,613
...fucking her while riding in circles?
- Oh, shit!

162
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,491
Nate.

163
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,008
Could I speak to you
outside for a minute?

164
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,570
Damn it, Nate! The woman on that table
is just as deserving of dignity...

165
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,409
...as anyone else we prepare.

166
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,689
And Federico is an employee.

167
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,889
It's up to you and me to set
an example for him, all right?

168
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:04,691
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Show some respect.

169
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,966
These are human lives
we're dealing with here.

170
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,815
These are not organic blackberries
or granola in bulk.

171
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,655
- I said, I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

172
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,415
I want you to remember
that what we do here is serious...

173
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,766
...because it really sucks for me
always having to be the spoilsport.

174
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,533
Okay.

175
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,850
Thank you.

176
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,692
- Hello?
- Nate, Bernard Chenowith,

177
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:33,848
Hi.

178
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:37,688
Margaret and I were wondering if you
would join us for dinner tomorrow night.

179
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,202
- We won't take no for an answer.
- You hear that?

180
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,362
Well, actually I have a lot of
studying to do for this exam...

181
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,925
Nate...

182
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:49,169
...we'd really love to be able
to get a sense of who you are...

183
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:52,124
...and I'm sure you're curious
about us as well, right?

184
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:55,403
Good. Shall we say 7-ish?

185
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,448
Can I bring anything?

186
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:00,443
Hello?

187
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,166
Suck on that, you ugly fuck!

188
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,157
Hi.

189
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:25,600
There's this thing called knocking. It's,
like, protected in the First Amendment.

190
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,923
I rented some videos.

191
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,846
I thought you and I could
watch them tonight.

192
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,364
Remember when you
were in middle school...

193
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,160
...you and I went to the movies
every Monday night?

194
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,118
Remember how much fun we had?

195
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:42,398
I remember seeing a lot
of really bad movies.

196
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,315
What'd you get?

197
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:53,760
Runaway Bride
and The Nutty Professor.

198
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:57,722
Cool.

199
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:04,160
Oz didn 't make you a bitch,

200
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,831
You were born one,

201
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:16,591
lt'd be good for business too.
Dad was a deacon there.

202
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:19,760
It's a big congregation. People die.

203
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:23,238
Their families don't know where to go,
and the church sends them our way.

204
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,557
They know you're gay?

205
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:29,595
I think Father Jack
has a pretty good idea.

206
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:33,156
- You think he likes you?
- Keith.

207
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,670
Does this mean you're not gonna be
going to church with me anymore?

208
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,190
Well, if they make me a deacon,
I'd have to go there all the time, yeah.

209
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,068
I'm sorry. I know.
Sundays have sort of been our day.

210
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:57,555
I think it's great. I really do.

211
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,669
One of the things I love about you...

212
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,432
...is the fact that your religion
means so much to you.

213
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,026
Besides, I think it could be
kind of hot, you know?

214
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,910
Dating a man of the cloth?

215
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:17,748
- But I need you to do something for me.
- What is it, my son?

216
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:21,345
You know the gay firemen
and police officers club I belong to?

217
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,830
Well, we're having a party
in Laguna this weekend.

218
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:27,948
- I want you to be my date.
- Your date? Will I get a corsage?

219
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:31,226
I want you to start meeting
some of my friends, David.

220
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,710
I'd like that.

221
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,349
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

222
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:58,943
This is an entire movie
about expelling gas.

223
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:02,029
I think that's why people like it.

224
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:08,142
- I don't want to watch this.
- Good, because neither do I.

225
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,421
Claire, look...

226
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,467
...I know you probably think
I'm old and stupid.

227
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,420
No, Mom, I don't.

228
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,744
But I love you just as much
as I ever did...

229
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,542
...and I'm worried about you,
and I don't know how to help.

230
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,585
I don't need help.

231
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,347
Why is everyone acting like
I'm in the Trenchcoat Mafia?

232
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,779
- You stole a foot. A human foot!
- Okay, you want to know why?

233
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:43,024
Because some guy who scammed me
into having sex with him...

234
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,384
...because I thought he cared about me,
told the entire school I sucked his toes.

235
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,698
And then when I confronted him,
he showed entirely no remorse.

236
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:54,864
I saw Nate drop the foot on the floor.
I grabbed it to get back at that asshole.

237
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,420
It wasn't premeditated.
I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer.

238
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:01,977
- I don't get off on hacked-up body parts.
- You're having sex?

239
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:06,018
No. Jesus. No, I'm sorry. I cannot have
this conversation with you.

240
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,738
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
we're ever gonna have...

241
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:12,413
...a touchy-feely, mother-daughter
relationship like on TV and the movies...

242
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:15,183
...because you know what?
They don't exist!

243
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,061
Here's our guest...

244
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:28,891
...and he brought us a bottle
of Louis Jadot Pinot Noir.

245
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:34,610
- 1997, no less.
- Okay, a man who knows his wine.

246
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:36,891
I'm liking you more and more, Nate.

247
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:41,537
Well, I worked at a food co-op in Seattle
for a long time. Learned a little bit.

248
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,493
A co-op? So there's a little hippie
in there, huh?

249
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,090
That makes sense.
Brenda would find that attractive.

250
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,894
She likes to think of herself
as being wildly countercultural.

251
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,454
I think she's actually
just jealous of the fact...

252
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,617
...that Bern and I really were hippies,
briefly.

253
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:01,254
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure, do you have any beer?

254
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,053
No, we have vodka, scotch, bourbon.

255
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:10,570
- I'll have a little bourbon.
- Manly, but not elitist. Just her type.

256
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,449
Down, girl.

257
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,736
So where is Brenda?

258
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:20,292
Brenda?
Oh, Brenda's not coming tonight.

259
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,330
- Really?
- She felt, and I have to agree with her...

260
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:32,767
...we'd have a better chance of getting
to know each other if she weren't here.

261
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,691
She does tend to take
center stage, so to speak.

262
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:45,572
- I wish somebody had thought to tell me.
- I'm sorry. I assumed she did.

263
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,488
There you are.

264
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,484
David was raised in this church.

265
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:01,002
He was christened and confirmed here,
he served as an altar boy...

266
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:05,443
...and he was president
of the youth ministry in high school.

267
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:09,041
- How old are you, David?
- I'm 31.

268
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:13,602
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a funeral director.

269
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,838
His father served as a deacon for over
a decade. He just recently passed away.

270
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,327
So you see this
as a sort of passing the torch.

271
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,442
No, sir, I see it as a chance
to serve God.

272
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:32,597
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.
Because that's what it is.

273
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:37,757
Being a deacon is more than just having
access to the church mailing list...

274
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,482
...and passing out your business cards
after Mass.

275
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:45,359
Sir, I won't deny that I run a business...

276
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,035
...providing service to people
in times of need.

277
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:52,683
But I would never exploit my relationship
to the church for marketing purposes.

278
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:56,356
Frankly, I consider that to be
a pretty grave sin.

279
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,605
No pun intended.

280
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:03,956
St. Bartholomew is an old church...

281
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:05,917
...a conservative church...

282
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,640
...a church that doesn't need
to have its boat rocked.

283
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:11,404
Which is precisely why I feel
David is a good candidate.

284
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:14,596
How many men his age
have values as strong as his?

285
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:17,955
I think he would be
an excellent role model.

286
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:24,675
- Are you married?
- No, sir. I was engaged, briefly.

287
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,560
Is there anything else you'd like
to tell me about yourself...

288
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:34,639
...before I consider this?

289
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,958
No, sir.

290
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:41,671
Is there anything specific about me
that you'd like to ask?

291
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:43,837
No.

292
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,119
I'll let you know my decision
in a few days.

293
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,235
- You impressed him.
- You think?

294
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,758
Yes.

295
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,993
Oh, by the way, one of our parishioners
recently lost her father to liver cancer.

296
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,793
Sharon Murdoch. I gave her your name.
You may be getting a call.

297
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,556
Thank you.

298
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:16,113
- Again with the not knocking.
- Pack some things.

299
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,069
- We're going to San Bernardino.
- What?

300
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:21,075
We're spending the night
at my cousin Hannah's.

301
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:24,746
- Mom, I'm doing homework.
- Well, stop!

302
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:28,786
- I have school tomorrow.
- I'll write a note!

303
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,268
It's been a long time since Brenda's
wanted us to meet...

304
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,828
...any of the men in her life.

305
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:40,550
- What was that last one, chiropractor?
- He was a Rolfer.

306
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:42,393
He was an idiot.

307
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:45,154
Well, I'm not sure Brenda
ever meant for us to meet.

308
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:47,948
I don't think she expected you guys
to come home that day.

309
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,309
Oh, Nate.

310
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:52,983
Where Brenda's concerned,
there are no coincidences.

311
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,669
- You think she planned all this?
- Of course.

312
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,392
She's a master manipulator.

313
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:04,625
I love her dearly, but you really ought
to know what you're getting into.

314
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,743
Would you like another bourbon?

315
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:09,182
No, thanks.

316
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:13,785
Can I ask you guys something?

317
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,784
As long as it doesn't involve
asking us for money.

318
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:20,902
No, it doesn't.

319
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,388
Does the name "Nathaniel"
have any significance to you?

320
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,387
Well, sure. Nathaniel and Isabel.

321
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,943
Brenda adored these books as a little girl.

322
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,424
She could read by the time she was 3.

323
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,140
- What are they about?
- Two orphans who had adventures.

324
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:52,338
They ran away from an orphanage.

325
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,584
There was a malevolent nurse
who was always hunting them down...

326
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,624
...but they always managed
to outsmart her.

327
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:02,183
Typical infantile wish fulfillment.

328
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:06,898
- I've never even heard of them.
- They're British, quite dark.

329
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,221
People die in them all the time.

330
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,904
When Brenda's brother was born...

331
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:14,342
...we expected serious displacement
anxiety from her, but there was none.

332
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:18,333
She would sit next to his crib
and read him these stories for hours.

333
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:22,937
- She was what then, Bern, 4?
- 5 at most.

334
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,420
It's all in the book.

335
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:28,135
This book?

336
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:35,331
You mean, she didn't tell
you about that either?

337
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:41,372
I feel terrible,

338
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,379
- I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma,
- Yeah, huh?

339
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:48,460
That was a pretty Freaky Friday moment
we had back there,

340
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:54,096
Ruthie, I am so glad you called.

341
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,413
Ginnie and I would never allow
ourselves this kind of food...

342
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,134
...unless it were a really
special occasion.

343
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,530
We are definitely gonna have to do
an extra spinning class this week.

344
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,058
Tomorrow morning?

345
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,170
- Who's teaching?
- Derek.

346
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,688
I'm so there.

347
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,566
Mom and I have the hugest crush
on this spinning instructor at the Y.

348
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,008
He is hot, hot, hot.

349
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,007
So, Claire, have you thought
about college?

350
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,496
Yeah.

351
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:28,133
I'd love to go to, like,
NYU or Columbia...

352
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,169
...but I don't know
if I could ever get in, so...

353
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:34,169
Well, there are some great schools
in L.A.

354
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,686
Why would you want to go to school
in the same town you grew up in?

355
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,126
I go to Cal State
right here in San Berdoo.

356
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:44,725
- Well, whatever rocks your boat.
- Claire.

357
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,047
Hey, I love it.

358
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:50,530
By living at home, I'm saving
a ton of money for grad school.

359
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,532
I'm not stuck in a crappy dorm
where everyone's smoking pot...

360
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:56,493
...and playing loud music all the time.

361
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:01,008
And I don't have to call campus police
every time I walk home from the library...

362
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,488
...so that I don't get raped.

363
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:07,726
- And I like to stay close to my mom.
- That translates to: I do her laundry.

364
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,651
Oh, that's not true.

365
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:12,968
I love my mom,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

366
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:15,925
Thank you, honey. I love you too.

367
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:23,524
Okay, anybody want more?

368
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,083
- So how was it?
- Oh, it was quite informative.

369
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,127
I know what Nathaniel means now.
I know you have an IQ of 185.

370
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:41,126
I know you had a book
written about you.

371
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,923
Here, I signed it for you.

372
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:47,759
Why didn't you just tell me about this?

373
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:51,961
People always change after they read it.
I was trying to make the fun part last.

374
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:56,604
Oh, God! So you're kind of
scarily brilliant, I can handle that.

375
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,401
What I can't handle is the way
you keep mind-fucking me...

376
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:02,883
...for your personal entertainment.
It's really starting to piss me off.

377
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:06,556
I'm sorry I'm not a well-behaved,
little nothing that never challenges you...

378
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:11,044
...but if that's what you're looking for,
you might as well just leave right now.

379
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,202
So, what, you're trying
to drive me away?

380
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:16,715
Yeah, Nate, I'm trying
to drive you away.

381
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:25,641
It was my mother's idea
that I not be there...

382
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:29,996
...which is fine by me.
I don't really enjoy their company.

383
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,793
She said it was your idea.

384
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,916
Yeah, she would. She probably
believes that. She's out of her mind.

385
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:40,001
You could've warned me
what I was walking into.

386
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,033
You wouldn't have gone.

387
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:47,316
I just wanted to get it all
out of the way.

388
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:49,114
Them, the book, everything.

389
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:51,716
Yeah, well, I felt like a fucking lab rat
over there!

390
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:54,719
Yeah, that's what they do!

391
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:01,073
I'm 6 years old, I score through the roof
on some standardized, biased test...

392
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,794
...and it all becomes about them!

393
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,788
They hand me over to strangers,
experts, a bunch of academic fucks...

394
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,878
...who scrutinized everything I did
or said or thought even.

395
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,236
It is a fucking law of physics
that the very act of observation...

396
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:18,511
...changes that which is being observed.

397
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:27,988
And now you're gonna read that book
and think that you know me.

398
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:33,789
- Well, you know what? You don't.
- Yeah, because you won't let me.

399
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:43,194
Okay, fine.
What do you want to know?

400
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,672
Ask me anything.

401
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,706
Did you burn down that house
that we made love in?

402
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:56,952
You think I burned down the house?

403
00:29:57,154 --> 00:30:00,032
Really? That is so weird!

404
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:01,832
Well, what am I supposed to think?

405
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,707
You put my brother and me
in the bus that killed our father.

406
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:07,905
You get weird phone calls from
screaming people you won't explain.

407
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:10,581
Now you wanna make me
feel stupid for being suspicious?

408
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,227
Give me a fucking reason not to be!

409
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:21,661
I just want to know what this is...

410
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:25,589
...for you.

411
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:32,300
Am I just another step along your way?

412
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,228
Okay, look...

413
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,348
...we obviously have
an intense sexual connection...

414
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,303
...and yes, I would like for there to be
something more than that.

415
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:51,620
But that can't ever happen until you
trust me, which apparently you don't.

416
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:55,262
Should I trust you?

417
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,345
Yes.

418
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,703
Come here.

419
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:19,975
R-A...

420
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:23,382
...K- E.

421
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:31,940
Triple letter score for K.
Good one, Mom.

422
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:40,301
H-E-L-L.

423
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:52,251
H-E-L-L...

424
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,861
...O.

425
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,132
Hello.

426
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,213
D...

427
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:06,574
...E...

428
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,133
...F...

429
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,697
...T.

430
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,456
Deft. What is deft?

431
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,174
Well, it's a laundry detergent
from when Ruth and I were kids.

432
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:23,213
No, it's a word.
It means skilled.

433
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,656
Really? Use it in a sentence.

434
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,969
He deftly juggled his responsibilities.

435
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,131
Deft.

436
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:40,929
Or "Deft, where ith thy sting?"

437
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:50,973
So how you both doing,
you know, with Nathaniel passing?

438
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:54,571
- Better every day.
- You know, shit happens.

439
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:59,086
You know, it's such an awful thing,
losing someone you love.

440
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:03,692
In terms of stress, it's right up there
with moving and getting fired.

441
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,647
I know when Ed and I split up,
I was devastated.

442
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:10,893
I didn't even want to get out of bed.
I just wanted to curl up and die.

443
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:17,367
And all I can say is, thank God
for my precious daughter.

444
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:21,122
Well, I just wouldn't let her mope.
Just wouldn't let her.

445
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,886
Dragged her ass,
pardon my French, out of bed...

446
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:25,969
...and took her to spinning class
with me.

447
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,807
And I hated her for it at the time,
but it really got me back on track.

448
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:33,083
You know, endorphins really are
nature's antidepressants.

449
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,407
Life goes on. It doesn't go on by itself.

450
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:37,602
Sometimes you just gotta
kick it in the butt.

451
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:40,245
But Ed didn't die.

452
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,522
He's still alive. You can still see him.

453
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,961
When Ginnie gets married,
you'll both be there.

454
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,883
When she has children,
they'll be able to know him.

455
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,437
He's not gone forever.

456
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:01,438
Yeah, well, sure, but...

457
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:06,364
...in terms of the impact
it had on both our lives...

458
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,523
...it's similar.

459
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,599
Okay, I have the greatest idea.

460
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:22,561
You guys are coming to spinning class
with us tomorrow, bright and early.

461
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:27,395
No offense, but I'd rather drive
a rusty railroad spike through my skull.

462
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:30,395
Oh, just try it once.

463
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:33,683
You might be surprised
how it changes the way you feel.

464
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,194
- I feel fine.
- You know what, Ginnie?

465
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,919
That is absolutely an inspired idea!

466
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:46,637
Okay, ladies, let's get to bed. Because
if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 a. M...

467
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,879
...Derek doesn't let you in.

468
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:57,033
So these tits do nothing for you, huh?

469
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,922
Well, I can appreciate
that they are beautiful...

470
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:03,194
...in their own completely artificial way.

471
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:07,474
Men loved them.
Well, real men.

472
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,793
You think God cares that you're gay?

473
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,035
You think God cares
that you fucked 30 guys at once?

474
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,078
Oh, so you equate being a fag
with being a whore?

475
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,794
- No.
- One's okay, but one isn't?

476
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,269
I think God appreciates it
when love's involved.

477
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,793
Oh, honey.

478
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:30,356
I loved every man I ever fucked
while I was fucking him.

479
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:16,063
- What are you doing?
- Watching you.

480
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:24,628
Claire, wake up. Get dressed.

481
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,427
- Why?
- We're leaving. Hurry.

482
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,100
Jesus, Mom, I'm starting to feel
like Anne Frank.

483
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:33,429
If we don't get out of here fast,
we'll have to go spinning.

484
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:35,350
Oh, my God.

485
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:46,904
- Let's go.
- Wait.

486
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:51,183
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

487
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,748
Thanks for buying me breakfast.

488
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:02,019
Thank you for finding
my G-spot this morning.

489
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:03,901
Anytime.

490
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:09,897
Oh, I have something for you.

491
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,097
Wow.

492
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:19,061
- Oh, come on, it's just a key.
- No, this is great.

493
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,539
I'm a little surprised, that's all.

494
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:22,856
I'm too nervous to eat.

495
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:26,456
I'll just drink coffee
until I start twitching and sweating.

496
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,816
Why does being a deacon
mean so much to you now?

497
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:33,656
- It wasn't a consideration a week ago.
- I know you think it's naive...

498
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:36,174
...but I see it as a chance
to make a difference...

499
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:38,262
...make the world a little more tolerant.

500
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:41,258
David, we have our own church
in West Hollywood...

501
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:44,774
...which means the other churches
and dioceses don't have to tolerate us.

502
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:47,703
Frankly, I resent the notion
that I need to be tolerated.

503
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:51,061
So, what, we should just allow
ourselves to be ghettoized?

504
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:53,936
Why do you embrace an organization
that doesn't embrace you?

505
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:57,858
- The church embraces everyone.
- Right. Hate the sin, love the sinner.

506
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:00,623
- The operative word being "hate."
- What is with you?

507
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,382
The other night you said
you liked the idea.

508
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,738
I had a chance to think.

509
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:15,011
Isn't that your brother?

510
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:17,132
Okay, look, can we just have breakfast...

511
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:21,458
...without me feeling like I'm George Will
and you're Cokie Roberts with PMS?

512
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,094
You probably like George Will.

513
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,653
Dave.

514
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,452
- Hi.
- Hey.

515
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,619
Keith, you remember my brother Nate,
don't you?

516
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:34,537
- How's it going?
- Hey.

517
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,411
This is Brenda.

518
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,530
My...

519
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:44,017
- My girlfriend.
- I prefer the term "fuck puppet."

520
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:48,456
So, what are you guys doing here,
you just play racquetball?

521
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,855
- No. No, we just worked out.
- Oh, so you guys work out together?

522
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,414
Yeah.

523
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,127
Yeah, we do.

524
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:06,214
Oh, well, that's great.

525
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,691
Okay, great.

526
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:13,250
Okay, you guys have a great day.

527
00:39:13,455 --> 00:39:14,934
You too.

528
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:18,885
Bye, David.

529
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:25,565
Oh, my God, I think David is gay.

530
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:29,322
I think David is lucky.
Did you get a look at that guy?

531
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,003
Claire.

532
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:44,087
I had an affair.

533
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,888
For the last two years
I was seeing someone.

534
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:56,842
Your father never knew about it.
At least, I hope he didn't.

535
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,405
And I called it off after he died.

536
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,048
It's not something I'm proud of.

537
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,481
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it's the truth.

538
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:14,845
And whatever relationship
you and I have, I want it to be honest...

539
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:16,879
...even if you hate me.

540
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,203
Mom, I don't hate you.

541
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,836
I remember going to the movies
on Monday nights...

542
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:30,239
...but I'm 17 years old now,
and I have my own life.

543
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:34,117
And there's things I have
to figure out on my own.

544
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,555
And that's, like, normal.

545
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:43,805
And I know stealing a foot is weird...

546
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:48,157
...but hello, living in a house where
a foot is available to be stolen is weird.

547
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:55,594
I gotta get to school.

548
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,829
- Did you see his face?
- Oh, man.

549
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,714
I know I shouldn't be laughing,
but he looked so stupefied.

550
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:28,390
The way he was all,
"Great, great. I'm hip, I'm cool."

551
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,079
Proud of you, man.

552
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,510
So listen, this thing in Laguna
is Saturday night.

553
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,359
I got us a room at the Surf and Sand.
You ever been there?

554
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,754
- No.
- Man, it's gonna be great.

555
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,756
We got a fireplace
overlooking the ocean.

556
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:42,996
Keith, I don't think I can make it after all.

557
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:48,516
I shouldn't miss church, not while
they're considering me for a deaconship.

558
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:51,471
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

559
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:55,556
We'll come back Saturday night.

560
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:58,430
- That'll work.
- I can go to church with you on Sunday.

561
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:00,836
That's not a good idea.

562
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,597
This hasn't been a good idea
from the beginning, has it?

563
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:05,428
Fine, why don't we cut our losses...

564
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:07,513
...and call it quits right now?
- What?

565
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:11,072
Look, as long as you feel the need
to keep our relationship a secret...

566
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:15,063
David, you're ashamed of it!
I'm not having any of that, not anymore.

567
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:17,545
- I just came out to my brother.
- One step forward.

568
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:21,031
Now you want to take a giant leap
backwards into the arms of the enemy.

569
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:23,112
So now I'm a Nazi collaborator?

570
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:26,192
A lot of African-Americans might say
the same thing about you...

571
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:28,703
...being a member of the L.A.P.D.

572
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,985
You fucking coward!

573
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,385
Keith, please don't...

574
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,467
It works.

575
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,945
I must have left the stereo on again.

576
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,709
So you are not too freaked out?

577
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,861
A little, maybe.

578
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:13,382
It makes David more interesting.

579
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:17,304
No, I mean about me giving you
a key to my apartment.

580
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:21,984
What do you think I am, an aging
Peter Pan who's gonna disappear...

581
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:24,947
...at the sign of something permanent?
- Well, yeah.

582
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:29,460
You're one to talk. You couldn't even
allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend.

583
00:43:33,107 --> 00:43:34,938
Don't mind me.

584
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:41,774
I thought we agreed that you would call
before you came over.

585
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:46,218
I did. The hot water's out in my building.
I needed to take a shower.

586
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:48,581
Don't be mad at me.

587
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:50,935
You know I hate it
when you're mad at me.

588
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:54,933
Hey, it's me,
I need to use your shower, okay?

589
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:58,500
Besides, I haven 't seen you in a while,
and it's a fucking gorgeous day,

590
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:02,534
- Satisfied?
- I'm going to make a cup of tea.

591
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:04,297
Hey...

592
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:08,621
...I'll take one of those.
- Hey, you behave yourself.

593
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:14,581
Hi. What's your name?

594
00:44:15,663 --> 00:44:19,132
- Nate.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Billy.

595
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:22,981
Hi.

596
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:26,176
So how long you known Brenda?

597
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:29,450
A few months.

598
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:34,173
So...

599
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,052
Who am I and why am I in your
girlfriend's house practically naked?

600
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,289
- Yeah.
- She's my sister.

601
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,259
She's my mother. Sister. My mother.

602
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,688
Sorry. Nobody's ever laughed at that.
I should know better.

603
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,968
It's nice to meet you.

604
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,018
- So you met the parents yet?
- Yes, last night.

605
00:44:58,218 --> 00:44:59,537
Wow.

606
00:45:00,138 --> 00:45:02,413
You've made it pretty far.

607
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:06,252
So why haven't I heard about you?

608
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:10,367
No idea.

609
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:17,124
Well, I guess I better go
put some clothes on.

610
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:46,564
How'd you get her breasts synchronized?
Some sort of industrial epoxy?

611
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:52,406
Would you ask Colonel Sanders
for his secret recipe?

612
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:55,445
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna tell.

613
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:03,126
I stuck a can of cat food
under each one.

614
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,849
My sister-in-law did
a cat food commercial.

615
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,166
We've got like 10 cases.

616
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,960
Hey. I'm Larry Wadd.

617
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,085
You know...

618
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:23,805
...I met Viveca St. John
before she even did her first video.

619
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:27,003
Yeah, she was...

620
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:32,566
She was the fluffer
on the set of Dirty Larry 3.

621
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:34,963
She was...

622
00:46:35,848 --> 00:46:38,759
...friendly. She was eager.

623
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:44,196
I can honestly say I've never received
a better blowjob in my life.

624
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,681
And nobody was even filming it.

625
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:55,121
When I first met Viveca,
I met her on Deep Diving.

626
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:57,722
Thank you.

627
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:02,800
And I had never gone down on a girl
before. So naturally, I was nervous...

628
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:05,837
...but Viveca was so warm
and relaxed about it.

629
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,922
She really put me at ease.

630
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:13,556
Well, her and the two Xanax
she gave me.

631
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:16,437
And when I first had to do
a double penetration...

632
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:18,913
...I was, like, a total wreck.

633
00:47:19,123 --> 00:47:25,357
But Viveca came through
like such the pro she is.

634
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:27,800
I mean was.

635
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:39,030
- Nate, what the hell is going on in there?
- A funeral.

636
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,397
For whom? A prostitute?

637
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,274
A woman who was a star
of adult videos.

638
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,075
Mom, we're gonna clear
8 grand from this.

639
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:55,112
We can finally pay for all that
air conditioning work.

640
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,915
I'm just glad your sister is at school.

641
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:05,992
It was awful.
They're like best friends.

642
00:48:06,878 --> 00:48:10,313
They're both like cheerleaders
with this totally plastic way of life...

643
00:48:10,517 --> 00:48:13,236
...like spinning class solves everything...

644
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:16,749
...and they're both hot
for the same guy. It was creepy.

645
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:26,675
My mom's...

646
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:30,834
My mom is just so fucking sad.

647
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:35,150
And I wish I could help her.

648
00:48:38,194 --> 00:48:40,310
So help her.

649
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:45,913
Now, Mrs. Murdoch, some people
prefer the solemnity of a church...

650
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:48,673
...and St. Bartholomew
is a beautiful setting.

651
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:52,786
Here, however, one is more free
to customize the service.

652
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:57,031
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just had to tell somebody.

653
00:48:57,872 --> 00:49:03,947
Viveca looks so great.
Her tits have never looked better.

654
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:08,265
She was like a sister to me.

655
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,578
I'm so glad that you're pleased.

656
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,260
We want to remember her
at her very best, don't we?

657
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,542
Now, I'm sorry, but I'm helping
some other people right now.

658
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:30,661
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you after the service?

659
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,666
Okay.

660
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:41,106
I think we'll have Dad's service
at the church.

661
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:42,263
Fine.

662
00:49:42,468 --> 00:49:47,177
I'm not a religious man,
but I do believe in God.

663
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:54,343
If I were to make a list of the things
I thank God for the most...

664
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:58,941
...fucking Viv would be
at the top of that list.

665
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:02,182
She was a goddamn force of nature.

666
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:06,742
And I loved her.
And I know God loved her too.

667
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:10,614
I know he knew
just what he was doing...

668
00:50:11,264 --> 00:50:13,573
...and how much joy...

669
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:16,856
...she would bring to the world.

670
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:32,057
For David James Fisher,
chosen deacon in your church...

671
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,698
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

672
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:39,052
That he may faithfully fulfill
the duties of this ministry...

673
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,900
...build up your church
and glorify your name...

674
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:45,616
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

675
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:49,853
That by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
he may be sustained and encouraged...

676
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,379
...to persevere to the end...

677
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,369
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

678
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,168
For all who fear God
and believe in you, Lord Christ...

679
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:02,928
...that our divisions may cease
and that all may be as one...

680
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,898
...as you and the Father are one.

681
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:10,330
- We pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

682
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:27,050
Way to go, Dave.

683
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:29,247
All I have to do is join the Kiwanis club...

684
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:32,687
...and Fisher & Sons will have
all our bases covered.

685
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:35,366
Where's Keith?

686
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:38,294
He's just a friend, Nate.

687
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:44,929
- Very good to see you.
- Hello.

688
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:52,169
So, Mom, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

689
00:51:52,374 --> 00:51:55,570
Nothing as far as I know. Why?

690
00:51:55,773 --> 00:52:00,449
I thought maybe you'd want to go see
a movie or rent a movie or something.

691
00:52:01,173 --> 00:52:04,403
Okay, but if you cry,
the whole thing is off.

692
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:08,885
Thanks for coming today.

693
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,322
- I know you must've found this a little...
- Are you kidding? I loved it.

694
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:15,921
All that pageantry, it's so trippy.
It's like a Fellini movie.

695
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:20,682
Well, it was kind of cool being with you
here in front of God and everybody.

696
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,447
- You don't really believe in God, do you?
- Well, yeah.

697
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,884
I mean, I don't believe in some bearded,
old, white man up in a cloud...

698
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:34,761
...but I believe in something.

699
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:38,166
Some sort of undefinable creative force.

700
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:41,360
I think it's just all totally random.

701
00:52:41,568 --> 00:52:42,887
Really?

702
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,647
Yeah.

703
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:49,479
We live, we die.
Ultimately, nothing means anything.

704
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:51,439
How can you live like that?

705
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:54,002
I don't know. Sometimes
I wake up so fucking empty...

706
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:58,916
...I wish I'd never been born,
but what choice do I have?

707
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:11,495
