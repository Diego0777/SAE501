1
00:01:56,053 --> 00:02:00,490
Vance, I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've got no fucking appetite lately.

2
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,972
- That's a sign of depression.
- Really?

3
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:05,725
Oh, yeah. I've been reading up on it.

4
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:09,647
Ever since my wife's hysterectomy,
she's been real down in the dumps.

5
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:12,965
Loss of appetite, loss of sex drive...

6
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:17,331
feelings of hopelessness and despair,
no energy. All of which she has.

7
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,082
I only got the loss of appetite thing.

8
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,523
You know what is depressing?

9
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:33,448
My wife's cooking. Here.

10
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,685
What the fuck is that? It looks like cat shit.

11
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,650
I think it is cat shit.

12
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:43,449
She's fucking useless in the kitchen.
She always has been.

13
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,809
- At least your wife still fucks you.
- Thank God.

14
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,167
If she didn't do that, I'd have to kill her.

15
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,288
Shit!

16
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,372
Oh, fuck!

17
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,521
Fuck me.

18
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,525
This is fucked!

19
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,572
Fucking fuck!

20
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:23,402
- It's kind of beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's way beautiful.

21
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,691
You add the sunset factor, it'll be perfect.

22
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,487
There's horseshit everywhere.

23
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:30,802
So?

24
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,048
So isn't it gonna mess up your white dress?

25
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,852
Yeah, like I'm gonna wear a white dress.

26
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:42,163
Besides, if we exchange vows
surrounded by horseshit...

27
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,244
it'd be kind of fitting.

28
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,447
Meaning you think us getting married
is a shitty idea?

29
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,003
Meaning we're going into this open-eyed,
shit and all.

30
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:53,681
And hopefully,
my mother will step in some of it.

31
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:58,449
Or even better, fall face first into it, and then
it really will be the happiest day of my life.

32
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,324
Are you sure you want to marry me?
We can still call it off.

33
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,369
Of course I want to marry you.

34
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,284
But I could die, Bren.

35
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,242
I mean, I could die any day.
I could die any moment.

36
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,130
Yeah, and I couldn't?

37
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,570
Yeah, we're all gonna die, I know...

38
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,123
but the chances of it actually happening
are significantly higher for me.

39
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,773
That's just a fucking fact.
And the last thing I want...

40
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:22,287
is for you to marry me
because you feel sorry for me.

41
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,568
You really think I'd do that?

42
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,321
You've made enough sacrifices in your life
without having to go through some...

43
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,244
I'm marrying you because I love you.

44
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:38,088
You're the first man I thought I could
stand to spend the rest of my life with.

45
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,927
Or the rest of your life,
if it's tragically cut short or whatever.

46
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,926
You're not some car I want to trade in
because it has faulty transmission.

47
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,925
Jesus, do you really think I'm that shallow?

48
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,568
Of course not.

49
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:52,848
All we have is this moment...

50
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,003
right here, right now.

51
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:59,606
The future is just a fucking concept
that we use...

52
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,491
to avoid being alive today.

53
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,282
So...

54
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,489
be here...

55
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:10,602
now.

56
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,166
So why do we need
to get married at all then?

57
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,883
So we can rack up all that free shit from
all my mother's wealthy friends, that's why.

58
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,612
Hey, I know this really cool rabbi
who can possibly do our wedding.

59
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,251
- A rabbi?
- Yeah.

60
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,452
- Why would you even go there?
- You are half-Jewish.

61
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,208
Yeah, I'm also half-Catholic.
So you wanna invite the Pope?

62
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:42,246
It's a marriage. It's a sacred occasion.

63
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,968
You'd rather have
just some civil servant there?

64
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,807
Personally, I think the two of us
should be enough to make it sacred.

65
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:59,684
Hey, did you sleep okay?

66
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,642
No.

67
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:06,488
I finally dozed off around 5:00.

68
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,290
Keith, go back to bed.

69
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,092
I'm not gonna sleep anymore, believe me.

70
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:20,281
Maybe you should talk to your doctor
about medication.

71
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,443
Yeah, drugs, that's the answer.

72
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:26,321
You're right. Suffering when you don't
have to, that's much more constructive.

73
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,051
- Idiot.
- Fuck you.

74
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,484
Is there any more coffee?

75
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:36,170
I really don't think you should be drinking
caffeine when your sleep is so erratic.

76
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,326
Suit yourself.

77
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,287
Bitch.

78
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:02,004
Taylor left her gummy vitamins.

79
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,288
Big surprise. She hated those.

80
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,210
I should run these over to Karla.

81
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:12,208
Okay, no. Karla can get her more vitamins.
You could probably use a little space now.

82
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,809
Yeah, well, I need to make sure
Karla's staying clean.

83
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,090
You need to take care of yourself
right now, okay?

84
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,844
That's what you're for.

85
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,170
I see. So, basically, I just exist to serve you.

86
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,371
Well, yeah.

87
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:36,241
- You're gonna make me late for work.
- That's your problem.

88
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,967
There are two chicken-salad sandwiches
in here. They're for your lunch.

89
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,725
And don't eat them before noon...

90
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:57,488
because you'll have to wait
until I get home from work to eat again.

91
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,372
What are these things supposed to be?

92
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,971
Have a nice day.

93
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:11,641
Are we really supposed to believe
Britney Spears is a virgin?

94
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,968
Why exactly are we supposed to care?

95
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:18,322
I'd like for you to do me a favor
and check on Nikolai when you get home.

96
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,483
I won't be home until late.

97
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:23,929
- Parker and I have plans.
- I thought you and Parker had a falling-out.

98
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,366
We made up.

99
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:29,651
I figured it was better to have a loser
for a friend than to have no friends at all.

100
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,042
Well, what are you doing with her?

101
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,564
We're going to the Getty.

102
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,729
Do you think I'm an idiot?

103
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,805
No, of course not.

104
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:44,688
It's not like I'm lying
to cover up my drug habit.

105
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:48,732
I'm lying to get out of having to empty
the bedpan of the man you're sleeping with.

106
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,485
I don't feel I should have to do that.

107
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,292
For God's sake,
that's not what I'm asking you to do.

108
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:54,488
Good.

109
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,564
You have absolutely no idea
how easy you have it.

110
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:03,005
Please tell me you're not gonna start talking
about your legless grandmother again.

111
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,845
I pity you, Claire.

112
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,728
You are under the mistaken impression
that life owes you something.

113
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,805
Well, you're in for
some very harsh surprises.

114
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,727
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was unbelievable.
Are they here yet?

115
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,724
Yeah, they're waiting in the Wisteria Room.

116
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:29,089
- Dave, I've got something I need to ask you.
- What?

117
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:32,204
What's with the red face?

118
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:38,611
Keith and I were fooling around,
and, well, he hadn't shaved.

119
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,572
You big whore.

120
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:42,530
- Is it really bad?
- No.

121
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:46,003
Actually, it's bright red.
It's red as a baboon's ass.

122
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:48,687
Oh, my God! I look like a burn victim.

123
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:56,007
What I wanted to ask was
if you'd be best man at my wedding.

124
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,882
- Of course I will.
- Excellent.

125
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,731
- All right, you ready to roll?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,372
Good Lord.

127
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:16,728
So, Dad already took care of everything?

128
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:20,131
It's all specified in the pre-need contract.

129
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,767
For the viewing,
he's chosen a Parliament casket...

130
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,606
followed by a cremation and internment
at Cedar Grove...

131
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,924
in the remaining chamber
of a prayer-level double crypt.

132
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,607
- With Mom?
- Harriet Mitchell Garrison?

133
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,246
That's her.

134
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,206
So there's nothing for us to do.

135
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,563
All you have to do is show up.

136
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,168
Okay.

137
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,812
Oh, my God!

138
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,769
I feel so awful.

139
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:57,168
I can't remember
the last time that I saw him.

140
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,491
Honey, it's okay.

141
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,490
He knew we loved him.

142
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:07,645
I can give you the number
of a great dermatologist.

143
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,842
- What up, Uncle Keith?
- Hey, you forgot these at my house.

144
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,163
I hate these nasty old things.

145
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,445
- They're good for you.
- I like the Flintstones.

146
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,091
Shouldn't you be in school?

147
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,926
Mama's sick. I'm staying home today
to take care of her.

148
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:36,527
Hey. Don't come too close to me.
I got the flu.

149
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,923
You got the flu.
Have you been to see the doctor?

150
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:44,644
I ain't paying nobody's doctor $100
just to tell me to stay in bed. Fuck that shit.

151
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:51,011
- You don't have a temperature.
- Are you sure?

152
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,806
Maybe you should stick a thermometer
up my ass.

153
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,081
Go play in your room.

154
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,971
No, honey, Taylor. You stay here.
Mama needs you.

155
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,082
Go.

156
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,124
You've got a choice to make.

157
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,522
You can either let me
check you into a drug rehab...

158
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:15,492
I already told you. I went to rehab
in Oakland. I am clean. What the fuck?

159
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:19,043
I'll call the station, we'll search this house,
and if we find anything...

160
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,601
you'll face charges. You got that?
It's your choice.

161
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:24,651
You sound just like Daddy, you know that?
You know that?

162
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:28,362
You done gone and turned into Daddy!
What are you gonna do next?

163
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:32,002
Slap me so hard I can't hear out of one ear
for the next day-and-a-half?

164
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,731
You remember that?

165
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,844
It's your choice, Karla.

166
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:43,526
God damn it.

167
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,572
You need help. I can get you help.

168
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:52,161
I'll find you the best help there is.
I swear to you I will.

169
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:01,852
I said okay.

170
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:09,049
Okay, but it has to be outpatient.
I'm not leaving Taylor again. So...

171
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:24,172
No major facial damage. That's a plus.

172
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:29,211
I'm gonna have to do some major plug-ins
on the top of the head here, though.

173
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:31,284
It's a good thing he's not bald.

174
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,492
Why's that?

175
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:37,929
It'd be a little hard to wig him...

176
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:42,484
since everybody remembered him
with his head all nice and shiny, you know?

177
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,007
Hello?

178
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,164
Oh, for Christ's sake!

179
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,648
I gotta swing by Appleby
and pick up the Parliament.

180
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,566
- You probably need some help with that.
- Not really.

181
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,052
Yes, really.

182
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,883
Hello? Anyone!

183
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,770
Please, I'm so bored.

184
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,203
That's not my problem, pal.

185
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,205
- He's gotta be driving you crazy.
- Not at all.

186
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:37,002
Actually, our relationship
has reached a whole new level.

187
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,321
How so?

188
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,925
Well, it's not just about the sex anymore.

189
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,448
There's more intimacy.
He's letting his guard down.

190
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:51,489
He's allowing me to see him
at his most vulnerable.

191
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:54,803
Well, that's great, cupcake.

192
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,928
Clarify one thing for me.
He is bedridden, right?

193
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,007
Hello? Who is there?

194
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,405
Can you help me?

195
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,965
That depends on what you want.

196
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:33,966
I ate already my lunch, and I am starving.
I cannot walk.

197
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:44,447
She is my favorite, this one. Such a bitch.

198
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,886
She would be a wildcat in love I think.

199
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:54,202
She's the kind that leaves scratch marks
all over your body.

200
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,532
Yeah, but she's, like, 60.

201
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:03,202
Doesn't matter. Besides, I think she's Latin.

202
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,609
They're always hot-blooded.

203
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:11,251
- What kind of sandwich this is?
- Pork.

204
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,170
It is not so good. Needs salt.

205
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:19,087
- Lf you don't like it, I'll eat it.
- No, I will eat.

206
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,407
It was supposed to be mine anyway.

207
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:29,532
- What happened to your face?
- It's none of your fucking business, pal.

208
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,288
Okay.

209
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:35,407
Sorry.

210
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,367
I don't understand. I'm his wife.

211
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,292
He should be buried with me.

212
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:47,922
Well, unfortunately,
he stipulated in his pre-need contract...

213
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:50,083
that he was to be buried
with his former wife.

214
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:54,485
That's gotta be a mistake. He must've made
those arrangements before he married me.

215
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,723
This is dated October of '98.

216
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:08,447
I never even knew he had done this.

217
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,251
Neither did his daughters.

218
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,611
God, I'm sure they just love it, though.

219
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:16,244
They've always hated me.

220
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,611
They thought their daddy
was too good for me.

221
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,089
And apparently, so did he.

222
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:26,564
I'm sure that's not true.

223
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,964
So this thing's all signed, sealed,
and paid for?

224
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,729
There's no recourse for me.

225
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:43,450
Well, actually, it hasn't been paid in full.

226
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,647
Really?

227
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,286
You know, he did leave everything to me...

228
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:59,205
and I hope you don't think I'm gonna
be paying for such a blatant slap in my face.

229
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,763
<i>What the hell is Mom doing in Belize?</i>

230
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,768
She's on some sort of cruise
for the recently separated.

231
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:16,481
Maybe it's for people
who want to quit smoking.

232
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,052
What a freak.

233
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,450
I'm fine with water.

234
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:27,490
Have you spoken to Dad?

235
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:30,486
Yeah, right.

236
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,603
So what's with you living with her?

237
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,763
Well, it sure beats the hospital.

238
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:46,602
You know, Bren, I still go in
three times a week to see Dr. Hanover.

239
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,728
She's great.

240
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:50,247
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she's a total genius.

241
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,447
She's helped me look at a lot of my shit.

242
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:56,812
That's good.

243
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,368
Yeah.

244
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,846
So, how's Nate?

245
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,765
He's not so great.

246
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:16,250
He was recently diagnosed
with this brain condition...

247
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:22,011
and he's had a couple of seizures, actually.

248
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,009
He could have a stroke.

249
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,842
Shit!

250
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,965
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

251
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,208
Well, now I know why you're marrying him.

252
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:36,567
Fuck you!

253
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,523
Wow, that hit a nerve. Must be true.

254
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,765
No, I'm just a little surprised
at how randomly cruel you can be.

255
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:46,606
I guess I'd forgotten
what a kick you get out of that.

256
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,762
See, this is what you do.

257
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,482
You invalidate anything I say
that might challenge your authority.

258
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:52,848
You learned it from Mom.

259
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,686
The same way that you learned
to explain everything to me...

260
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:58,606
- like I'm an idiot from Dad.
- No, I learned that from you.

261
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:02,208
Apparently you're still angry at me
for committing you.

262
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,568
No. That was the best thing
that could have happened to me.

263
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:11,168
Then why wouldn't you see me...

264
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,049
or take my calls or e-mail?

265
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,691
Because Dr. Hanover suggested...

266
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:18,162
that I might be able
to do more constructive work...

267
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,972
if I cut things off with you for a while.

268
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:29,242
Because you have contributed a lot
to my pathology.

269
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,609
- You have a medical condition.
- It's not just about pharmaceuticals.

270
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:36,481
I never developed any functional way
to deal with the world...

271
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,889
because you kept me from it.

272
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,005
I've done a real number on you.

273
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,881
You were always there, looking out for me,
protecting me, being strong for me.

274
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,929
I never learned how to take care of myself.

275
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:55,005
I mean, shit, Brenda,
I've never even had a real girlfriend.

276
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:59,211
I never let you have a girlfriend?
That's really...

277
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:00,612
You fucking asshole!

278
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,649
I thought we could have
a rational discussion.

279
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,724
How dare you blame me for that, Billy?

280
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,691
I'm not saying that you did it on purpose.

281
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,493
But I do think we need
to disengage from each other...

282
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:13,406
because our relationship is really toxic.

283
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:27,288
Okay.

284
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,973
And I don't know how long it needs to last.

285
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:33,089
Probably a very long time.

286
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:37,487
Maybe.

287
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,052
Anyway...

288
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:48,162
I have somewhere I have to be,
but thank you for the grub.

289
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:12,051
- Hey, you look nice.
- Thanks.

290
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,965
Where you going?

291
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:18,361
- To meet a friend.
- Billy Chenowith?

292
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:20,802
Yeah.

293
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,370
I don't think you should be seeing him.

294
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:27,126
I'll just file that under
"couldn't possibly matter less."

295
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,010
He can be dangerous.

296
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,802
I can take care of myself, Nate.

297
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:36,132
Okay. Are you armed,
in case he pulls a knife on you?

298
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:39,967
- How much time have you spent with him?
- How much time have you spent with him?

299
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:44,205
Enough to know he isn't
a drooling psychopath. He's got a disease.

300
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:47,046
He went through a period
where he went off his medication...

301
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,772
because he was fucked up
and in denial about it.

302
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,890
It's under control now. Sound familiar?

303
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,209
It was very slow at work today.

304
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:05,603
It is because I wasn't there.

305
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:09,810
- You and Robbie are lazy.
- That is not true.

306
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:15,090
Why, just today I reorganized the ribbons,
I cleaned the inside of the cash register...

307
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:18,404
and I spent a couple of hours
looking at the books.

308
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:22,407
- That is not your job.
- No, and it's apparently not yours, either.

309
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:25,724
I've never seen a messier,
more incoherent bookkeeping system.

310
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:27,166
I thought my husband was bad.

311
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,562
I don't want you messing with my books.

312
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,008
This is my personal finances.
None of your business.

313
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:34,732
May I remind you
that I've been paying your medical bills?

314
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,041
I will pay back.

315
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,442
You're gonna be in big trouble
if you get audited.

316
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,569
- That bullshit.
- Language.

317
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:52,522
So, listen, I really wanted to thank you.

318
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,092
For what?

319
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:58,401
For being the only person
who kept in touch with me...

320
00:23:58,493 --> 00:24:01,087
while I was in
the home for the tragically inappropriate.

321
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,925
Are you kidding me?

322
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:07,202
Your e-mails were totally brilliant.
I saved them all.

323
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,046
It was the only thing that kept me going.

324
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,931
I know I would never have given me
a second chance...

325
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:16,925
after the way I treated you
the first time we met.

326
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,967
- So, no word from Gabe at all?
<i>- Nada.</i>

327
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:26,248
Which is fine.
Like, seriously, good riddance.

328
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:32,165
It was so obvious he was never gonna
take charge of his life, you know?

329
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,608
Well, it's hard. Few people ever do.

330
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:39,050
Yeah, but most people are able
to avoid becoming drug-addict criminals.

331
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:41,325
Yeah, most people.

332
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:47,202
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

333
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,811
I'm not sure. Why?

334
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:54,565
Well, I need some help with this project...

335
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,891
and there's not really anybody else
I can ask.

336
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,563
- Okay.
- Yeah?

337
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:04,962
Cool.

338
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,605
<i>We're back with our exclusive visit...</i>

339
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:35,403
<i>with one of the year's happiest and sexiest</i>
<i>couples, David and Keith Fisher-Charles.</i>

340
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,529
<i>So guys, tell me, how do you do it?</i>

341
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,810
<i>- Well, Leeza, it takes a lot of work.</i>
<i>- It's not that much work.</i>

342
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,451
<i>He's right. We've done all the work.</i>

343
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,001
<i>I think people don't appreciate</i>
<i>how important that is.</i>

344
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,048
<i>No, they really don't.</i>

345
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,567
<i>- Now, you've got kids. How many?</i>
<i>- Two.</i>

346
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:53,283
<i>- And we're talking about a third.</i>
<i>- Yeah, we're talking about a third.</i>

347
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:56,046
<i>I think the key is to do everything together...</i>

348
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,682
<i>from PTA meetings</i>
<i>to the White Party in Palm Springs.</i>

349
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:03,368
<i>Togetherness is the key.</i>
<i>We're a partnership. We're a team.</i>

350
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:11,212
- How long have I been asleep?
- About an hour I think.

351
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:12,928
Shit.

352
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:15,772
I'm never gonna get back to sleep tonight.

353
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,332
Why didn't you wake me up?

354
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:21,850
Because you're totally sleep-deprived.
You should take it where you can get it.

355
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:28,084
- Are you staying here tonight?
- I was planning on it.

356
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,601
- Would you rather I didn't?
- Maybe... I don't know.

357
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:35,287
Maybe we're moving a little too fast.

358
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:38,770
Okay. I can go home.

359
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:43,212
I mean, it's just that
we've spent the last six nights together.

360
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,329
Yeah, sure, no problem.

361
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:48,285
Call me tomorrow.

362
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:58,122
What?

363
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:12,642
- It's what our father wanted.
- No, it's what you want.

364
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,566
- Because you've never liked me.
- Well, you got that right.

365
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:18,008
You couldn't control your father
when he was alive...

366
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:20,129
and now you're trying to do it
when he's dead.

367
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:21,851
It was his decision.

368
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,766
There is a significant unpaid balance
on the account.

369
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:25,842
We'll pay for it!

370
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:28,163
Take money from them,
you'll hear from my attorney.

371
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:29,845
I really don't think that's necessary.

372
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,766
No? I gave the last six years of my life
to that man...

373
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:35,128
and contrary
to what these stupid bitches think...

374
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:38,444
I really did love him,
and I will not be humiliated like this!

375
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:42,003
Well, if you do not follow
our father's instructions exactly...

376
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,446
you'll hear from our attorney.

377
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:46,286
- Who used to work for Disney.
- Bring it on, ferret face!

378
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,728
- Fuck you, you gold-digging slut!
- How dare you!

379
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:52,283
There are naked pictures of you
on the Internet. My son showed them to me.

380
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:55,683
Shut up, all of you! Shut the fuck up!

381
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,569
Jesus Christ, a man died.

382
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:04,293
Your husband. Your father.

383
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,687
He lived a life, and now he's dead.

384
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,485
Show some respect.

385
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,850
And if you really loved him,
and I believe you did...

386
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,810
you'll give him what he wanted.

387
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:21,647
If you don't, then you never
really loved him. It's as simple as that.

388
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,172
Thank you.

389
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:30,563
And if I so much as get a phone call
from anybody's lawyer...

390
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:32,291
we'll give the body back...

391
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:36,969
and the three of you can tear him to pieces
like fucking jackals if you want to.

392
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:39,363
It's not your decision.

393
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:55,322
God!

394
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:00,408
Oh, my God.

395
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:02,484
Hey, I'm right here, okay?

396
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:04,962
It's okay.

397
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:14,843
What happened to me, Keith?

398
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,085
I used to be okay.

399
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:29,888
I used to be able to live
without all this sadness...

400
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,445
without all this...

401
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:38,130
- never having any hope.
- You're here, aren't you?

402
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:41,772
And my baby...

403
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:44,530
she's so precious.

404
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:47,491
I am such a bad mother.

405
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,610
Hey, look at me. No, you're not.

406
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:52,684
I've seen worse. Believe me, I have.

407
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:56,850
None of it's her fault.

408
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,930
She doesn't deserve this.

409
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:02,853
Look, let's just put it all behind you, okay?

410
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,289
I wish we could just start over.

411
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:22,770
- Nate, hi.
- What are you doing here?

412
00:31:23,253 --> 00:31:24,606
I'm just...

413
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:30,846
Remember when I told you about that movie
producer who was looking for a vegan chef?

414
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,288
I finally caved in and took the job.

415
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:35,808
- Cool.
- Yeah, finally sold out.

416
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,124
- So, you live here now?
- Well, the Palisades.

417
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:42,128
Since when?

418
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,932
Since right after Christmas.

419
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:51,682
I didn't want to bother you.
You have a whole new life and all.

420
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:53,764
Lisa, come on, we're friends.

421
00:31:56,933 --> 00:32:00,050
There's a great juice bar here.
Let's get caught up, okay?

422
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,088
Okay.

423
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:09,202
"Of all the lies we're fed, on which we gorge
in our comfort-addicted world...

424
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:14,286
"none is more insidious
than the lie of romance.

425
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,447
"The seductive but infantile notion...

426
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:22,288
"that somewhere there exists someone
to complement us in every way.

427
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:25,368
"Someone who will make us complete.

428
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:28,049
"Of course, this illusion...

429
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:32,491
"keeps us from ever being complete
in and of ourselves...

430
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,604
"and eventually encourages us...

431
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,605
"to despise our shortcomings, our flaws...

432
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:43,970
"everything in which our humanity lies.

433
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:48,563
"Our humanity, without which, of course...

434
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:50,812
"we are nothing."

435
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:59,926
It's strange. I mean, she's a strict vegan...

436
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:02,811
but she drinks like a fish
and she does a lot of blow.

437
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:07,045
But she's nice to me, and I needed to make
some real money for a change.

438
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,609
So, what's new with you?

439
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,207
Well, not much.
Same old same old, you know.

440
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,084
- How's Brenda?
- She's great. We're...

441
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:22,606
We're engaged.

442
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,122
- You're kidding.
- Yeah, I know, it's...

443
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:31,684
- What about you? You seeing anybody?
- No, not really.

444
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,203
By the way, I'm pregnant.

445
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:39,050
- Wow, that's great!
- Yeah. Five months.

446
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,805
She's a kicker.

447
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,012
Don't worry.
I don't expect anything from you.

448
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:50,130
- I don't expect anything at all.
- Lisa, I don't...

449
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:53,728
Don't you remember when you came
to Seattle last August and you fucked me?

450
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,725
Then you left the next day
like it didn't mean a goddamn thing?

451
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:59,805
It did mean something to you
'cause you were crying like a baby.

452
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,406
That's not the reason I was crying.

453
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:04,724
You were crying 'cause you knew
you were home. Because you missed me.

454
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:08,886
Because you knew that you and I
should be together. Then you fucked me.

455
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:12,728
Then you chickened out the next day
and I saw you for exactly who you are:

456
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:16,283
A coward who was never going to own up
to the way he really felt about me.

457
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,364
How could you not tell me about this?

458
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:21,013
Because we already went through this
once before.

459
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:24,005
But this time, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna have it without you.

460
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:25,082
I don't know...

461
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:28,563
Congratulations, you know,
on the whole getting married thing.

462
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:31,247
- She must be out of her fucking mind.
- Just give me...

463
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,448
Don't.

464
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:09,327
Come on in.

465
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:26,129
All right, let me show you.

466
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,601
You can put your purse down if you like.

467
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,572
Here it is.

468
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,168
This is your focus, and this is your zoom.

469
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,525
That's pretty much it.

470
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,366
So here you go.

471
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,565
You'll get a feel for it.

472
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:49,092
Okay, what do you want me to do?

473
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:53,610
Just, you know, follow your instincts.
Relax. Don't think about yourself at all.

474
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:57,724
- I know that's impossible for a 1 <i>7</i>- year-old.
- Eighteen.

475
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:04,045
What you don't know is you're
going to be 18 for the rest of your life.

476
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:18,083
I've tried to do self-portraits before...

477
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:22,291
but they always turn out so contrived,
like I'm trying to be some version of myself.

478
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,725
So fucking juvenile.

479
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,486
And I really want to see it, you know?

480
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:32,292
I want to.

481
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:34,530
I need to see what I've done.

482
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:39,602
And I think it really is impossible
for somebody to see themselves.

483
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,810
You need someone else's eyes.

484
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,844
I need somebody else to see me.

485
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:49,931
Somebody who isn't Brenda.

486
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,082
She sees things a little too darkly.

487
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:56,566
I mean, I don't need any help going there.

488
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:01,412
Besides, I've looked through her eyes
enough for one lifetime, you know.

489
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,366
What are you seeing?

490
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:09,923
I'm on your scar, really close up.

491
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,325
What does it look like?

492
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,650
Like the surface of the moon.

493
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,532
That's good.

494
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:27,123
That's the thing about Narcissus.

495
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:34,243
It's not that he's so fucking in love
with himself, because he isn't at all.

496
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,125
Fucking hates himself.

497
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,324
It's that without that reflection
looking back at him...

498
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,651
he doesn't exist.

499
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:57,766
Billy, are you okay?

500
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:08,892
Yeah. Don't be freaked out. This is good.
This is exactly what I needed to happen.

501
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,651
I'm fucking crying.

502
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:15,690
Oh, God, I'm sorry, this is intense.
You can go.

503
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,242
It's okay, I'll be all right, I swear.

504
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,843
- Nikolai?
- I told you, he's not here.

505
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,686
Where is Nikolai?

506
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,886
- He's not in today. Can I help you?
- Where is he?

507
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,687
He's at home.

508
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,810
No. There is no one at his house.

509
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,682
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of his.

510
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,884
I have something for him.

511
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:36,364
- I need to know where he is.
- He's in the hospital.

512
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:40,641
He was robbed and beaten up
and the police are investigating.

513
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,446
You tell...

514
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,485
You tell Nikolai...

515
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,128
that Yuri says he is sorry...

516
00:39:57,693 --> 00:40:00,161
and hopes he will be better very soon.

517
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,610
I take this for my mother.

518
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,410
Way to go, buddy boy.

519
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:27,010
Nice to know
you're not shooting blanks, right?

520
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:29,528
Oh, God, what the fuck am I going to do?

521
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:32,366
You don't have to do anything.
That's the beauty part.

522
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:34,250
No, I have to tell Brenda.

523
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,812
No, you don't.

524
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:40,845
I can't keep something like this from her.
We're getting married.

525
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:42,924
Not if you tell her, you're not.

526
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,288
You really think she'd stay with you?

527
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:48,046
My guess is
she's just looking for a way out anyway.

528
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,045
You know, ever since she found about the...

529
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:53,122
What?

530
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:56,970
You think she meant everything
she said about sticking with you?

531
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:58,645
Oh, yeah.

532
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:03,210
Nothing turns the women on
more than a potentially fatal brain condition.

533
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:07,122
Try coughing up blood.
I bet you'll be getting laid left and right.

534
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:11,603
You know, buddy boy,
sometimes you can be a fucking moron.

535
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,291
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

536
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,763
You can get away with anything.
There's shit on me you still don't know.

537
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,323
Things you'll never know.
And let me tell you, you're better off for it.

538
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,768
No, I should tell her. She deserves that.

539
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:28,413
You want to die alone? Go right ahead.

540
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:39,370
Oh, my God, it was hallucinatory,
and I'm sorry but it was so...

541
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:43,446
You know, I could just...
I could feel every inch of my skin.

542
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:47,242
I could just feel
that I was so goddamn alive.

543
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:50,413
You know how guys who've been to war
talk about it?

544
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:54,452
Yeah, like that.
Like I was right in the fucking center of life!

545
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,173
Wow. For a random fuck,
sounds pretty great.

546
00:41:57,253 --> 00:42:00,211
But it wasn't him.
I don't even remember him.

547
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:01,521
God, what was it?

548
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,810
I've had spontaneous,
anonymous sex before.

549
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:07,646
Maybe it's just the thrill
of breaking the rules.

550
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:10,051
You are engaged.

551
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:13,532
You keep harping on about that. It's not it.

552
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:16,491
It's not about me and Nate. It's not it at all.

553
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:22,012
It's about me
not being outside myself for once.

554
00:42:22,093 --> 00:42:25,972
Not watching, not analyzing
every goddamn moment as it happens.

555
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,567
Not holding back. Just becoming...

556
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,683
pure sensation.

557
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:35,925
Becoming energy. Just becoming nature.

558
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:39,332
- Sounds pretty great.
- Yeah. Oh, my God!

559
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:42,247
It was such a fucking rush.

560
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:48,889
And then I came home and I wrote
a whole 12 pages without stopping.

561
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,044
What if I'm losing my shit?

562
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:02,131
What if this is the beginning
of some serious mental illness, you know?

563
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:05,011
Chances are I am genetically predisposed.

564
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:08,803
Fuck it. That's just me being paranoid.

565
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:12,488
That's just me being afraid
to be out of control.

566
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,768
As if anybody's ever in control.

567
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:18,766
I can give you the name of my therapist
if you want to talk to somebody.

568
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,452
No, thanks.

569
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:24,482
I will never talk to a therapist.

570
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:29,372
Therapists fucked up my life.
I don't need a fucking therapist.

571
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,324
- Want another beer?
- Sure.

572
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:40,008
I come to this country with nothing.

573
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:44,606
My wife was already dead for many years.

574
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,090
My son is dead, too.

575
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:55,843
And so I come to America. Why not?

576
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:02,768
I working, cleaning toilets at the studio...

577
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:06,411
riding bus...

578
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:15,243
growing potato in the box in the roof.

579
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:24,249
Bank, they don't want to give me money
to start my business.

580
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:28,450
So I have to go somewhere else.
What choice do I have?

581
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,524
How much money do you owe them?

582
00:44:36,493 --> 00:44:39,326
I don't know. It keeps changing.

583
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:41,727
Interest.

584
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:45,648
- Nikolai, you should call the police.
- Yeah, police.

585
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:50,723
This is no different than Moscow.

586
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,930
No difference at all.

587
00:45:11,413 --> 00:45:12,846
Keith, are you okay?

588
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,042
No.

589
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:20,892
What's wrong?

590
00:45:25,293 --> 00:45:26,772
Is it because of the shooting?

591
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:29,367
No, it is not because of the shooting.

592
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:32,452
Damn, you're like
a fucking broken record about that.

593
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,286
- What is it then?
- What difference does it make?

594
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:38,731
Am I not allowed
to feel shitty every now and then?

595
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,770
I just want to help.

596
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:51,243
Is it because Taylor
isn't living here anymore?

597
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,166
No. You know what?
I'm glad Taylor's not living here anymore.

598
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:58,041
I didn't ask for the responsibility
of taking care of a child. I don't want it.

599
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,010
I'm glad. I have my life back!

600
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,282
I'm sick and tired of taking care
of everybody else's fucking problems!

601
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:05,728
Okay.

602
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,930
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

603
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:16,563
I don't mean to take it out on you.

604
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:18,887
You can.

605
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:23,410
I mean, we all need to vent.
That's just part of it, right?

606
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:28,448
You can tell me to shut the fuck up.

607
00:46:30,093 --> 00:46:31,890
I don't mind, really.

608
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:39,166
I do miss her.

609
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:41,962
Me, too.

610
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:49,851
- You want to have sex?
- Sure.

611
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,289
I want to do it on the floor.

612
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:56,087
Okay. Let me just put these groceries away.

613
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:14,445
How was your day?

614
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:17,846
It was okay. Long.

615
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,290
- You?
- Okay. I got a lot of writing done.

616
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,492
That's good.

617
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:27,966
Did you eat?

618
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:33,332
No, I didn't.

619
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:37,568
Do you want me to fix you something?

620
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,491
No, I'm not hungry.

621
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:53,092
What's this?

622
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:56,523
Some book everyone's raving about.

623
00:47:57,973 --> 00:48:00,726
- You met him?
- No, it belongs to my mom.

624
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,171
Oh, God.

625
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,848
Dear friends, it was our Lord Jesus Himself
who said:

626
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,891
"Come to me,
all you who labor and are burdened...

627
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:23,725
"and I will give you rest."

628
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:26,727
Let us pray then,
for our brother Dwight Garrison...

629
00:48:26,813 --> 00:48:29,168
that he may rest from his labors and enter...

630
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,847
Nate, are you okay? You don't look well.

631
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:33,651
Yeah, I just...

632
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:37,689
didn't sleep a lot last night.

633
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:43,048
You're taking care of yourself, right?

634
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:48,050
You're taking your medication,
not letting yourself get too stressed out?

635
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,446
I'm doing my best.

636
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:56,006
Mrs. Garrison, is there anything we can do?

637
00:48:56,093 --> 00:48:57,845
I just wanted to thank you.

638
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,804
The service is lovely.

639
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,925
I'm pleased you approve.

640
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:08,291
And I also want to apologize
for the way I behaved yesterday.

641
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:13,326
I was just...

642
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,964
I'm just so fucking angry.

643
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:22,451
He shouldn't have died.

644
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:24,644
He was still young.

645
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,527
We only had six years together.

646
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,051
Only six years.

647
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,084
It's more than some people have.

648
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:41,965
- It's not enough.
- I know.

649
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:45,684
I know, it's never enough.

650
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,688
I went to Cedar Grove.

651
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:59,129
The crypt next to Dwight and his wife's
was empty, so I bought it.

652
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:03,010
- Really?
- Yeah. I still want to be buried with him.

653
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:07,332
Or next to him, if that's all I can get.

654
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:09,926
That's lovely.

655
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:16,489
I don't want those bitches anywhere near
him, so I bought the one on the other side.

656
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:20,088
I'd like to come in on Monday
and make all the arrangements in advance...

657
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:21,925
you know, like he did.

658
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,243
Of course. Any time after 9:00.

659
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:26,168
Thank you.

660
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:34,568
Yes, I do have telemarketing experience.

661
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:36,962
Can you tell me where you're located?

662
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,612
I can't come this morning.
I have a previous appointment.

663
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,968
How about if I come around 2:30?

664
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:46,406
Okay. Thank you so much.
What's your name?

665
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:48,332
Thank you, Martha.

666
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:53,326
Hey, honey. You done? Thanks, baby.

667
00:50:53,413 --> 00:50:54,562
You did real good.

668
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:57,725
I'll take this to the doctor's office
on my way to my interview...

669
00:50:57,813 --> 00:51:00,373
and we'll need to do this
about twice a week, okay?

670
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:02,171
Okay. Am I sick?

671
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:06,127
No, of course not. You're not sick.

672
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:09,724
I just want to make sure
you don't get sick. Okay?

673
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:11,762
Okay.

674
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:15,606
You're such a good girl, you know that?

675
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:18,048
And Mama loves you very much.

676
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,324
I love you, too, Mama.

677
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:29,969
I thought you were working till midnight.

678
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,726
They switched my schedule around again.

679
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,483
What have you got in the bag?

680
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:40,325
These are just some things
I thought I'd keep over here, if that's okay.

681
00:51:41,613 --> 00:51:45,367
Prevacid. I have acid reflux.
I have to take it every night...

682
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:49,128
so I got an extra prescription filled
so I don't miss it when I stay over.

683
00:51:49,213 --> 00:51:51,408
That's my Night Guard...

684
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:54,364
so I don't grind my teeth.

685
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:58,132
Buckwheat pillow. It's hypoallergenic.

686
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:04,409
Earplugs for when you snore.

687
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:08,161
- Are you moving in?
- Of course not.

688
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,922
Because I don't remember
discussing you moving in.

689
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,732
I'm not moving in.
Jesus, are you paranoid or what?

690
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:16,885
'Cause living together,
I'm not sure we're ready for that.

691
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:21,012
Okay, it's just stuff, Keith.
I still have my own place.

692
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:28,092
- Would you like me to go there now?
- No, I made dinner.

693
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:30,727
<i>Oz</i> is on.

694
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:34,651
Does the term "mixed messages"
mean anything to you?

695
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:35,848
Come on.

696
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,009
I'm just fucking with you, fool.
I think you should move in.

697
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:44,366
- Really?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?

698
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:49,486
As long as you don't think you're bringing
any of that ugly-ass furniture with you.

699
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,001
What are you doing?

700
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:13,971
Just making a list
of things I have to do on Monday.

701
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:19,250
You were right about Billy.

702
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:22,564
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened. It's just...

703
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:26,689
He's just on this
completely different wavelength...

704
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:30,083
and it's not a wavelength
I want to be anywhere near.

705
00:53:31,493 --> 00:53:33,404
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

706
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,166
Good night.

707
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,446
Good night.

708
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,172
<i>You've got mail.</i>

709
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,961
English
