1
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,273
Dillon.

2
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:58,120
Hey, there, buddy.
What are you doing awake so late?

3
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,471
- Does he look okay to you?
- He's just fussing a little, is all.

4
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:05,354
He doesn't look a little funny?

5
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:09,396
Of course he looks a little funny.
That's his daddy's nose.

6
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,481
He's just a little sleepy.

7
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,881
There's my baby's smile.

8
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:27,154
Why don't you go back to bed?
I'll be in as soon as he falls asleep.

9
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,481
You sure?

10
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,237
It's all right. Go back to sleep.

11
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,598
Okay.

12
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,537
You're still here.

13
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:52,218
- What, no breakfast?
- I've got to go to work.

14
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,904
You were a lot nicer online.

15
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,894
Yeah, well, people aren't
always who they seem to be.

16
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,541
Tell me about it.

17
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,788
You need to leave.

18
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,543
Now.

19
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,019
Whatever.

20
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,265
See you in the chat rooms...

21
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,586
..."Jim."

22
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:45,463
Again.

23
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:46,825
Again.

24
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,311
Again!

25
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,707
Fucking bitch.

26
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,391
Morning, Mom.

27
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:39,965
Bren, Bren, if you're there, pick up,
It's Billy,

28
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,325
- Pick up the phone, Brenda,
- Fuck you.

29
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,996
Pick up the fucking phone, Please?

30
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,848
Fuck you.

31
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:56,480
Look, I need you, Bren,
Things are not good, I need you,

32
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,641
Brenda!
Goddamn it! Fuck!

33
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:03,046
Bitch,

34
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,684
Lovely way to wake up, huh?

35
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,966
Brenda, you're gonna have
to face him sometime.

36
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,813
Sometime, just not now.

37
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:16,609
Let's get major espressos,
take a walk on the beach.

38
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,693
Can't. I gotta get ready for my trip.

39
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:21,806
What trip?

40
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,405
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

41
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,450
The annual Western States
Funeral Directors Conference.

42
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:30,888
Was that today?
I thought that was months away.

43
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,407
No, just me and David
and 300 funeral directors...

44
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:36,497
...cutting loose in the city of sin.
- Why would you do that to yourself?

45
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,977
One: We get to attend helpful seminars
where we learn new tricks of the trade.

46
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,057
Two: We get to commiserate
with all the other sad fucks...

47
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,649
...who are being edged out by Kroehner.

48
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,377
Three: We have the perfect opportunity
to get in Matt Gilardi's face, tell him...

49
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,176
...we know Kroehner burned down
the house across the street.

50
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:57,292
The ongoing pissing contest.

51
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:01,736
That'll be good for you and David.
You'll have fun.

52
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:04,617
I don't know how much fun
he's gonna have. He's giving this...

53
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,817
...big speech about the future of
the independent funeral home.

54
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:12,099
David doesn't strike me as the
type of guy who gives speeches.

55
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,983
My dad was scheduled to do it.
Dave volunteered to fill in.

56
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:20,937
It's kind of a big deal for him.
He's pretty nervous about it.

57
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,537
- Call me from Vegas.
- I will.

58
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,779
Unless I'm flailing about in a pool
having sex with some showgirl.

59
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,458
I'll miss you.

60
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:38,029
Oh, fuck you!

61
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:42,986
I know this is an exceptionally
difficult time for you...

62
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:46,902
...but can you tell us what you
had in mind for your son's...

63
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,627
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:53,545
We're only here because the
hospital suggested we call you guys.

65
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:56,827
We're not even sure
what we're doing here.

66
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,425
He is a perfectly healthy baby.

67
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:04,113
Can I ask, what was the cause of...?

68
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,474
SIDS.

69
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:11,989
Yes, well, if you need to take some time
before we start making arrangements...

70
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,667
...that's completely understandable.
- The arrangements?

71
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,278
What arrangements?

72
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,433
For his funeral.

73
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,556
Funeral?

74
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,361
- He was only 3 weeks old.
- It might help...

75
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:30,111
...if you think of it less as a funeral and
more as a way of saying goodbye to him.

76
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:35,919
I don't want to say goodbye.
He just barely got here.

77
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:39,919
Of course it's difficult for anyone
to come to terms with something...

78
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:44,755
...as unexpected as this, but...
- It's not just difficult.

79
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,558
It's not even remotely possible.

80
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:54,166
Some babies are just
too good for this world.

81
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:58,800
We'll fix things so you can spend
as much time with him as you need.

82
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,922
- How old is he?
- Barely 3 weeks.

83
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,883
SIDS?

84
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,002
Yeah.

85
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:16,124
- Oh, Jesus.
- You should've been here for the intake.

86
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,448
The parents are practically
children themselves.

87
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:21,121
They didn't even know they were
supposed to have a funeral.

88
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,168
- Welcome back, Rico.
- Thanks, Nate.

89
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:29,129
- You're sure you're up to this?
- Yeah, yeah, it's no problem.

90
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,007
We'll only be gone till Sunday.

91
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:35,095
If you need anything, I can hop on a
plane and be back in an hour and a half.

92
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,686
I'll be fine.

93
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,178
I have some of your T-shirts here.
They're still warm.

94
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,371
Mom.

95
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,818
Oh, don't let me stop you.

96
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,822
You know, I probably should take
a couple of those T-shirts with me...

97
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:21,460
...to Las Vegas.

98
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,824
- David, I want to ask you something.
- I'm really kind of in a hurry here.

99
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:31,576
I just wanted to know...

100
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,181
- Are you...?
- Mom.

101
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,984
Can we talk about this
when I get back from Las Vegas?

102
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,260
Yes, of course.
That's a lovely idea.

103
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:49,385
We'll talk about it when you
get back from Las Vegas.

104
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,546
Mrs. Dimas?

105
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:54,902
It's Claire Fisher.

106
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,585
I'm sorry to keep calling,
I was just wondering if you've...

107
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:01,706
...heard anything from Gabe yet.

108
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:04,751
What?

109
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,227
When?

110
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:10,074
Oh, my God.

111
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,585
Is he okay?

112
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:16,471
What hospital?

113
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:20,874
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Dimas.
Thank you.

114
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:36,477
- You are late. 10 minutes.
- I know, I'm sorry.

115
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:41,711
Is okay. I just want you to know that
I notice these kinds of things.

116
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:44,801
It won't happen again, Nikolai.

117
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,722
We have to talk.

118
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:49,882
- It's about your work.
- I said I was sorry for being late.

119
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,758
No, no, no, has nothing
to do with being late.

120
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:58,363
Is about how you arrange the flowers.

121
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,204
- What?
- There have been complaints...

122
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:02,284
...from some of the customers.
- There have not.

123
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:07,198
- Afraid so.
- Ruth. You are not so good at arranging.

124
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,160
- I am too.
- No, you're not.

125
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:11,758
From now on, Robbie will
handle arrangement...

126
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:15,087
...and you will work the register
and help with the books.

127
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,201
I don't want to help with the books!

128
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,561
I helped my husband with
the books for 30 years.

129
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:23,446
I want to do flower arrangements. Tell
me what's wrong with my arrangements.

130
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:27,691
Not all arrangements
are for funerals, cupcake.

131
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:31,292
You think my arrangements
look funereal?

132
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:35,647
It's like Robbie said. There have been
a few complaints from some customers.

133
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,368
No. We done talking now.

134
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:42,325
Robbie will do the arrangement,
you will work on the register.

135
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:54,533
You gonna nail Gilardi for
the arson job in your speech?

136
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,377
- No.
- Why not?

137
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,855
Let's think.
Possible libel charges, maybe.

138
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,255
- Mind if I say something to him?
- Yes. Don't.

139
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,495
Pussy.

140
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,374
Nate, do we have any evidence
against him? No.

141
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:09,697
Apparently the police don't either.

142
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:13,178
Look, I don't want you picking
a fight with Gilardi.

143
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:16,898
Why not? You basically threatened
to kill him that one time.

144
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:23,493
- I'm coming with you.
- Great.

145
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:32,543
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:36,425
- I need to get out of here.
- All right.

147
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,061
- Oh, my God, is that a penis?
- Rico.

148
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:44,740
- I'm sorry. It is, isn't it?
- Your wife doesn't want me to say.

149
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:48,022
- The baby's okay, right?
- Baby's fine.

150
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:51,381
But you have mild to
moderate preeclampsia.

151
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,181
- What is preeclampsia?
- A $ 10 word for prenatal hypertension.

152
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,987
Your blood pressure is a little
higher than we'd like.

153
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:00,467
Could cause some problems
if it gets out of hand...

154
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,232
...but we're not gonna let that happen.
- What kind of problems?

155
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:07,221
Let's not even go there.
This baby's fine.

156
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:10,267
Worse comes to worst, we go in
a little early, we do a C-section.

157
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:14,192
We'll take a look at your labs, check
your blood pressure in a day or two...

158
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:20,392
...and see how we're doing then.
Until then, I want you on strict bed rest.

159
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:26,789
I really wouldn't worry about this.
The baby is fine.

160
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,636
If you came looking to collect more
money for Anthony's funeral...

161
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,035
...I'm all tapped out at the moment.

162
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,435
This one...

163
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,109
...shoots up too much speed and heroin.

164
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,119
Now I'm stuck paying
for this fancy-ass hotel room...

165
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:54,839
...to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while
they keep him under observation.

166
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm going out for coffee and smokes.

167
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:07,123
Speed and heroin?

168
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,557
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd try something different.

169
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:17,483
- Different like with a needle in your arm?
- Hey, what is this?!

170
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:21,284
Twenty fucking questions?
I've been through this already, all right?

171
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,639
With the doctors, with the police,
with my mom.

172
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:27,763
- Now I gotta put your mind at ease too?
- I'm sorry.

173
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,561
I would've been fine if you had just
minded your own fucking business.

174
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:35,128
Well, excuse me for giving a shit!

175
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,210
This wasn't an accident, was it?

176
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,531
I wish you would just
fucking leave already.

177
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,210
Fine. Here.

178
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:15,692
"The emerging role of funeral directors
in mass aviation disasters."

179
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,618
That sounds like fun.

180
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,937
Do you realize how many of these
seminars are sponsored by Kroehner?

181
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,620
Who's "Jasmine Brecker"?

182
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:27,736
She's either a federal judge or a
sex surrogate. I haven't decided yet.

183
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,855
- You got any matches?
- Sure.

184
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,497
Thank you.

185
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:36,902
Okay, boys. Let's mingle.

186
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,054
When in Rome.

187
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:46,698
I think maybe my expectations
of this trip were a little high.

188
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,667
Oh, great. Happy hour.

189
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,868
Well, well. The Fisher brothers.

190
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,822
You know, I wondered
if you'd even bother to show.

191
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,220
I understand you'll be speaking
tomorrow in place of your father.

192
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,422
What was your topic again?

193
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,628
The future of independent funeral homes.

194
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:12,427
Well, I'm certainly
looking forward to that.

195
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,906
I'd invite you boys to the Kroehner
party at the Luxor, but...

196
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:18,512
...it's only for affiliates.

197
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:21,103
Damn.
Because we'd really like to be there.

198
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:23,828
I'm sure you corporate lackeys
really know how to party.

199
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,866
Have fun with the other
dinosaurs, boys.

200
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:29,507
Oh, Matt, I have something for you.

201
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,184
This is a pack of matches.

202
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:33,988
This is for a can of lighter fluid.

203
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,789
Next time you need to unload some
cumbersome real estate, you'll be all set.

204
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:49,235
- Nate, that was not smart.
- I should've set his fucking hair on fire.

205
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,670
Bottoms up.

206
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:12,360
I love Las Vegas. It has to be
the most artificial place on earth.

207
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:17,594
- You think so? More than Disneyland?
- Oh, come on, more than Japan.

208
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,198
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,967
What are all these little cartoon
explosions all over their butts?

210
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,887
- They look like they're farting.
- Yeah. Look, coupons.

211
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:34,917
Hey, Dave, you wanna get some of that
famous Las Vegas $4.99 prime rib?

212
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:38,884
I have it on good authority it's just as
good as the $6.99 prime rib over there.

213
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,888
No, I think I'll just head up to my room...

214
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,127
...order some room service,
make an early night of it.

215
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,520
You sure?

216
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:47,531
Yeah, I should work
on my speech anyway.

217
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,810
Okay. Well, we'll see you in the morning.

218
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:54,369
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- Yeah, not likely.

219
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,212
I have two words for you:

220
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:59,531
- Lap. Dance.
- Yeah, who says I want a lap dance?

221
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:03,489
- Who says it's for you, baby?
- Kinky.

222
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:27,209
- I thought I told you to leave.
- I drove all the way out here to Barstow.

223
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,254
If you think I'm gonna turn around and
drive back, you're seriously whacked.

224
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,932
- This is like Bumfuck, Egypt out here.
- You spent the night?

225
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,656
Yeah, I slept in my car.

226
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:43,694
- My mom still here?
- No, she went out for more cigarettes.

227
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,696
Did you say anything to her about...?

228
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,016
No.

229
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,936
Are you gonna?

230
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,741
I haven't decided.

231
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,780
- You hungry?
- No.

232
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:05,821
I can't eat this hospital shit.
It all tastes the same.

233
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,144
Here.

234
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:10,865
I got you an Egg McMuffin because
I know they're your favorite.

235
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,581
How is it?

236
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,740
Fucking cold.

237
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:28,512
But good.

238
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:34,428
Thanks.

239
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:08,313
In this class, we're gonna be working
on freeform summer arrangements.

240
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:11,400
And if we have any time at the end
of class, I'm not promising...

241
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:14,322
...because I want us to get
to our breathing exercises...

242
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:19,075
...but if we have time, we might try
a spiky arrangement or two.

243
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:24,040
But first we're gonna start by doing
a little work treating our stems.

244
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:27,955
And we're gonna start by working
with our woody stems...

245
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:33,719
...because they can be a little on the
tricky side and require the most TLC.

246
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,645
Tough loving care.

247
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:40,601
Okay, let's start with an azalea,
one of my favorites.

248
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,445
Starting an inch or two
from the bottom of the stem...

249
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:47,369
...and if it's a thick stem,
we really have to smash them...

250
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,607
...we split the stem vertically.

251
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,928
Does anyone know why we do this?

252
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:58,127
Anyone? Yes.

253
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:01,531
- So it will draw more water?
- Very good.

254
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:05,726
Did everyone hear that?
So it will draw more water.

255
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:11,089
Okay. Does everyone have
their hammers? Let's begin.

256
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,257
You're supposed to be in bed.

257
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,609
I needed to get some turkey franks
and milk for Julio.

258
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,573
Why didn't you call me? I could've
stopped home on my way from work.

259
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,374
- He has a snack at 3:30.
- Why didn't you call your sister?

260
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,015
She just got two days
on a new Nicolas Cage movie.

261
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:43,975
She plays this hooker who witnesses
a murder, then gets raped and killed.

262
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:47,492
She's got lines and everything! She
wants me to come visit her on the set.

263
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:48,772
Well, you're supposed to be in bed.

264
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,543
I got bored and went to the market.
What's the big deal?

265
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,338
- What are you doing home anyway?
- I came home for lunch.

266
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:57,820
- I was worried.
- Rico, please. I'm fine.

267
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:59,856
I'm not just worried about you.

268
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,741
Okay.
This is about the baby at work.

269
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:08,736
I just...
I can't do it.

270
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:12,265
Of course you can.

271
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,420
He looks like...

272
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,665
Like he's sleeping.

273
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:24,067
Like a baby who's fallen asleep.

274
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,903
He was 3 weeks old.
There was nothing wrong with him.

275
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:33,588
And then, just like that...

276
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,987
...he dies.

277
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,101
For no reason.

278
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,506
How can that be?

279
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:46,391
How can the beginning and end
be so damn close together?

280
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,549
And now I've got this real bad feeling.

281
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:57,387
I haven't done a baby
since Julio was born.

282
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:59,986
David always does them.

283
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:07,676
- So make David do this one.
- David's in Vegas until tomorrow.

284
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,758
The viewing is this afternoon.

285
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:19,514
Some babies just aren't meant
for this world, Rico.

286
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,642
But this one is.

287
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,202
Turn to page seven
in your notebooks...

288
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:38,681
...we'll go step by step
through the most challenging...

289
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:43,324
...cranial facial reconstruction
I ever faced.

290
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:45,995
If we could go to
the next slide, please.

291
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,200
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus.

292
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,446
- That shit is fucked up.
- Nate, this is Chloe Yorkin.

293
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,722
The job Federico left us
to do for Kroehner?

294
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,206
Oh, God.
That is like fucking science fiction.

295
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,323
The first question my team
and I asked ourselves was not...

296
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:11,330
...as it might have been at a
facility with less resources...

297
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:15,367
...can we do this?
- They don't even credit Rico by name.

298
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:18,646
Oh, man, he's gonna be furious.

299
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,812
Oh, God.

300
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,166
Well, that is a very generous
offer, Roger...

301
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:32,211
...but unfortunately I am in a relationship
at the moment. If I was...

302
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,612
Deal me in.

303
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:38,687
Jesus, Billy.

304
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:41,936
Hold on. Hey!
So where's your boyfriend?

305
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:44,573
What are you doing here?

306
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,538
I love Vegas.
You know I love Vegas.

307
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,256
And sometimes when my sister isn't
there when I need her, I hop in my car...

308
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,850
...start driving, wind up here.
- Billy, you're lying.

309
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:55,530
I'm really not.
I just saw you at the blackjack table.

310
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:57,812
- It was a total coincidence.
- You're a fucking liar.

311
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:01,572
You're a selfish, manipulative,
narcissistic liar.

312
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:09,700
- What did Mom and Dad tell you?
- They told me that you made a bomb.

313
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:15,534
That's fucking hilarious.
So now I'm like, what, a terrorist?

314
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,862
"Billy Mc Veigh"?

315
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,938
They're fucking liars, Brenda!

316
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,106
They hate each other and they're
miserable and they're jealous of us...

317
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:27,583
...and they want us to hate
each other too. So they lie to us!

318
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:31,020
No, they lied to me, you lied to me. You
let me believe you tried to kill yourself.

319
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:32,378
Do you know how fucked that is?

320
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:34,899
You know what?
I was so fucking drugged up...

321
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,828
...I don't even really
remember what happened.

322
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,908
Dad showed me what you wrote.

323
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:46,268
I was kidding, okay?

324
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,672
It wasn't serious.

325
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:54,392
Do you have any idea
what I gave up for you?

326
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:57,712
Because I thought that if you tried
to kill yourself again and succeeded...

327
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,873
...I could tell myself that I did
everything I could to save you.

328
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,509
And you did.

329
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:06,628
- You've saved me every day since then.
- Well, fuck you!

330
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:09,874
- Brenda, don't fucking walk away...
- I'm having a life. Just back off!

331
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:12,353
Hey, you heard her! Now, fuck off!

332
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,635
Nice.

333
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,197
Are you okay?

334
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,601
He followed us here.

335
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:36,276
I hate to say it,
but I'm not entirely surprised.

336
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,119
Very nice.

337
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,121
Luscious.

338
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,005
This is a little...

339
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:25,566
...tight.

340
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:29,323
- Tight?
- You're not breathing right.

341
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,288
- I'm not?
- You're breathing from here...

342
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,089
...when you should be
breathing from here.

343
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,332
- But my lungs are here.
- Of course they are.

344
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,413
I'm speaking metaphorically.

345
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:42,973
If you breathe from up here, your
arrangements will come from up here.

346
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:47,808
If you breathe from down here, your
arrangements will come from down here.

347
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,578
- And that's good?
- That's very good.

348
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:52,531
- Do you do yoga?
- No.

349
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:55,971
Okay. Would everybody grab
a yoga mat in the next room?

350
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,857
We're gonna do some breathing
exercises before we break for dinner.

351
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,970
You're a bit of a control freak,
aren't you?

352
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:08,015
No, I'm not. I don't think I am.

353
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,541
- Am I?
- Yes.

354
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:12,576
And control freaks
do not make good arrangers.

355
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:15,503
Believe me, I know.
I used to be a control freak too.

356
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:18,412
But you know what?
You can get over it.

357
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,378
All you have to do is learn to breathe.

358
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:24,220
- Are you on antidepressants?
- No!

359
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,975
Well, Lord knows I'd be lost
without my Saint John's Wort.

360
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:35,467
There are countless challenges facing
independent funeral homes today:

361
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:39,548
Changing social attitudes
toward death and dying...

362
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:44,540
...economic hardship in communities
both large and small...

363
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:03,382
Oh, what the hell.

364
00:30:04,914 --> 00:30:08,464
We all know what the real challenge is.

365
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:13,874
How are you doing today, Mr. Gilardi?

366
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:17,628
- Fine, thank you.
- Glad to hear it.

367
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,911
We all know of a certain organization...

368
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:24,155
...that controls the flow
of prep-room supplies...

369
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:30,070
...caskets, cemetery property and
flowers to everyone in this room.

370
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,840
And believe me, that organization
will stoop to almost any means...

371
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,508
...to make sure that the independent
funeral home has no future.

372
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:37,074
But hear me out.

373
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:42,272
My father was in this business
for over 35 years.

374
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:44,120
He...

375
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:48,632
He thought it was okay to tell people
about a cheaper casket.

376
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:51,836
He didn't always try
to talk people out of cremation.

377
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:54,239
There were even times
where I actually heard him say:

378
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:56,754
"To hell with our profit margin on this."

379
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,166
These words are heresy
to a certain organization...

380
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:01,958
...because profit is all it cares about...

381
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:05,842
...no matter how many PR-motivated
seminars it sponsors.

382
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,197
That organization wants us
independents to believe...

383
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,797
...that we cannot afford to be
like my father anymore.

384
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:12,726
Well, I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

385
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:15,762
Don't get me wrong, my father
worried about the bottom line too...

386
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,437
...but he worried more
about other things.

387
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,561
Like comforting people...

388
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,125
...and helping them face profound loss.

389
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:31,370
Maybe now more than ever, we should
all try to be a little more like him.

390
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,812
Thank you.

391
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,379
- Very motivational.
- Good job.

392
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,013
How'd I do?

393
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,260
Are you kidding? You kicked
some serious ass, you big freak.

394
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:19,819
You didn't come home last night.

395
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:23,815
Well, it's not like it was a school night.

396
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,502
Would you like me to
make you something to eat?

397
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:30,139
Yeah, that'd be great.

398
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:39,984
Do you think I'm a control freak?

399
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,337
Yeah.

400
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:49,184
- Where do you think David gets it from?
- Your father was very controlling.

401
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:52,187
- Not like you.
- That's not nice.

402
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,658
You asked.

403
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,708
You're not as bad as you used to be.

404
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:04,789
May I ask where you were all night?

405
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,027
In Barstow.

406
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,349
What in God's name
were you doing there?

407
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,623
I was visiting a friend of mine
who's in the hospital.

408
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,665
Who?

409
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:17,702
Gabriel Dimas.

410
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:22,629
- The young man whose brother...
- Yeah.

411
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:27,510
What was he doing in the hospital?

412
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,996
He OD'd.

413
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:33,757
Good Lord.

414
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,715
Claire...

415
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,075
...he's obviously a deeply disturbed boy.

416
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,832
You need to steer clear of him.
Let his family deal with this.

417
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:50,954
Well, let's take stock
for a second, shall we?

418
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,921
His little brother's dead.
His father's dead.

419
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,074
His stepfather beat him up...

420
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:01,163
...his white-trash mother who smokes
like a fish could give a shit.

421
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:04,003
That leaves no one.

422
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:08,315
Was his overdose an accident?

423
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:12,041
- Of course it was an accident.
- Because sometimes these things aren't.

424
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:16,320
And if it wasn't, it could happen again.
There's an 80%/% chance that someone...

425
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:19,166
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

426
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,518
I hope, for his sake, you're right.

427
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,407
But if you're wrong, Claire...

428
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,079
I don't want you
getting too close to him.

429
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:40,205
- Thank you.
- No problem.

430
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,050
Look at him.

431
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:45,163
- He's a star.
- Hi. Really great.

432
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,606
I just want you guys to meet someone.

433
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:54,131
This is my brother and partner
Nathaniel Jr. And his...

434
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:58,328
- Jasmine.
- Hey, there, I'm Neil Schaeger.

435
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:00,572
- Schaeger and Sons, from Flagstaff.
- Raymond Dooley.

436
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:03,086
Dooley and Moss Funeral Home,
Reno, Nevada.

437
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:05,447
Moss couldn't be here. Bladder cancer.

438
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:07,934
That was a hell of a speech
David made.

439
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:11,130
Almost made me cry when those
Kroehner bastards got up and left.

440
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,014
Those fuckers have been trying
to buy us out for five goddamn years.

441
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,336
Your father was a good man.

442
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,735
Yes, he was.

443
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,619
Y'all don't mind if we drag your
little brother out with us, do you?

444
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,540
- I really shouldn't.
- Gotta let us buy you a drink at least.

445
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:26,733
- You're our hero.
- Well, maybe just a quick one.

446
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:29,251
Quick one, my Aunt Fanny.
We're gonna make a night of it.

447
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,340
Hey, you want to go with?
The more the merrier.

448
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:36,383
Oh, I don't think so.
We're just gonna lay low tonight.

449
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:41,579
- Yeah, but you guys have fun.
- Okay, your loss.

450
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:01,982
Excuse me.

451
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:05,749
We'd just like to thank you...

452
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,983
...very much.
- He looks so beautiful.

453
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,783
I'm glad you're pleased.

454
00:36:10,991 --> 00:36:13,107
Mike's mom and dad
drove down from Salinas.

455
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:17,988
Yeah. They never got
a chance to meet him.

456
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:21,788
Now it's almost like they did.

457
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:27,310
- Do you have children?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

458
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:33,273
I have a 4-year-old boy and my...

459
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:34,829
Yes.

460
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:43,149
We'd like to be alone with him
for a little while, if that's okay.

461
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,589
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Please take as much time as you need.

462
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:49,515
Thanks.

463
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:14,837
- Say fromage!
- Fromage.

464
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:20,519
Hey, you were really
great today, Nate.

465
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:23,798
Standing up to Billy.
I felt like some white-trash girl...

466
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,885
...whose boyfriend
was the biggest badass in town.

467
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:30,284
- Your brother's seriously ill, Brenda.
- Yeah, whatever.

468
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:34,959
But you know what?
We're in faux Paris, so let's party.

469
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:13,222
Hi.

470
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,902
- I'm Amber.
- David.

471
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,184
You're a lucky guy, David.

472
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,870
- I am?
- Very.

473
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:27,301
Your friend just bought you
a lap dance with me.

474
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:33,911
- Excuse me?
- So where you from, David?

475
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:38,827
- Boston.
- That is the coldest place I ever lived.

476
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,431
What part of town you live in?

477
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,505
Downtown.

478
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:57,190
Are you even enjoying this at all?

479
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:01,036
- Yeah, I'm loving it, why?
- Because...

480
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:03,629
...your dick isn't responding one bit.

481
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,397
Look, I'm gay. It's not you.

482
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:12,635
It never is me.

483
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:18,600
Well, if you're gay, you won't mind
if we cut this one short, will you?

484
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:26,001
What happened, buddy?
Popped your cork too soon?

485
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,515
He's gay, you idiots.

486
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:40,320
- I wish you would've told us that.
- Yeah, believe me, so do I.

487
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:44,605
Thanks for a lovely evening, fellas.

488
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:51,486
Great. Great, I'll meet you out front.
Thank you.

489
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,053
Hello, Brad.

490
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,948
Very nice.

491
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,034
- Jim.
- Brad?

492
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,235
Yeah.

493
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,277
You look...

494
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,041
...different from the ad.
- Well, that's from '91.

495
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:23,314
I've been meaning to update it.
I've just been...

496
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:27,310
- You know, busy.
- You're...

497
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,198
- Almost 20 minutes late.
- Previous appointment ran a little over.

498
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,964
What can I say, Brad's a busy boy.

499
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:36,802
- How much...?
- You're not a cop, right?

500
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:39,758
- No, I'm not a cop.
- Because if you are, that's entrapment.

501
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,637
I'm not a cop.

502
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,635
You are kind of cute.

503
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,997
Thank you.

504
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:54,197
$200 gets you a pony ride all
the way to the moon and back.

505
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,242
Up front.

506
00:43:57,129 --> 00:43:58,767
Now would be a good time.

507
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,319
- All I've got is 80.
- Fine, fine.

508
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,048
Fine.

509
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:18,888
- Where do you want to go, Jimbo?
- I don't know.

510
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:20,766
Where are you staying?

511
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:25,249
- I'm not taking you back to my room.
- Okay.

512
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,015
Don't wanna wake the wife, I get it.

513
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,172
Then...

514
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:32,407
Where do you want to do this?

515
00:44:36,017 --> 00:44:37,894
Oh, yeah.

516
00:44:38,097 --> 00:44:41,135
Oh, yeah. Good.

517
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:46,012
- Oh, yeah, Jimbo, give it to me.
- Yeah.

518
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:48,893
Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,649
- You like that, don't you, faggot?
- Oh, yeah.

520
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:01,337
Oh, no.

521
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:07,661
Okay, boys, party's over.

522
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:20,820
All right. When you're done there, Sally,
you're allowed one phone call.

523
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:08,466
Your stuff.

524
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,707
He's all yours.

525
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,111
Thanks.

526
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:26,276
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

527
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,276
Are you okay?

528
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,957
I'm fine.

529
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:37,280
You didn't think you'd get caught
doing something this fucked up?

530
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:39,155
- I wasn't thinking.
- Clearly.

531
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:46,004
Were you using condoms?

532
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:51,437
I was drunk. I was very drunk.

533
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,604
You're lucky I had a couple
connections with the Vegas P.D.

534
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:57,879
All the charges are being dropped
and your file's being tossed.

535
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:01,284
- Next time you won't be this lucky.
- Thank you for doing this.

536
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:05,003
David, I did this because I love you.
But I won't ever do it again.

537
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,800
This shit isn't good for either one of us.

538
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,409
You need to get yourself some help.

539
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,400
Goodbye, David.

540
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:46,290
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Something's not right with the baby.

541
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:49,170
What? Come on, let's go.

542
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:52,927
I'll call your sister, okay?
We'll leave Julio over at her house.

543
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,252
Hey, you.

544
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:08,532
Late night?

545
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:10,812
Not really.

546
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:14,333
We tried calling your room this morning,
you didn't seem to be in.

547
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,613
I must have been in the shower.

548
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:19,622
Did you have fun with the guys?

549
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:24,615
I suppose so.
From a purely anthropological standpoint.

550
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:27,703
- Do you mind driving?
- Okay.

551
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,216
Thank you.
Let's get the hell out of here.

552
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:37,022
I think somebody got lucky last night.

553
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,101
This is good, yeah.

554
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:57,544
- You have been practicing.
- Practicing?

555
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,903
- I am a graduate.
- Cool.

556
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:06,710
Learning Annex. Wow! I hear
that school's really hard to get into.

557
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,189
Robbie, go take care of customer.

558
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:12,705
Today Ruth is going
to do all the arrangement.

559
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:15,714
Nikolai, get your head out
of your pants for two seconds.

560
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:17,110
That diploma means nothing.

561
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:19,955
It just means she's plunked down
a couple hundred dollars.

562
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:22,876
Have you got diploma
from flower class?

563
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:27,276
I have been arranging professionally
for almost 20 years.

564
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:31,995
Good. Today Ruth does arrangement.

565
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:54,674
Where's your mom?

566
00:49:55,964 --> 00:50:00,117
She drove home today
because she had to go into work.

567
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:04,761
They said I might be getting out
of here this afternoon, though.

568
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,842
What are you...?

569
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,845
I love you.

570
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:34,206
I love you too.

571
00:50:42,574 --> 00:50:45,930
There's an adorable shot of you.

572
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,730
There's like three of you
with that cowboy-hat guy.

573
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:52,485
Oh, yeah?
By the way, I slept with him.

574
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:54,015
Was that wrong?

575
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:56,731
Oh, man. You took one of me
in the shower? Come on.

576
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:59,929
You looked so cute, I had to.

577
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:05,937
What?

578
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:09,051
Come on, it can't be that bad.

579
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:23,177
Oh, fuck.

580
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:26,181
Oh, fuck, Billy!

581
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,932
Oh, shit.

582
00:51:45,547 --> 00:51:48,107
Vitals are good.

583
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,185
Okay, we're almost there.

584
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:52,948
- How we doing, Mrs. Diaz?
- Fine.

585
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:54,867
- Almost got him.
- Him?

586
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:58,142
That's right. I hate to spoil the surprise,
but you have another son.

587
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,787
It's a boy, baby. Did you hear that?
I knew it was gonna be a boy.

588
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,743
Shut up.

589
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:09,024
Heart rate's dropping.
Okay, let's get him out.

590
00:52:09,232 --> 00:52:10,824
Pull the catheter.

591
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:12,182
Here you go.

592
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:16,427
- Is the cord compressed?
- Yes. Clamp.

593
00:52:19,754 --> 00:52:23,384
Breathe. Come on.

594
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:25,068
- Okay.
- Suction.

595
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:34,113
- Get the table ready.
- Where are they taking him?

596
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,390
Just to heat him up a little.
Have you picked out a name yet?

597
00:52:39,118 --> 00:52:43,431
Augusto, after my father. Wait,
is there something wrong with my baby?

598
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:47,428
We're just gonna warm him up,
make sure his airways are clear.

599
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:02,433
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's gonna be just fine.

600
00:53:02,643 --> 00:53:05,317
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

601
00:53:05,524 --> 00:53:09,564
- You swear on a stack of Bibles?
- Okay, Augusto.

602
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:11,244
Time to meet the parents.

603
00:53:18,086 --> 00:53:20,840
Hello, Augusto.

604
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:25,437
He looks just like Julio.

605
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,561
- He is so pissed off.
- Can I grab him?

606
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:33,767
Okay. Here we go.

607
00:53:51,225 --> 00:54:45,780
