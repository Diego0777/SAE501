1
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,872
<i>... following Wall Street's sharp rebound...</i>

2
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:19,350
<i>and boosted by a renewed hope</i>
<i>in a government plan...</i>

3
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,160
<i>to lift the banking sector</i>
<i>out of its doldrums.</i>

4
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,239
<i>In currency trade...</i>

5
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,599
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

6
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:34,036
<i>Me and my buddy,</i>
<i>we just moved in next door.</i>

7
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,476
<i>We were wondering who lives here.</i>

8
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,832
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>I was just about to get in the shower.</i>

9
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,875
<i>Come on in, I'll be out in a moment.</i>

10
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:44,910
<i>Nice.</i>

11
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,119
<i>- She's hot.</i>
<i>- Yeah, you're telling me.</i>

12
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,959
<i>I thought I told you guys</i>
<i>to wait in the other room.</i>

13
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,315
<i>We thought you might</i>
<i>need some help getting clean.</i>

14
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,912
<i>This is so cool.</i>

15
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,392
<i>- Yeah, you like this, don't you?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

16
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,798
<i>Let's move over here.</i>

17
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,874
<i>You're a nasty girl, aren't you?</i>

18
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,232
<i>You guys are the best neighbors I ever had.</i>

19
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,828
David.

20
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,077
You're all wet.

21
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,718
Were you crying?

22
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,478
No, it was raining.

23
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,996
And, yes, I was crying.

24
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,558
I love you.

25
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,995
<i>We get just about all the minerals</i>
<i>and vitamins that bones need...</i>

26
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,797
<i>from things like sunshine.</i>

27
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,111
Didn't I ask you to clean up after yourself?

28
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,717
Why did you ask for an omelet
if you weren't hungry?

29
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,393
I was, but now my tummy hurts.

30
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,871
Again? Girl, you better eat some breakfast.

31
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,272
Maybe I'm full.

32
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,710
Eat half of it and you can watch MTV...

33
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,313
or don't eat and go to school hungry,
it's your choice.

34
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,276
That's good, bribe her.

35
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,310
Did I ask for your input?

36
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,430
- I gotta go.
- Go.

37
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,795
Your car is blocking me in.

38
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,474
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,314
What's wrong with me?
I'm taking care of Taylor...

40
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,550
I don't know where her mother is,
I haven't slept in two months...

41
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,278
since I shot and killed that man.
I'm sick of your shit.

42
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,793
I'm sick and tired of you
taking it all out on me.

43
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,188
This is way more than I signed on for.

44
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,955
I've got an idea. Find what's yours,
and take it when you leave.

45
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,473
Then I'll never have to
look at your ass again.

46
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,198
I have a better idea. I'll go right now.

47
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,352
If you find any of my stuff,
you can shove it up your tight white ass.

48
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,354
Who the hell you think you're talking to?
I know you didn't call my ass white.

49
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,673
My tummy hurts.

50
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,115
The answer is no, I'm sorry.

51
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,472
It's not like it's some stranger.
It's your sister.

52
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,228
It's not like it's Kabul. It's Topanga,
it's not even an hour from here.

53
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,674
You heard what was done to Nate.

54
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,193
I don't think anything was done to him.

55
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,952
In case you haven't hung out
with any 15-year-old guys...

56
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,791
they're like total hornswogglers.

57
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,268
It was a much more innocent time.

58
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,758
What, the '80s?

59
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,875
Your brother
was a much more innocent boy...

60
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,950
to say nothing of what happened to David.

61
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,394
He hiked three miles
down the canyon in pitch dark...

62
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,958
to get away from those people.

63
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,031
He cut his ear on a bramble.
The answer is no.

64
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,832
Have you thought at all about scaffolding?

65
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,035
When your house is falling apart,
you build scaffolding...

66
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,314
to support you
while you are doing the work.

67
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,357
And I think a great way
to build scaffolding...

68
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,988
is to revisit old experiences
but try them a new way.

69
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,631
So I'm going out there after school today...

70
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,791
and spend the weekend
and be back on Sunday.

71
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,716
<i>I haven't even told Justin yet.</i>

72
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,553
He doesn't know his father's dead.

73
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,395
Jewish tradition says
we have to bury him tomorrow.

74
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,311
You have had Jewish funerals
here before, right?

75
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,714
Of course.

76
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:31,190
We decided not to do this in our temple
because of the way Jeffrey died.

77
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:38,113
Jess, if you want,
I can do this with Jeffrey's mother.

78
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,156
Fuck it, I can do it.

79
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,830
What do you need to know?

80
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,553
He killed himself for no reason...

81
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,437
while I was at goddamn Gymboree
with Tess.

82
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,512
Tess is four.

83
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,071
While I was with her, my husband,
Jeffrey Shapiro...

84
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,392
who worked for the third best law firm
in LA...

85
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:04,596
and was three months away
from making partner...

86
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,551
He came home...

87
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,873
on his lunch break and he hung himself...

88
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,191
with his pants around his ankles
in our goddamn sunroom.

89
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,308
There's your fucking eulogy.
Can you say that in Hebrew?

90
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,797
So you'll be conducting the service, Rabbi?

91
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,030
I love my new place.
You have to come see it.

92
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,478
It's a condo, but it's like a hotel, too.

93
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,948
It's got a concierge and a bidet.

94
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,793
Get me one of those jumbo beers
on the side as well.

95
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,268
- I'll share it with her.
- Get your own.

96
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,031
Make it two, thanks.

97
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,149
To living alone, finally.

98
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,354
To bidets.

99
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,397
And to starting over, with us, sweetheart.

100
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:08,237
I think I was under much more
emotional pressure than I ever realized.

101
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,829
And I'm actually so sorry
for those awful things I said to you.

102
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,238
Thank you.

103
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,590
Aren't you sorry for hitting me?

104
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,670
Yes, that was insane of me, but...

105
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,148
No buts, Brenda. Just be sorry.

106
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,233
I know it was probably my fault,
but I don't want to know why.

107
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,431
So, now the headline.

108
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,315
That whore has moved in with your father.

109
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,627
Dad's seeing a whore?

110
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,074
The Whore of Tranquility Spa, Brenda.

111
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,832
Has your father said anything
to you about her?

112
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,194
What's in it for her, money?

113
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,794
I know she's not in it for sex.

114
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,677
Your father's not what he used to be
after years of Paxil...

115
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,829
Okay, that'll be fine, Mom.

116
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,994
All right, then. Let's talk about you.

117
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,753
You sure you want to lose
the focus just yet?

118
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,433
Come on now, what's up in your world?

119
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,550
Nate and I are getting married.

120
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:18,468
Is he smart enough for you?
Does he have what it takes, up here?

121
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,633
Like you? Like me?

122
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,795
No, Mom, he's not like us.

123
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,708
He doesn't think so hard he wants
to put a staple gun to his forehead.

124
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,154
I get it. He's uncomplicated.

125
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,558
I've been with a man or three like that.

126
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,076
But Bern always had me because I knew
he was much smarter than I am.

127
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,229
That's why it's still so hot with us,
all these years later.

128
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,912
And we're back.

129
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,790
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,949
So, how did he propose?

131
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,153
I asked him.

132
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,712
You didn't.

133
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,391
Yeah, I know, it's really funny.

134
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:06,916
It's almost as funny as the notion of you
trying to build a life on your own.

135
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,671
I don't see how he could kill himself
when he's got three kids.

136
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,717
- I don't think he meant to.
- He hung himself.

137
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,991
I talked to the Quincy down at the morgue...

138
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:27,312
and he says that the cops said
there was a porno playing in the VCR.

139
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,914
- And they found a bottle of Astroglide.
- What's Astroglide?

140
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,667
It's lube. Lubrication. For sex.

141
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,269
- Thank you, David.
- No problemo.

142
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,994
Wait a minute, I know about this.
He was doing autoerotic asphyxiation...

143
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,195
- like the guy in that band?
- You got it.

144
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,554
See, you cut off the air supply...

145
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,437
and that heightens the stimulation
in the ensuing orgasm.

146
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,068
Here's the giveaway:
They found a lemon wedge on the floor.

147
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,154
You keep the lemon in your mouth...

148
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,514
and at the moment of climax...

149
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,875
you bite down on it to wake you up,
so you don't die.

150
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:08,796
See, the lemon was lying
on the floor, untouched.

151
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:19,311
I'm calling to let you know
that Eddie and I broke up.

152
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,075
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

153
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,877
I broke it off with him.

154
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,992
All right, then.

155
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,951
Thank you for telling me,
I'm going to go now.

156
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,712
So, there's this part in my book...

157
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,269
where the main character
meets a high-class hooker.

158
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,475
Is this fiction, or nonfiction?

159
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,868
It's still kind of working itself out.

160
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,678
There's definitely someone based on you.

161
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,513
- Part of her is you.
- Excellent.

162
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,755
As long as she doesn't get raped
and murdered to pay for her sins.

163
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,148
I'm so sick of that tired old story.

164
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,594
She's way beyond conventional morality.

165
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,550
I can't wait to read it.

166
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,359
I jerked off a client the other day.

167
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,351
- I didn't know you did release.
- No, I don't.

168
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,350
He didn't ask me to.

169
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,353
So, I'm sure you can imagine
sometimes the guy gets a hard-on.

170
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,517
Normally I just ignore it.

171
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,908
So what, was this guy
just exceptionally hot?

172
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,637
No, not even.

173
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,114
So I'm giving the guy a massage...

174
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,236
he flips over, there's this hard-on.

175
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,034
It was kind of huge, but you'd never guess
by looking at the guy.

176
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,395
I could tell that he wanted me to touch it.

177
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,157
I thought, well, I would be crossing a line.

178
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,952
And then I did.

179
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,636
I crossed a line.

180
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,671
You are hilarious.

181
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,472
I mean, what is that?
Am I trying to be you or something?

182
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,073
I don't know. How'd you feel afterwards?

183
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,190
I was weirdly kind of inspired.
I wrote this really cool chapter about it.

184
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,913
- As long as it's all for your art.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,157
Aunt Sarah, hi!

186
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,989
Baby, is everything okay?

187
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,028
I thought we said
a "probably-maybe" about next weekend.

188
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,149
But this weekend is fine, it's just fine.

189
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,749
I thought it was this weekend.

190
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,678
I'm totally cool to go home
and come back whenever.

191
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,954
You're here, and you're mine.

192
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,629
I have to believe the universe sent you.

193
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,949
It's our annual <i>Howl</i> weekend.

194
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,394
- Allen Ginsburg <i>Howl?</i>
- Yes.

195
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,119
So you're down. Wonderful.

196
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,955
He was a dear friend.

197
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,594
We once shared a flat in Berlin...

198
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,955
until I got fed up with
the parade of Aryan starfucker boys.

199
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,513
I'm going to summon
his energy this weekend.

200
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,232
I'm expecting some visitors.
A wonderful poet named Basil...

201
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:01,394
and the painter Fiona Kleinschmidt,
have you heard of her?

202
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,991
A couple of freaks and some nasty hippies
from my druggie days.

203
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,797
It's going to be a riot.

204
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,835
Sure you don't want me to come back later?

205
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,558
Wouldn't hear of it.
I'll show you to your sleeping nook.

206
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,231
I love that bag.

207
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,154
- Why did you do that to me?
<i>- Do what?</i>

208
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,434
That. Just calling me and telling me that.

209
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,631
Hold on a second.

210
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,551
Mom, I'm on the phone.

211
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,199
Are you going to have supper?
I'm making pork chops.

212
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,077
No, Mom, I won't be having dinner with you.

213
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,077
Sorry. What do you want?

214
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,633
You called me.

215
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,352
I was calling to find out why you called me
to tell me you guys broke up.

216
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,748
You're my friend.

217
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,228
I thought you'd want to know
what happens in my life.

218
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,868
A month ago you didn't think
we should see each other anymore.

219
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,592
Things change.

220
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,876
Just what exactly is your agenda?

221
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,553
- I don't have an agenda, okay?
- Yeah, right.

222
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,270
- Wonderful.
<i>- Great.</i>

223
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:05,071
Thank you for sharing.

224
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,075
Shut up, just keep it shut.

225
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,432
I was just eating.

226
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,035
I spent most of the '90s thinking
that stripping was goddess work...

227
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,476
but I've come around to my original position
which is that it's just plain cheap.

228
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,276
I've always been astonished
at some of that pole work.

229
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:33,432
I once saw this woman, she could
hang upside down from 20 feet in the air.

230
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,314
She looked like an inverted Jesus.

231
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,791
It's the PVC boots.
They make your legs stick to the metal.

232
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,073
No way.

233
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,753
I would totally take my clothes off
on stage...

234
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,434
at least once, if I didn't harbor
a vague feeling of hatred about my body.

235
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,987
You're crazy, you have a beautiful body.

236
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,478
Thank you.

237
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,998
That's Nate.
Listen, the whole prostitute thing...

238
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,274
- he wouldn't be into it.
- Whatever.

239
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,232
- Hey.
- Hi.

240
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,348
Oh, God.

241
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,351
Where'd you get the hummus?

242
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,748
Sorry, incredibly rude and hungry.

243
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,432
This is Nate, my fiancé.

244
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,791
This is my friend, Melissa.

245
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,789
Cool. Where'd you guys meet?

246
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,869
Melissa's a client of mine.

247
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,112
So does Brenda
have all your auras aligned?

248
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,078
Chakras. Did you note the tone of mocking?

249
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,876
Have you guys ever heard
of autoerotic asphyxiation?

250
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,871
Cutting off your air supply
so you can come harder? Sure.

251
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:45,077
There's a name for it in
the fetish community. It's called breath play.

252
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,118
I read a thing.

253
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,996
We have this guy who died of it...

254
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,798
and it's weird
because it's definitely suicide...

255
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,189
but is it accidental suicide
or just plain old suicide?

256
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,267
He was indulging in something
he knew could kill him...

257
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,318
but even if it's accidental
it's still sort of on purpose, right?

258
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,230
What do you mean, "this guy we have"?

259
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,038
- Nate's an undertaker.
- Funeral director.

260
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,598
Did you note the tone of mocking in that?

261
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,555
Don't tell me you're a couple
that likes to bicker in front of others...

262
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:20,234
until it gets uncomfortable
and I have to leave and you guys fuck?

263
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,428
No.

264
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,278
No, not us.

265
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,228
Okay, you want to know my agenda?

266
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,432
My agenda is to
take you to dinner tomorrow night.

267
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,678
You there?

268
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,754
If I say yes, what am I agreeing to?

269
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,714
You and me having dinner,
maybe a little conversation, that's all.

270
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,428
Dinner?

271
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,757
We could make a plan,
but it seems a little soon after...

272
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,989
Would you just shut up and say yes?

273
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,388
Yes, I would like to have dinner
with you tomorrow night.

274
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,967
- How you doing, baby?
- Good.

275
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:42,455
How are you?

276
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:44,925
Be careful, Snoopy has an ear infection.

277
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:47,412
I brought tomatoes from my garden.

278
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:52,206
But I'm making the sauce, right?
Do you have fresh pasta or do I make some?

279
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:55,005
The Napa contingent can't make it.

280
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:58,247
Fernando's doing community service, again.

281
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,249
Who are you?

282
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,535
This is Claire, Ruth's daughter.

283
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,412
I didn't know Ruth had a daughter.

284
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:12,613
If I remember correctly,
you certainly knew she had a son.

285
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,095
- How is Ruth?
- How is Nathaniel?

286
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:27,090
My mom's great.
My dad is not so great. He's dead.

287
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:31,365
Shame. Hell of a guy, your dad.

288
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:35,204
So funny, fucking wicked.

289
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,769
I can still see him sitting here
at this counter...

290
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:43,815
hunched over his little rolling machine.
He used a rolling machine.

291
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:54,371
I'm gonna have my cell phone on,
in case you need to call me or anything.

292
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:56,014
Okay, have a good one.

293
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:59,611
- You want another cup of coffee?
- Lf you make it, I'll drink it.

294
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:02,415
Be really careful
when you're taking down this plastic...

295
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,214
'cause of Julio's allergies.

296
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:07,254
- There's tons of dust all through here.
- Okay, I got it.

297
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,894
We know, honey.

298
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:12,726
I'm going to make some breakfast. Hungry?

299
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:14,454
That sounds good.

300
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:19,132
I moved your circular saw to the porch.

301
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,571
I know, man, I got it. It's cool.

302
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,565
Honey...

303
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:28,085
listen, if it gets too loud in here...

304
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,849
you can take the kids to the park.
You don't have to stay.

305
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,291
Okay, baby, I got it. Have a good day.

306
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,405
Okay.

307
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,927
Julio, turn that TV down.

308
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:54,368
There's a spray cleaner
that's much more earth friendly.

309
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:55,969
Maybe I'll order it.

310
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:58,092
Oh, god damn it!

311
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,732
Or we can keep using this.

312
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,966
I don't talking to you!

313
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,809
Are you mad at us?

314
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:07,932
Why the grumps, Mr. Cranky Pants?

315
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:10,649
Someone's in a real snoot.

316
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:13,967
- I don't think he's feeling well.
- I feeling fine.

317
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:18,765
I can't come to your house
for dinner tonight. I have other obligation.

318
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:22,612
We planned this three days ago.
I bought aubergines.

319
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:27,334
I can't. Stop with all the question, okay?

320
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,649
I'm not asking you questions.
I haven't asked you any questions.

321
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,375
So, tell...

322
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:36,128
what do you do with aubergines?

323
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:38,127
It's a Greek thing, it's like a...

324
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,128
It's like a lasagna.

325
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:01,893
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

326
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,769
Nothing would please me more, muffin.

327
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,648
Star sighting. I think I just saw
that Jewish "Friend" in there.

328
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,806
- What, Jennifer Aniston?
- The guy.

329
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:22,410
- Ross.
- Right. I'll be back in a couple hours.

330
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:24,885
- Hey, did you forget to shave?
- I was running late.

331
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,011
Really?

332
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:29,529
I'll thank you not to discuss
my facial hair any further.

333
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,686
Come here, let me check it out. Come on.

334
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:37,808
- What time's your date?
- Who said I have a date?

335
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:41,134
Tonight. Dinner.

336
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,534
It's a little soon.

337
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:46,495
The whole Oops-l-didn't-know-l-was-sexy
stubble look...

338
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:49,044
will peak at around noon tomorrow.

339
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:52,604
Believe me, I've perfected the art.

340
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,369
Can you make it drinks after dinner?
You'll have more time.

341
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,732
- I can't discuss this now. I'm going out.
- Clothes shopping?

342
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,773
- No.
- Stay out of Structure.

343
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,972
Augusto's got a little cold...

344
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:12,689
so I'm gonna head home
and give Vanessa a little break.

345
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,414
Okay, that's cool.

346
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,167
I'll be right here, then.

347
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,288
You may be seated.

348
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:32,525
We are here today to mourn the loss
of Jeffrey Marc Shapiro.

349
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:36,452
Talmud says, "Better is one day in this life...

350
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:40,254
"than all eternity in the world to come."

351
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,930
"And if they ask, you answer

352
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:50,052
"Damn the high-walled guard towers
of right and left

353
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:55,566
"Coast to coast, now, here upon a time

354
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:59,056
"where leaf shines, shimmers

355
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,767
"tokes to toasts

356
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:06,251
"Fear forever, nevermore"

357
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:11,295
And there you have it,
the crap of the moment!

358
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:13,135
It's not crap.

359
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,169
Look what just arrived.

360
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:16,405
Hi, Jill!

361
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:20,774
Hey, magic mushrooms, special delivery.

362
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,335
Throw them in the sauce.

363
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:26,170
No, no, sauté them first.
You guys, sauté them first!

364
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:30,335
Hey, do you have any of that THC butter
in the freezer from last year?

365
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,205
Hey!

366
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,285
Fuck!

367
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:10,775
What the fuck?

368
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,488
What the fuck is going on in here?

369
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,567
Just get out of here, man. Give me a sec.

370
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:16,975
Get out of here?

371
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:20,253
This is my fucking house,
you fucking homo!

372
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,531
It's nothing. Just chill, Rico. Damn!

373
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:26,973
Are you out of your fucking mind?
My kids could have seen that! Vanessa!

374
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:28,894
She took the kids to the park.

375
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:32,764
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you out of your fucking homo mind?

376
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:37,168
Get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck is wrong with you, Ramon?

377
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:39,212
Do you have anything to fucking say?

378
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:43,369
No, I'm just going to get out of here
until you calm the hell down, okay?

379
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,525
Damn!

380
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:47,695
What the fuck?

381
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,693
What the fucking fuck?

382
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:57,206
- Rabbi?
- You can call me Ari.

383
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,409
I need to ask you a few questions.

384
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:04,970
As a funeral director, I want to ask
about death from a Jewish point of view.

385
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:09,254
Sure. But I warn you, Jews tend
to answer questions with more questions.

386
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:11,930
- I'll give you my card.
- I mean now.

387
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,131
We're going straight to the cemetery.

388
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,567
You could drive with me.

389
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:27,729
I'm coming.

390
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:36,206
- Mother.
- Baby.

391
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:42,533
I got this for you. It doesn't need
watering or caring about in any way.

392
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:48,846
So, Brenda, I had this vision
of your wedding at the Hollyhock House.

393
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,852
They're wonderful
as long as you bring in your own caterer.

394
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:55,769
Loulou Smigel's daughter
had her wedding there.

395
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,610
Well, actually, I was thinking of somewhere
more beautiful and natural.

396
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:02,129
Oh, God!

397
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,725
What?

398
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,572
You know, your father and I got married
on the beach...

399
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,810
and we ran in the surf afterwards.

400
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:16,686
Yeah, I know.
You were barefoot, he wore clogs.

401
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,015
I think you're going to have to leave.

402
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:30,486
I've just got so much coming up right now...

403
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:34,847
and I need to go in my room
and sob for an hour.

404
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:41,451
Look, I could stay.
I'll massage your shoulders.

405
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:44,648
No, that...

406
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:48,694
It doesn't help me right now
that you're here.

407
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,735
Sure I can't make you
a cup of tea or something?

408
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:56,853
I'm sure. And, Brenda...

409
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,654
please don't tell your father
that you saw me cry.

410
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,932
Mom, come on, let me help.

411
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:07,895
I'm not Billy.
If you want to help me, just leave.

412
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,250
Okay.

413
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,845
Every time I get a headache,
I'm thinking this could be it.

414
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:38,287
You must be really scared.

415
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:40,253
Yeah, I'm going to die.

416
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:42,169
Yeah, me, too.

417
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:45,610
- Really, what do you have?
- A body.

418
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,974
Okay. Yeah, we're all going to die...

419
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:02,446
and maybe I'm going to die
before everyone else, maybe not.

420
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:08,645
So what's the Jewish answer
to what I'm supposed to do now?

421
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:13,164
I don't know what the Jewish answer is.
I know what I try to do.

422
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:16,134
I try to live my life...

423
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:19,210
every day in a way that honors God.

424
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,844
I don't even know if I believe in God.

425
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:29,452
Maybe it's time to find Him.

426
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,124
- Maybe God's a woman.
- Maybe.

427
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:38,128
There he is now.

428
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,375
Jeffrey Shapiro.

429
00:34:47,256 --> 00:34:49,292
I'll wait here by the car.

430
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:51,931
Come and watch him be buried.

431
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:56,775
Jeffrey can't repay you,
so it's considered a great mitzvah.

432
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,969
Kindness, love, for its own sake.

433
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,932
Some people call that God.

434
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:13,772
What I'm saying is, yes, definitely,
forgive your mother and father.

435
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:17,326
I mean, we've all heard that before,
but what's become clear...

436
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:22,012
is that my family of origin
never really lived in a house.

437
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:25,611
They lived in this tent city, psychologically.

438
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:30,646
It's no wonder that my own house never felt
remotely like it was built on solid ground...

439
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,966
<i>Shut up. Shut the mouth.</i>

440
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:37,447
It was built on this quicksand
of emotional incest...

441
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,686
- if there is such a thing...
<i>- Shutting it now.</i>

442
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,495
<i>Shutting it and stopping it.</i>

443
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:46,012
But The Plan would call that
"old blueprinting"...

444
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:49,486
<i>If you say another word,</i>
<i>I will stab you in the heart with a fork.</i>

445
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:50,895
...that's about the size of it.

446
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:54,685
<i>If there is a God in heaven,</i>
<i>He will surely shut your mouth.</i>

447
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:56,892
You never stop renovating.

448
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,929
Robbie, I have to tell you something now.

449
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:05,329
I do believe I've learned everything
I needed to learn from The Plan...

450
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:09,690
and I no longer feel the urge
to speak in building metaphors...

451
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:13,407
or talk about myself or my feelings
in this way...

452
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:16,049
any longer.

453
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:58,128
I don't know what kind of power trip
you're on, but it seems cruel, to be honest.

454
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,650
Oh, God, Keith, you poor thing.

455
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:10,414
- You mind checking on her one more time?
- Sure.

456
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,090
- Hi.
- Hey.

457
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,976
- How is she?
- She's in surgery right now.

458
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:21,015
I guess her appendix was huge,
but they got it before it burst...

459
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:25,453
and she's going to be fine. I'm just waiting.
It's been an hour and a half.

460
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:30,489
She kept telling me
her stomach was hurting...

461
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:33,010
and I thought it was some kind of game.

462
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,486
You can't be perfect all the time, Keith.

463
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,648
That's what life's about:
Striving for perfection.

464
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:44,408
And when that fails,
accepting ourselves for being imperfect.

465
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,009
Not in my book.

466
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:54,009
- God, you are so self-righteous sometimes.
- Yeah, and you are a doormat.

467
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,895
Do I really come off as being a doormat?

468
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,295
- How is she?
- Great.

469
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:08,015
It went very smoothly. She's in recovery.

470
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:10,727
Good. When can I see her?

471
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,408
You can wait for her in her room.

472
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:15,568
When she comes out of her anesthesia,
she might be a little weepy.

473
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,374
Don't let it concern you.

474
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,125
Thank you.

475
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,408
- Oh, God, don't let her come over here.
- No, it's too late.

476
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,647
Beat these gourds!

477
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,768
No spectators!

478
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:31,650
Oh, my God, is there a lock on this thing?

479
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,086
They use this place as a meditation hut...

480
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:39,885
but it's been my safe-house
more times than I care to remember.

481
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:42,888
What fucking freaks.

482
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:46,729
Yeah, at least two of them
aren't your parents.

483
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:52,134
I'm their designated driver... every year.

484
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,210
Sorry.

485
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,331
It's better than getting a call
from the sheriff...

486
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,408
saying your parents are laying in the bottom
of Topanga Canyon...

487
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,964
and would I like a ride in a helicopter.

488
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,847
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Why not?

489
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:23,252
Because, you know, like...

490
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:26,888
people are having, like,
end-of-the-world sex...

491
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:31,293
and just, I didn't bring condoms...

492
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:33,733
Like I would even anyway.

493
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,335
Yeah, right.

494
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,125
No.

495
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,965
No. I mean, you're quite the fox,
I'm happy to report...

496
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:46,605
but, like, I would never just
hook up with somebody I just met.

497
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,015
Like, ever.

498
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,775
Seriously?

499
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,055
Seriously.

500
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:58,774
I get it. You're just trying
to let me get my guard down...

501
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,051
and then, all of a sudden, we're hooking up.

502
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:02,285
Wrong.

503
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:07,374
I'm 19, okay, Claire?
I've had the major life experience to know...

504
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:13,166
it kind of sucks to enter the body of another
human being you're not in love with.

505
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:20,735
Okay, what are you, like, straight-edge,
or all Jesusy or just gay?

506
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,245
None of those things, okay? Forget it.

507
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,091
Just lay down here with me.

508
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:30,251
We won't have sex.
That's all you have to know.

509
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:33,089
Whatever. Who said I even wanted you to?

510
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:38,936
I promise you, you're gonna be fine.

511
00:41:39,616 --> 00:41:43,245
This is all going to be over soon,
and we'll have you back at home.

512
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:45,773
I'm sorry I got sick.

513
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:49,688
Baby, it's not your fault.
You kept trying to tell me.

514
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:53,016
I just wasn't paying attention to you.

515
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:57,007
In the future,
we need to have a code word, okay?

516
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:58,645
Okay.

517
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:02,093
Secret words you can use to let me know
when the pain is real...

518
00:42:02,176 --> 00:42:03,814
and you're not just playing.

519
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:06,407
But it was always real.

520
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:10,850
I know.

521
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,888
Baby, I'm sorry.

522
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:18,812
I don't know why you guys are depressed.
I haven't gotten laid since September 11...

523
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:20,444
1985.

524
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:25,770
You laughed at the wrong part.
I'm just telling you. What a crowd!

525
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:28,495
You drinking NyQuil, ladies?
Sit up, come on!

526
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:31,010
Blonde Jews, everybody! Hip crowd!

527
00:42:31,096 --> 00:42:34,532
Good to see you back
in men's clothes, Senator. All right.

528
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:37,688
Cousin Stu, right out of rehab.
Good to see you.

529
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:41,292
- The landscaper's here, thank God!
- So what's shiva mean, standup?

530
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:44,095
Jeffrey represented a lot of comedians.

531
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:49,134
There's one part I haven't told you.
I'm engaged.

532
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,567
Well, we couldn't go out anyway.
You're not Jewish.

533
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,245
No, I didn't mean...
You would go out with me?

534
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,614
No, I just said I wouldn't.

535
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,927
- But it crossed your mind.
- I said, I would not.

536
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,853
Well, then, why'd you say it?

537
00:43:07,936 --> 00:43:10,291
You thought about it. Come on.

538
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,125
Maybe.

539
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:14,526
You know, with your whole illness thing...

540
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:18,325
I have a bit of a messiah complex...

541
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,213
saving the men.

542
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,734
Yes, messiah complex.

543
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:27,853
You know, you can save me.

544
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:31,213
If that's what you need to do,
you can save me.

545
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:36,127
It's really good that you have someone.
If anything is going to save you, that will.

546
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,251
Yeah.

547
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:42,888
I haven't told her
about my whole head thing.

548
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:47,566
How could you not tell your soul mate
something like that?

549
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,095
I don't even know if she's my soul mate.

550
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:56,013
I get it. She's not your soul mate
but you're going to marry her...

551
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,495
I don't know what else to do.

552
00:43:57,576 --> 00:44:01,046
...because you have nothing better to do.
Great. That sounds good.

553
00:44:01,496 --> 00:44:04,693
Hey, I don't even know
what a soul mate is, do you?

554
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:09,414
The person who makes you be
the most "you" that you could possibly be.

555
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:14,013
Maybe your soul mate...

556
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:16,729
is the person...

557
00:44:18,216 --> 00:44:20,650
who forces your soul to grow the most.

558
00:44:23,816 --> 00:44:25,852
Not all growth feels good.

559
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:32,894
Hey, Melissa, it's Brenda.
I've been driving around for hours.

560
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:37,726
You want to have a drink or something?
Call me if you get in tonight, okay? Bye.

561
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:39,569
Whatever.

562
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,933
- Like that?
- Oh, yeah.

563
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,488
Are you gonna fuck me?

564
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:25,487
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck you.

565
00:45:25,576 --> 00:45:27,646
- I'm gonna fuck you hard.
- Yeah?

566
00:45:29,976 --> 00:45:32,888
- Harder than you ever been fucked.
- Oh, good!

567
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,328
What's your name?

568
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:52,773
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Fisher.
- Glad to.

569
00:46:06,176 --> 00:46:07,894
Did he want to die?

570
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:11,128
Did he want to leave us?

571
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:14,448
- How could he have wanted that?
- I don't know.

572
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:22,409
What do you think?

573
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:26,852
I don't think he wanted to die.

574
00:46:35,176 --> 00:46:37,485
<i>Nate, leave your clothes on.</i>

575
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,609
I'll get naked. You can go outside
and come back as a dangerous intruder.

576
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:47,013
Come on, I'm serious.

577
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:50,175
It'll be fun.

578
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:55,372
I'll pretend I'm asleep, and then you
can come in and have your way with me.

579
00:47:00,376 --> 00:47:02,890
I don't really feel like it, all right?

580
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:06,446
Okay, you don't have to go outside.
Just do it from in here.

581
00:47:15,496 --> 00:47:17,612
Hey, I've never seen you before.

582
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,133
- What's your name?
- Nate.

583
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:24,525
- My name is Nate.
- That's pretty funny.

584
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,452
My fiancé's name is Nate.

585
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,527
I love you so much.

586
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:51,094
You're so soft, baby.

587
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:55,811
I love you. I love you so much.

588
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:58,091
Harder!

589
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:02,444
Come on.

590
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,853
Did the music wake you up?

591
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:57,724
No, I've been up for a while actually.
I took a walk in the canyon.

592
00:49:57,816 --> 00:50:00,967
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- My God, it's gorgeous!

593
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:08,330
We'll have a weekend soon,
just you and me, okay?

594
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:11,010
You come back
when there's not so much craziness.

595
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:14,372
The craziness was totally fine.
It was fun, actually.

596
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:15,805
Good.

597
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:21,216
I love this song. It's so pretty.

598
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:24,451
You want a waffle before you go?

599
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,769
No, thanks.

600
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:33,574
Well, then, tell everyone
I love them and miss them...

601
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:37,089
and want them to get their butts here
super soon, okay?

602
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:39,326
Especially that mama of yours.

603
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:43,765
Yeah, right, like she would ever.

604
00:50:47,776 --> 00:50:52,452
I think she hides inside of herself
because she's so afraid we'll reject her.

605
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:55,368
So let's don't, okay?

606
00:50:56,936 --> 00:50:59,848
She's had enough heartache
for one lifetime.

607
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,844
- You can keep it, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

608
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:18,085
As soon as I figure out
which two are my parents...

609
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:21,213
I'm just gonna roll them up in a rug
and throw them in my trunk.

610
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:22,809
Let me know if I can help.

611
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:27,128
I think I'll start with some coffee. But
give me your number if you're taking off.

612
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:29,335
Seriously?

613
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:32,251
I figured I'd never see you again.

614
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:35,608
Well, you were wrong. I'll come into the city.

615
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:39,011
Okay, I'll write down my number.

616
00:51:43,696 --> 00:51:47,928
So, you get the 8 x 10
and the 24 wallet sizes for under $20.

617
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:51,888
- Pedro is the spitting image of Ramon.
- Right?

618
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:55,491
And everybody said he looked just like me
for the longest time.

619
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,454
Hey, morning, baby!

620
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:02,010
Hey! Hey, Graciela.

621
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:06,131
So, Rico, Ramon told me
why he's not finishing your house.

622
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,644
He did?

623
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:12,445
Yeah, just because
he has different taste in tile than you do.

624
00:52:12,536 --> 00:52:16,415
I mean, you could have returned
what he bought and got something else.

625
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:19,328
Yeah, I guess I could have.

626
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:23,125
I know, girl, it sounds crazy to me, too,
but you know how men are.

627
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:25,411
<i>Se ponen locos</i> with that machismo stuff.

628
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:29,206
I guess I just really wanted
to do my own house myself.

629
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:31,171
My way.

630
00:52:31,256 --> 00:52:33,565
You know how to do construction?

631
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,768
You know, I want to learn.
I got some books and...

632
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:39,609
That's cool,
but just don't hold a grudge, okay?

633
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:44,772
I gotta go. Ramon is watching the kids,
and he's going to kill me.

634
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:47,051
- Okay, girl. Bye.
- See you guys later.

635
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:54,250
Baby, you're such a weirdo sometimes.

636
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:57,529
Whatever.

637
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:26,091
Are you even going to ask
about my weekend?

638
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:28,087
I wasn't planning on it.

639
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:33,804
- I had fun.
- I'm glad.

640
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:39,525
I found some slugs in the garden.

641
00:53:42,816 --> 00:53:43,931
Neat.

642
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:52,332
I'm gonna go take a nap.

643
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:13,129
English
