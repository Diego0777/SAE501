1
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,107
Dillon.

2
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:58,954
Hey, there, buddy.
What are you doing awake so late?

3
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:04,305
- Does he look okay to you?
- He's just fussing a little, is all.

4
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,188
He doesn't look a little funny?

5
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:10,230
Of course he looks a little funny.
That's his daddy's nose.

6
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:13,315
He's just a little sleepy.

7
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,715
There's my baby's smile.

8
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,988
Why don't you go back to bed?
I'll be in as soon as he falls asleep.

9
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,315
You sure?

10
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:32,071
It's all right. Go back to sleep.

11
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,432
Okay.

12
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,371
You're still here.

13
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:53,052
- What, no breakfast?
- I've got to go to work.

14
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,738
You were a lot nicer online.

15
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,728
Yeah, well, people aren't
always who they seem to be.

16
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,375
Tell me about it.

17
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,622
You need to leave.

18
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,377
Now.

19
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,853
Whatever.

20
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:20,099
See you in the chat rooms...

21
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,420
..."Jim."

22
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,297
Again.

23
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,659
Again.

24
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,145
Again!

25
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,541
Fucking bitch.

26
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,225
Morning, Mom.

27
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,799
Bren, Bren, if you're there, pick up,
It's Billy,

28
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:45,159
- Pick up the phone, Brenda,
- Fuck you.

29
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,830
Pick up the fucking phone, Please?

30
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:50,682
Fuck you.

31
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:57,314
Look, I need you, Bren,
Things are not good, I need you,

32
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:01,475
Brenda!
Goddamn it! Fuck!

33
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,880
Bitch,

34
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,518
Lovely way to wake up, huh?

35
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:10,800
Brenda, you're gonna have
to face him sometime.

36
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,647
Sometime, just not now.

37
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:17,443
Let's get major espressos,
take a walk on the beach.

38
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:20,527
Can't. I gotta get ready for my trip.

39
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,640
What trip?

40
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,239
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

41
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,284
The annual Western States
Funeral Directors Conference.

42
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,722
Was that today?
I thought that was months away.

43
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:34,241
No, just me and David
and 300 funeral directors...

44
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:37,331
...cutting loose in the city of sin.
- Why would you do that to yourself?

45
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:41,811
One: We get to attend helpful seminars
where we learn new tricks of the trade.

46
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:43,891
Two: We get to commiserate
with all the other sad fucks...

47
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:46,483
...who are being edged out by Kroehner.

48
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:51,211
Three: We have the perfect opportunity
to get in Matt Gilardi's face, tell him...

49
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:54,010
...we know Kroehner burned down
the house across the street.

50
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,126
The ongoing pissing contest.

51
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:02,570
That'll be good for you and David.
You'll have fun.

52
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:05,451
I don't know how much fun
he's gonna have. He's giving this...

53
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,651
...big speech about the future of
the independent funeral home.

54
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:12,933
David doesn't strike me as the
type of guy who gives speeches.

55
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,817
My dad was scheduled to do it.
Dave volunteered to fill in.

56
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:21,771
It's kind of a big deal for him.
He's pretty nervous about it.

57
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,371
- Call me from Vegas.
- I will.

58
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:30,613
Unless I'm flailing about in a pool
having sex with some showgirl.

59
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:33,292
I'll miss you.

60
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,863
Oh, fuck you!

61
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:43,820
I know this is an exceptionally
difficult time for you...

62
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:47,736
...but can you tell us what you
had in mind for your son's...

63
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,461
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:54,379
We're only here because the
hospital suggested we call you guys.

65
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,661
We're not even sure
what we're doing here.

66
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,259
He is a perfectly healthy baby.

67
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,947
Can I ask, what was the cause of...?

68
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:09,308
SIDS.

69
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,823
Yes, well, if you need to take some time
before we start making arrangements...

70
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,501
...that's completely understandable.
- The arrangements?

71
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,112
What arrangements?

72
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,267
For his funeral.

73
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,390
Funeral?

74
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,195
- He was only 3 weeks old.
- It might help...

75
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,945
...if you think of it less as a funeral and
more as a way of saying goodbye to him.

76
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:36,753
I don't want to say goodbye.
He just barely got here.

77
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,753
Of course it's difficult for anyone
to come to terms with something...

78
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,589
...as unexpected as this, but...
- It's not just difficult.

79
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,392
It's not even remotely possible.

80
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:55,000
Some babies are just
too good for this world.

81
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:59,634
We'll fix things so you can spend
as much time with him as you need.

82
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:08,756
- How old is he?
- Barely 3 weeks.

83
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,717
SIDS?

84
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,836
Yeah.

85
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,958
- Oh, Jesus.
- You should've been here for the intake.

86
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,282
The parents are practically
children themselves.

87
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,955
They didn't even know they were
supposed to have a funeral.

88
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:26,002
- Welcome back, Rico.
- Thanks, Nate.

89
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,963
- You're sure you're up to this?
- Yeah, yeah, it's no problem.

90
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,841
We'll only be gone till Sunday.

91
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,929
If you need anything, I can hop on a
plane and be back in an hour and a half.

92
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,520
I'll be fine.

93
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:55,012
I have some of your T-shirts here.
They're still warm.

94
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:57,205
Mom.

95
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,652
Oh, don't let me stop you.

96
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,656
You know, I probably should take
a couple of those T-shirts with me...

97
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,294
...to Las Vegas.

98
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,658
- David, I want to ask you something.
- I'm really kind of in a hurry here.

99
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,410
I just wanted to know...

100
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,015
- Are you...?
- Mom.

101
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:40,818
Can we talk about this
when I get back from Las Vegas?

102
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:46,094
Yes, of course.
That's a lovely idea.

103
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:50,219
We'll talk about it when you
get back from Las Vegas.

104
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,380
Mrs. Dimas?

105
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:55,736
It's Claire Fisher.

106
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:59,419
I'm sorry to keep calling,
I was just wondering if you've...

107
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:02,540
...heard anything from Gabe yet.

108
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,585
What?

109
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,061
When?

110
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,908
Oh, my God.

111
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,419
Is he okay?

112
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:17,305
What hospital?

113
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:21,708
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Dimas.
Thank you.

114
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:37,311
- You are late. 10 minutes.
- I know, I'm sorry.

115
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:42,545
Is okay. I just want you to know that
I notice these kinds of things.

116
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,635
It won't happen again, Nikolai.

117
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,556
We have to talk.

118
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,716
- It's about your work.
- I said I was sorry for being late.

119
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,592
No, no, no, has nothing
to do with being late.

120
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,197
Is about how you arrange the flowers.

121
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,038
- What?
- There have been complaints...

122
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,118
...from some of the customers.
- There have not.

123
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:08,032
- Afraid so.
- Ruth. You are not so good at arranging.

124
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,994
- I am too.
- No, you're not.

125
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,592
From now on, Robbie will
handle arrangement...

126
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:15,921
...and you will work the register
and help with the books.

127
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:18,035
I don't want to help with the books!

128
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,395
I helped my husband with
the books for 30 years.

129
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:24,280
I want to do flower arrangements. Tell
me what's wrong with my arrangements.

130
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:28,525
Not all arrangements
are for funerals, cupcake.

131
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,126
You think my arrangements
look funereal?

132
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,481
It's like Robbie said. There have been
a few complaints from some customers.

133
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,202
No. We done talking now.

134
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:43,159
Robbie will do the arrangement,
you will work on the register.

135
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,367
You gonna nail Gilardi for
the arson job in your speech?

136
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:58,211
- No.
- Why not?

137
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:01,689
Let's think.
Possible libel charges, maybe.

138
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:04,089
- Mind if I say something to him?
- Yes. Don't.

139
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,329
Pussy.

140
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,208
Nate, do we have any evidence
against him? No.

141
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,531
Apparently the police don't either.

142
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:14,012
Look, I don't want you picking
a fight with Gilardi.

143
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:17,732
Why not? You basically threatened
to kill him that one time.

144
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:24,327
- I'm coming with you.
- Great.

145
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,377
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,259
- I need to get out of here.
- All right.

147
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:39,895
- Oh, my God, is that a penis?
- Rico.

148
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:45,574
- I'm sorry. It is, isn't it?
- Your wife doesn't want me to say.

149
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,856
- The baby's okay, right?
- Baby's fine.

150
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:52,215
But you have mild to
moderate preeclampsia.

151
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:56,015
- What is preeclampsia?
- A $ 10 word for prenatal hypertension.

152
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,821
Your blood pressure is a little
higher than we'd like.

153
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,301
Could cause some problems
if it gets out of hand...

154
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,066
...but we're not gonna let that happen.
- What kind of problems?

155
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:08,055
Let's not even go there.
This baby's fine.

156
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:11,101
Worse comes to worst, we go in
a little early, we do a C-section.

157
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:15,026
We'll take a look at your labs, check
your blood pressure in a day or two...

158
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:21,226
...and see how we're doing then.
Until then, I want you on strict bed rest.

159
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,623
I really wouldn't worry about this.
The baby is fine.

160
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:40,470
If you came looking to collect more
money for Anthony's funeral...

161
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:42,869
...I'm all tapped out at the moment.

162
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,269
This one...

163
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:46,943
...shoots up too much speed and heroin.

164
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:50,953
Now I'm stuck paying
for this fancy-ass hotel room...

165
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:55,673
...to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while
they keep him under observation.

166
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:59,474
I'm going out for coffee and smokes.

167
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,957
Speed and heroin?

168
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,391
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd try something different.

169
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:18,317
- Different like with a needle in your arm?
- Hey, what is this?!

170
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:22,118
Twenty fucking questions?
I've been through this already, all right?

171
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,473
With the doctors, with the police,
with my mom.

172
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:28,597
- Now I gotta put your mind at ease too?
- I'm sorry.

173
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:32,395
I would've been fine if you had just
minded your own fucking business.

174
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:35,962
Well, excuse me for giving a shit!

175
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:48,044
This wasn't an accident, was it?

176
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,365
I wish you would just
fucking leave already.

177
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,044
Fine. Here.

178
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:16,526
"The emerging role of funeral directors
in mass aviation disasters."

179
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,452
That sounds like fun.

180
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:20,771
Do you realize how many of these
seminars are sponsored by Kroehner?

181
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,454
Who's "Jasmine Brecker"?

182
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:28,570
She's either a federal judge or a
sex surrogate. I haven't decided yet.

183
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:31,689
- You got any matches?
- Sure.

184
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:33,331
Thank you.

185
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:37,736
Okay, boys. Let's mingle.

186
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,888
When in Rome.

187
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,532
I think maybe my expectations
of this trip were a little high.

188
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,501
Oh, great. Happy hour.

189
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,702
Well, well. The Fisher brothers.

190
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:00,656
You know, I wondered
if you'd even bother to show.

191
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:05,054
I understand you'll be speaking
tomorrow in place of your father.

192
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:07,256
What was your topic again?

193
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,462
The future of independent funeral homes.

194
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:13,261
Well, I'm certainly
looking forward to that.

195
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:17,740
I'd invite you boys to the Kroehner
party at the Luxor, but...

196
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:19,346
...it's only for affiliates.

197
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,937
Damn.
Because we'd really like to be there.

198
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:24,662
I'm sure you corporate lackeys
really know how to party.

199
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,700
Have fun with the other
dinosaurs, boys.

200
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,341
Oh, Matt, I have something for you.

201
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,018
This is a pack of matches.

202
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,822
This is for a can of lighter fluid.

203
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,623
Next time you need to unload some
cumbersome real estate, you'll be all set.

204
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:50,069
- Nate, that was not smart.
- I should've set his fucking hair on fire.

205
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,504
Bottoms up.

206
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:13,194
I love Las Vegas. It has to be
the most artificial place on earth.

207
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:18,428
- You think so? More than Disneyland?
- Oh, come on, more than Japan.

208
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,032
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,801
What are all these little cartoon
explosions all over their butts?

210
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,721
- They look like they're farting.
- Yeah. Look, coupons.

211
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:35,751
Hey, Dave, you wanna get some of that
famous Las Vegas $4.99 prime rib?

212
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:39,718
I have it on good authority it's just as
good as the $6.99 prime rib over there.

213
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,722
No, I think I'll just head up to my room...

214
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,961
...order some room service,
make an early night of it.

215
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:45,354
You sure?

216
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:48,365
Yeah, I should work
on my speech anyway.

217
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,644
Okay. Well, we'll see you in the morning.

218
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:55,203
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- Yeah, not likely.

219
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,046
I have two words for you:

220
00:18:57,248 --> 00:19:00,365
- Lap. Dance.
- Yeah, who says I want a lap dance?

221
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:04,323
- Who says it's for you, baby?
- Kinky.

222
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:28,043
- I thought I told you to leave.
- I drove all the way out here to Barstow.

223
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,088
If you think I'm gonna turn around and
drive back, you're seriously whacked.

224
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,766
- This is like Bumfuck, Egypt out here.
- You spent the night?

225
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,490
Yeah, I slept in my car.

226
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:44,528
- My mom still here?
- No, she went out for more cigarettes.

227
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,530
Did you say anything to her about...?

228
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,850
No.

229
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,770
Are you gonna?

230
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,575
I haven't decided.

231
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,614
- You hungry?
- No.

232
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,655
I can't eat this hospital shit.
It all tastes the same.

233
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:07,978
Here.

234
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:11,699
I got you an Egg McMuffin because
I know they're your favorite.

235
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,415
How is it?

236
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,574
Fucking cold.

237
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:29,346
But good.

238
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,262
Thanks.

239
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:09,147
In this class, we're gonna be working
on freeform summer arrangements.

240
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,234
And if we have any time at the end
of class, I'm not promising...

241
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:15,156
...because I want us to get
to our breathing exercises...

242
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,909
...but if we have time, we might try
a spiky arrangement or two.

243
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:24,874
But first we're gonna start by doing
a little work treating our stems.

244
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,789
And we're gonna start by working
with our woody stems...

245
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,553
...because they can be a little on the
tricky side and require the most TLC.

246
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,479
Tough loving care.

247
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,435
Okay, let's start with an azalea,
one of my favorites.

248
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,279
Starting an inch or two
from the bottom of the stem...

249
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:48,203
...and if it's a thick stem,
we really have to smash them...

250
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:51,441
...we split the stem vertically.

251
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,762
Does anyone know why we do this?

252
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,961
Anyone? Yes.

253
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:02,365
- So it will draw more water?
- Very good.

254
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:06,560
Did everyone hear that?
So it will draw more water.

255
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:11,923
Okay. Does everyone have
their hammers? Let's begin.

256
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,091
You're supposed to be in bed.

257
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,443
I needed to get some turkey franks
and milk for Julio.

258
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,407
Why didn't you call me? I could've
stopped home on my way from work.

259
00:22:35,614 --> 00:22:38,208
- He has a snack at 3:30.
- Why didn't you call your sister?

260
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:41,849
She just got two days
on a new Nicolas Cage movie.

261
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:44,809
She plays this hooker who witnesses
a murder, then gets raped and killed.

262
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:48,326
She's got lines and everything! She
wants me to come visit her on the set.

263
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,606
Well, you're supposed to be in bed.

264
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:52,377
I got bored and went to the market.
What's the big deal?

265
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:55,172
- What are you doing home anyway?
- I came home for lunch.

266
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,654
- I was worried.
- Rico, please. I'm fine.

267
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:00,690
I'm not just worried about you.

268
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,575
Okay.
This is about the baby at work.

269
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,570
I just...
I can't do it.

270
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:13,099
Of course you can.

271
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,254
He looks like...

272
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,499
Like he's sleeping.

273
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:24,901
Like a baby who's fallen asleep.

274
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:30,737
He was 3 weeks old.
There was nothing wrong with him.

275
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:34,422
And then, just like that...

276
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,821
...he dies.

277
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,935
For no reason.

278
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,340
How can that be?

279
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:47,225
How can the beginning and end
be so damn close together?

280
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,383
And now I've got this real bad feeling.

281
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,221
I haven't done a baby
since Julio was born.

282
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:00,820
David always does them.

283
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:08,510
- So make David do this one.
- David's in Vegas until tomorrow.

284
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,592
The viewing is this afternoon.

285
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:20,348
Some babies just aren't meant
for this world, Rico.

286
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,476
But this one is.

287
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,036
Turn to page seven
in your notebooks...

288
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,515
...we'll go step by step
through the most challenging...

289
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,158
...cranial facial reconstruction
I ever faced.

290
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:46,829
If we could go to
the next slide, please.

291
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:53,034
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus.

292
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:58,280
- That shit is fucked up.
- Nate, this is Chloe Yorkin.

293
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:01,556
The job Federico left us
to do for Kroehner?

294
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:04,040
Oh, God.
That is like fucking science fiction.

295
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,157
The first question my team
and I asked ourselves was not...

296
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:12,164
...as it might have been at a
facility with less resources...

297
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:16,201
...can we do this?
- They don't even credit Rico by name.

298
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,480
Oh, man, he's gonna be furious.

299
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:26,646
Oh, God.

300
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, that is a very generous
offer, Roger...

301
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,045
...but unfortunately I am in a relationship
at the moment. If I was...

302
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,446
Deal me in.

303
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:39,521
Jesus, Billy.

304
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:42,770
Hold on. Hey!
So where's your boyfriend?

305
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:45,407
What are you doing here?

306
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:47,372
I love Vegas.
You know I love Vegas.

307
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:51,090
And sometimes when my sister isn't
there when I need her, I hop in my car...

308
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,684
...start driving, wind up here.
- Billy, you're lying.

309
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,364
I'm really not.
I just saw you at the blackjack table.

310
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,646
- It was a total coincidence.
- You're a fucking liar.

311
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:02,406
You're a selfish, manipulative,
narcissistic liar.

312
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:10,534
- What did Mom and Dad tell you?
- They told me that you made a bomb.

313
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:16,368
That's fucking hilarious.
So now I'm like, what, a terrorist?

314
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,696
"Billy Mc Veigh"?

315
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:22,772
They're fucking liars, Brenda!

316
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,940
They hate each other and they're
miserable and they're jealous of us...

317
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:28,417
...and they want us to hate
each other too. So they lie to us!

318
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,854
No, they lied to me, you lied to me. You
let me believe you tried to kill yourself.

319
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:33,212
Do you know how fucked that is?

320
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:35,733
You know what?
I was so fucking drugged up...

321
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,662
...I don't even really
remember what happened.

322
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,742
Dad showed me what you wrote.

323
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:47,102
I was kidding, okay?

324
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,506
It wasn't serious.

325
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:55,226
Do you have any idea
what I gave up for you?

326
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,546
Because I thought that if you tried
to kill yourself again and succeeded...

327
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,707
...I could tell myself that I did
everything I could to save you.

328
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:03,343
And you did.

329
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,462
- You've saved me every day since then.
- Well, fuck you!

330
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:10,708
- Brenda, don't fucking walk away...
- I'm having a life. Just back off!

331
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:13,187
Hey, you heard her! Now, fuck off!

332
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,469
Nice.

333
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:28,031
Are you okay?

334
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:31,435
He followed us here.

335
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:37,110
I hate to say it,
but I'm not entirely surprised.

336
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,953
Very nice.

337
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,955
Luscious.

338
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:24,839
This is a little...

339
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,400
...tight.

340
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:30,157
- Tight?
- You're not breathing right.

341
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:33,122
- I'm not?
- You're breathing from here...

342
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,923
...when you should be
breathing from here.

343
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:38,166
- But my lungs are here.
- Of course they are.

344
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,247
I'm speaking metaphorically.

345
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,807
If you breathe from up here, your
arrangements will come from up here.

346
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:48,642
If you breathe from down here, your
arrangements will come from down here.

347
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,412
- And that's good?
- That's very good.

348
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,365
- Do you do yoga?
- No.

349
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,805
Okay. Would everybody grab
a yoga mat in the next room?

350
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:01,691
We're gonna do some breathing
exercises before we break for dinner.

351
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:05,804
You're a bit of a control freak,
aren't you?

352
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:08,849
No, I'm not. I don't think I am.

353
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:10,375
- Am I?
- Yes.

354
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:13,410
And control freaks
do not make good arrangers.

355
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:16,337
Believe me, I know.
I used to be a control freak too.

356
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:19,246
But you know what?
You can get over it.

357
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,212
All you have to do is learn to breathe.

358
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:25,054
- Are you on antidepressants?
- No!

359
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,809
Well, Lord knows I'd be lost
without my Saint John's Wort.

360
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:36,301
There are countless challenges facing
independent funeral homes today:

361
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:40,382
Changing social attitudes
toward death and dying...

362
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:45,374
...economic hardship in communities
both large and small...

363
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:04,216
Oh, what the hell.

364
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:09,298
We all know what the real challenge is.

365
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:14,708
How are you doing today, Mr. Gilardi?

366
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,462
- Fine, thank you.
- Glad to hear it.

367
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:21,745
We all know of a certain organization...

368
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:24,989
...that controls the flow
of prep-room supplies...

369
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:30,904
...caskets, cemetery property and
flowers to everyone in this room.

370
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,674
And believe me, that organization
will stoop to almost any means...

371
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,342
...to make sure that the independent
funeral home has no future.

372
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:37,908
But hear me out.

373
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,106
My father was in this business
for over 35 years.

374
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,954
He...

375
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:49,466
He thought it was okay to tell people
about a cheaper casket.

376
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:52,670
He didn't always try
to talk people out of cremation.

377
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:55,073
There were even times
where I actually heard him say:

378
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:57,588
"To hell with our profit margin on this."

379
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,000
These words are heresy
to a certain organization...

380
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,792
...because profit is all it cares about...

381
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,676
...no matter how many PR-motivated
seminars it sponsors.

382
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,031
That organization wants us
independents to believe...

383
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:11,631
...that we cannot afford to be
like my father anymore.

384
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,560
Well, I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

385
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:16,596
Don't get me wrong, my father
worried about the bottom line too...

386
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:19,271
...but he worried more
about other things.

387
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,395
Like comforting people...

388
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:23,959
...and helping them face profound loss.

389
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:32,204
Maybe now more than ever, we should
all try to be a little more like him.

390
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:35,646
Thank you.

391
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:05,213
- Very motivational.
- Good job.

392
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:07,847
How'd I do?

393
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:12,094
Are you kidding? You kicked
some serious ass, you big freak.

394
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:20,653
You didn't come home last night.

395
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:24,649
Well, it's not like it was a school night.

396
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:28,336
Would you like me to
make you something to eat?

397
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:30,973
Yeah, that'd be great.

398
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,818
Do you think I'm a control freak?

399
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:44,171
Yeah.

400
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:50,018
- Where do you think David gets it from?
- Your father was very controlling.

401
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:53,021
- Not like you.
- That's not nice.

402
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:54,492
You asked.

403
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:01,542
You're not as bad as you used to be.

404
00:33:02,505 --> 00:33:05,623
May I ask where you were all night?

405
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,861
In Barstow.

406
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,183
What in God's name
were you doing there?

407
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:13,457
I was visiting a friend of mine
who's in the hospital.

408
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,499
Who?

409
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:18,536
Gabriel Dimas.

410
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:23,463
- The young man whose brother...
- Yeah.

411
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,344
What was he doing in the hospital?

412
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:30,830
He OD'd.

413
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:34,591
Good Lord.

414
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,549
Claire...

415
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,909
...he's obviously a deeply disturbed boy.

416
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:47,666
You need to steer clear of him.
Let his family deal with this.

417
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,788
Well, let's take stock
for a second, shall we?

418
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,755
His little brother's dead.
His father's dead.

419
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,908
His stepfather beat him up...

420
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:01,997
...his white-trash mother who smokes
like a fish could give a shit.

421
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,837
That leaves no one.

422
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:09,149
Was his overdose an accident?

423
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,875
- Of course it was an accident.
- Because sometimes these things aren't.

424
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,154
And if it wasn't, it could happen again.
There's an 80%/% chance that someone...

425
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:20,000
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

426
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,352
I hope, for his sake, you're right.

427
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,241
But if you're wrong, Claire...

428
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,913
I don't want you
getting too close to him.

429
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,039
- Thank you.
- No problem.

430
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,884
Look at him.

431
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,997
- He's a star.
- Hi. Really great.

432
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:49,440
I just want you guys to meet someone.

433
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:54,965
This is my brother and partner
Nathaniel Jr. And his...

434
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,162
- Jasmine.
- Hey, there, I'm Neil Schaeger.

435
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,406
- Schaeger and Sons, from Flagstaff.
- Raymond Dooley.

436
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,920
Dooley and Moss Funeral Home,
Reno, Nevada.

437
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:06,281
Moss couldn't be here. Bladder cancer.

438
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:08,768
That was a hell of a speech
David made.

439
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,964
Almost made me cry when those
Kroehner bastards got up and left.

440
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:15,848
Those fuckers have been trying
to buy us out for five goddamn years.

441
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:18,170
Your father was a good man.

442
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:19,569
Yes, he was.

443
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:22,453
Y'all don't mind if we drag your
little brother out with us, do you?

444
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:25,374
- I really shouldn't.
- Gotta let us buy you a drink at least.

445
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:27,567
- You're our hero.
- Well, maybe just a quick one.

446
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:30,085
Quick one, my Aunt Fanny.
We're gonna make a night of it.

447
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,174
Hey, you want to go with?
The more the merrier.

448
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:37,217
Oh, I don't think so.
We're just gonna lay low tonight.

449
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:42,413
- Yeah, but you guys have fun.
- Okay, your loss.

450
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:02,816
Excuse me.

451
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,583
We'd just like to thank you...

452
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:09,817
...very much.
- He looks so beautiful.

453
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:11,617
I'm glad you're pleased.

454
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,941
Mike's mom and dad
drove down from Salinas.

455
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:18,822
Yeah. They never got
a chance to meet him.

456
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:22,622
Now it's almost like they did.

457
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:28,144
- Do you have children?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

458
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:34,107
I have a 4-year-old boy and my...

459
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,663
Yes.

460
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:43,983
We'd like to be alone with him
for a little while, if that's okay.

461
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:47,423
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Please take as much time as you need.

462
00:36:48,232 --> 00:36:50,349
Thanks.

463
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,671
- Say fromage!
- Fromage.

464
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,353
Hey, you were really
great today, Nate.

465
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,632
Standing up to Billy.
I felt like some white-trash girl...

466
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,719
...whose boyfriend
was the biggest badass in town.

467
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:31,118
- Your brother's seriously ill, Brenda.
- Yeah, whatever.

468
00:37:31,322 --> 00:37:35,793
But you know what?
We're in faux Paris, so let's party.

469
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:14,056
Hi.

470
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:17,736
- I'm Amber.
- David.

471
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:22,018
You're a lucky guy, David.

472
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,704
- I am?
- Very.

473
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:28,135
Your friend just bought you
a lap dance with me.

474
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:34,745
- Excuse me?
- So where you from, David?

475
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:39,661
- Boston.
- That is the coldest place I ever lived.

476
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:42,265
What part of town you live in?

477
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,339
Downtown.

478
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:58,024
Are you even enjoying this at all?

479
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:01,870
- Yeah, I'm loving it, why?
- Because...

480
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,463
...your dick isn't responding one bit.

481
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,231
Look, I'm gay. It's not you.

482
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:13,469
It never is me.

483
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:19,434
Well, if you're gay, you won't mind
if we cut this one short, will you?

484
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:26,835
What happened, buddy?
Popped your cork too soon?

485
00:40:27,118 --> 00:40:29,349
He's gay, you idiots.

486
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,154
- I wish you would've told us that.
- Yeah, believe me, so do I.

487
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:45,439
Thanks for a lovely evening, fellas.

488
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:52,320
Great. Great, I'll meet you out front.
Thank you.

489
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,887
Hello, Brad.

490
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:34,782
Very nice.

491
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:11,868
- Jim.
- Brad?

492
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:15,069
Yeah.

493
00:43:16,234 --> 00:43:18,111
You look...

494
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:20,875
...different from the ad.
- Well, that's from '91.

495
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:24,148
I've been meaning to update it.
I've just been...

496
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:28,144
- You know, busy.
- You're...

497
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:32,032
- Almost 20 minutes late.
- Previous appointment ran a little over.

498
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,798
What can I say, Brad's a busy boy.

499
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:37,636
- How much...?
- You're not a cop, right?

500
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,592
- No, I'm not a cop.
- Because if you are, that's entrapment.

501
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:42,471
I'm not a cop.

502
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,469
You are kind of cute.

503
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,831
Thank you.

504
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:55,031
$200 gets you a pony ride all
the way to the moon and back.

505
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:57,076
Up front.

506
00:43:57,963 --> 00:43:59,601
Now would be a good time.

507
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:04,153
- All I've got is 80.
- Fine, fine.

508
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:06,882
Fine.

509
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:19,722
- Where do you want to go, Jimbo?
- I don't know.

510
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,600
Where are you staying?

511
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:26,083
- I'm not taking you back to my room.
- Okay.

512
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,849
Don't wanna wake the wife, I get it.

513
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:31,006
Then...

514
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,241
Where do you want to do this?

515
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:38,728
Oh, yeah.

516
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:41,969
Oh, yeah. Good.

517
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:46,846
- Oh, yeah, Jimbo, give it to me.
- Yeah.

518
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:49,727
Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:53,483
- You like that, don't you, faggot?
- Oh, yeah.

520
00:44:59,816 --> 00:45:02,171
Oh, no.

521
00:45:05,697 --> 00:45:08,495
Okay, boys, party's over.

522
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:21,654
All right. When you're done there, Sally,
you're allowed one phone call.

523
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,300
Your stuff.

524
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:13,541
He's all yours.

525
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:14,945
Thanks.

526
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:27,110
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

527
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,110
Are you okay?

528
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,791
I'm fine.

529
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:38,114
You didn't think you'd get caught
doing something this fucked up?

530
00:46:38,316 --> 00:46:39,989
- I wasn't thinking.
- Clearly.

531
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:46,838
Were you using condoms?

532
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:52,271
I was drunk. I was very drunk.

533
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,438
You're lucky I had a couple
connections with the Vegas P.D.

534
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,713
All the charges are being dropped
and your file's being tossed.

535
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:02,118
- Next time you won't be this lucky.
- Thank you for doing this.

536
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,837
David, I did this because I love you.
But I won't ever do it again.

537
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:11,634
This shit isn't good for either one of us.

538
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:19,243
You need to get yourself some help.

539
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,234
Goodbye, David.

540
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,124
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Something's not right with the baby.

541
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,004
What? Come on, let's go.

542
00:47:50,211 --> 00:47:53,761
I'll call your sister, okay?
We'll leave Julio over at her house.

543
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:06,086
Hey, you.

544
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:09,366
Late night?

545
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:11,646
Not really.

546
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:15,167
We tried calling your room this morning,
you didn't seem to be in.

547
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:17,447
I must have been in the shower.

548
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:20,456
Did you have fun with the guys?

549
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:25,449
I suppose so.
From a purely anthropological standpoint.

550
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:28,537
- Do you mind driving?
- Okay.

551
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,050
Thank you.
Let's get the hell out of here.

552
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:37,856
I think somebody got lucky last night.

553
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:53,935
This is good, yeah.

554
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:58,378
- You have been practicing.
- Practicing?

555
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:02,737
- I am a graduate.
- Cool.

556
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:07,544
Learning Annex. Wow! I hear
that school's really hard to get into.

557
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:10,023
Robbie, go take care of customer.

558
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:13,539
Today Ruth is going
to do all the arrangement.

559
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:16,548
Nikolai, get your head out
of your pants for two seconds.

560
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,944
That diploma means nothing.

561
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,789
It just means she's plunked down
a couple hundred dollars.

562
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,710
Have you got diploma
from flower class?

563
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:28,110
I have been arranging professionally
for almost 20 years.

564
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:32,829
Good. Today Ruth does arrangement.

565
00:49:53,277 --> 00:49:55,508
Where's your mom?

566
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,951
She drove home today
because she had to go into work.

567
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:05,595
They said I might be getting out
of here this afternoon, though.

568
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:12,676
What are you...?

569
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:27,679
I love you.

570
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:35,040
I love you too.

571
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:46,764
There's an adorable shot of you.

572
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:49,564
There's like three of you
with that cowboy-hat guy.

573
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:53,319
Oh, yeah?
By the way, I slept with him.

574
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,849
Was that wrong?

575
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,565
Oh, man. You took one of me
in the shower? Come on.

576
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:00,763
You looked so cute, I had to.

577
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:06,771
What?

578
00:51:06,973 --> 00:51:09,885
Come on, it can't be that bad.

579
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:24,011
Oh, fuck.

580
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:27,015
Oh, fuck, Billy!

581
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:31,766
Oh, shit.

582
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:48,941
Vitals are good.

583
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:51,019
Okay, we're almost there.

584
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:53,782
- How we doing, Mrs. Diaz?
- Fine.

585
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,701
- Almost got him.
- Him?

586
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:58,976
That's right. I hate to spoil the surprise,
but you have another son.

587
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,621
It's a boy, baby. Did you hear that?
I knew it was gonna be a boy.

588
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,577
Shut up.

589
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:09,858
Heart rate's dropping.
Okay, let's get him out.

590
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:11,658
Pull the catheter.

591
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:13,016
Here you go.

592
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:17,261
- Is the cord compressed?
- Yes. Clamp.

593
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:24,218
Breathe. Come on.

594
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:25,902
- Okay.
- Suction.

595
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,947
- Get the table ready.
- Where are they taking him?

596
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:38,224
Just to heat him up a little.
Have you picked out a name yet?

597
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:44,265
Augusto, after my father. Wait,
is there something wrong with my baby?

598
00:52:44,473 --> 00:52:48,262
We're just gonna warm him up,
make sure his airways are clear.

599
00:52:59,796 --> 00:53:03,267
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's gonna be just fine.

600
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:06,151
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

601
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:10,398
- You swear on a stack of Bibles?
- Okay, Augusto.

602
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:12,078
Time to meet the parents.

603
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,674
Hello, Augusto.

604
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:26,271
He looks just like Julio.

605
00:53:27,402 --> 00:53:30,395
- He is so pissed off.
- Can I grab him?

606
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:34,601
Okay. Here we go.

607
00:53:52,059 --> 00:54:46,614
