1
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,173
<i>Pike Place Market was born in 1907...</i>

2
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:54,041
<i>from citizen outrage</i>
<i>at the high cost of produce...</i>

3
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,707
<i>when Seattle City Councilman</i>
<i>Thomas Revelle...</i>

4
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,182
<i>proposed a public street market.</i>

5
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:03,081
<i>On opening day, August 7, 1907...</i>

6
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,955
<i>eight farmers brought their wagons</i>
<i>to the corner of 1st and Pike...</i>

7
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:10,893
<i>and were overwhelmed</i>
<i>by an estimated 10,000 eager shoppers.</i>

8
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:13,998
<i>By 11.00 a.m. They were completely sold out.</i>

9
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,235
<i>That concludes the morning half of our tour.</i>

10
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,396
<i>Once again, my name's Karen.</i>

11
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,804
<i>You've been a superduper group</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

12
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,742
<i>We'll see you back here on the bus at 1.30.</i>

13
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,275
Thank you, Karen.

14
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:31,412
I don't know about you,
but I could sure use a fucking cigarette.

15
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,383
Come on, dear.

16
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:38,581
Bye.

17
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,985
Excuse me, sir?

18
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,694
<i>Sir, it's lunchtime.</i>

19
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,293
<i>You can get off the bus now.</i>
<i>We're at Pike Place Market.</i>

20
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:02,805
Shit!

21
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,950
We've got another dead one
back here, Larry.

22
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,699
You missed your last three sessions.

23
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:28,306
Sometimes coming in here talking about
my life gets in the way of me having one.

24
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:31,808
So why did you bother coming in today?

25
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:36,746
Because they sent a letter to my mother
and threatened to suspend me if I didn't.

26
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:40,376
I thought you had something
you wanted to talk about.

27
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,317
With you? Yeah, right.

28
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:45,914
Are you angry with me?

29
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,586
How can you tell?

30
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:54,159
I was obligated to cooperate
with the police, Claire. It's my job.

31
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:57,425
Just so you know,
I was here for you, not for them.

32
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,766
They wanted to interrogate you alone.

33
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:03,496
And they haven't found him yet,
in case you're curious.

34
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,867
I'm not.

35
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,838
You haven't heard from him?

36
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,679
Fuck, no. Not that I'd tell you if I had.

37
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,719
You did the right thing
when you called the police that night.

38
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,414
I know I did the right thing.

39
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,980
This isn't about whether or not
I did the right thing.

40
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,458
Given the circumstances,
it's fully understandable...

41
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,688
that you're feeling this angry, Claire.

42
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:28,494
If you don't stop saying my name
at the end of every sentence, I am gonna...

43
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,558
- What?
- I don't know.

44
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:35,202
Just don't, okay?

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,539
You feel like throwing something?

46
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,480
Excuse me?

47
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:46,981
You could, you know.

48
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,612
Just pick something up off my desk
and chuck it.

49
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,617
I'm so sure
you'd let me trash something off your desk.

50
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,955
If you thought it might help, I would.

51
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:07,770
No, thanks.

52
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,509
You're angry with Gabe...

53
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,975
and you're scared because you don't know
what's gonna happen to him.

54
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,448
At this point,
I don't give a flying fuck about him.

55
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,986
You don't really feel that way, do you?

56
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:26,749
No.

57
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,805
I do feel better. Thank you.

58
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,847
He was on one of those package bus tours.

59
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,653
He'd been going on a lot.

60
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,384
Three or four times a year,
ever since Mom died.

61
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,451
Sometimes he went with his friend Pete.
This time he went alone.

62
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,856
They think his heart just gave out.

63
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,057
I'm very sorry.

64
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:15,366
- Where is your father now?
- He's still up there in Seattle.

65
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:21,403
The Columbia Funeral Home's holding him
for us. They're on Rainier Avenue.

66
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:25,878
Not a problem. We can make arrangements
to have him flown back to LA.

67
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,448
- Flown back?
- Yes.

68
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,314
Dad won't fly.

69
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,555
It was always a sore spot with Mom.

70
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,794
She wanted to travel,
but Dad flat out refused.

71
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:43,563
Then, after she died, he started taking
all these package bus tours.

72
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:44,897
He has...

73
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,734
- He had a thing about flying.
- He never flew.

74
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:54,437
- I'm sure, given the circumstances...
- No, it isn't what he would have wanted.

75
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:56,572
Isn't there some other way?

76
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:02,017
We can make arrangements
to have him shipped via rail or freight.

77
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,121
Like FedEx?

78
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,225
- You can do that?
- It's done all the time.

79
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,219
They brought Abraham Lincoln home
to Illinois by train...

80
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,788
all the way from Washington, packed in ice.

81
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,264
It shouldn't be a problem.

82
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:29,643
Keith, I'll be back up here just as soon
as your father's back on his feet.

83
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,511
What if Grandpa dies?

84
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:36,112
My friend Neisha's brother had an operation,
and he died.

85
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:41,021
I told you, Taylor, it's just a hernia.
It's nothing for you to worry about.

86
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,358
I'd sure like to know where the hell Karla is.

87
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:47,057
Is she still up in Oakland with Derek?

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,968
Did she even offer
to come back down here...

89
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,733
and take care of her kid
when you told her you were leaving?

90
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,569
We haven't heard from her.

91
00:07:58,577 --> 00:07:59,805
Jesus.

92
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:03,673
I thought you had a number for her.

93
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,118
- It's been disconnected.
- Shit.

94
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,421
I told you, Keith,
hush that kind of mouth around your niece.

95
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,349
Maybe I should just take the child with me.

96
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,494
She'll be fine, all right?

97
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,395
My new place has an extra room,
and between Eddie and me...

98
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:23,263
- we'll make sure she's...
- I don't wanna come stay with you.

99
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,634
- How come you can't stay here?
- Because my things are at my place.

100
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,538
- What about my stuff?
- You can bring it with you.

101
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,603
You'd probably steal it.

102
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,301
There's my cab.

103
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:38,112
Taylor, come on, honey.
Give your grandma a hug.

104
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,785
I love you, Grandma.

105
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:50,085
Now, you be good,
and you mind your Uncle Keith.

106
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,926
I'll try to come back as fast as I can.

107
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,874
I know a lot worser words than "shit,"
you know.

108
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,013
So do I.

109
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,155
So, how'd the Mossback intake go?

110
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:23,058
We need to find a way to get a body shipped
back from your old stomping ground.

111
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:26,291
Why can't you just fly it back?
That's what your father always did.

112
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,491
Apparently the deceased was afraid
of flying.

113
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,229
I don't think he's gonna give a shit now.

114
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,635
The family doesn't want him to fly, all right?

115
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,037
The freight companies
are backed up until next week.

116
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:39,201
And Amtrak can't bring him back
until next Tuesday.

117
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,938
No problem.

118
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:44,379
I'll fly up, rent a refrigerated van,
and drive him back.

119
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,416
You don't need a refrigerated van,
just a one-way rental.

120
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,953
- He's already been embalmed.
- Even easier.

121
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:54,088
You'd do that? You'd fly up there
and turn around and drive all the way back?

122
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,026
I haven't been back since Christmas.
I can see a few friends.

123
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,995
I still have stuff up there. I'd love to.

124
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:02,363
I suppose we could mark up
the cost of shipping to cover your travel.

125
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,664
- When do you want me to leave?
- Tomorrow?

126
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:05,828
Done.

127
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:14,409
Have you met any nice men recently, David?

128
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,744
No one to speak of.

129
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,610
I wish you'd put yourself out more.

130
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:24,985
The door to your house only opens
from the inside, you know.

131
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:31,318
We haven't seen your friend Gabriel
around much lately, Claire.

132
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,585
So?

133
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,159
Have you not been seeing as much of him?

134
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,327
- No, I haven't.
- Did you two have a falling-out?

135
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,436
Yeah, Gabe joined the Hare Krishna, okay?

136
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:44,771
Those people with the orange robes
and tambourines?

137
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:48,244
That try to sell you books in the airport.
Yeah, that's them.

138
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,541
Oh, my goodness!

139
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,951
- He never struck me as a religious person.
- He is now, big-time.

140
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,414
- Did he shave his head?
- Yeah, he shaved his head.

141
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,289
Can we talk about something else, please?

142
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:06,529
Claire, do you want to come to Seattle
with me?

143
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,831
You're asking me to come to Seattle
with you?

144
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,392
Yeah, why not?

145
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,673
I'm not sure we can stick the Mossbacks
with two plane tickets.

146
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,605
- I'll pay for it.
- You will?

147
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,769
Yeah. I could use the company.

148
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:22,870
- You could help me drive on the way back.
- She'll miss school.

149
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,178
We're not doing anything I can't miss,
and I can bring my homework.

150
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,219
It's just for a couple of days.

151
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,680
Fine.

152
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,359
I'm tired of trying to be the architect
for this family.

153
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:38,328
It's high time you drew your own blueprints.

154
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,934
Does anyone know
what the fuck she's talking about anymore?

155
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,505
- Nate.
- What?

156
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,215
By the way,
I'm flying up to Seattle tomorrow.

157
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,848
- You are?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,962
I'm picking up a body
and driving it back for David.

159
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,124
- I'm gonna take Claire with me.
- Sounds like fun.

160
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,069
You don't mind that I didn't ask you?

161
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,401
- Ask me what?
- To go with me.

162
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,876
- No, not at all.
- Good.

163
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,936
You sure?

164
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,806
Nate, I'm trying to read...

165
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,853
and you know I hate it
when you floss in front of me.

166
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,983
Sorry.

167
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,990
Is it weird I didn't ask you
to come to Seattle with me?

168
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,156
No, why would it be?

169
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:50,465
I don't know. It just feels a little weird.

170
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,366
Okay, now it is a little weird.

171
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,201
But only because
you're making it a little weird.

172
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:58,071
- But you're not mad about it?
- Not at all.

173
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,608
I think it's really good for you,
spending some time with your sister.

174
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,442
That's what I think.

175
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:19,928
- You sure it's not too weird?
- God, Nate, give it a rest.

176
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,961
- Good night, Bren.
- Good night.

177
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:55,832
Cool! Sleater-Kinney's playing
at this place called Showbox tonight.

178
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,336
I hate to break it to you,
but Showbox is 18 and over.

179
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:03,331
What makes you think
I don't have a fake I.D.?

180
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,406
You have a fake I.D.?

181
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:09,013
You're not gonna pull some
pseudo-parental bullshit on me, are you?

182
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,947
No. I had a fake I.D. Once, too.

183
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,984
Maybe I'll go with you.

184
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:18,587
- I don't need a babysitter, Nate.
- I love Sleater-Kinney.

185
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,991
You love Sleater-Kinney?

186
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:28,095
Will you try to get over yourself for a second
and let me be your friend and your brother?

187
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:36,672
Did you bring me on this trip because
you thought I needed a little distraction?

188
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:39,642
I invited you because I thought it'd be fun
to bring you along.

189
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,009
Now I'm having second thoughts.

190
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,040
I believe you.

191
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,913
- So where are we staying, anyway?
- My friend Lisa's.

192
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,290
- Is she an old girlfriend?
- No.

193
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,362
No way, not even close.

194
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,597
We were strictly roommates, nothing more.

195
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,301
Worked at the co-op together.

196
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,899
Is she all crunchy-granola...

197
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,669
backpacky, and way into grunge?

198
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,146
Crunchy-granola: Maybe a little.

199
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:17,943
Backpacky: Definitely.

200
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,008
Into grunge: No way.

201
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,780
Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did.

202
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:24,717
Besides, Lisa is...

203
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,086
It's not too easy to categorize.

204
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,489
You guys did it a few times, though, right?

205
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,930
- We're not having this discussion.
- Fine.

206
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:55,977
This is it.

207
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,248
Sweet.

208
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,231
- It's so good to have you back home.
- It's good to be back.

209
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,361
Lisa, this is my sister, Claire.

210
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,307
Come in.

211
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,531
Hello, Hiram? It's me, Ruth.

212
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,969
I'm fine. How are you?

213
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:26,669
Listen, the reason why I'm calling is...

214
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,849
I just wanted to let you know that I've been
drafting a new blueprint for myself.

215
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,717
No, not for the house.

216
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,386
Yes, it is for the house. My house.

217
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,155
I mean, not the actual physical structure
I live in with my family.

218
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,322
I'm speaking
more of the emotional structure...

219
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,866
in which I've chosen to live my life.

220
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,738
I most certainly have not been drinking.

221
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,473
I'm just trying to let you know, Hiram...

222
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,543
that I harbor no hard feelings against you.

223
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,443
No, I do not want to get back together.

224
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,310
How presumptuous!

225
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,184
You know something, Hiram? Fuck off!

226
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,161
Amelia? It's Ruth.

227
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,823
I know we haven't seen each other
in a while...

228
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,028
and I feel a little funny leaving this
on your machine...

229
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,504
but I just wanted to let you know...

230
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,733
I've been drafting a new blueprint
for myself.

231
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:36,172
And if you're ever looking
for an opportunity to renew our friendship...

232
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,477
my front door is open to you.

233
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,907
That's all I wanted to say.

234
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,818
You can call me back if you want to, okay?

235
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,979
Bye!

236
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,690
Sarah, are you there?

237
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,455
If you're there, pick up.

238
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,536
Okay, fine. I know we don't talk
to each other very much anymore...

239
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:03,836
but I left you three messages in two weeks
and you haven't returned any of my calls.

240
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:07,605
I think you don't ever want to
talk to me again, and if that's the case...

241
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,873
we really need to talk!

242
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:14,514
There are things I'd like to say to you
about the cracks in my foundation...

243
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,315
and your part in helping me repair them.

244
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,046
This is your sister, Ruth.

245
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,702
What do you mean, you can't?

246
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,866
Eddie, I need you
to pick up Taylor from school.

247
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,876
Look, I realize you're in the middle
of a shift.

248
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,641
Can't you get somebody to cover for you?

249
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:46,815
I'm caught between a rock
and a fucking hard place here.

250
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,079
I need you to do this for me.

251
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,316
All right, never mind. Fuck it, then.

252
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,789
This is a bullshit detail.

253
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,383
I wish the guy would just shoot her
and get it over with.

254
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,894
I've got tickets for the Dodgers tonight.

255
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:01,854
What did I say?

256
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,869
Listen, I've got a huge favor to ask.

257
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,778
What is it?

258
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,777
I'm stuck in Koreatown.

259
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:21,409
Some guy's
holding his mother-in-law hostage.

260
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:24,249
He claims she put his TV remote
down a garbage disposal.

261
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:27,655
<i>I don't know when I'll be out of here.</i>
<i>Eddie's pulling a double shift.</i>

262
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,484
I hate to ask...

263
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,695
but is there any way
that you can pick up Taylor...

264
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,231
from Bridgebrook Elementary at 3:00?

265
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,665
Yes. I mean, sure. I'd be glad to.

266
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,330
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yes, of course.

267
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,901
All right, thanks.

268
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,506
<i>I'll call ahead to the school</i>
<i>so they'll be expecting you.</i>

269
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:50,212
<i>- I'll pick Taylor up from your place later.</i>
- Great.

270
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,744
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

271
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,416
No problem.

272
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,297
- What is this?
- Tofu meatloaf.

273
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,137
It's completely vegan.

274
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,175
No dairy, no eggs.
No animal products of any kind.

275
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,444
- No meat?
- None whatsoever.

276
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,515
Why do you call it "meatloaf"?

277
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,917
You're a pisser just like your brother,
aren't you?

278
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,452
- Anyway, it used to be his favorite.
- It's delicious, Lisa.

279
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,055
I didn't put in too much garlic?

280
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,096
- Not for me.
- No way.

281
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,227
Garlic is a miracle herb.

282
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,563
It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.

283
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,101
It stimulates the immune system...

284
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,366
and inhibits the growth of parasites
in the intestines.

285
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,270
So, how's life at the co-op?

286
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:55,972
Our membership is up 15% since you left...

287
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,811
in spite of the corporate outfits
breathing down our necks.

288
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:02,011
- Wow, sounds like things are going great.
- We miss you.

289
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,353
You should stop in
and say hello while you're here.

290
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:09,788
- So, how's life back in LA?
- It's okay.

291
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:14,294
What can I say? I may have finally
found something I'm good at.

292
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:17,766
- I always knew you had a spiritual calling.
- Yeah, right.

293
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:23,999
What? Being a funeral director
is proof of a spiritual calling?

294
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:29,511
It's not exactly what I imagined for Nate,
but it doesn't surprise me.

295
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,517
Nothing ever surprises you, Lisa.

296
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:39,012
That's true.

297
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,729
So, last time I spoke to you,
back in January...

298
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,890
I suppose, you had met somebody?

299
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,791
- Brenda.
- Yeah.

300
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,300
Anything ever happen with that?

301
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,036
We're still together.

302
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,901
Wow! Eight months.

303
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,810
That's gotta be an all-time record
for you, Nate.

304
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,313
It might be.

305
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,942
Sounds like a real relationship to me.

306
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:08,814
What can I say?

307
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,215
It is what it is.

308
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,387
I mean, for me, for where I am at right now,
it's a good thing.

309
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:20,322
- It's all good.
- It is. It's all...

310
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,662
well, mostly, you know, good.

311
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:29,573
I'm really happy for you, Nate.

312
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,874
You know, I got offered a job in LA.

313
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,211
- Really?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:41,683
Some big-time producer
came through town shooting a movie.

315
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:44,414
She's looking for a vegan chef,
and she offered me a job.

316
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:46,217
Really, what movie?

317
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:49,792
I'm not good with titles.
I don't go to the movies.

318
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,421
Film is processed with gelatin.
Gelatin comes from horses' hooves.

319
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:56,295
- I didn't know that.
- Most people don't.

320
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,892
Hence the global slavery of animals.

321
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,600
- Were you thinking about taking the job?
- I don't know.

322
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,540
I mean, LA is such a godless place.

323
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,910
Besides, my life is really full here.

324
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,447
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah.

325
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:20,081
It's down the hall, first door on the left.

326
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,894
- She's a lot like you.
- You think?

327
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,259
God, I've missed you, Nate.

328
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,760
I've missed you, too.

329
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,170
Give me a break.

330
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:13,175
I think you totally cleared out my sinuses.

331
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:15,868
Not too hard?

332
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,608
Some of my clients find me a little intense.

333
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,711
Not at all.

334
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,152
I love it.

335
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,219
It feels great.

336
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,594
I have to say you're pretty loose.

337
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,428
Not a lot of tension in the usual places.

338
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,901
I'm curious. Melissa, what do you do?

339
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:47,777
I'm just asking because I'm thinking
about changing professions...

340
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:50,345
and I'm curious.

341
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,577
I'm a prostitute.

342
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,348
No shit?

343
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,319
No shit.

344
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,186
Cool.

345
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,405
I'm making a cup of tea. Want one?

346
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:22,139
I'd love to, but I've gotta get to work.

347
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,548
- Same time next week?
- Absolutely.

348
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:32,786
- I'll see you.
- See you.

349
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:39,728
- Hello?
<i>- Bren. Hi, honey. It's Mom.</i>

350
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,293
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa.</i>
<i>I need you to meet me over here.</i>

351
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,995
- Why?
<i>- Sweetheart, it's an emergency.</i>

352
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,163
<i>- I need you over here, please.</i>
- What's happened?

353
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:51,469
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa, Brenda, in La Cañada.</i>

354
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,703
<i>I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.</i>

355
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,243
Brenda! Don't go in there.

356
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:02,842
Mother, let go of my fucking arm.
You're hurting me!

357
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,717
This is your father's car.

358
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,287
So Dad's here. Who cares?

359
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:10,020
He's not here. He's at work. I checked.

360
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,388
Look on the dash.

361
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,393
Your father doesn't smoke Virginia Slims.

362
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:20,802
Look on the gear shift.

363
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,035
A scrunchie. Big fucking deal!

364
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:30,877
Your father hasn't had enough hair
to need a scrunchie since 19<i>7</i>5!

365
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,348
- So you think Dad's fucking somebody.
- Bingo!

366
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,783
Oh, my God, is that all this is?

367
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,979
I thought you'd heard from the hospital
that something happened to Billy.

368
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,252
Don't be so dramatic, Brenda.

369
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,795
I have to go downstairs
and work for a little while.

370
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:54,064
Do you have everything you need?

371
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,498
Can I have some chocolate milk?

372
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,566
I'm sorry. We don't have any chocolate milk.

373
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,276
I want some goddamn chocolate milk.

374
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,174
I'm sorry, but we only have white milk.

375
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,653
Ain't you got any other cookies
besides these?

376
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:12,154
Those are all we have.

377
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:15,055
I don't like these kind.
These kind taste like shit.

378
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,061
Then just color in your coloring books,
and I'll check in on you in a bit.

379
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:20,960
I don't like coloring books.

380
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:26,526
- You picked them out at the drugstore.
- You told me I had to.

381
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:30,164
- I thought you liked coloring books.
- I don't. I told you I like to draw.

382
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,764
Then draw.

383
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,747
These are coloring books.

384
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,106
You can't draw in coloring books...

385
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:42,778
because they already have
the drawings in them.

386
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,447
You can only color in coloring books.

387
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:48,090
That's why they're called coloring books.

388
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,665
- You wanna watch TV?
- Okay.

389
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:06,034
- You know how to use that?
- What do you think, I'm stupid?

390
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,102
- I didn't say you're stupid.
- I know how to use a remote.

391
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,204
Fine, knock yourself out.

392
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,677
Dumb-ass cracker.

393
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:19,155
Man, I am starving for a cheeseburger.

394
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:22,386
I want something that walked the earth,
with the works.

395
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,393
Man, I'm having a double.

396
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,957
I thought you liked the meatless meatloaf.

397
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,066
- I lied.
- No shit.

398
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,597
And what's with the "it is what it is"...

399
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:38,664
purposely vague bullshit
about you and Brenda?

400
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,306
I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings, okay?

401
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,343
You definitely slept with her.

402
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,248
Okay, yes.

403
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:55,054
We had occasional sex together,
but it was strictly on a friendship basis.

404
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,854
You were fuck-buddies?

405
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,287
Yeah.

406
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,961
- And nothing more.
- Does Lisa know that?

407
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:06,859
You know what?

408
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:11,703
Every time we did have sex,
and I'm talking about five, six times, tops...

409
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:16,909
I was very honest with her
about what it meant and what it didn't mean.

410
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:22,548
- She's got it bad for you.
- I was always honest with Lisa.

411
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:24,951
- Lf you say so.
- What do you want?

412
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:29,959
I want a Chubby Cheese with everything,
medium skinny fries, and a Coke.

413
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:35,121
My God, do you smell that?

414
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,831
What, burgers and fries?

415
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:40,301
No, it's like rotten eggs! Jesus!

416
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:43,506
Oh, man, déjà fucking vu.

417
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:47,599
<i>Welcome to Chubby's.</i>
<i>May I take your order?</i>

418
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:51,444
Yeah, I'll have a double Chubby...

419
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,812
I'll have a double Chubby cheeseburger.
Fuck me!

420
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,923
<i>- Was that one or two cheeseburgers?</i>
- Jesus, my head!

421
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:07,085
Fuck!

422
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:20,905
Nate, are you okay?

423
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:33,787
<i>Sir, I didn't get that.</i>
<i>Can I take your order, please?</i>

424
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:41,629
<i>Hello, sir?</i>

425
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,470
You drive.

426
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,806
I'm gonna get some air
and make a phone call.

427
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:55,867
Okay.

428
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,854
<i>- I didn't get that. Please repeat your order.</i>
- Shut up.

429
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,969
Yeah, is Dr. DiPaolo in?

430
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,107
Yeah, it's definitely an emergency.

431
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,547
<i>- Can I take your order, please?</i>
- Shut the fuck up!

432
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:36,245
<i>I'm going to have to contact the manager.</i>

433
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,520
I can't believe I'm doing this.

434
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,419
Can't we at least go inside?

435
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:46,792
I could get a seaweed wrap
while I pretend to listen to you.

436
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,056
That couldn't be her.

437
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,963
I'm eating your protein bar.

438
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:53,802
Maybe it is.

439
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:59,665
This is like eating upholstery.

440
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:03,176
I knew it.

441
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,748
Bern couldn't get anyone that good-Iooking
to jump his saggy ass.

442
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:17,820
I thought you and Dad had an agreement
about this sort of thing.

443
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:21,120
We did. We do.

444
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:25,731
Only this time he broke one of the rules.
He didn't tell me first.

445
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,361
So you're not upset
Dad's fucking somebody else.

446
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:31,373
You're upset he didn't tell you
he was fucking somebody else.

447
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:32,703
That's right.

448
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,939
The rule is,
if you step outside the holy bonds...

449
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,072
you have to tell your wife first.

450
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:42,744
So she can line up some young hottie
of her own.

451
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:52,525
I guess that sounds fair.

452
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,361
You have other rules?

453
00:33:56,933 --> 00:34:01,370
- Yeah, a whole slew of them.
- Go on, tell me. I'm curious.

454
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:10,003
You can't fuck my friends, I can't fuck yours.

455
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:13,412
No fucking of mutual friends.
Never in Hawaii.

456
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:16,750
Never in a hotel
that costs more than $300 a night.

457
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,983
And never in a hotel
that's under $<i>7</i>5 a night.

458
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:25,586
Not on holidays.

459
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:30,124
There are others. I just can't remember
all of them at the moment.

460
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:32,226
Is one of them:

461
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,998
"Never fuck anybody else
in front of your kids"?

462
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,166
I guess not. Since there was that time
I saw you in the hot tub...

463
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,833
with some old guy with a hairy back.

464
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,208
Darling, your father was there.

465
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,908
And there was absolutely no penetration,
I can assure you of that.

466
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:50,282
- I'll bet that wasn't your choice.
- And you were supposed to be in bed.

467
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,490
I was only gone a couple of hours, Rico.

468
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,354
Every hour you're gone
is an hour I have to stay late.

469
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,193
I'm sorry about your buddy's kid,
but I have kids of my own.

470
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:05,257
Is this about us not giving you the loan
for the house?

471
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:09,169
Because you never used to complain
about having to work a little overtime.

472
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:13,471
This is about me not wanting to be
taken advantage of by my employers.

473
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:17,741
- We're more than just your employers...
- That's bullshit, David, and you know it.

474
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:21,875
When it's convenient, we're like family.
But in a pinch, I'm just an employee...

475
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:24,477
and you and Nate are just my bosses.

476
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,847
Hey, little lady.

477
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:30,990
Taylor, I told you to wait upstairs.

478
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:33,722
- My tummy hurts.
- Let's go.

479
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:36,056
Is that man dead?

480
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:41,995
That man was totally dead.

481
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:48,744
Yes, that man was totally dead.

482
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,910
- Did you kill him?
- No.

483
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:56,484
- Did that other man in there kill him?
- No.

484
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:59,215
He died of natural causes.

485
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,686
My friend Renee said
sooner or later we'll all be dead.

486
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,796
That's true.

487
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:11,967
So someday I'll be dead,
laying on a table like that?

488
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:14,094
Not for a very, very long time.

489
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:19,272
My mom says my dad's good as dead
as far as she's concerned.

490
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:28,281
That's just her way of expressing anger
at him for not being around.

491
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:32,778
Sometimes my mom says
she wishes she was dead.

492
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:39,128
That's just something that people say
when they're upset about something.

493
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,393
Did that dead man in there have any kids?

494
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:47,362
Yeah, he had a wife and three children
and five grandchildren.

495
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:52,831
- I don't ever want to die.
- Me, neither.

496
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:03,910
It's called arteriovenous malformation.
AVM, for short.

497
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,188
Lots of people have it their whole lives
and never even know.

498
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,748
And the pills?

499
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,985
They're an anti-seizure medication.

500
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,863
So what happened to you,
that was a seizure?

501
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,196
Sort of.

502
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,867
- Sort of?
- It was a mild seizure.

503
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,176
- Does David know about this?
- Yes, he does.

504
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:30,671
I don't want Mom to know
'cause she'll just freak out. All right?

505
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:32,544
It's no big deal, I promise.

506
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,978
People don't just spaz out...

507
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:40,022
and hork all over their shoes
for no good reason.

508
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,456
Two words: Tofu meatloaf.

509
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:48,694
Besides, now I have these pills
it'll be totally under control.

510
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:50,790
- You swear?
- I swear.

511
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:55,262
I just have to take them
for the rest of my life is all.

512
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:58,836
I don't believe you.

513
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:01,536
Just do me a favor
and don't tell David about this.

514
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,545
This client of mine's a prostitute.

515
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:16,353
- Is that supposed to shock me?
- What?

516
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:20,160
God, not everything is about you.

517
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:23,564
You're such a classic narcissist.

518
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:27,865
Just because your parents are shrinks
doesn't mean you know about psychology.

519
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:32,374
Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean
that you're not out of your fucking mind.

520
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,777
I've treated several prostitutes
over the years...

521
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,577
and they're not as uncommon
as you'd think...

522
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:44,784
That's her.

523
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:49,881
She's your age. I have to talk to her.

524
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:53,122
- Mom, don't. Please don't.
- No, wait.

525
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:55,662
I'm not angry.
I'm not going to make a scene.

526
00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:59,896
I just need to personalize the experience
and humanize the situation.

527
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:03,104
- It's for all of us.
- You'll just regret it.

528
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:06,000
Miss!

529
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:10,337
Hello, I'm Margaret, Bern's wife.

530
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,414
You know, Bern and I have
a really open relationship...

531
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:17,282
and I just want you to know
it's okay with me.

532
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:20,915
I'd love to chat,
but I've gotta go meet Bern for lunch. Sorry.

533
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,862
Get off, you bitch! I can't believe you!

534
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,998
- Get off of me!
- Fine.

535
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,536
You slut!

536
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,795
Psycho!

537
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,669
I'll see you in hell.

538
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,741
I hope you like herpes.

539
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:59,317
You know, I thought she'd be more evolved.

540
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,055
Evolved?

541
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:04,225
Mother, you just attacked
that woman repeatedly.

542
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:08,432
- She could have you thrown in jail.
- I seriously doubt that.

543
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,098
Are you hungry?

544
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,501
Why am I here?

545
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,009
Why was it necessary
for me to be here with you for this?

546
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,149
Because you needed a fucking audience.

547
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:29,216
- Not everything's about you, Brenda.
- Look at Mommy.

548
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,850
Isn't Mommy pretty?

549
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:35,227
Isn't Mommy fabulous and free-spirited
and uninhibited?

550
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:38,732
Validate Mommy, kids,
because she's incapable of doing it herself.

551
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,532
No wonder Billy ended up in a psych ward.
Not that you care.

552
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:45,506
For your information, Miss High and Mighty,
this is life.

553
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:47,609
People have crises.

554
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:51,704
They push each other's buttons.
They inflict pain on one another.

555
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:56,343
And once in a fucking blue moon,
they bring out the best in each other.

556
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:00,251
But mostly, they bring out the worst.

557
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:05,590
- You're pathetic.
- Don't you dare judge me.

558
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:07,960
You think you're the paragon
of mental health...

559
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:11,592
just because you've been dating
the same man for the past few months?

560
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:14,967
That's real,
compared to what your father and I have?

561
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:18,172
- You're just jealous.
- Of what?

562
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,601
The fact that I haven't allowed you
to totally destroy my life...

563
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:23,145
like you have everybody else's.

564
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,544
What life?

565
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:30,182
You've spent 32 years
being your little brother's nursemaid...

566
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:31,242
Fuck you!

567
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,552
...to avoid having any emotional life
of your own.

568
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:38,225
And now that he's been put away...

569
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:40,524
you're gonna have
to face your own demons.

570
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,498
And, sweetheart, they're legion.

571
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:53,836
Get out of my car.

572
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,743
I would be happy to.

573
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:16,230
I hope you like pork roast
and mashed potatoes.

574
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,731
They're okay.

575
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:22,060
- Where are you going, dear?
- To watch TV.

576
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:25,936
In this house we eat dinner at the table.

577
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:29,409
- You don't watch TV while you eat?
- No, we don't.

578
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:33,443
Maybe we can watch some TV
when we're done eating.

579
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,589
- So, what grade are you in, Taylor?
- Fourth.

580
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,656
David was in the fourth grade once.

581
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,264
It's true.

582
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:56,466
Did you know David
used to be my Uncle Keith's boyfriend?

583
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:00,172
Yes, I did.

584
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:07,009
Sometimes my momma calls my Uncle Keith
a punk-ass fudgepacker...

585
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,313
'cause he likes men instead of women.

586
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:13,447
I guess that makes you
a punk-ass fudgepacker, too, don't it?

587
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:16,917
We don't use those kinds of words
at this table.

588
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,495
- We don't use those kinds of words at all.
- How come?

589
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:25,293
- Because those words are...
- Hateful. Those are hateful words.

590
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:27,667
What words do you use?

591
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:32,839
Homosexual.

592
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:40,510
My Uncle Keith has a new boyfriend.
His name's Eddie.

593
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:44,253
He drives an ambulance.
But I don't like him too much.

594
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:45,980
Why not?

595
00:43:46,522 --> 00:43:50,583
He looks at himself in the mirror a lot,
and he talks to me like I'm stupid.

596
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,793
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

597
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,131
It is true.

598
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:01,836
Some people just don't know
how to talk to children.

599
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,597
Tell me about it.

600
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:14,278
I think I'll start the dishes.

601
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,396
It's time for you to leave now.

602
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:32,923
Go!

603
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:49,879
- Is everything okay?
- Claire, I thought you were taking a nap.

604
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,147
I was reading.

605
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,620
- Where's Nate?
- He's outside making a phone call.

606
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,520
Who were you talking to?

607
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,058
Ants.

608
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,462
I'm being overrun by them.

609
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:10,432
At first I tried setting a little food aside
for them next to the back door.

610
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:13,703
Then I tried coaxing them out
with some citrus oil.

611
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:16,142
Now I'm trying to reason with them.

612
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:22,080
At home, my dad used to squirt them
with lighter fluid and torch them.

613
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,953
I'm not still in love with your brother,
if that's what you're thinking.

614
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,120
Actually, I wasn't thinking that.

615
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:37,399
I used to be.

616
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:42,092
I used to think one day he would realize
I was the one for him.

617
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,763
He never has.

618
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:47,804
Do you think he ever will?

619
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,671
I'm probably not the person
to be asking that question.

620
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:58,816
He's my brother, but to tell you the truth,
I'm just getting to know the guy.

621
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,648
He's a heartbreaker, that's for sure.

622
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:05,192
There are a dozen women all over Seattle...

623
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:07,855
who would freak
if they knew he was back here.

624
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,700
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- No, I don't.

625
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:17,331
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

626
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:20,541
Not anymore.

627
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:23,210
We broke up.

628
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,911
You're better off, trust me.

629
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,552
Fucking ants.

630
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,388
I just wanted to hear how your day went.

631
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:38,056
My mother practically beat the shit
out of a woman in a parking lot...

632
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,061
<i>but apart from that, I'm fine.</i>

633
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:42,993
<i>- How's Seattle?</i>
- Seattle's good.

634
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:45,727
Your mother tried
to beat the shit out of somebody?

635
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,067
I really don't feel like reliving that right now.

636
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,569
How's it going with Claire?

637
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,041
Great. We're getting along great.

638
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:57,972
Is everything okay?

639
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,514
I just have a headache.

640
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:06,554
We're gonna hit the road first thing
in the morning.

641
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:09,186
Okay, I'll see you, then.

642
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:14,754
I just ran a bath and it's getting cold, so...

643
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:17,397
I miss you.

644
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:21,761
I miss you, too.

645
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:11,980
You never called.

646
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:16,153
How did you know where I live?

647
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,621
That's not really important.

648
00:48:22,965 --> 00:48:24,728
I think maybe it is.

649
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,399
You wanna know what's really important?

650
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:34,770
Show me.

651
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,516
Did she give you a hard time?

652
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:23,523
Not really.

653
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:29,054
Let me grab her,
and we'll get out of your way.

654
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:38,496
Thanks again.

655
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,700
It's no problem whatsoever.

656
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:43,543
She's a great kid, Keith. She really is.

657
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:47,571
Considering everything she's been put
through, it's kind of a miracle.

658
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,018
We should go.

659
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,528
- Good night, David.
- Good night.

660
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:30,987
I thought you might need an extra quilt.

661
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:34,186
It gets cold in this room.

662
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:35,825
Excellent.

663
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,004
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

664
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,431
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

665
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,100
Yeah. I'm good.

666
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:54,105
You can't fool me, Nate. I know you too well.

667
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:57,979
I'm fine.

668
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:15,868
Poor baby.

669
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:19,698
It's okay. I'm here.

670
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:22,074
I'm right here.

671
00:51:23,212 --> 00:51:24,338
It's okay.

672
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:44,997
- Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?
- I'm good. I never eat breakfast.

673
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,627
Lisa, have you seen
my old brown flannel shirt?

674
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:52,162
I'm pretty sure it got donated
to the co-op garage sale.

675
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:55,641
Here it is.

676
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:00,179
I love that shirt. It's so Nate.

677
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,981
- Why don't you hang on to it?
- No, I couldn't.

678
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:07,954
I want you to have it.

679
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:11,254
- What would I want with your shirt?
- Would you just keep it?

680
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,788
We should probably hit the road
and pick up Mr. Mossback.

681
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,127
Right.

682
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,297
As always, it's been great seeing you.

683
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:30,573
- Take care of yourself, Nate.
- You, too.

684
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:35,947
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, Claire.

685
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:46,695
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

686
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:56,494
Morning, Mom.

687
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:00,809
It's awfully quiet around here
with Nate and Claire being gone.

688
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,002
I suppose it is.

689
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:08,271
What time did your friend come by
to pick up his niece?

690
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:10,877
1:30.

691
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:14,415
That's awfully late
for a child her age to be up.

692
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,617
She was asleep on the sun porch.

693
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:26,526
- Is there something you'd like to say to me?
- No.

694
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,394
Yes, there is.

695
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:33,873
I'm all ears.

696
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,813
Your father used to say that to me
all the time. "I'm all ears."

697
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:42,909
Sometimes you remind me of him.

698
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,249
What's on your mind?

699
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:52,388
You have to be careful with children...

700
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:56,555
because their blueprints are being drafted
by the adults in their lives.

701
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:58,600
And this little girl...

702
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,235
It seems to me that her foundation
is probably unstable enough...

703
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:06,206
without you bringing your...

704
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,305
My what?

705
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:14,442
Your relationship with her uncle,
you have to admit...

706
00:54:14,516 --> 00:54:17,212
might be a little confusing
to someone her age.

707
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:26,822
I'm happy for you if this whole plan thing
of yours has enabled you...

708
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:29,159
to draft your own blueprint...

709
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,496
or patch up some of the cracks
in your foundation.

710
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:37,462
But just between you and me,
you're starting to sound like a crazy person.

711
00:54:38,474 --> 00:54:40,772
I think it's time you kept
that shit to yourself...

712
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:43,403
and minded your own fucking business.

713
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:09,693
Thank you.

714
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:26,683
It's a little weird driving a dead guy
all the way back to LA.

715
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:29,349
It's only weird if you make it weird.

716
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:34,586
- It's a little weird.
- It's not.

717
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:41,932
You know, Nate, I don't know why...

718
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:45,637
but it's comforting to know
you're just as fucked up as the rest of us.

719
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,336
I'm not anywhere near as fucked up
as the rest of you.

720
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,105
- You are.
- I'm not.

721
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:53,711
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up and drive.
