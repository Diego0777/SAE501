1
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,973
<i>Pike Place Market was born in 1907...</i>

2
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,841
<i>from citizen outrage</i>
<i>at the high cost of produce...</i>

3
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,507
<i>when Seattle City Councilman</i>
<i>Thomas Revelle...</i>

4
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,982
<i>proposed a public street market.</i>

5
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,881
<i>On opening day, August 7, 1907...</i>

6
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,755
<i>eight farmers brought their wagons</i>
<i>to the corner of 1st and Pike...</i>

7
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,693
<i>and were overwhelmed</i>
<i>by an estimated 10,000 eager shoppers.</i>

8
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,798
<i>By 11.00 a.m. They were completely sold out.</i>

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,035
<i>That concludes the morning half of our tour.</i>

10
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,196
<i>Once again, my name's Karen.</i>

11
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,604
<i>You've been a superduper group</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

12
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,542
<i>We'll see you back here on the bus at 1.30.</i>

13
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,075
Thank you, Karen.

14
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,212
I don't know about you,
but I could sure use a fucking cigarette.

15
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,183
Come on, dear.

16
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,381
Bye.

17
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,785
Excuse me, sir?

18
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,494
<i>Sir, it's lunchtime.</i>

19
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,093
<i>You can get off the bus now.</i>
<i>We're at Pike Place Market.</i>

20
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,605
Shit!

21
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,750
We've got another dead one
back here, Larry.

22
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,499
You missed your last three sessions.

23
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:27,106
Sometimes coming in here talking about
my life gets in the way of me having one.

24
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,608
So why did you bother coming in today?

25
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,546
Because they sent a letter to my mother
and threatened to suspend me if I didn't.

26
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,176
I thought you had something
you wanted to talk about.

27
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,117
With you? Yeah, right.

28
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,714
Are you angry with me?

29
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,386
How can you tell?

30
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,959
I was obligated to cooperate
with the police, Claire. It's my job.

31
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,225
Just so you know,
I was here for you, not for them.

32
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,566
They wanted to interrogate you alone.

33
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,296
And they haven't found him yet,
in case you're curious.

34
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,667
I'm not.

35
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,638
You haven't heard from him?

36
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,479
Fuck, no. Not that I'd tell you if I had.

37
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,519
You did the right thing
when you called the police that night.

38
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,214
I know I did the right thing.

39
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,780
This isn't about whether or not
I did the right thing.

40
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,258
Given the circumstances,
it's fully understandable...

41
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,488
that you're feeling this angry, Claire.

42
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,294
If you don't stop saying my name
at the end of every sentence, I am gonna...

43
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,358
- What?
- I don't know.

44
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,002
Just don't, okay?

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,339
You feel like throwing something?

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,280
Excuse me?

47
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,781
You could, you know.

48
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,412
Just pick something up off my desk
and chuck it.

49
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,417
I'm so sure
you'd let me trash something off your desk.

50
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,755
If you thought it might help, I would.

51
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,570
No, thanks.

52
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,309
You're angry with Gabe...

53
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,775
and you're scared because you don't know
what's gonna happen to him.

54
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,248
At this point,
I don't give a flying fuck about him.

55
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,786
You don't really feel that way, do you?

56
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,549
No.

57
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,605
I do feel better. Thank you.

58
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,647
He was on one of those package bus tours.

59
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,453
He'd been going on a lot.

60
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,184
Three or four times a year,
ever since Mom died.

61
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,251
Sometimes he went with his friend Pete.
This time he went alone.

62
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,656
They think his heart just gave out.

63
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,857
I'm very sorry.

64
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:14,166
- Where is your father now?
- He's still up there in Seattle.

65
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,203
The Columbia Funeral Home's holding him
for us. They're on Rainier Avenue.

66
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:24,678
Not a problem. We can make arrangements
to have him flown back to LA.

67
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,248
- Flown back?
- Yes.

68
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,114
Dad won't fly.

69
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,355
It was always a sore spot with Mom.

70
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,594
She wanted to travel,
but Dad flat out refused.

71
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:42,363
Then, after she died, he started taking
all these package bus tours.

72
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,697
He has...

73
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,534
- He had a thing about flying.
- He never flew.

74
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:53,237
- I'm sure, given the circumstances...
- No, it isn't what he would have wanted.

75
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,372
Isn't there some other way?

76
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,817
We can make arrangements
to have him shipped via rail or freight.

77
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,921
Like FedEx?

78
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,025
- You can do that?
- It's done all the time.

79
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,019
They brought Abraham Lincoln home
to Illinois by train...

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,588
all the way from Washington, packed in ice.

81
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,064
It shouldn't be a problem.

82
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:28,443
Keith, I'll be back up here just as soon
as your father's back on his feet.

83
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,311
What if Grandpa dies?

84
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,912
My friend Neisha's brother had an operation,
and he died.

85
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,821
I told you, Taylor, it's just a hernia.
It's nothing for you to worry about.

86
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,158
I'd sure like to know where the hell Karla is.

87
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,857
Is she still up in Oakland with Derek?

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,768
Did she even offer
to come back down here...

89
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,533
and take care of her kid
when you told her you were leaving?

90
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,369
We haven't heard from her.

91
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,605
Jesus.

92
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,473
I thought you had a number for her.

93
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,918
- It's been disconnected.
- Shit.

94
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,221
I told you, Keith,
hush that kind of mouth around your niece.

95
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,149
Maybe I should just take the child with me.

96
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,294
She'll be fine, all right?

97
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,195
My new place has an extra room,
and between Eddie and me...

98
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,063
- we'll make sure she's...
- I don't wanna come stay with you.

99
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,434
- How come you can't stay here?
- Because my things are at my place.

100
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,338
- What about my stuff?
- You can bring it with you.

101
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,403
You'd probably steal it.

102
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,101
There's my cab.

103
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,912
Taylor, come on, honey.
Give your grandma a hug.

104
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,585
I love you, Grandma.

105
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,885
Now, you be good,
and you mind your Uncle Keith.

106
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,726
I'll try to come back as fast as I can.

107
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,674
I know a lot worser words than "shit,"
you know.

108
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,813
So do I.

109
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,955
So, how'd the Mossback intake go?

110
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,858
We need to find a way to get a body shipped
back from your old stomping ground.

111
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,091
Why can't you just fly it back?
That's what your father always did.

112
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,291
Apparently the deceased was afraid
of flying.

113
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,029
I don't think he's gonna give a shit now.

114
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,435
The family doesn't want him to fly, all right?

115
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,837
The freight companies
are backed up until next week.

116
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,001
And Amtrak can't bring him back
until next Tuesday.

117
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,738
No problem.

118
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,179
I'll fly up, rent a refrigerated van,
and drive him back.

119
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,216
You don't need a refrigerated van,
just a one-way rental.

120
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,753
- He's already been embalmed.
- Even easier.

121
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,888
You'd do that? You'd fly up there
and turn around and drive all the way back?

122
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,826
I haven't been back since Christmas.
I can see a few friends.

123
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,795
I still have stuff up there. I'd love to.

124
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,163
I suppose we could mark up
the cost of shipping to cover your travel.

125
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,464
- When do you want me to leave?
- Tomorrow?

126
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,628
Done.

127
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,209
Have you met any nice men recently, David?

128
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,544
No one to speak of.

129
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,410
I wish you'd put yourself out more.

130
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,785
The door to your house only opens
from the inside, you know.

131
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,118
We haven't seen your friend Gabriel
around much lately, Claire.

132
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,385
So?

133
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,959
Have you not been seeing as much of him?

134
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,127
- No, I haven't.
- Did you two have a falling-out?

135
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,236
Yeah, Gabe joined the Hare Krishna, okay?

136
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,571
Those people with the orange robes
and tambourines?

137
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,044
That try to sell you books in the airport.
Yeah, that's them.

138
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,341
Oh, my goodness!

139
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,751
- He never struck me as a religious person.
- He is now, big-time.

140
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,214
- Did he shave his head?
- Yeah, he shaved his head.

141
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,089
Can we talk about something else, please?

142
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,329
Claire, do you want to come to Seattle
with me?

143
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,631
You're asking me to come to Seattle
with you?

144
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,192
Yeah, why not?

145
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,473
I'm not sure we can stick the Mossbacks
with two plane tickets.

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,405
- I'll pay for it.
- You will?

147
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,569
Yeah. I could use the company.

148
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,670
- You could help me drive on the way back.
- She'll miss school.

149
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,978
We're not doing anything I can't miss,
and I can bring my homework.

150
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,019
It's just for a couple of days.

151
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,480
Fine.

152
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,159
I'm tired of trying to be the architect
for this family.

153
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,128
It's high time you drew your own blueprints.

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,734
Does anyone know
what the fuck she's talking about anymore?

155
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,305
- Nate.
- What?

156
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,015
By the way,
I'm flying up to Seattle tomorrow.

157
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,648
- You are?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,762
I'm picking up a body
and driving it back for David.

159
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,924
- I'm gonna take Claire with me.
- Sounds like fun.

160
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,869
You don't mind that I didn't ask you?

161
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,201
- Ask me what?
- To go with me.

162
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,676
- No, not at all.
- Good.

163
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,736
You sure?

164
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,606
Nate, I'm trying to read...

165
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,653
and you know I hate it
when you floss in front of me.

166
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,783
Sorry.

167
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,790
Is it weird I didn't ask you
to come to Seattle with me?

168
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,956
No, why would it be?

169
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,265
I don't know. It just feels a little weird.

170
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,166
Okay, now it is a little weird.

171
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,001
But only because
you're making it a little weird.

172
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,871
- But you're not mad about it?
- Not at all.

173
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,408
I think it's really good for you,
spending some time with your sister.

174
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,242
That's what I think.

175
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,728
- You sure it's not too weird?
- God, Nate, give it a rest.

176
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,761
- Good night, Bren.
- Good night.

177
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:54,632
Cool! Sleater-Kinney's playing
at this place called Showbox tonight.

178
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,136
I hate to break it to you,
but Showbox is 18 and over.

179
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,131
What makes you think
I don't have a fake I.D.?

180
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,206
You have a fake I.D.?

181
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,813
You're not gonna pull some
pseudo-parental bullshit on me, are you?

182
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,747
No. I had a fake I.D. Once, too.

183
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,784
Maybe I'll go with you.

184
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,387
- I don't need a babysitter, Nate.
- I love Sleater-Kinney.

185
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,791
You love Sleater-Kinney?

186
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,895
Will you try to get over yourself for a second
and let me be your friend and your brother?

187
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,472
Did you bring me on this trip because
you thought I needed a little distraction?

188
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,442
I invited you because I thought it'd be fun
to bring you along.

189
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,809
Now I'm having second thoughts.

190
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,840
I believe you.

191
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,713
- So where are we staying, anyway?
- My friend Lisa's.

192
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,090
- Is she an old girlfriend?
- No.

193
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,162
No way, not even close.

194
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,397
We were strictly roommates, nothing more.

195
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,101
Worked at the co-op together.

196
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,699
Is she all crunchy-granola...

197
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,469
backpacky, and way into grunge?

198
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,946
Crunchy-granola: Maybe a little.

199
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,743
Backpacky: Definitely.

200
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,808
Into grunge: No way.

201
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,580
Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did.

202
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,517
Besides, Lisa is...

203
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,886
It's not too easy to categorize.

204
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,289
You guys did it a few times, though, right?

205
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,730
- We're not having this discussion.
- Fine.

206
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,777
This is it.

207
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,048
Sweet.

208
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,031
- It's so good to have you back home.
- It's good to be back.

209
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,161
Lisa, this is my sister, Claire.

210
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,107
Come in.

211
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,331
Hello, Hiram? It's me, Ruth.

212
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,769
I'm fine. How are you?

213
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,469
Listen, the reason why I'm calling is...

214
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,649
I just wanted to let you know that I've been
drafting a new blueprint for myself.

215
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,517
No, not for the house.

216
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,186
Yes, it is for the house. My house.

217
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,955
I mean, not the actual physical structure
I live in with my family.

218
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,122
I'm speaking
more of the emotional structure...

219
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,666
in which I've chosen to live my life.

220
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,538
I most certainly have not been drinking.

221
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,273
I'm just trying to let you know, Hiram...

222
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,343
that I harbor no hard feelings against you.

223
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,243
No, I do not want to get back together.

224
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,110
How presumptuous!

225
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,984
You know something, Hiram? Fuck off!

226
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,961
Amelia? It's Ruth.

227
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,623
I know we haven't seen each other
in a while...

228
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,828
and I feel a little funny leaving this
on your machine...

229
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,304
but I just wanted to let you know...

230
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,533
I've been drafting a new blueprint
for myself.

231
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,972
And if you're ever looking
for an opportunity to renew our friendship...

232
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,277
my front door is open to you.

233
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,707
That's all I wanted to say.

234
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,618
You can call me back if you want to, okay?

235
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,779
Bye!

236
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,490
Sarah, are you there?

237
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,255
If you're there, pick up.

238
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,336
Okay, fine. I know we don't talk
to each other very much anymore...

239
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:02,636
but I left you three messages in two weeks
and you haven't returned any of my calls.

240
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,405
I think you don't ever want to
talk to me again, and if that's the case...

241
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,673
we really need to talk!

242
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:13,314
There are things I'd like to say to you
about the cracks in my foundation...

243
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,115
and your part in helping me repair them.

244
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,846
This is your sister, Ruth.

245
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,502
What do you mean, you can't?

246
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,666
Eddie, I need you
to pick up Taylor from school.

247
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,676
Look, I realize you're in the middle
of a shift.

248
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,441
Can't you get somebody to cover for you?

249
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,615
I'm caught between a rock
and a fucking hard place here.

250
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,879
I need you to do this for me.

251
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,116
All right, never mind. Fuck it, then.

252
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,589
This is a bullshit detail.

253
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,183
I wish the guy would just shoot her
and get it over with.

254
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,694
I've got tickets for the Dodgers tonight.

255
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,654
What did I say?

256
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,669
Listen, I've got a huge favor to ask.

257
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,578
What is it?

258
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,577
I'm stuck in Koreatown.

259
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,209
Some guy's
holding his mother-in-law hostage.

260
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,049
He claims she put his TV remote
down a garbage disposal.

261
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,455
<i>I don't know when I'll be out of here.</i>
<i>Eddie's pulling a double shift.</i>

262
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,284
I hate to ask...

263
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,495
but is there any way
that you can pick up Taylor...

264
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,031
from Bridgebrook Elementary at 3:00?

265
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,465
Yes. I mean, sure. I'd be glad to.

266
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,130
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yes, of course.

267
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,701
All right, thanks.

268
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,306
<i>I'll call ahead to the school</i>
<i>so they'll be expecting you.</i>

269
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,012
<i>- I'll pick Taylor up from your place later.</i>
- Great.

270
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,544
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

271
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,216
No problem.

272
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,097
- What is this?
- Tofu meatloaf.

273
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,937
It's completely vegan.

274
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,975
No dairy, no eggs.
No animal products of any kind.

275
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,244
- No meat?
- None whatsoever.

276
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,315
Why do you call it "meatloaf"?

277
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,717
You're a pisser just like your brother,
aren't you?

278
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,252
- Anyway, it used to be his favorite.
- It's delicious, Lisa.

279
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,855
I didn't put in too much garlic?

280
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,896
- Not for me.
- No way.

281
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,027
Garlic is a miracle herb.

282
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,363
It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.

283
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,901
It stimulates the immune system...

284
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,166
and inhibits the growth of parasites
in the intestines.

285
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,070
So, how's life at the co-op?

286
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,772
Our membership is up 15% since you left...

287
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,611
in spite of the corporate outfits
breathing down our necks.

288
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,811
- Wow, sounds like things are going great.
- We miss you.

289
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,153
You should stop in
and say hello while you're here.

290
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,588
- So, how's life back in LA?
- It's okay.

291
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,094
What can I say? I may have finally
found something I'm good at.

292
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,566
- I always knew you had a spiritual calling.
- Yeah, right.

293
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,799
What? Being a funeral director
is proof of a spiritual calling?

294
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,311
It's not exactly what I imagined for Nate,
but it doesn't surprise me.

295
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,317
Nothing ever surprises you, Lisa.

296
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,812
That's true.

297
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,529
So, last time I spoke to you,
back in January...

298
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,690
I suppose, you had met somebody?

299
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,591
- Brenda.
- Yeah.

300
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,100
Anything ever happen with that?

301
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,836
We're still together.

302
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,701
Wow! Eight months.

303
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,610
That's gotta be an all-time record
for you, Nate.

304
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,113
It might be.

305
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,742
Sounds like a real relationship to me.

306
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,614
What can I say?

307
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,015
It is what it is.

308
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,187
I mean, for me, for where I am at right now,
it's a good thing.

309
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,122
- It's all good.
- It is. It's all...

310
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,462
well, mostly, you know, good.

311
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,373
I'm really happy for you, Nate.

312
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,674
You know, I got offered a job in LA.

313
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,011
- Really?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,483
Some big-time producer
came through town shooting a movie.

315
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,214
She's looking for a vegan chef,
and she offered me a job.

316
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,017
Really, what movie?

317
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,592
I'm not good with titles.
I don't go to the movies.

318
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,221
Film is processed with gelatin.
Gelatin comes from horses' hooves.

319
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,095
- I didn't know that.
- Most people don't.

320
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,692
Hence the global slavery of animals.

321
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,400
- Were you thinking about taking the job?
- I don't know.

322
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,340
I mean, LA is such a godless place.

323
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,710
Besides, my life is really full here.

324
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,247
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah.

325
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,881
It's down the hall, first door on the left.

326
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,694
- She's a lot like you.
- You think?

327
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,059
God, I've missed you, Nate.

328
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,560
I've missed you, too.

329
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,970
Give me a break.

330
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,975
I think you totally cleared out my sinuses.

331
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,668
Not too hard?

332
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,408
Some of my clients find me a little intense.

333
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,511
Not at all.

334
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,952
I love it.

335
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,019
It feels great.

336
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,394
I have to say you're pretty loose.

337
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,228
Not a lot of tension in the usual places.

338
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,701
I'm curious. Melissa, what do you do?

339
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,577
I'm just asking because I'm thinking
about changing professions...

340
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,145
and I'm curious.

341
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,377
I'm a prostitute.

342
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,148
No shit?

343
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,119
No shit.

344
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:06,986
Cool.

345
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,205
I'm making a cup of tea. Want one?

346
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,939
I'd love to, but I've gotta get to work.

347
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,348
- Same time next week?
- Absolutely.

348
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,586
- I'll see you.
- See you.

349
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,528
- Hello?
<i>- Bren. Hi, honey. It's Mom.</i>

350
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,093
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa.</i>
<i>I need you to meet me over here.</i>

351
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,795
- Why?
<i>- Sweetheart, it's an emergency.</i>

352
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,963
<i>- I need you over here, please.</i>
- What's happened?

353
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,269
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa, Brenda, in La Cañada.</i>

354
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,503
<i>I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.</i>

355
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,043
Brenda! Don't go in there.

356
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,642
Mother, let go of my fucking arm.
You're hurting me!

357
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,517
This is your father's car.

358
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,087
So Dad's here. Who cares?

359
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,820
He's not here. He's at work. I checked.

360
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,188
Look on the dash.

361
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,193
Your father doesn't smoke Virginia Slims.

362
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,602
Look on the gear shift.

363
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,835
A scrunchie. Big fucking deal!

364
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:29,677
Your father hasn't had enough hair
to need a scrunchie since 19<i>7</i>5!

365
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,148
- So you think Dad's fucking somebody.
- Bingo!

366
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,583
Oh, my God, is that all this is?

367
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,779
I thought you'd heard from the hospital
that something happened to Billy.

368
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,052
Don't be so dramatic, Brenda.

369
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,595
I have to go downstairs
and work for a little while.

370
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,864
Do you have everything you need?

371
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,298
Can I have some chocolate milk?

372
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,366
I'm sorry. We don't have any chocolate milk.

373
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,076
I want some goddamn chocolate milk.

374
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,974
I'm sorry, but we only have white milk.

375
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,453
Ain't you got any other cookies
besides these?

376
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,954
Those are all we have.

377
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,855
I don't like these kind.
These kind taste like shit.

378
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,861
Then just color in your coloring books,
and I'll check in on you in a bit.

379
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,760
I don't like coloring books.

380
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,326
- You picked them out at the drugstore.
- You told me I had to.

381
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,964
- I thought you liked coloring books.
- I don't. I told you I like to draw.

382
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,564
Then draw.

383
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,547
These are coloring books.

384
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,906
You can't draw in coloring books...

385
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,578
because they already have
the drawings in them.

386
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,247
You can only color in coloring books.

387
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,890
That's why they're called coloring books.

388
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,465
- You wanna watch TV?
- Okay.

389
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,834
- You know how to use that?
- What do you think, I'm stupid?

390
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,902
- I didn't say you're stupid.
- I know how to use a remote.

391
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,004
Fine, knock yourself out.

392
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,477
Dumb-ass cracker.

393
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,955
Man, I am starving for a cheeseburger.

394
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:21,186
I want something that walked the earth,
with the works.

395
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,193
Man, I'm having a double.

396
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,757
I thought you liked the meatless meatloaf.

397
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,866
- I lied.
- No shit.

398
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,397
And what's with the "it is what it is"...

399
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,464
purposely vague bullshit
about you and Brenda?

400
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,106
I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings, okay?

401
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,143
You definitely slept with her.

402
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,048
Okay, yes.

403
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,854
We had occasional sex together,
but it was strictly on a friendship basis.

404
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,654
You were fuck-buddies?

405
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,087
Yeah.

406
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,761
- And nothing more.
- Does Lisa know that?

407
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,659
You know what?

408
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,503
Every time we did have sex,
and I'm talking about five, six times, tops...

409
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:15,709
I was very honest with her
about what it meant and what it didn't mean.

410
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:21,348
- She's got it bad for you.
- I was always honest with Lisa.

411
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,751
- Lf you say so.
- What do you want?

412
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,759
I want a Chubby Cheese with everything,
medium skinny fries, and a Coke.

413
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,921
My God, do you smell that?

414
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,631
What, burgers and fries?

415
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,101
No, it's like rotten eggs! Jesus!

416
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,306
Oh, man, déjà fucking vu.

417
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,399
<i>Welcome to Chubby's.</i>
<i>May I take your order?</i>

418
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:50,244
Yeah, I'll have a double Chubby...

419
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,612
I'll have a double Chubby cheeseburger.
Fuck me!

420
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,723
<i>- Was that one or two cheeseburgers?</i>
- Jesus, my head!

421
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:05,885
Fuck!

422
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,705
Nate, are you okay?

423
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,587
<i>Sir, I didn't get that.</i>
<i>Can I take your order, please?</i>

424
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,429
<i>Hello, sir?</i>

425
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,270
You drive.

426
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,606
I'm gonna get some air
and make a phone call.

427
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,667
Okay.

428
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,654
<i>- I didn't get that. Please repeat your order.</i>
- Shut up.

429
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,769
Yeah, is Dr. DiPaolo in?

430
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,907
Yeah, it's definitely an emergency.

431
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,347
<i>- Can I take your order, please?</i>
- Shut the fuck up!

432
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,045
<i>I'm going to have to contact the manager.</i>

433
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,320
I can't believe I'm doing this.

434
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,219
Can't we at least go inside?

435
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,592
I could get a seaweed wrap
while I pretend to listen to you.

436
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,856
That couldn't be her.

437
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,763
I'm eating your protein bar.

438
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,602
Maybe it is.

439
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,465
This is like eating upholstery.

440
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,976
I knew it.

441
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,548
Bern couldn't get anyone that good-Iooking
to jump his saggy ass.

442
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:16,620
I thought you and Dad had an agreement
about this sort of thing.

443
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,920
We did. We do.

444
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,531
Only this time he broke one of the rules.
He didn't tell me first.

445
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,161
So you're not upset
Dad's fucking somebody else.

446
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,173
You're upset he didn't tell you
he was fucking somebody else.

447
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,503
That's right.

448
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,739
The rule is,
if you step outside the holy bonds...

449
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,872
you have to tell your wife first.

450
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,544
So she can line up some young hottie
of her own.

451
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,325
I guess that sounds fair.

452
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,161
You have other rules?

453
00:33:55,733 --> 00:34:00,170
- Yeah, a whole slew of them.
- Go on, tell me. I'm curious.

454
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,803
You can't fuck my friends, I can't fuck yours.

455
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,212
No fucking of mutual friends.
Never in Hawaii.

456
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,550
Never in a hotel
that costs more than $300 a night.

457
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,783
And never in a hotel
that's under $<i>7</i>5 a night.

458
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,386
Not on holidays.

459
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,924
There are others. I just can't remember
all of them at the moment.

460
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,026
Is one of them:

461
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,798
"Never fuck anybody else
in front of your kids"?

462
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,966
I guess not. Since there was that time
I saw you in the hot tub...

463
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,633
with some old guy with a hairy back.

464
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,008
Darling, your father was there.

465
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,708
And there was absolutely no penetration,
I can assure you of that.

466
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,082
- I'll bet that wasn't your choice.
- And you were supposed to be in bed.

467
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,290
I was only gone a couple of hours, Rico.

468
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,154
Every hour you're gone
is an hour I have to stay late.

469
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,993
I'm sorry about your buddy's kid,
but I have kids of my own.

470
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,057
Is this about us not giving you the loan
for the house?

471
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,969
Because you never used to complain
about having to work a little overtime.

472
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,271
This is about me not wanting to be
taken advantage of by my employers.

473
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:16,541
- We're more than just your employers...
- That's bullshit, David, and you know it.

474
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:20,675
When it's convenient, we're like family.
But in a pinch, I'm just an employee...

475
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,277
and you and Nate are just my bosses.

476
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,647
Hey, little lady.

477
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,790
Taylor, I told you to wait upstairs.

478
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,522
- My tummy hurts.
- Let's go.

479
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,856
Is that man dead?

480
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,795
That man was totally dead.

481
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,544
Yes, that man was totally dead.

482
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,710
- Did you kill him?
- No.

483
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,284
- Did that other man in there kill him?
- No.

484
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,015
He died of natural causes.

485
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,486
My friend Renee said
sooner or later we'll all be dead.

486
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,596
That's true.

487
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,767
So someday I'll be dead,
laying on a table like that?

488
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,894
Not for a very, very long time.

489
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:18,072
My mom says my dad's good as dead
as far as she's concerned.

490
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:27,081
That's just her way of expressing anger
at him for not being around.

491
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,578
Sometimes my mom says
she wishes she was dead.

492
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,928
That's just something that people say
when they're upset about something.

493
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,193
Did that dead man in there have any kids?

494
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:46,162
Yeah, he had a wife and three children
and five grandchildren.

495
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,631
- I don't ever want to die.
- Me, neither.

496
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,710
It's called arteriovenous malformation.
AVM, for short.

497
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,988
Lots of people have it their whole lives
and never even know.

498
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,548
And the pills?

499
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,785
They're an anti-seizure medication.

500
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,663
So what happened to you,
that was a seizure?

501
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,996
Sort of.

502
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,667
- Sort of?
- It was a mild seizure.

503
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,976
- Does David know about this?
- Yes, he does.

504
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,471
I don't want Mom to know
'cause she'll just freak out. All right?

505
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,344
It's no big deal, I promise.

506
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,778
People don't just spaz out...

507
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,822
and hork all over their shoes
for no good reason.

508
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,256
Two words: Tofu meatloaf.

509
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,494
Besides, now I have these pills
it'll be totally under control.

510
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,590
- You swear?
- I swear.

511
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:54,062
I just have to take them
for the rest of my life is all.

512
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,636
I don't believe you.

513
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,336
Just do me a favor
and don't tell David about this.

514
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,345
This client of mine's a prostitute.

515
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,153
- Is that supposed to shock me?
- What?

516
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,960
God, not everything is about you.

517
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,364
You're such a classic narcissist.

518
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,665
Just because your parents are shrinks
doesn't mean you know about psychology.

519
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,174
Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean
that you're not out of your fucking mind.

520
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,577
I've treated several prostitutes
over the years...

521
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,377
and they're not as uncommon
as you'd think...

522
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,584
That's her.

523
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,681
She's your age. I have to talk to her.

524
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,922
- Mom, don't. Please don't.
- No, wait.

525
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,462
I'm not angry.
I'm not going to make a scene.

526
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:58,696
I just need to personalize the experience
and humanize the situation.

527
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,904
- It's for all of us.
- You'll just regret it.

528
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,800
Miss!

529
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,137
Hello, I'm Margaret, Bern's wife.

530
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:13,214
You know, Bern and I have
a really open relationship...

531
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,082
and I just want you to know
it's okay with me.

532
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:19,715
I'd love to chat,
but I've gotta go meet Bern for lunch. Sorry.

533
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,662
Get off, you bitch! I can't believe you!

534
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,798
- Get off of me!
- Fine.

535
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,336
You slut!

536
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,595
Psycho!

537
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,469
I'll see you in hell.

538
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,541
I hope you like herpes.

539
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,117
You know, I thought she'd be more evolved.

540
00:39:58,763 --> 00:39:59,855
Evolved?

541
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:03,025
Mother, you just attacked
that woman repeatedly.

542
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,232
- She could have you thrown in jail.
- I seriously doubt that.

543
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,898
Are you hungry?

544
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,301
Why am I here?

545
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,809
Why was it necessary
for me to be here with you for this?

546
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,949
Because you needed a fucking audience.

547
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,016
- Not everything's about you, Brenda.
- Look at Mommy.

548
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,650
Isn't Mommy pretty?

549
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:34,027
Isn't Mommy fabulous and free-spirited
and uninhibited?

550
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,532
Validate Mommy, kids,
because she's incapable of doing it herself.

551
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,332
No wonder Billy ended up in a psych ward.
Not that you care.

552
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:44,306
For your information, Miss High and Mighty,
this is life.

553
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,409
People have crises.

554
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,504
They push each other's buttons.
They inflict pain on one another.

555
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:55,143
And once in a fucking blue moon,
they bring out the best in each other.

556
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,051
But mostly, they bring out the worst.

557
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,390
- You're pathetic.
- Don't you dare judge me.

558
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,760
You think you're the paragon
of mental health...

559
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,392
just because you've been dating
the same man for the past few months?

560
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,767
That's real,
compared to what your father and I have?

561
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,972
- You're just jealous.
- Of what?

562
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,401
The fact that I haven't allowed you
to totally destroy my life...

563
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,945
like you have everybody else's.

564
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,344
What life?

565
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:28,982
You've spent 32 years
being your little brother's nursemaid...

566
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,042
Fuck you!

567
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,352
...to avoid having any emotional life
of your own.

568
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,025
And now that he's been put away...

569
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,324
you're gonna have
to face your own demons.

570
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,298
And, sweetheart, they're legion.

571
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,636
Get out of my car.

572
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,543
I would be happy to.

573
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:15,030
I hope you like pork roast
and mashed potatoes.

574
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,531
They're okay.

575
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,860
- Where are you going, dear?
- To watch TV.

576
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,736
In this house we eat dinner at the table.

577
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,209
- You don't watch TV while you eat?
- No, we don't.

578
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,243
Maybe we can watch some TV
when we're done eating.

579
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,389
- So, what grade are you in, Taylor?
- Fourth.

580
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,456
David was in the fourth grade once.

581
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,064
It's true.

582
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:55,266
Did you know David
used to be my Uncle Keith's boyfriend?

583
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,972
Yes, I did.

584
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,809
Sometimes my momma calls my Uncle Keith
a punk-ass fudgepacker...

585
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,113
'cause he likes men instead of women.

586
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:12,247
I guess that makes you
a punk-ass fudgepacker, too, don't it?

587
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,717
We don't use those kinds of words
at this table.

588
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,295
- We don't use those kinds of words at all.
- How come?

589
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:24,093
- Because those words are...
- Hateful. Those are hateful words.

590
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,467
What words do you use?

591
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,639
Homosexual.

592
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:39,310
My Uncle Keith has a new boyfriend.
His name's Eddie.

593
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,053
He drives an ambulance.
But I don't like him too much.

594
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,780
Why not?

595
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:49,383
He looks at himself in the mirror a lot,
and he talks to me like I'm stupid.

596
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,593
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

597
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,931
It is true.

598
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,636
Some people just don't know
how to talk to children.

599
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,397
Tell me about it.

600
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,078
I think I'll start the dishes.

601
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:30,196
It's time for you to leave now.

602
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:31,723
Go!

603
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,679
- Is everything okay?
- Claire, I thought you were taking a nap.

604
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,947
I was reading.

605
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:55,420
- Where's Nate?
- He's outside making a phone call.

606
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,320
Who were you talking to?

607
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,858
Ants.

608
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,262
I'm being overrun by them.

609
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:09,232
At first I tried setting a little food aside
for them next to the back door.

610
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,503
Then I tried coaxing them out
with some citrus oil.

611
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,942
Now I'm trying to reason with them.

612
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:20,880
At home, my dad used to squirt them
with lighter fluid and torch them.

613
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,753
I'm not still in love with your brother,
if that's what you're thinking.

614
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,920
Actually, I wasn't thinking that.

615
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,199
I used to be.

616
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,892
I used to think one day he would realize
I was the one for him.

617
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,563
He never has.

618
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,604
Do you think he ever will?

619
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:52,471
I'm probably not the person
to be asking that question.

620
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:57,616
He's my brother, but to tell you the truth,
I'm just getting to know the guy.

621
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,448
He's a heartbreaker, that's for sure.

622
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,992
There are a dozen women all over Seattle...

623
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,655
who would freak
if they knew he was back here.

624
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,500
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- No, I don't.

625
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:16,131
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

626
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,341
Not anymore.

627
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,010
We broke up.

628
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,711
You're better off, trust me.

629
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,352
Fucking ants.

630
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,188
I just wanted to hear how your day went.

631
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,856
My mother practically beat the shit
out of a woman in a parking lot...

632
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,861
<i>but apart from that, I'm fine.</i>

633
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,793
<i>- How's Seattle?</i>
- Seattle's good.

634
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,527
Your mother tried
to beat the shit out of somebody?

635
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,867
I really don't feel like reliving that right now.

636
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,369
How's it going with Claire?

637
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,841
Great. We're getting along great.

638
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,772
Is everything okay?

639
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,314
I just have a headache.

640
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,354
We're gonna hit the road first thing
in the morning.

641
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,986
Okay, I'll see you, then.

642
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,554
I just ran a bath and it's getting cold, so...

643
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,197
I miss you.

644
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,561
I miss you, too.

645
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,780
You never called.

646
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,953
How did you know where I live?

647
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,421
That's not really important.

648
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,528
I think maybe it is.

649
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:29,199
You wanna know what's really important?

650
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,570
Show me.

651
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,316
Did she give you a hard time?

652
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,323
Not really.

653
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,854
Let me grab her,
and we'll get out of your way.

654
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,296
Thanks again.

655
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,500
It's no problem whatsoever.

656
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,343
She's a great kid, Keith. She really is.

657
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:46,371
Considering everything she's been put
through, it's kind of a miracle.

658
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,818
We should go.

659
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,328
- Good night, David.
- Good night.

660
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,787
I thought you might need an extra quilt.

661
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,986
It gets cold in this room.

662
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,625
Excellent.

663
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,804
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

664
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,231
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

665
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,900
Yeah. I'm good.

666
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,905
You can't fool me, Nate. I know you too well.

667
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,779
I'm fine.

668
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,668
Poor baby.

669
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,498
It's okay. I'm here.

670
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,874
I'm right here.

671
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,138
It's okay.

672
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:43,797
- Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?
- I'm good. I never eat breakfast.

673
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,427
Lisa, have you seen
my old brown flannel shirt?

674
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,962
I'm pretty sure it got donated
to the co-op garage sale.

675
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,441
Here it is.

676
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,979
I love that shirt. It's so Nate.

677
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,781
- Why don't you hang on to it?
- No, I couldn't.

678
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,754
I want you to have it.

679
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:10,054
- What would I want with your shirt?
- Would you just keep it?

680
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,588
We should probably hit the road
and pick up Mr. Mossback.

681
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,927
Right.

682
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,097
As always, it's been great seeing you.

683
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,373
- Take care of yourself, Nate.
- You, too.

684
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,747
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, Claire.

685
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,495
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

686
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,294
Morning, Mom.

687
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,609
It's awfully quiet around here
with Nate and Claire being gone.

688
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,802
I suppose it is.

689
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:07,071
What time did your friend come by
to pick up his niece?

690
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,677
1:30.

691
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,215
That's awfully late
for a child her age to be up.

692
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,417
She was asleep on the sun porch.

693
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,326
- Is there something you'd like to say to me?
- No.

694
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,194
Yes, there is.

695
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,673
I'm all ears.

696
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,613
Your father used to say that to me
all the time. "I'm all ears."

697
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,709
Sometimes you remind me of him.

698
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,049
What's on your mind?

699
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:51,188
You have to be careful with children...

700
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:55,355
because their blueprints are being drafted
by the adults in their lives.

701
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,400
And this little girl...

702
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,035
It seems to me that her foundation
is probably unstable enough...

703
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,006
without you bringing your...

704
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,105
My what?

705
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,242
Your relationship with her uncle,
you have to admit...

706
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,012
might be a little confusing
to someone her age.

707
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,622
I'm happy for you if this whole plan thing
of yours has enabled you...

708
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,959
to draft your own blueprint...

709
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,296
or patch up some of the cracks
in your foundation.

710
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:36,262
But just between you and me,
you're starting to sound like a crazy person.

711
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,572
I think it's time you kept
that shit to yourself...

712
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,203
and minded your own fucking business.

713
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,493
Thank you.

714
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,483
It's a little weird driving a dead guy
all the way back to LA.

715
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,149
It's only weird if you make it weird.

716
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,386
- It's a little weird.
- It's not.

717
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,732
You know, Nate, I don't know why...

718
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,437
but it's comforting to know
you're just as fucked up as the rest of us.

719
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:47,136
I'm not anywhere near as fucked up
as the rest of you.

720
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,905
- You are.
- I'm not.

721
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,511
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up and drive.
