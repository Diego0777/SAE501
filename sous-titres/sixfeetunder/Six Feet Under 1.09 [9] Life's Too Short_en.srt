1
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,556
Yo, what's up? You get it?

2
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:25,595
No, I didn't get anything. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

3
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:32,678
- Anthony, go play in Mom's room.
- Why?

4
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,310
Because I said so,
you little shit. Go!

5
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,031
Get up, come on.

6
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,995
You suck!

7
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,436
Kid's got so much major attitude.

8
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,321
Six years old and he's
already a hard-ass.

9
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,761
You can get more of this stuff?
How much?

10
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:32,114
- How much money do you have?
- Oh, like I'm a fucking loaded.

11
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:40,717
Hey, Bennett and I are going to
that record release party tonight.

12
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:43,761
And then there's an
after-hours in Hollywood.

13
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,635
No, dude, I fucking hate that shit.

14
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,431
It's always a bunch of
whacked-out faggot tweakers...

15
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:51,111
...shoving glow sticks in your eyes.
- It's at Sin Sin.

16
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:54,838
Great, whacked-out Asian tweakers.

17
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,994
That club's weak, dude.

18
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:03,961
Anthony? An...

19
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,474
Oh, fuck!

20
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,074
Oh, shit.

21
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,640
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck!

22
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,437
I gotta get out of here.

23
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,397
- What?
- I gotta get that shit out of here.

24
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,597
Oh, fuck. Anthony?

25
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,396
Morning.

26
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:45,556
Okay. What are you mad
at me about now?

27
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:48,881
I'm busy, all right? My workload
has doubled since Federico's gone.

28
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:53,953
You can't expect me to engage you
in small talk just to make you feel better.

29
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,240
You flunked the licensing test.

30
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:03,319
- Did you think I didn't know?
- I didn't.

31
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,476
You didn't apply yourself.

32
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,358
You think this is something people do as
a last resort...

33
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,564
...and therefore it can't be that difficult.
- I feel bad. You wanna make it worse?

34
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:14,721
- I don't care what you feel...
- Bullshit.

35
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:18,036
You like it when I feel bad
because misery loves company.

36
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,759
- How'd he die?
- Heart attack.

37
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:30,957
Fell down a flight of stairs,
dead when he hit the bottom.

38
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,316
- His nose supposed to look like that?
- Of course not.

39
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,643
I have to finish embalming him before
I can start on anything cosmetic.

40
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:44,958
- I can deal with whoever it is.
- Unless it's a walk-in.

41
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,202
You are choosing
to be the victim here.

42
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,755
I could handle an intake
and you know it.

43
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:54,239
Ladies, teacup chain.

44
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,445
Good.

45
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:06,282
And walk to the middle and back.

46
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,880
All right, very good.
Very good, ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:14,477
So we'll see you all at the same time
next week, okay? Be safe getting home.

48
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,914
Morning, folks.

49
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

50
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,321
Goddamn it, why hasn't anyone
answered the door? Where is Mom?

51
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:27,125
Okay, if you haven't slept with
that guy yet, would you start?

52
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,477
Because I think it would
do you a world of good.

53
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,926
Don't do that.

54
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,085
- Do what?
- Watch me like that.

55
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,959
I can't help it.
You're beautiful.

56
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,722
Oh, for heaven's sake.

57
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,964
- I want to go camping again.
- Then go camping.

58
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,916
- With you.
- I've got a job now, Hiram.

59
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,880
I can't just up and leave
whenever I feel like it.

60
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,965
Spring is a very busy
time of the year.

61
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,277
It's our anniversary tomorrow.

62
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:13,799
The first time we went camping
was two years ago tomorrow.

63
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:17,045
We don't have anniversaries.

64
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:20,684
- I never agreed to anniversaries.
- Just you and me alone in the woods.

65
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:24,887
Naked under the stars.
Just like it was at the beginning.

66
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:29,246
Tomorrow is such short notice.

67
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,484
I can't promise anything.
But I'll try.

68
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,168
My mom wants to know
how quickly we can do this.

69
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:50,886
Well, I'd suggest a viewing in
two days to allow proper restoration.

70
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:53,962
Viewing?

71
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:58,197
For friends, family. You can make it
as small or as large as you wish.

72
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:03,119
No, I can't see him in a box.
I can't.

73
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:05,687
All right.

74
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,925
Ms. Dimas, seeing your son before
you bury him might help you to let go.

75
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,041
No, I don't want to see him!

76
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,882
Of course. We'll arrange
for a closed-casket ceremony.

77
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:27,442
Will three days
give you enough time?

78
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,727
Yeah, that's gonna be fine.

79
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:45,561
- Nate will show you to the door.
- Thanks.

80
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,443
What happened?

81
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,086
A 6-year-old found a gun
and was playing with it.

82
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,485
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

83
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,161
They gave me this at the hospital.

84
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,409
It's some sort of receipt. I don't know...
I don't know if you need it, but...

85
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,243
What was he doing here?

86
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:35,803
- Gabe.
- It's okay.

87
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,564
Hey.

88
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:45,801
My brother just told me.
I'm so sorry.

89
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:50,324
I didn't know where else to go.
My grandmother's funeral was here.

90
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:53,527
Yeah, of course.

91
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,050
My mom's waiting
for me to unlock the car.

92
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:16,727
I thought we were supposed
to encourage people to have a viewing.

93
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,801
Well, sometimes
people don't want that.

94
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:22,731
Well, sometimes you don't
want to work any harder.

95
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,802
When faced with the option of
not having to restore a child's head...

96
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:30,248
...that's been blown to bits, yeah,
I don't want to do that. Do you?

97
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,563
We can't force someone to do
something they're not ready to do...

98
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:38,487
...because we think it's the right thing.
Because it will make us feel better.

99
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:49,241
- Can I help you?
- Roses are if you love somebody, right?

100
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:54,048
Roses are the classic choice, but other
flowers could achieve the same effect.

101
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,482
What if you were gonna
ask her to marry you?

102
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,842
Oh, how lovely.

103
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,088
Well, roses would be
the perfect choice.

104
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,327
But she turned out
to be a cheating coward...

105
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,764
...and ran off with some shithead
that she met at traffic school.

106
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:10,331
What color would
you give a coward?

107
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:14,329
- Yellow. Yellow.
- Great.

108
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:18,685
Twelve dozen yellow roses
sent to this address, please.

109
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,771
- What would you like the card to say?
- "Fuck you, cunt."

110
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,805
I think it would be more
personal if you write that.

111
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,963
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,846
I have to take the day off
tomorrow and Saturday.

113
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,281
Why?

114
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,087
I was supposed to have plans
with a friend and I forgot.

115
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,291
Is it with that man?

116
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:52,292
The one with the funny little car
that picks you up?

117
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:55,292
It's an electric car and it's
very good for the environment.

118
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:02,324
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you are not.

119
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:05,002
- You like this man?
- Can I have the days off or not?

120
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:10,129
Take! Go, I don't care.
We will miss you.

121
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:13,409
Beep, beep.

122
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,407
Beep, beep.

123
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:26,130
- Brenda?
- Hey there.

124
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,644
I'll be right out. I just
got out of the shower.

125
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,810
- How was work?
- It sucked.

126
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,810
Like I figured, I failed
that funeral director's test.

127
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,849
There was this intake meeting
this morning I totally fucked up.

128
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:51,804
And I just picked up a dead
6-year-old at the morgue.

129
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,408
All in all, it's been
a pretty bad day.

130
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,935
Goddamn it!

131
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:05,484
Sometimes I feel like I don't have
any fucking idea what I'm doing.

132
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,452
It's like I made this bullshit decision
to go into this business...

133
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,970
...for all the wrong reasons
and now it's too late.

134
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:20,174
- It's never too late.
- Jesus, Billy.

135
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,685
What, do you live here now?

136
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,690
No, Brenda just gave me a shiatsu.
I've been kind of tense lately.

137
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:28,966
So...

138
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:31,331
- Bad day?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:36,491
- Well, I've had my share of those.
- Well, I don't doubt that.

140
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:41,087
I don't really feel like cooking, so you
guys decide what we're having delivered.

141
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:48,249
That shit was all over the news.
Six years old, right?

142
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:52,893
Fuck! Some people should just
not be allowed to have kids.

143
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,336
She just sat there like a ghost.

144
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,931
Just like she'd been erased.

145
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:06,335
- I felt so fucking helpless.
- Oh, God.

146
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,775
That poor woman.

147
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,850
There's a tribe in Nigeria that
throws a dead baby's body...

148
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:20,247
...into the bush because they believe
if buried...

149
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:25,093
...the dead infant would offend the
earth gods which bring fertility and food.

150
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:28,374
The Chinese consider the death
of a child a bad death.

151
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,614
The parents and grandparents
aren't expected to go to the funeral.

152
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:35,332
Or the Balinese mother who's counseled
to be cheerful after her infant's death...

153
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:41,766
...because grief makes one vulnerable
to illness and malevolent demons.

154
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:46,087
Well, that was informative.

155
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:51,814
Yeah, I thought it'd be good to read
up on your boyfriend's line of work.

156
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:56,731
What a man does is...
Well, it's who he is.

157
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:58,650
Right, Nate?

158
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,367
Yeah.

159
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:05,138
A man should know the history
of his chosen profession...

160
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,414
...if he expects to be
anything but an amateur.

161
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:11,447
- So I'm an amateur.
- I prefer the term dilettante.

162
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:12,972
And what are you, Billy?

163
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:16,255
Running around with your camera,
taking pictures of people's lives?

164
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,533
Boys.

165
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:21,373
You think knowing a bunch of arcane
National Geographic shit is gonna...

166
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:25,008
...help me cope with a 6-year-old
who shot himself in the head?

167
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,452
There are plenty of places in the world
where a kid dying is pretty common.

168
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:36,332
But we can't deal with it,
because a dead child...

169
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,612
...is the greatest failure of a culture that
believes it's reversed the order of nature.

170
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,935
This was an accident.
This wasn't nature.

171
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:45,774
You know what
I find interesting?

172
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:51,975
If you lose a spouse,
you're called a widow or a widower.

173
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,855
If you're a child and you lose
your parents, then you're an orphan.

174
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:02,533
But what's the word to describe
a parent who loses a child?

175
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,251
I guess that's just too fucking
awful to even have a name.

176
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,732
- I was worried you weren't gonna show.
- I just got tied up at work.

177
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,931
Believe me, I need this
after the day I had.

178
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,255
This ought to help.

179
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,337
- Oh, what is it?
- X. Ecstasy.

180
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,929
- You ever done it?
- No, can't say that I have.

181
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,892
You're gonna love it.

182
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,537
- Are you gonna take one too?
- I'm already there. Let's dance.

183
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,050
- I'm not a very good dancer.
- You will be.

184
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,058
David.

185
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,293
David. Here,
you gotta keep drinking this.

186
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,491
She was only 63.

187
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:45,420
That's so young.

188
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:48,294
Isn't that young?

189
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,972
Have you thought about what kind
of funeral you'd like for your mother?

190
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:59,650
It has to be beautiful.
It has to be beautiful.

191
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:06,211
Well, we can offer you a wide
variety of services ranging from...

192
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:11,257
...simple to more formal to...
To anything you might need.

193
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:15,411
Yes, anything at all.

194
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,859
It's a good thing
I was there, you know?

195
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:31,372
I mean, Gabe was so wrecked
I was the one who had to trash his weed.

196
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:35,097
Seriously, if the police found that shit,
it'd be way worse, you know?

197
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,821
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey.

198
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:39,981
- How's Gabe?
- He's okay, I guess.

199
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:44,502
- Well, have you talked to him?
- Not really.

200
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,935
Well, are you gonna see him later?

201
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:51,298
I don't know. It's real weird over there.

202
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:55,894
- The mother's, like, all freaked.
- Yeah, but what about Gabe?

203
00:18:56,143 --> 00:19:00,853
Look, Morticia, I'm not interfering.
It's too much to get into, you know?

204
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,980
- I thought you were his friend.
- Why don't you fuck off, bitch?

205
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:10,022
If you're so worried, why don't you go
fuck him again? That'll cheer him up.

206
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:13,215
Nice, that's nice.

207
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,376
Yeah.

208
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:19,020
By the way, Parker told me
how one of your testicles is, like...

209
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,738
...freakishly small, like a peanut.

210
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:29,337
- Is that true?
- That's not true.

211
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,937
For later.

212
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:07,296
- You have a headache, dear?
- Yeah, I thought I did.

213
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,338
I'm throwing in a load of laundry
if you need some done.

214
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:15,543
By the way, I'm going camping
with Hiram this weekend.

215
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:18,464
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Great.

216
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,297
I'm doing whites first.

217
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:30,415
- Fuck. David, David.
- David. David?

218
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,334
David! David?

219
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:37,013
Are you all right? You look pale.

220
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:41,503
No, I'm fine.
It's just a headache, that's all.

221
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:51,944
Okay, you're in this, like, total
danger zone. Gabe Dimas is a dick.

222
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:56,025
I'm sorry his brother's dead, but
don't think that means he's not a dick.

223
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,258
I just haven't seen him around,
so I was worried.

224
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,618
If you hook up with him now,
it's gonna be like total emotional rape.

225
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:08,337
Whatever he feels for you is gonna be
wrapped up in some guilt-grief fuckfest.

226
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:12,983
You better stay away from that shit.
I'm not kidding.

227
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:23,620
So you failed a test.
Big whoop.

228
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:27,137
You want to be helpful to the people
that walk in through your door...

229
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:30,497
...so you have to be
one of those people.

230
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:32,900
Okay.

231
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:37,021
I chose three funeral homes
from the yellow pages at random.

232
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:41,186
I've always felt an uncontrolled sample
group provides more reliable data.

233
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:44,857
What, you want us to pretend
to be purchasing a funeral?

234
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:48,218
Look up the first address.
I think it's in Sherman Oaks.

235
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:51,578
Come on, it'll be fun.

236
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:05,022
Hello? Gabe?

237
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,938
Is anybody home?

238
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:17,265
Oh, Mrs. Dimas, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

239
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:21,943
Is Gabe around?

240
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:02,705
- We can still leave.
- Why? What are you afraid of?

241
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,342
Humiliating myself,
wasting someone's valuable time.

242
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:08,062
Don't be so left-brained.

243
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,461
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

244
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,139
Now, how can I help?

245
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,498
It's my parents.

246
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:34,547
They were killed this morning
in an accident.

247
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,828
I'm terribly sorry.

248
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:42,420
It was a...
A helicopter...

249
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,099
...went down
and there was an explosion.

250
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,346
Oh, God.
I can't do this.

251
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:55,229
It's not right.
They were in the prime of their lives.

252
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,348
Everybody dies.
We all die.

253
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,620
Everything we ever care
about will disappear.

254
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,981
So, what's the fucking
point of living?

255
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,988
Can I suggest matching caskets?

256
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,259
That's it?

257
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,462
That's what you have to offer me
in my time of grief? Merchandise?

258
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,706
We have nothing
to learn here.

259
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,468
Water purifier.
Rope.

260
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,465
Bear bell.
Flashlight.

261
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,139
Toilet paper.
And, yes, it's biodegradable.

262
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:42,103
Bird caller.
Binoculars.

263
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:46,623
I'm sure you have everything. I know
you have everything. You always do.

264
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:51,382
It wouldn't be fun to get up there and
realize we forgot the matches, would it?

265
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:55,140
Or the champagne.

266
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,819
Hiram, that's just decadent.

267
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,670
Was it expensive?
We shouldn't waste it.

268
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:04,304
Waste it?
It's our anniversary.

269
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:10,589
Claire, you're home early.
You remember Hiram.

270
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:12,784
Hi.

271
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,588
- How was school?
- I have a headache.

272
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:30,666
Hiram and I are going camping.

273
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:34,348
Your dinner's in the refrigerator
and I'll be back tomorrow.

274
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:40,430
It's a very beautiful
time of the year.

275
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:44,383
Okay.
Well, you two have fun.

276
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:55,901
We should probably leave
if we want to beat the rush-hour traffic.

277
00:25:56,952 --> 00:26:00,501
Ruth?
Honey, what's wrong?

278
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,510
My children don't
need me anymore.

279
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:12,224
Let's think of this as a celebration...

280
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,185
...of your uncle's life.

281
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:18,543
Now, the Titan is an excellent choice
for a distinguished gentleman.

282
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:24,271
It's solid mahogany. It's hand-finished.
Burlwood and nickel accents.

283
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,668
And Grace Field...

284
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:29,945
Grace Field
is a lovely place for interment.

285
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,542
It's serene.
It's pastoral.

286
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:34,662
How much?

287
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:37,945
Well, after you sign the contract,
we take care of everything.

288
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:40,943
There's no worry.
There's no pain.

289
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:44,824
How much?

290
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:47,547
It comes to just
under $20,000.

291
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:59,273
You're charging $ 12,000
for the Titan?

292
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,749
What is that,
like a 300 percent markup?

293
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,228
I could come down to 10.

294
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:09,386
And Grace Field is in between
a power station and a freeway.

295
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,666
There are nicer cemeteries.

296
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,468
But they're just a little
bit more expensive.

297
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,902
No, thanks.

298
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:24,264
We'll try and find somewhere that
doesn't just want to swindle us.

299
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,231
Nice tie.

300
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:37,503
- This business is a total racket.
- What business isn't?

301
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,025
You know, sometimes
I wish I could be this...

302
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:45,426
...completely selfish asshole
that didn't give a shit about anything...

303
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:49,310
...and I could just work at some mindless
job that paid me a fuckload of money.

304
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:52,672
- No, you don't.
- It would make my life a lot easier.

305
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,548
You don't want
your life to be easy.

306
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:07,314
Gabe?

307
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,914
Hi.

308
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,146
I didn't know if
anybody was home.

309
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:18,824
Did you ring the bell?

310
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:24,231
I just... I came by
to drop off this stuff.

311
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,473
Okay.

312
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:31,193
It's my brother's soccer clothes.

313
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,910
I thought that he might
like to get buried in them.

314
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,393
You think that's okay?

315
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:42,754
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's really nice.

316
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,833
I went to your house.

317
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:50,312
You see my mom?

318
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,193
Yeah.

319
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:59,508
Just like a zombie.
Just sits there.

320
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:04,948
I don't know why she blames herself.
It's my fault. I killed him.

321
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,755
Gabe, no.
It was an accident.

322
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,832
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been watching him.

323
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:17,706
My mom can't even find Anthony's dad
to tell him what happened.

324
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,829
Probably moved.
We haven't seen him in, like, two years.

325
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:23,312
Oh, that sucks.

326
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:28,466
He's a fucking drunken dipshit. He used
to kick my ass just to prove he could.

327
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,597
You know when people would call you
those things like...

328
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,793
..."cemetery girl" and "Vampira"?

329
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,835
Yeah.

330
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,387
I never thought that was funny.

331
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:52,557
I should go. Would you just
make sure your brother gets these?

332
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,355
Of course.

333
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:59,473
Hey, look. If you need
anything, like to talk...

334
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:03,631
...or something,
you can call me.

335
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,271
All right.

336
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,915
- Where do you want to hang the food?
- Can't it wait till after dinner?

337
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,667
I've already taken out what we're
going to eat. I'd rather not risk it.

338
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:26,477
I'm sorry it's inconvenient...

339
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:29,556
...but would you prefer we were mauled
in our sleep by bears?

340
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:32,909
Ruth?
You need to relax.

341
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:46,190
Hello, I'm Rosemary.
How can I help you?

342
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,596
Hi. I need to make
arrangements for a funeral.

343
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,232
All right.

344
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,349
My wife's in the restroom.
She'll be out in a minute.

345
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,957
- Can I ask who the funeral is for?
- It's for me.

346
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,390
Bet you don't get too many people
shopping for their own funeral.

347
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,911
It happens. Most people who know
they're going to die want to have a say.

348
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:19,999
Planning it with your husband could be
a meaningful process for you both.

349
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,388
- Is it cancer?
- Yeah.

350
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:29,831
It's everywhere.
Liver now.

351
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,870
- Brenda.
- My husband hates me doing this.

352
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,629
He wants me to spend this time
doing things I always dreamed of...

353
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,196
...but never gave
myself permission to...

354
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,311
Pardon me.

355
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,513
The coughing blood and pissing needles
thing kind of gets in the way.

356
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,757
- He just wants you to be happy.
- He just doesn't want me to die.

357
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,076
Okay, it's just too fucked up, Brenda.
I can't do it. I can't.

358
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,310
- He's not ready.
- It's hard for him.

359
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,439
Probably harder
than it is for you.

360
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,360
That was the most fucked up
thing you've ever done to me.

361
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,040
- Sorry.
- That was like the shit...

362
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,874
...you pulled on those doctors
to get a rise out of them.

363
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,157
- Are you gonna start barking at me?
- I might.

364
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:28,071
- What you did just now was not funny!
- Well, it wasn't meant to be.

365
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,793
You counsel people about
death every day, Nate...

366
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,997
...when death is what
you're most afraid of.

367
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:38,193
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Of course I'm afraid of it.

368
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,750
- What sane person isn't?
- I'm not.

369
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,794
Yeah, well, I said, what sane person.

370
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,998
- Hello.
- Hey.

371
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:20,638
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing, I just...

372
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,000
I just wanted to
talk to somebody.

373
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:29,837
- What are you doing tonight?
- I don't know. What are you doing?

374
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:31,481
You.

375
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:48,359
Shit. Fuck! Shit.

376
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:55,396
- What are you looking for?
- Aspirin.

377
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:58,276
I know there was a bottle
of aspirin in here.

378
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:00,195
Yeah, I took some earlier.

379
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:02,399
You did? Are you okay?

380
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:05,202
Yeah, why?

381
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,152
You found it, didn't you?
You found it and kept it for yourself.

382
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,915
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

383
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:15,161
You're wearing my shirt.

384
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:18,761
- Fuck!
- What is this, like a date?

385
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,994
Sort of.

386
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:24,559
No way, you're dating
the square-dancing guy?

387
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,399
- Weird.
- Weird why?

388
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:33,801
No, I get it. He's hot in a kind of
generic, Banana Republic kind of way.

389
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:38,680
- Claire, I really need that aspirin bottle.
- David, I really don't have it.

390
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:43,753
- What was in there?
- He gave me some pills.

391
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:47,320
Now I'll have to say, "Sorry, I lost
them because I'm this old-guy geek...

392
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:50,920
...and I'm completely uncool in this world
in which you seem to thrive...

393
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:54,161
...you perfect distillation
of human evolution."

394
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:58,075
Okay, is this split
personality thing...

395
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:01,674
...like, something that happens
when Mom goes out of town?

396
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,603
Because I like you
like this way better.

397
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:13,678
- Dinner was delicious.
- Food just tastes better outdoors.

398
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:16,194
Remember what we ate
the first time we went camping?

399
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,963
No.

400
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:21,999
- Pork chops with fire-roasted vegetables.
- Oh, yes.

401
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:26,721
The sky was so clear that night.
Just like tonight.

402
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:30,201
Did you know you're not supposed
to go camping if you're menstruating?

403
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,760
- What?
- It's true.

404
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:35,275
My husband buried
a young woman once.

405
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:38,199
She went on a camping trip.
She was menstruating.

406
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:41,078
A bear smelled the blood and
killed her in her sleeping bag.

407
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:43,680
Killed one of her friends too.

408
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:48,197
But we only buried her.
Not the friend.

409
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:56,564
I'm glad we're seeing
each other again.

410
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:59,875
Me too. It's nice.

411
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:05,806
- What's wrong?
- I've got a little bit of a headache.

412
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:20,715
I'm sorry I forgot those pills.

413
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:24,282
That's no big deal.
You can be my drug tonight.

414
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:31,281
So, what's with the guy who's been
staring at you since we got here?

415
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:40,639
Shit! That's Keith.
We dated.

416
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:44,322
- He's pretty hot. You guys still friends?
- Not really.

417
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:48,361
- Why not? I'm friends with my exes.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

418
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,125
He's coming over.
Is he into three-ways?

419
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,835
He's a cop, so don't mention
the drugs or anything.

420
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,161
- Sure, Dad.
- David.

421
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,637
- Keith, hi. How's it going?
- Good. It's going good.

422
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,241
This is the last place
I'd ever expect to see you.

423
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:08,802
Yeah. Well, it was Kurt's idea.
Kurt, this is Keith.

424
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:11,157
- Hey.
- Hi.

425
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:15,006
Kurt teaches square dancing.

426
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,005
Tried to get David to go dancing
when we were together.

427
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:20,403
Told me he didn't
even like to dance.

428
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:22,876
Thanks.

429
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:28,316
- Eddie, this is David and...
- Kurt. Hi.

430
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:29,926
Hi.

431
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,040
Hi.

432
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:37,605
- So how'd you guys meet?
- Eddie's an EMT.

433
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:41,803
Met on the job.
Newlyweds in a car crash.

434
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:44,278
He saved the bride
right in front of me.

435
00:37:45,768 --> 00:37:49,727
- What about the groom?
- Didn't make it.

436
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,483
The bride had eternity with the man
she loved right in front of her...

437
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:57,402
...then you go save her and
she ends up left behind, alone.

438
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:01,286
That's one way
of looking at it.

439
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:07,276
Well, it's good to see you.

440
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:11,567
- Yeah, nice meeting you.
- You too.

441
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:20,528
Well, of course he's dating
Mr. Fucking Super Guy ER.

442
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:24,802
I bet they have great sex,
I mean, with the uniforms and all.

443
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,559
I dated a cop once. Total control freak.
Now, firemen on the other hand...

444
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:32,603
Is dating an excuse for you to figure out
who you wanna be when you grow up?

445
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,561
I don't know.
Is dating like an excuse...

446
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:38,079
...for you to see who you wished
you'd been when you were my age?

447
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,282
- Let's get out of here.
- Why?

448
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,724
Come on.

449
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:15,921
David. Wait, David.
Look...

450
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,649
- Who was that?
- Just a guy I know.

451
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,127
He wants to go home with us.

452
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,083
- I don't think so.
- Come on, you'll love him.

453
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:26,967
- I promise, he's a total fuck machine.
- I said, no.

454
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:30,807
Why not? Why are you
taking this so seriously?

455
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:34,204
Because I'm a serious guy.
I bury people for a living.

456
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:36,564
Well, that shit's in your head.

457
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:39,646
Yeah, you're right.
That shit is in my head.

458
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:47,691
Look, go. Have fun. I'm just too...

459
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:49,930
I'm sorry that I can't...

460
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,322
I'm sorry. Bye.

461
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,364
You really spooked me, Bren.

462
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:16,053
What?
The idea of me dying?

463
00:42:17,054 --> 00:42:18,692
Well, yeah.

464
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:21,963
I will die someday.

465
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,004
We die, Nate.

466
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:35,165
We all die.

467
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:08,327
Hello?

468
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,245
You certainly took
your sweet time getting here.

469
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:03,530
- You'll ruin that shirt.
- Who cares?

470
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:15,455
What, you're hitting on me now?
Two guys aren't enough, you slut?

471
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:19,285
Oh, dear.
I suppose I owe you an apology.

472
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:22,648
- Why? I'm dead.
- Yes, but I was seeing Hiram before you...

473
00:44:22,857 --> 00:44:26,486
I was gone long before I died.

474
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,131
You'd like Hiram. He's kind.
He makes me laugh.

475
00:44:30,777 --> 00:44:34,008
- I got my money on the florist.
- Oh, heavens no, Nathaniel.

476
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:37,015
The man is a complete savage.

477
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:44,975
Oh, God. This is the hearse
that was always stalling, isn't it?

478
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:48,374
Remember after that funeral in Malibu
for that jazz musician?

479
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:52,650
We broke down on the side of the PCH
and we made love in the back.

480
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:55,206
If this baby could talk.

481
00:44:56,577 --> 00:45:01,810
Nathaniel, what happened to us?
We were so in love once.

482
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,167
Life happened to us.

483
00:45:04,977 --> 00:45:09,335
I buried hundreds of people
and we watched each other grow old.

484
00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:12,487
- But we're not old.
- Well, technically speaking...

485
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:15,087
...I'm as old as
I'm ever gonna get.

486
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:18,730
We were such children
when we met.

487
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:21,850
Then we watched
those children disappear.

488
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:32,898
Damn it! Stalled again.
Won't go forward. Won't go back.

489
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,771
Well, these can't be helping.

490
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:58,458
No tears.

491
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:04,616
- I miss what we had.
- So find it again.

492
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,733
What a beautiful day.
You should have woken me up.

493
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,613
I thought you could use the sleep
after the night we had.

494
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,096
You've never been that
passionate with me before.

495
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,212
Thank you for a wonderful night.

496
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,698
- Last night?
- You were spectacular.

497
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,773
What?

498
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:36,253
- Do I just sit anywhere?
- Wherever you'd like.

499
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:49,495
- Nice suit.
- Thank you. Bought it last week.

500
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,135
You need more than one suit
to be a funeral director.

501
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:54,571
No, you need
to pass a test first.

502
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:57,375
You just can't let
go of that, can you?

503
00:47:58,621 --> 00:48:01,579
- I failed the first time I took it.
- You did not.

504
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:07,778
Yes, I did. I fuck up a lot more
than you might think. I fuck up a lot.

505
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:30,261
- Hey.
- Hi.

506
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:36,652
- How are you holding up?
- Okay, I guess.

507
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:39,217
It's just weird.

508
00:48:42,582 --> 00:48:45,335
Why are you being
so nice to me?

509
00:48:46,702 --> 00:48:50,251
- You little bastard!
- Sam, we didn't think you'd show.

510
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:56,493
- Stop it!
- Stop! Leave him alone!

511
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:59,376
I'm gonna kill you,
you useless fuck!

512
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,141
Okay, everybody calm down.

513
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,653
Probably wasted out of your mind,
whacking off!

514
00:49:04,063 --> 00:49:05,974
Let my kid shoot himself!

515
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:07,172
You're gonna blame him?

516
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:09,493
Where the fuck were you
for the past two years?

517
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:21,098
All right, just take it easy.

518
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:24,696
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

519
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:28,134
- Don't worry about it, I'll deal with it.
- Thank you.

520
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:37,820
Who the fuck
was that little bitch out there?

521
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:40,020
That's my sister.

522
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:44,496
You should warn her. Gabriel has
been a fuckup his whole life.

523
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:47,582
When I lived there, he used
to drive his mother nuts...

524
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:50,542
...with all the shit that he'd do.
Staying out all night.

525
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:53,453
No fucking responsibility.

526
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:57,899
- That's my kid who's dead.
- I know.

527
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:07,503
It was my gun.
I bought it for Vickie.

528
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:12,735
Because I was gonna leave for a while,
you know? Go up north for a job.

529
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:15,014
Make some extra money.

530
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:19,172
How could he let
something like this happen?

531
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:22,182
It's not right.
It's just not fucking right!

532
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,019
Jesus, he was 6!

533
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:28,576
Everybody dies.

534
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:33,176
Some of us live to be 100, some never
make it through the first day.

535
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:35,222
That's just a fucking
fact of nature, pal.

536
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,057
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

537
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:39,056
You can punch as many
people as you want.

538
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:41,779
It's not gonna change
the fact that boy is dead.

539
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:45,102
And your chance to be
in his life is over.

540
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:50,262
Did you use that time well
or did you just piss it away?

541
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:54,822
And your own fucking life
is a ticking clock too.

542
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:57,535
Everybody's is.

543
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:33,461
- Mom, you're home. I was worried.
- Worried, why?

544
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:38,621
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, David, you must go camping.

545
00:51:38,826 --> 00:51:41,386
It's so spectacular
up there right now.

546
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:46,421
Spring is such a full time.
So much color, so much detail.

547
00:51:46,626 --> 00:51:49,743
And the smells.
It's like nothing else.

548
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:53,018
And you're okay?
No sickness, no headaches?

549
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,980
Oh, no.
I had one on the trip...

550
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:59,463
...but I took some aspirin
and it just disappeared.

551
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:03,383
Yes, well, aspirin is
damn good stuff.

552
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,498
How was the service?

553
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,983
There was a fight that broke out,
but I let Nate take care of it.

554
00:52:09,187 --> 00:52:12,623
I'm glad you boys are working
so well together now.

555
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:18,145
Claire, you look terrible.
Are you not feeling well?

556
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:23,498
I'm just a little wrecked.
We buried my friend's brother today.

557
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:26,500
He's your friend?
I had no idea.

558
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:29,540
Yeah.

559
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:33,658
He's the foot guy.

560
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:36,897
Oh, my God.

561
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,061
Good night.

562
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:52,422
There's so much you wish you could
protect your children from.

563
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:01,460
Night, Mom.

564
00:53:02,468 --> 00:53:04,140
Night, dear.

565
00:53:56,591 --> 00:54:47,746
