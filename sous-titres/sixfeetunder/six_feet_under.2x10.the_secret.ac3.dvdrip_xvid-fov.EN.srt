1
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,409
- Hey.
- Hi. I need to sit down.

2
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,872
Oh, God, I'm so fat!

3
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,875
So what papers do you need me to sign?

4
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,636
Don't tell me I forgot them.

5
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,872
I'm forgetting everything.
It's because of the hormones.

6
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,679
Which, by the way, made me
a complete freak the last time I saw you.

7
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,990
I'm sorry again for being so hostile.

8
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,997
How are you doing?
It's so good to see you again.

9
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,868
Hi, Lisa, I didn't know you were in town.
What's new?

10
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,832
- Doing the whole single-mom routine.
- Right, I can see that. Good for you.

11
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,911
Are you taking pictures these days?

12
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,357
No. I took some photos with a friend's
camera and I wanted to keep doing it.

13
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,510
So I went on eBay and I got my own.

14
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,752
But it was really just because I was bored
and it was kind of stupid. But...

15
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,191
I have to go to school. So I'll see you later.

16
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,236
I'll be out in a second.

17
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,755
Shit!

18
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,953
Okay, let's go.

19
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,555
Hey, you think your chair seems right
for that space?

20
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,036
You said you were kidding about
me not bringing my ugly-ass furniture.

21
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,189
It's so big.

22
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,794
It's a really good chair
for watching television.

23
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,108
I guess.

24
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,029
Maybe it is too big. I think it is. It's too big.

25
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,469
You know, I'll put it in storage
with the rest of my stuff.

26
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,634
Shit. I gotta return <i>The Great Escape</i> today.
I'm gonna be fucking late.

27
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,995
I'll return it. It's on my way.

28
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
I never get tired
of watching Steve McQueen.

29
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,032
I think I've seen every one of his movies
at least three times.

30
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,350
Yeah, some of them four times.

31
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,394
Wow, this is...

32
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,710
Since I want your name
on the birth certificate...

33
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,917
my lawyer says you need to sign away
all custodial rights.

34
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,392
- I thought...
- What?

35
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,119
I thought we were gonna be
more casual about this.

36
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,919
It's a baby.
It's hard to be that casual about it.

37
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,115
Right.

38
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,480
Maybe I should have my lawyer look at this.

39
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,313
It's just a formality.
Cut the bullshit and just sign it.

40
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,469
Okay.

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,992
- You know what's weird about dead people?
- Everything?

42
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,192
How they look so perfect.

43
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,198
I just want to mess this woman's hair up
a little bit.

44
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,713
Please don't.

45
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,353
When I die, I want to be one big mess.
That's what life is: Messy.

46
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,876
Nate, I'm not accusing you.

47
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,829
It's better this way. We both know that.

48
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,193
I mean, I can't lie.

49
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,558
Of course, I would've loved to do this
with someone who wanted to be a father.

50
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,959
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,799
- I don't know what else to...
- But then I think how perfect this baby is.

52
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,348
And everything somehow seems right.

53
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,794
You know, somehow it's just so funny.

54
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,358
And you know, actually, I'm proud,
in a weird way.

55
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,080
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I'm having a child...

56
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,516
with the last person in the world
who would ever want a child.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,270
Why aren't you wearing your casts?

58
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,432
I take them off.

59
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,159
It's time for me to go.

60
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,708
But you're supposed to keep them on
until next week.

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,634
- I'm calling the doctor.
- He say it's okay. Look. See?

62
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,436
Your left foot looks purple.

63
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,155
Is always like that. Is from bad circulation.
You know that.

64
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,878
I guess I forgot.

65
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,030
Okay, it's time to get this show
on the road, yeah?

66
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,590
I guess I could call a taxi...

67
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,076
- even though it's a total rip-off.
- I can drive you!

68
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,511
It was a heart attack.

69
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,117
He died just like that.

70
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,233
So you want
a traditional Thai Buddhist service?

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,789
If that's a problem,
we can go somewhere else.

72
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,713
There are very specific elements,
and if you can't do it...

73
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,314
Please do not behave this way.

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,274
You will have to excuse my son.

75
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,555
He and my husband
hadn't spoken in months, and...

76
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,598
Mom, please. Not in front of this person.

77
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,359
Okay, Mr. Fisher, if you know the procedure,
let's hear it.

78
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,150
Actually, I've only been here
for a year or so, and...

79
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,670
Although I did read <i>Zen and the Art</i>
<i>of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> in high school...

80
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,591
That's probably my brother. David!

81
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,549
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop at Video West.
Some idiot ahead of me was writing a check.

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,952
I didn't even want to watch a movie
last night, but Keith got his way, as usual.

83
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,030
- This is...
- Bette and Phil Srisai. I'm David Fisher.

84
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,069
I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.

85
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,992
I'm so sorry for your loss.

86
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,270
Thank you.
We were just discussing my father's service.

87
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,477
I assume the deceased
will remain at the temple for three days...

88
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,278
before we have the service here?

89
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,636
Of course, Fisher & Sons will provide
all the requisite supplies:

90
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,234
The Buddha, the altar, the carpet-kneelers.

91
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,909
And you'll want some monks for chanting.

92
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,395
We prefer to use the ones from Riverside...

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,678
but if those aren't to your liking, we have
some good ones over in Eagle Rock.

94
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,349
Nikolai, your apartment is so...

95
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,753
It's very...

96
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,957
It has a lot of charm.

97
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,359
Thank you.

98
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,149
I still don't know what your big rush was.
You could've stayed with me until...

99
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,434
It was time.

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,035
But how do we know you're safe here?
You could be hurt by these ruffians.

101
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,235
I spoke to Yuri.

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,437
I tell him that February
is the biggest month for flowers.

103
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,988
He say he give me 30 days
to come up with the money.

104
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,833
- Are you gonna be able to do it?
- Yeah, sure, of course.

105
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,672
Well, that's nice.

106
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,310
Thank you for all the taking care of me.
You don't have to do that now.

107
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,879
You are done.

108
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,392
What about dinner?
You probably don't have any food.

109
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,552
I was gonna pack you lamb, but I forgot.
I'll go get the lamb.

110
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,030
No, I'll be fine. I get takeout from Eat-a-Pita.

111
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,598
Goodbye, Nikolai.

112
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,192
Goodbye, Ruthie.

113
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,390
I bet you Mr. Van Kirk
has sex with students in here after hours.

114
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,199
We should stake this place out later, okay?

115
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,680
- Claire?
- Oh, fuck.

116
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,791
- I think there was dust on the negative.
- No one's gonna notice.

117
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,996
No, I want it to be perfect.

118
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,074
- Claire, these are so sick!
- Thanks.

119
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,914
I've taken shots
of almost every single person...

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,514
that's come through in the past three weeks.

121
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,715
They're amazing.

122
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,759
It's like each one
is someone who's lying in bed with you...

123
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,557
telling you a little story
before you go to sleep.

124
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,593
I'm putting them together
for that thing for Foster's class.

125
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,990
- The fucking <i>Spoon River Anthology</i> paper?
- Yeah.

126
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,313
I just thought that since each poem
is from the perspective of a dead person...

127
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,075
that it would be a really interesting way to...
I don't know.

128
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,349
Show what the poems brought out in me.

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,797
Okay, that sounded really geeky.

130
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,714
No, that's genius.
You could really do something with this.

131
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,839
Yeah, right.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,275
Claire, I have to tell you something.

133
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,394
I got into Yale. I heard yesterday.

134
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,308
You don't feel jealous or hate me, right?

135
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,668
No. You worked really hard for it.
Congratulations.

136
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,433
I know you didn't play the game
the way I did...

137
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,308
but I'm sure you'll get into UCLA,
which is a really good school, too.

138
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,235
Actually, no, I didn't make the cut.

139
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,352
But they sent me
a list of community colleges I could go to...

140
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,749
and said to try again next year.

141
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,910
So I'm looking at East Valley.

142
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,677
I'm gonna be a famous photographer
and make a gazillion dollars...

143
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,036
taking pictures of anorexic models
and fucked-up actors.

144
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,998
So maybe I don't even need
to go to college, right?

145
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,871
It's a joke. I'm joking.

146
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,231
But you could.
You should just become a photographer.

147
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,149
Because, truthfully,
East Valley is kind of a shitty school.

148
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,792
So there was that one
a month ago in the bookstore.

149
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,633
Then I met this other guy
at the Farmers Market.

150
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,836
That place has gotten so touristy.

151
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,312
And then there was this guy last week
at the Rose Café, who...

152
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,273
No, that doesn't count.
That was an almost one.

153
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,273
What exactly do you hope
to get out of therapy?

154
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,636
Melissa gave me your number
because I guess I'm...

155
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,553
I don't know.

156
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,398
It's not that I'm unhappy. I'm not unhappy.
I'm really not.

157
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,716
But I know that what I'm doing
is a little strange.

158
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,833
I mean, most people who are engaged
to someone they really love...

159
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,115
don't have sex with strangers.

160
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,798
- Or maybe they do.
- Does that matter?

161
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,109
I think I like the euphoria I get
from these encounters.

162
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,319
I'm just having a little trouble with anxiety.

163
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,955
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

164
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,631
It's like I'm coexisting
in these two separate realities.

165
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,271
There's my Nate reality,
and then there's this other reality.

166
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,751
And I would like to not feel
so anxious about it.

167
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,990
It's not guilt. It's just edginess.

168
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,915
So, that's it.

169
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,594
I'd like to not feel edgy. That's why I'm here.

170
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,069
Okay, so you would like...

171
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,438
to continue to have these encounters,
as you call them...

172
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,877
- but you would like to not feel edgy.
- Ideally.

173
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,310
I know what you're thinking.

174
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,911
You think that I'm afraid of intimacy...

175
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,833
so I'm trying to sabotage
my relationship with my fiancé.

176
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,753
Is that what I'm thinking
or is that what you're thinking?

177
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,829
No.

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,192
I just wanted to clarify...

179
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,829
that I don't necessarily think
that what I'm doing is destructive.

180
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,431
It might even be healthy.

181
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,954
How so?

182
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,833
Maybe it's not good for me
to totally lose myself in one person...

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,308
and this is a way for me to have...

184
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,190
a completely separate,
private area that's my own.

185
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,914
Not his, not ours.

186
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,158
Maybe that's healthy for me.

187
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,198
Listen, I assume that Melissa told you...

188
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,794
one of my specialties is sexual addiction.

189
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,955
No.

190
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,198
I don't know how much you know
of this issue, but obviously...

191
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,558
it involves the sublimation of emotions
that are too painful to address.

192
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,671
It's the root of all addiction, really.

193
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,275
<i>I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you</i>
<i>because you don't need help.</i>

194
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,194
<i>You've clearly evolved beyond the need</i>
<i>for therapy. I'm actually in awe of you...</i>

195
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,477
<i>because I'd be fucking strangers</i>
<i>like a truck-stop whore on crack...</i>

196
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,199
<i>if I wasn't so inhibited</i>
<i>by my Judeo-Christian upbringing.</i>

197
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,031
It's not down here.

198
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,590
We used to have a few Buddhas in here.
I can't believe we can't find one.

199
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,036
I've read all this stuff about Buddhism,
but it never stays with me.

200
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,156
Just know that everything is nothing.

201
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,708
Is that it?
I thought it was, "Nothing is everything."

202
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,758
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- I found one.

203
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,070
- It looks kind of girly, doesn't it?
- Sort of.

204
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,119
Think it's water damage. I'll get you
some stuff to clean him off, okay?

205
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,591
His little hat is cute, so pointy.

206
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,513
I wonder if anyone
poked their eyes out on one by accident.

207
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,795
Look at all these unclaimed cremains.

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,713
Can you imagine
having a member of your family cremated...

209
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,633
and then not caring enough
to pick up their ashes?

210
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,993
I think sometimes it's too hard
for people to acknowledge...

211
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,913
that someone they loved
is now just chunks of soot.

212
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,274
David Fisher. Hey.

213
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,718
Yes, I returned the videos.
Didn't I say I would?

214
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,313
Sure, swordfish is fine. Whatever. Bye.

215
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,758
You hate swordfish.

216
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,599
I know. It's funny.
Now that Keith and I are living together...

217
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,797
I find myself trying to be
so fucking agreeable all the time.

218
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,440
- Why?
- Because, if you aren't, things come up...

219
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,829
and you've no idea
how big the thing's gonna be.

220
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,629
It's like this constant negotiation.
You can never just relax.

221
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,313
Is that just a phase
or is it always going to be like that?

222
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,312
Don't ask me. Look, I have no fucking idea.

223
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,868
Maybe that's just what a relationship is.

224
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,270
Constantly doing things
you have absolutely no desire to do.

225
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,589
Nate, Brenda, come on in!

226
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,433
We have so many details to go over...

227
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,229
before the bridal shower on Sunday.
Isn't it exciting?

228
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,599
It's all too much for me.

229
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,116
Please, it's all for you.
I'd rather just cancel it.

230
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,792
Are you mad?

231
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,634
Lulu Smeigel cancelled her weekend
at Canyon Ranch just to be here.

232
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,759
Now, you must try one of these.

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,275
It's made from this incredible liqueur...

234
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,272
that comes from the most
poverty-stricken village in Belize.

235
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,749
- It's delicious!
- Right. Your trip.

236
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,115
- You look like you had a good time.
- It was fabulous!

237
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,194
Your skin looks good.
Did you have some work done?

238
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,193
Not at all. It's just happiness.
You should try it sometime.

239
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,989
Is Billy here?

240
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,478
No. When I got back, I found a note saying
he's staying with friends in Portland.

241
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,118
But he didn't leave a number.

242
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,191
Brenda, did he give it to you?

243
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,436
- No, he didn't.
- That's right.

244
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,353
He still has all that raging resentment
towards you.

245
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,036
Who are you hiding in the bedroom?

246
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,192
Let me guess. Another one
of your young South American gigolos?

247
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,193
Not at all, darling.
He's an aging intellectual from the Bronx.

248
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,517
Isn't this fabulous?

249
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,713
Bern and I are back, and better than ever.

250
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,189
So I realized I'd made a terrible mistake,
got on the next plane to Belize...

251
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,316
and begged your mother to take me back.

252
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,073
Come on, be honest, dear.
The whore dumped you.

253
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,549
Because I was subconsciously
pushing her away...

254
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,036
because I really love you.

255
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,270
The point is, the sex has been incredible.

256
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,231
Just like when we first met.

257
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,633
I'll never forget what you were wearing
the first time you walked into my office.

258
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,759
The tight Givenchy blue skirt with a slit
that went right up to my wazoo.

259
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,038
I knew immediately I was gonna have
some wildly inappropriate feelings for you.

260
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,712
And, boy, was I right!

261
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,879
Mom was one of Dad's patients.
It's actually kind of disgusting.

262
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,993
I was not a patient. I was in grad school.

263
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,832
I was an intern.

264
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,471
And the second I lay down...

265
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,950
I knew I was never gonna get up
off that couch.

266
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,235
We terminated therapy after a few months...

267
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,030
and waited the correct amount of time
before embarking on a relationship.

268
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,240
At least, that's what we tell everyone.

269
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,029
I'll give you a hand with that.

270
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,833
Okay, what?

271
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,399
I can't believe you just took him back.

272
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,590
Are you that scared of being alone?

273
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,514
God, you're so fucking depressing.

274
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,232
I love your father.

275
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,638
And I'm very happy. You noticed it yourself.

276
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,308
Maybe that's what's upsetting you so much,
that I'm so happy.

277
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,355
I'm sorry for whatever tensions this
engagement is bringing up in you and Nate.

278
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,557
But my advice to you...

279
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,599
is get your shit together
and don't blow it with this one.

280
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,354
Because you are a major handful.

281
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,077
Sorry. I noticed a coffee stain on the couch.
I was trying to get it out.

282
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,789
You still mad at me about the swordfish?

283
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,279
You should've told me you didn't like it
instead of waiting till I slaved over it.

284
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,557
- You're right. I should've told you.
- So why didn't you?

285
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,717
Because you scare me.

286
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,238
Shut the fuck up.

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,115
You want everything to be perfect,
all the time.

288
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,395
When it's not, you get upset.

289
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,631
I didn't get any sleep last night.
I'm too tired for this conversation.

290
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:08,933
Sometimes I feel like
if I don't do or say exactly what you want...

291
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:12,016
you might decide
you don't want to be with me.

292
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,902
That's just stupid.

293
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:18,218
Thanks.

294
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,020
When we were together the first time...

295
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:34,335
it seemed like all our problems stemmed
from my not coming out.

296
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:35,652
They did.

297
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,894
Now I think it was just easier for you
to make us believe that.

298
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:46,864
If everything could be blamed
on my not coming out...

299
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,663
then nothing ever had to be your fault.

300
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,380
What's under that arm right here?

301
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:30,536
- Hey, Nate!
- Hey!

302
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,695
- Say hello to Nate.
- Hello.

303
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:35,741
You didn't like that?

304
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:43,376
All right. Let's go.

305
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,615
Look, Vanessa's sister,
she's got this publicist...

306
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:53,737
and the first thing she does is get her
invited to some spa thing in Long Beach.

307
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:54,813
So?

308
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:58,658
So she took Vanessa and the baby.
Now my sitter's sick, so here we are.

309
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:01,212
Mrs. Hirsch needs to be finished by 1:00.

310
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:06,021
I have a kid, okay?
These type of things happen.

311
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:10,822
Anyhow, I gave Mrs. Hirsch the once-over.
She's a young breast cancer. Piece of cake.

312
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:14,817
- Hopefully I'll get a sitter in time to do her.
- That's not good enough.

313
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,379
My hands are tied here, okay?

314
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,137
Unless you take care of Julio
while I do Mrs. Hirsch.

315
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:25,818
- No...
- Come on, I don't see you doing anything.

316
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:29,533
Look, I can't. I have to clean a Buddha.

317
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,655
He looks like he's asleep.

318
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:37,898
He's not.

319
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,335
He's just blissed out
because he has the secret to enlightenment.

320
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:43,176
What's "enlightmintz"?

321
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:50,693
- I guess it's knowing everything.
- My dad knows everything.

322
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:53,657
Well, he knows a lot.

323
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:56,662
He knows everything.
How much do you know?

324
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,012
Not much.

325
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:17,413
- Ruthie? Did we have plans?
- No.

326
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:21,334
Does that mean I have to go away?

327
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:27,415
I do not need my house
to smell like fake lemons.

328
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,938
- It smells good already.
- No, it doesn't.

329
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:33,974
- I like everything the way it is.
- But I don't.

330
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:44,023
I thought I would... Isn't this fun?

331
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,095
It's a surprise sleepover.

332
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:51,295
Okay, let's do it, sure.

333
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,854
- Then let's get started.
- Okay.

334
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:59,054
First, we have to get this place into shape,
so we can have a nice, cozy, clean evening.

335
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:00,977
We're going to wallpaper?

336
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:04,136
No, silly. It's contact paper for the drawers.

337
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:09,092
Ruthie, why do I want little cherries
in my drawers?

338
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:12,658
It's hard to explain. You just do.

339
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:15,863
You failed me?

340
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:18,902
I'm sorry, Claire,
but I asked for a literary analysis.

341
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:22,021
- So you didn't think they were any good?
- That's not the point.

342
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:25,062
This is an English class.
I wanted something in English.

343
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:28,341
So you'd just prefer I download
some stupid crap off the Internet...

344
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,336
than do something that's actually creative?

345
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,578
I don't have time for this.
Would you just do the make-over?

346
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,698
I was really happy with Mrs. Sibley.

347
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,413
"The secret of woman, the soil.

348
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:51,254
"My secret: Under a mound
that you shall never find."

349
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,254
Just so you know,
I put a lot of myself into this.

350
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:01,414
I wasn't just slacking off.

351
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:05,301
Look, I don't want to fail you.
Just give me some kind of paper.

352
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:08,820
I assume you need to graduate.
You are going to college, right?

353
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:11,941
- Yup, East Valley.
- Really? I went there.

354
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,252
David Fisher.

355
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,141
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Hi.

356
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:30,702
I'm calling to tell you we're having lunch
with Taylor and Karla on Saturday.

357
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:35,577
You can't just schedule things without
asking me first. That's not what couples do.

358
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:38,656
- How would you know what couples do?
<i>- I watch TV.</i>

359
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:41,901
Or at least I used to
when I had a comfortable chair to sit in.

360
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:44,737
<i>Listen, I was in the middle</i>
<i>of five things at work, okay?</i>

361
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:47,213
You know,
not everyone can always act so perfect.

362
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:50,979
Yeah, I know that. That's what
I was trying to tell you last night.

363
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:55,383
You should check with me
before you say yes to things.

364
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,853
- Are you available?
<i>- Yes.</i>

365
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:00,415
Then pretend I asked you first.

366
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:09,893
So I went the one time,
but I'm not going back to Dr. Michaelson.

367
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:14,540
- Are you annoyed?
- No, why would I be annoyed?

368
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:18,663
- You can do whatever you want.
- I'm sure she's good. She's just not for me.

369
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,903
You didn't tell me she was so serious.

370
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:25,303
I didn't realize you were looking for laughs.

371
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:32,622
I can ask around for more names.
My friend Paula's been to 40 shrinks...

372
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:36,140
although I guess that's not
the best endorsement for them.

373
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,536
I'm fine. I think I'm the only one
that can solve any of my problems.

374
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:43,537
Yeah, we are ultimately
stuck with ourselves.

375
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:46,099
It's so fucking puritanical...

376
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:49,381
how we're conditioned to buy into
the whole true-Iove-monogamy crap.

377
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:51,614
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.

378
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:58,099
So I've been thinking,
the next time that I feel adventurous...

379
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:01,140
what if I include Nate?

380
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:03,097
Not a bad idea.

381
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:07,214
You remember Terry from Orange County
I was telling you about?

382
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:10,614
- She has the lifestyle parties on weekends.
- Oh, right.

383
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:14,663
She and her husband are committed.
They have sex with strangers once a week.

384
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:18,532
They're really happy.
Monogamy just isn't for everyone.

385
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,182
I know. Look at my parents.

386
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:23,176
Actually, don't look at them.
That's what they want.

387
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:29,413
So maybe we could go to Terry's
this weekend and check it out.

388
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,972
Yeah, whatever. I'll give you the address.

389
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:35,261
- I hope you and Nate like it.
- I don't want to bring Nate.

390
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:39,053
I mean not yet. First you and I should go
and see what it's like.

391
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,460
Okay, what do you think?

392
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,102
It feels like a whole new place.

393
00:29:58,184 --> 00:30:00,414
Yes, it really does.

394
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,576
Who am I kidding?

395
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:07,376
I can't stay here.

396
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,180
I'll never be able to stay here.

397
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:13,901
It's too dank. It will always be dank.

398
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:17,497
I'm only human. I can only do so much.

399
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:22,340
Nikolai, this is crazy.
Why aren't you moving into my house?

400
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,574
I don't know, it's...

401
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:28,295
Why are you acting like we talked
about this? We haven't, have we?

402
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:30,295
I guess it's just been on my mind.

403
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:32,773
I like how things have been
for the past few months.

404
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:37,096
I like seeing you every night and morning.
I don't want to go backward, do you?

405
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,619
I love you.

406
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:52,217
I wish you didn't sound so sad
when you say that.

407
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:56,773
I wish I wanted to move in with you
and be with you all the time.

408
00:30:57,744 --> 00:31:00,463
I want to want that more than anything.

409
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,576
But I don't.

410
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,979
Maybe I am the one with the problem.

411
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:11,378
Maybe I have been alone and cut off
for so long...

412
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:13,614
that I no longer know how to do it.

413
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,574
Maybe I am not capable of it.

414
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:22,657
Can't we go on as we were before accident?

415
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,220
I think I should go home.

416
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,422
Didn't Mom leave any real food for dinner?

417
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:42,820
No, there was just a note saying
she was gone for the night.

418
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,658
So why aren't you two
with your loved ones?

419
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:49,860
- Late shift.
- Shiatsu appointment.

420
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,662
- What's this?
- Give me that.

421
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:58,577
- It's this thing for school.
- I don't believe this.

422
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:01,341
David, look at these.

423
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,782
That's Mrs. Steiner.

424
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:10,817
Mr. Thomas. The Harrisons.

425
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,701
Mr. Benson.

426
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,018
Mrs. Orozco.
God, Rico did an amazing job on her.

427
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:21,581
- So do you think they're any good?
- I think they fucking suck!

428
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,132
Do you know
what kind of lawsuit this could cause?

429
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:26,692
What kind of stupid,
fucked-up child are you?

430
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:29,173
I was trying to do something
I gave a shit about.

431
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,777
What's going on here?

432
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,260
Nate, I heard you yelling.

433
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,781
- Someone please tell me what's going on.
- Nothing.

434
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:41,732
You were spending the night out.
Why are you back?

435
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:43,701
That's none of your business!

436
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,295
Hey, got some change?

437
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,537
Fuck you, too!

438
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:12,055
You're not listening to me.
I said this shirt feels funny.

439
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,932
- It scratches my neck.
- Too bad. It's the only clean one you had...

440
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:19,858
and I can't take your uncle's bitching
if he sees one little apple juice stain.

441
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:22,617
- I want to go back and get my yellow one!
- I said no.

442
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:25,662
- Turn around, now!
- You don't tell me what to do.

443
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,462
Mom!

444
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,743
- What are you doing?
- We gotta get out of here.

445
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:45,023
I had no idea
East Valley was so close to the freeway.

446
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,617
It's very convenient.

447
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:50,260
That's the Student Center.
That's where your mailbox will be.

448
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:51,652
Great.

449
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:55,743
I can go there and get letters
from people begging me not to kill myself.

450
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,814
I bet you some famous people went here.

451
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,417
Someone like...

452
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,297
David Spade.

453
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:09,739
Okay, there's way too many flyers
with the word "Baptist" on them.

454
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,020
Look, you can make extra money
as a phone sex operator.

455
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:17,140
Yeah, Baptist phone sex.

456
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,657
It says here
they have a really good arts center.

457
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:23,941
No, it's under construction.
It won't be open till 2004.

458
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:29,463
That's okay.

459
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,292
I need to start being more connected
to the real world.

460
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:35,103
I'm thinking about taking
some business courses.

461
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:46,260
- Mommy, we have to...
- Just shut up.

462
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,217
I need to think.

463
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:52,813
Okay. Nothing there. I think nothing's there.

464
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,696
Where have I missed?

465
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:58,216
- I don't want anyone to find anything.
- We have to tell the cops.

466
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,376
No, we don't!
We just got to pray nobody saw us.

467
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:05,695
It wasn't my fault. We can't help him now.

468
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:08,373
- We have to tell somebody.
- No, we don't!

469
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:12,218
God! I am so tired!
I am so fucking tired of this shit!

470
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:14,852
Why can't I ever have some fucking peace?

471
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:24,657
Baby, we can't tell the cops.

472
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,536
Okay? They'll take me away from you.

473
00:35:28,624 --> 00:35:30,979
Do you want the cops
to take me away from you?

474
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:33,703
- No.
- Then we don't tell the cops.

475
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:38,659
Okay? This is our little secret.
Do you hear me?

476
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,417
Our little secret.

477
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:46,097
- Say it.
- It's our little secret.

478
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:58,772
Of course they're late.
I've got a turkey breast drying up.

479
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,900
I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

480
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:08,179
No, I didn't get any sleep last night
because you were kicking me for hours.

481
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:12,621
You know what? I have nightmares.
Is that my fault, too, like everything else?

482
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:21,940
- You're 40 minutes late.
- Sorry, something came up.

483
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,342
Hey, little girl.

484
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,782
Fuck, Bren, it's just that it's Saturday night.

485
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:36,462
You know, I thought we planned to
on Saturday night...

486
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:39,462
Yeah, I know you have
the shitty shower tomorrow.

487
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,340
All right. No.

488
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,736
Just stay at home
and take care of yourself, all right?

489
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:52,303
All right, bye.

490
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,616
Maybe you shouldn't jump so hard.
What if he catches us?

491
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:05,343
- I don't care.
- Taylor, that's enough.

492
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,063
My mom ran over somebody on Washington.

493
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,613
What?

494
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:15,496
It was an accident.
It was an old, bald white guy.

495
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:18,303
But we're not gonna tell anybody.
It's a secret.

496
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:23,338
But secrets are so stupid.
People always find out about secrets.

497
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,583
Oh, my God.

498
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:30,063
I was just kidding.

499
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:33,424
I got you, I got you good.

500
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,898
- Taylor, that's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

501
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,222
This is even more of a shitbox
than I remembered.

502
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:52,533
Do you want to get out
while there's time to run?

503
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,740
Are you kidding? This is fantastic.

504
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:57,694
Melissa, you made it!

505
00:37:58,344 --> 00:37:59,538
Oh, crap.

506
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:02,582
Hey, Terry, look at you, girl!

507
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,295
Sex is so stupid.

508
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:18,413
This is like these parties
my parents used to have when I was a kid.

509
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,536
There was always
this really weird energy in the air.

510
00:38:21,624 --> 00:38:23,057
Just like tonight.

511
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:26,136
Oh, yes, the heady haze of expectancy.

512
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,700
Everyone got really drunk, got all handsy.

513
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:34,498
Although I don't think they were
official sex parties, like this one.

514
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,582
We should mingle.

515
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:43,018
This shit's amazing.

516
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,982
I found it in my kid's room
and beat the crap out of him.

517
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,861
Don't get me started on my kids.

518
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:51,095
They leave the house at all hours.
I've no idea what they're up to.

519
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,652
If I think about it too hard, I could cry.

520
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:11,903
You like that?

521
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:20,782
Why are you getting so upset?

522
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:23,822
I'm saying, isn't it weird
that Taylor made up this story?

523
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,781
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

524
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,493
Because you were going on and on
about the coffee stain on your couch.

525
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,257
It was me, okay? I did it.
I'm sorry. It was me.

526
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:34,858
Now shut up already about the coffee stain!

527
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:41,343
Don't call her. Let's just forget it.
It's just this weird thing Taylor said.

528
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:43,494
I'm not calling her, idiot.

529
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:49,018
Hello?

530
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:09,775
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

531
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:13,334
You killed me.
It was about seven years ago, remember?

532
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:15,700
You drove Lisa to have me killed.

533
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:19,216
Don't get me wrong.
I don't harbor any bad feelings or anything.

534
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:20,817
I'm pro-choice.

535
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:24,579
At least I would be, if I were alive.

536
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,337
You killed me, too.

537
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:33,653
Actually, I was miscarried by the girl
who worked at that Starbucks on Fremont.

538
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,455
I don't think she was ever planning
to tell you about me.

539
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:42,861
Yeah, Mom was your first real girlfriend.
Then I came along.

540
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:45,333
You guys offed me and then broke up.

541
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,183
Excuse me.

542
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:56,816
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

543
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:04,661
Who wants cookies and milk?

544
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,740
<i>I know the secret to everything.</i>

545
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:17,416
<i>But you'll never know it,</i>
<i>because you killed us.</i>

546
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:37,019
Hit-and-run at Washington and Third.

547
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:40,822
The vehicle's description
matches Karla's car.

548
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:45,015
The old, bald white guy was dead
before he got to Cedars.

549
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:47,376
Oh, my God.

550
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:55,020
- What do we do?
- What the hell do you think we do?

551
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,499
Marly and I were fighting night and day.

552
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,973
And then we came to one of these parties.

553
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,658
It was like we rediscovered each other.

554
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:07,059
And things have been hot between us
ever since.

555
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:09,533
Isn't that such a heartwarming story?

556
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:15,101
Some people just need a little extra help
to stay together, you know?

557
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:19,503
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- I'm for getting all the help I can get.

558
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:23,820
Marly, show the gals
that thing I got you for your birthday.

559
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:28,419
- This has given us another five years.
- This sounds good.

560
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:31,213
- Should we guess what it is?
- No, I'll tell you.

561
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:35,820
It's this little gizmo that he got online
at a sex website.

562
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:40,342
You've just got to see it to believe it.

563
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:44,542
- I can't wait.
- I can. I'm gonna get another drink.

564
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:47,576
I can't find it.

565
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:52,377
I'll just kill myself if I've lost that.

566
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:56,060
- Why do I lose everything?
- You probably left it in your coat.

567
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,783
I think we left them in that room over there.

568
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:06,859
I'll just go help Marly for a second.

569
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:10,493
Or you could come with us, if you want.

570
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:23,184
Sure, I'll help you.

571
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,900
I just saw Mr. Srisai's brother-in-law
put $20 in the casket.

572
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,493
It's traveling money for his journey.

573
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,539
Apparently, unlike the rest of us,
Buddhists can take it with them.

574
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:03,940
- Why am I giving Brenda napkin rings?
- Because that's all I had in the gift closet.

575
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:13,579
Hey, they're allowed to take pictures
of the dead guy, but I'm not?

576
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:17,260
- That's right. They're family.
- Claire, we're going to be late.

577
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:21,303
- I can't believe I have to go to this thing.
- All right, look, I'm sorry.

578
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:22,859
On the plus side...

579
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:27,017
I bet it'll take you two sips of punch
before you're completely wasted.

580
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,534
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

581
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:34,775
- More punch, anyone?
- Yeah, sure, I'll take another hit.

582
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:38,821
That brat's over an hour late.

583
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:42,817
For the life of me, I don't know
how she got so damn passive-aggressive.

584
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:46,259
Isn't that just being aggressive?

585
00:44:46,424 --> 00:44:49,496
Are you sick, dear?
Or are you always this deathly pale?

586
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,622
I'm not late, am I?

587
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:00,895
You most certainly are.

588
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:04,575
Ice-cold mini asparagus quiche, darling?

589
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,260
What are they doing
with those cups of water?

590
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:13,743
It's a cleansing ritual.

591
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:17,100
You rid yourself of any wrongs you've done
to the deceased.

592
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:25,143
You really think that changes anything?
Pouring a little water into a bowl?

593
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:28,615
I don't know. Maybe.

594
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:31,897
I have to go.

595
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:35,902
Can you make sure
that the monks get home all right?

596
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:42,376
And you'll pour the water out
from Mr. Srisai's bowl?

597
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:46,901
You're supposed to do it over the oldest
tree you can find. I use the one out front.

598
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,533
I don't know why they bring
so many oranges.

599
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:52,741
But if there are any extra,
grab some for the prep room.

600
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:58,059
This punch is delicious.

601
00:45:58,304 --> 00:46:01,137
Your mother made it
with a liqueur from Belize.

602
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:04,821
It's some word with a tilde over the "n."

603
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:10,137
So what's new?

604
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,015
Actually, I spent all night...

605
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:19,217
doing it with this couple
from Orange County.

606
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:21,734
And I have absolutely no idea why.

607
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:26,578
It's one of those sex things, you know.

608
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:29,736
- Lifestyle parties.
- I don't know anything about that.

609
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,382
They had this...

610
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:35,293
little high-tech Japanese vibrator...

611
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:39,417
that stimulates the clitoris
through very low-voltage electrical shocks.

612
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:43,654
Anyway, they invited me, you know,
to go with them...

613
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:46,622
and I thought,
"Now this would be crossing a line."

614
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,264
Which I seem to be doing
more and more these days.

615
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:53,496
Because you know what?
The lines are only in our heads.

616
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,374
In actuality, there are no lines at all...

617
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:59,695
which is really fucking terrifying,
if you think about it.

618
00:47:01,824 --> 00:47:03,416
What's so funny?

619
00:47:04,544 --> 00:47:07,581
Nothing. Everything. This.

620
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,979
I want you to know something, Brenda.

621
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:17,382
I love you.

622
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:23,543
I love you, because you are so independent
and spirited...

623
00:47:24,744 --> 00:47:27,383
and you make no apologies to yourself.

624
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:31,743
And you know you can't smother someone
or you'll lose them.

625
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:36,653
You accept Nate as he is,
and that is beautiful.

626
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,773
I don't know how to do that. Not at all.

627
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:47,822
Maybe that's why I resented you so much.

628
00:47:48,304 --> 00:47:50,260
But now I don't.

629
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,780
Now I admire you.

630
00:48:02,064 --> 00:48:03,417
Thank you.

631
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:06,418
Thanks.

632
00:48:08,544 --> 00:48:10,774
I have to go to the bathroom.

633
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:21,774
Claire, are you feeling all right?

634
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:24,456
Yeah, I'm just tired.

635
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:27,740
Let me feel your forehead.

636
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:33,177
It feels okay.

637
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:37,857
I don't know why you should be tired.
You slept almost 11 hours last night.

638
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:42,977
I'm not really like want-to-go-to-sleep tired.
I'm just sort of like...

639
00:48:43,064 --> 00:48:45,180
sick and tired of everything.

640
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:48,782
- What do you mean?
- Just all the lies we're fed.

641
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:52,493
The bullshit we're supposed to care about,
how everybody is so scared...

642
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:55,621
of anything that's different
from everything else.

643
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:59,335
I don't know.

644
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:03,619
I'm gonna get some coffee.
Do you want some?

645
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:05,581
I have to use the bathroom.

646
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:14,373
You must be Ruth. Bernard Chenowith.

647
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:17,980
- Oh, hello.
- I'm so sorry to startle you.

648
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,862
I was supposed to confine myself
to the master suite...

649
00:49:20,944 --> 00:49:23,856
but Margaret doesn't like me
to use her bathroom.

650
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:27,096
She gets insanely territorial
about that damn bidet.

651
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:33,664
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- I know.

652
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:37,657
I don't know why Nate and Brenda
haven't arranged a dinner or something.

653
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:41,414
I could give you half a dozen reasons
just off the top of my head!

654
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:43,620
But I'd like to ask you something.

655
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:48,734
What steps have you taken
to treat your daughter's depression?

656
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:51,258
I have no idea what you're talking about.

657
00:49:51,744 --> 00:49:53,860
Surely you must be aware of it.

658
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:59,141
Now, if you're adverse to talk therapy,
there are scads of pharmaceutical solutions.

659
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:02,694
Either way, I'd be happy to recommend
the name of somebody she can see.

660
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:05,503
I'm sorry. I have to use the bathroom.

661
00:51:58,504 --> 00:51:59,823
You're breaking up with me?

662
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:04,341
I don't think we have a healthy friendship.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

663
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,574
- Okay.
- I don't know how else to explain it.

664
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:11,143
Don't bother, really.

665
00:52:11,224 --> 00:52:14,057
I'm going through something.
I don't understand what it is...

666
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:16,977
but I need to be around people
who aren't like you.

667
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:20,974
People who have clear values, or something.

668
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:22,736
Okay, got it.

669
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:27,502
If I hadn't met you, I probably wouldn't be
doing all the shit I've been doing.

670
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:29,461
Not that I blame you, exactly.

671
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:32,337
Oh, brother! Just can it, sweetheart.

672
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:37,416
You can't stand to see the truth
about yourself, so I've got to take the fall.

673
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:42,016
Just do me a favor.
When you feel bad about this later...

674
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:45,335
you can skip the big apology
and trying to be friends again.

675
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:47,779
It was fun, but we should both move on.

676
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:59,343
So now you know what was really
going on with me that night in Seattle.

677
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:03,979
So is the Western medicine
controlling the seizures?

678
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:06,342
Not entirely.

679
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:13,061
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about this earlier.

680
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:16,942
I think I was just trying to not face it myself.

681
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:22,502
Lisa, I've changed.

682
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:28,655
I used to be this person who ran away from
responsibility, but I'm not him anymore.

683
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:39,653
I want to be a part of our child's life.

684
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:44,101
I really want to. I need to.

685
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:50,261
Is this about
you being a father for someone...

686
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,904
or is this about you being scared of death?

687
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:55,776
Does it really matter?

688
00:53:58,144 --> 00:53:59,577
Maybe it doesn't.

689
00:54:02,624 --> 00:54:06,458
This is going to take some adjusting.

690
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:13,813
Okay, maybe we can work out something.

691
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:19,256
- This is what you want, right?
- Absolutely what I want.

692
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:25,500
It's not like Brenda told you
this was the right thing to do, or something.

693
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:26,573
No.

694
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:29,854
She doesn't even know about it.

695
00:54:35,384 --> 00:54:36,373
What?

696
00:54:39,224 --> 00:54:41,419
Nate, you are so...

697
00:54:43,424 --> 00:54:44,823
This is no good.

698
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:48,533
- I just want to get away from you.
- I don't understand. What's going on?

699
00:54:48,624 --> 00:54:52,537
I was so stupid to think
that anything could ever change you.

700
00:54:53,304 --> 00:54:57,377
You don't want a child, so you agree
not to be a part of that child's life.

701
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:01,736
Then you decide you do want a child, and
you say you'll be part of the child's life...

702
00:55:01,824 --> 00:55:05,453
with a total disregard for the person
you're supposedly sharing a life with.

703
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:07,262
- All I said...
- Jesus, Nate...

704
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:10,620
if you can't put anyone but yourself first,
how can you be a father?

705
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:11,773
You can't.

706
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:15,379
So do us both a favor
and stay out of our lives. Please.

707
