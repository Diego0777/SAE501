1
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,146
<i>That one's gonna be for the highlight reel</i>
<i>this weekend.</i>

2
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,708
<i>As we take another look...</i>

3
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,543
If you don't get your fat ass in gear
you're gonna be late for work.

4
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,023
I just sat down.

5
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,942
Come on.
You only got this job two weeks a year.

6
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,703
All right.

7
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,588
You know, this goddamn suit
itches like hell.

8
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,660
You could lose a little padding here.

9
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,661
Careful. Only good little girls get presents.

10
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,224
No flirting with the faggoty elves.

11
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,899
Can I help it if the elves think I'm a stud?

12
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,503
You are a stud. But you're my stud.

13
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,060
- Careful.
- Yeah, like hell.

14
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:49,227
You're a loser.

15
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,468
Is that Santa?

16
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,423
It is. It's Santa.

17
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,103
Hi, Santa!

18
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,623
You told me Donald Green was Jewish.

19
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,627
I don't know.
His shop was closed on Yom Kippur.

20
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,428
He sent us a Christmas card
with a baby Jesus on it.

21
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,022
So he's not Jewish.

22
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:34,858
- We sent him one with a dreidel on it.
- Now he thinks we're Jewish.

23
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,302
Is Brenda Jewish?

24
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,061
Yeah, sort of.

25
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,304
Her dad's Jewish,
and her mom was raised Catholic, I think.

26
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,222
But now they're atheists. I think.

27
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:49,102
How would your children be raised?

28
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,463
We haven't gotten that far yet, Mom.

29
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,023
Is she coming to Christmas dinner?
I'm making my list.

30
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,178
That's the plan.

31
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,659
Christmas Eve at her mother's place,
and then Christmas dinner here.

32
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,138
- So I'll write you down for two.
- Great.

33
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,866
- David?
- You can put me down for one.

34
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,941
But what about Keith?
Aren't the two of you...

35
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:14,581
Yes, we're having healthy,
affection-based sex on a regular basis.

36
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,261
Twice a day sometimes.

37
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,661
Why won't you bring him here
for Christmas? Are you ashamed of us?

38
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:21,738
Of course not.

39
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,821
Taylor's living with him now.
They're having their own Christmas.

40
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:27,742
Invite them both. I'm cooking a goose.
Don't they like goose?

41
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:30,548
You really want them,
or are you being politically correct?

42
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,824
Of course I want them to be here.

43
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,821
If he's someone you care about,
then he should be here.

44
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,662
I am sick and tired
of this chip on your shoulder, David!

45
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:42,264
How am I supposed to accept you
if you resent every single attempt I make?

46
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,748
All right, fine.

47
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,106
We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night.
I'll ask him then.

48
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,142
If you both have plans for Christmas Eve...

49
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,948
who's going to midnight service with me?

50
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,940
I'd like for you
to go to church with me tomorrow night.

51
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:07,138
And I need to know if you're bringing
anyone to Christmas dinner.

52
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,225
- I was thinking about maybe asking Toby.
- Toby? I don't know any Toby.

53
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:16,458
I met him at Aunt Sarah's,
and we've been out a couple of times.

54
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,945
Doesn't Toby have a family of his own
to spend Christmas with?

55
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,145
His parents are pagans.

56
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,348
It's not his fault.

57
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,179
When are you going to invite him?
I need to know how many yams to buy.

58
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,784
Look, if he's coming,
I'll tell him to bring his own yam.

59
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,178
And when are we going
to decorate the tree?

60
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,338
You need to calm down.

61
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,989
Christmas is the day after tomorrow.
What about tonight?

62
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,866
I can't. I made plans.

63
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,382
Me, too.

64
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:46,139
I'm already doing the church thing.

65
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:50,698
I wish I knew what I did
to deserve such morose, surly children.

66
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:59,939
I'll be so glad
when these fucking holidays are over.

67
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,705
Baby, you're making it worse.

68
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,987
How come you can make
a squashed face look like new...

69
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,821
but you can't even fix a stupid wall?

70
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,377
It's the Sheetrock. It's all crumbled.

71
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,859
- I know. I'm still picking it out of the couch.
- Okay, Vanessa.

72
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,669
Why don't you tell me
what else I've done wrong lately?

73
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:20,947
I don't understand why you fired Ramon.
He was doing good work. He was cheap.

74
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:23,297
I had my reasons.

75
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,779
You're jealous 'cause he knows how
to fix things and makes you look bad.

76
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,178
I don't want him around here anymore.

77
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,385
Look at you, Rico, you're jealous.

78
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,701
All right, you wanna know
why I fired him? Yeah?

79
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,620
When I came home that afternoon,
he was screwing someone.

80
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:41,621
A man. Right here against this wall.

81
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,428
- Rico, that's disgusting. Stop lying.
- I'm not lying.

82
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,420
He was screwing a frigging man!

83
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,865
Right here, right in my fucking house,
he was screwing a man!

84
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,503
Oh, my God.

85
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,383
And that's why I fired him. Okay?

86
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,062
Oh, my God!

87
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:05,662
Okay, if you were a gay mortician,
what would you want for Christmas?

88
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,982
A new life?

89
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,308
- I hate Christmas.
- I hear you.

90
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,826
It's such pressure
to live up to these images.

91
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,824
The whole family
sitting around the dinner table...

92
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,503
as Mom, dressed in
her special Christmas apron...

93
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,705
serves a meal
that she spent three days making.

94
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,586
I mean, who has that?

95
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,418
I do.

96
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,668
You're kidding.

97
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:34,468
Just add the smell of death
and people crying downstairs...

98
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:36,460
you've got my life exactly.

99
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,667
- It doesn't sound half bad, actually.
- It's awful.

100
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,339
No, awful is when you celebrate
the winter solstice...

101
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,420
by watching your father play the recorder...

102
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,386
while your mother
dances around a bonfire...

103
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,903
chanting hymns to Gaea, the earth goddess.

104
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,861
Sure, it's funny to you.

105
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:02,021
So do you want to have Christmas dinner
with my creepy family?

106
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,266
Are you kidding? I would love it.
Do you really want me to?

107
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,260
It was my mother's idea.

108
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,257
Ever since my last boyfriend
tried to kill himself...

109
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,305
robbed a store, and shot at a guy...

110
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,746
before disappearing off the face of the earth,
she wants to meet everyone I date.

111
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,219
- A biker funeral?
- I know what you're thinking...

112
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,537
but they seem pretty cool.

113
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,666
Are you kidding? I love biker funerals.
These guys have big money.

114
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,944
They all have Harley dealerships
or repair shops...

115
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,543
And methamphetamine labs
in their basements.

116
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,024
Whatever. Money is money.

117
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,420
Mrs. Johnson, I'm David Fisher.
I've very sorry about your loss.

118
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:41,737
Thank you.

119
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:45,742
This is Pete, a close friend of the deceased.
This is my brother, David.

120
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,225
And this is Marilyn's brother, Bitsy.

121
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,901
As in Itsy.

122
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,624
So, is there a casket that appeals to you?

123
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,188
It's gotta be steel.

124
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,621
The Camry here is 20 gauge stainless steel.

125
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,308
That sounds foreign.

126
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,302
No, I assure you, it's built right here
in the United States of America.

127
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:09,739
All right. As long as it's the best.

128
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,147
Jesse never liked
to have a fuss made over him.

129
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,737
He always said that when his time comes...

130
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,337
just set him out by the curb on trash day.

131
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:20,943
But...

132
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,306
I want to do right by him.
He was a good man.

133
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,220
He was the fucking best!

134
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:33,017
Now, we want the casket airbrushed
the same as his gas tank.

135
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,948
It's midnight-purple with orange flames.

136
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,668
- I'm not sure...
- I'll give you the number of the guy...

137
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:42,388
that's restoring Jesse's hog.
He can do it all at once.

138
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,982
That is a hell of a bike.

139
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:47,903
And on the inside of the casket lid,
we want a picture of Marilyn here.

140
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:51,700
You know, so she's looking down on him
for all eternity.

141
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,183
That was Jesse's favorite picture of me.

142
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:59,667
It was <i>Hustler's</i> Beaver Hunt, April of '86.

143
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:03,908
It's a very nice picture of you.

144
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:06,867
Isn't it? I usually hate pictures of myself.

145
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,384
We're gonna need a couple of kegs of Bud...

146
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,619
and a case of Jack for the service.

147
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,866
I want this done right.

148
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,187
It's gonna be
one big-ass Christmas Day funeral.

149
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,589
Sorry. Christmas is the one day
we don't hold services.

150
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,739
We'd pay whatever it takes.

151
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,344
A big-ass Christmas Day funeral it is.

152
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,989
So we're gonna be working
on Christmas Day.

153
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,824
We've had worse Christmases.

154
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,542
Yeah, we have.

155
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,268
Do you remember
the last time you saw him?

156
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:50,858
No.

157
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,499
<i>I can't believe it's Thanksgiving already.</i>

158
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,427
What happened to this year?

159
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,820
I know. You can't even go anywhere
that isn't all decked out...

160
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,343
with candy canes and Santa heads and shit.

161
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,067
It's all so phony.

162
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,103
I think in Hell it's always Christmas.

163
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:13,503
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,303
Hey, buddy-boy.

165
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,221
What are you doing out here?

166
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,618
I had to take a break.
It was just too much food.

167
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,177
I know. Your mother's been baking all week.

168
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,740
She outdid herself this year.

169
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,380
So, how's Seattle treating you?

170
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,302
It's all right, I guess. I got no complaints.

171
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:40,743
Me, neither.

172
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,942
Not many people can say that,
you know, and mean it.

173
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,189
I guess we've got a lot to be thankful for.

174
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,908
Either that, or we've
lowered our expectations so much...

175
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,549
we've given up on anything better than this.

176
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,102
Oh, boy.

177
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,578
Listen, I gotta pick up a body...

178
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,384
so I'm not gonna be able
to drive you to the airport.

179
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:17,461
- That's okay. I can take him.
- Thank you, kitten.

180
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,060
You coming down for Christmas?

181
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:26,148
Yeah, I think so.
I gotta see how my schedule works out.

182
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,787
It's good to see you, son.

183
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,257
You, too, Dad.

184
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,541
Take care of yourself.

185
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,340
Anything I can help you with?

186
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,745
Yes, I'm looking for clothes so expensive...

187
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,627
only an idiot would buy them.
Oh, there they are.

188
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:12,185
- Excuse me.
- Be my guest.

189
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:06,983
Excuse me.

190
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,302
Your wife would like you to see
how she looks in her Jil Sanders sweater.

191
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,021
And I think you should leave,
or I'll have to call security.

192
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:23,302
Do you validate?

193
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,863
You smell good.

194
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,142
It's the flowers.

195
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,621
You are so beautiful.

196
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,348
I am not.

197
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:38,901
Did you not wear panties today like I asked?

198
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,506
I most certainly did not
not wear panties today.

199
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,466
- Why not?
- It's unhygienic.

200
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,224
What kind of panties did you wear?

201
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,227
Something sexy?

202
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,427
No, they're not sexy.

203
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,979
They are Fruit of the Loom
control top briefs...

204
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,788
and they come three to a pack
for $15 at Target.

205
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:08,667
I want you to go into the bathroom
and take them off...

206
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,821
- and then hide them someplace in my office.
- I will not.

207
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,507
And I wish you'd
stop talking to me that way.

208
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,784
You don't like when I talk dirty?

209
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:19,581
I didn't say that.

210
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:21,819
I don't like it here at work.

211
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:34,378
When I was shopping today,
this total stranger felt me up.

212
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,621
- That's irritating.
- No, it was really hot.

213
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,621
He was giving me the eye...

214
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,018
so I went over
and stood right next to him, like:

215
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,145
"What are you gonna do about it, pal?"

216
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:49,108
And he puts his hand on my ass
very tentatively.

217
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,580
I know, it was so polite.

218
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,827
So I took his hand
and I just put it inside me.

219
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,669
I mean, if you're gonna do it, do it.

220
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,058
Wow!

221
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,060
Does this mean you have...

222
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,701
maybe some mixed feelings
about marrying Nate?

223
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,058
No.

224
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,463
Seriously, that's not it at all.

225
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,178
I think it's just natural biological drive
at work.

226
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,377
The need to sample as diverse
a selection of people as possible...

227
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,858
before settling down with one mate.

228
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,828
It's normal.

229
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:38,018
Anyway, I got another chapter out of it.

230
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:10,660
Do you know
where the jaundice solution is?

231
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,341
Mrs. Doyle's looking very yellow.

232
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,580
It's back-ordered.
Use the ColorGuard. 10 ounces a gallon.

233
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,262
Take a little break.

234
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,138
Here, have some eggnog.

235
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,303
This isn't eggnog. It's whiskey.

236
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:27,540
Whiskey? It's rum, my boy.
The drink of holidays.

237
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,028
You know, when you were little,
you always wanted to...

238
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:35,579
leave milk and cookies out on the tray
for Santa Claus. Remember?

239
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:36,658
Yeah.

240
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,868
And you used to laugh and say,
"What Santa really needs is a shot."

241
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,497
And I was right.

242
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,945
I always thought you meant a shot,
like a shot of penicillin.

243
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:56,108
- I should...
- David, it's Christmas. Come on.

244
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,699
Spend a little time among the living.

245
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,259
Sit down with your pop
and tell me what you want for Christmas.

246
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,385
Mrs. Doyle's viewing's at 4:00.

247
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:33,699
Mom said she might have
a special guest for dinner.

248
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:35,703
All right.

249
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,624
If he's anything like
her past special guests...

250
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:43,463
he's a 24-year-old Venezuelan pool boy
who makes up for his lack in English...

251
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,858
by being fluent
in the language of power-fucking.

252
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:48,747
I'll try not to get into a conversation
with him.

253
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,464
Hey, Bren, hold on just a sec.

254
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,148
Do you remember what happened
a year ago today?

255
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,147
Oh, God, I'm sorry, your father...

256
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,504
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

257
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,662
It's our anniversary.

258
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,262
Oh, my God!

259
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:12,103
Of course.

260
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:15,342
It's hard to believe it's only a year ago
that we met.

261
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,420
Yeah, it feels like 20 years.

262
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,421
If you don't want to be with me,
then don't, all right?

263
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,625
Nate, I'm kidding. Come on.

264
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,185
Of course I want to be with you. I love you.

265
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,419
Then why do you treat me like shit
all the time?

266
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,659
Because I had a really fucked-up life...

267
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,822
and I use sarcasm to hide
how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.

268
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,820
Come on. Jesus, you know that.

269
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,547
Happy anniversary.

270
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,867
I know I already got you another ring, but...

271
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,228
I can't believe you...

272
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,427
It was my grandmother's.
It didn't cost me anything.

273
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,621
Merry Christmas.

274
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:10,942
It's okay.

275
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:13,984
I love you.

276
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,146
Well, it's about time.

277
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,939
- Hey, Mom, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

278
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:28,381
Nate, Merry Christmas.

279
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:33,657
I know there's some mistletoe
around here some place, God damn it!

280
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,422
What's wrong, honey? You look like shit.

281
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,307
- Enjoying a Scotch, Mom?
- Not nearly enough.

282
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:42,097
Sweetheart, would you freshen up my drink?

283
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,624
Come on, give your sister a big kiss.

284
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:03,103
I told you we were having a special guest.

285
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,218
Yes.

286
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,988
- I just didn't expect...
- To see your crazy brother. Sure.

287
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:10,818
Don't worry...

288
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:15,266
they pumped enough electricity through me
to light up the Eastern Seaboard.

289
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:17,419
Kidding. I'm sorry, Bren.

290
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,058
Come on, lighten up. It's Christmas.

291
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:28,108
- Come on, go get me another drink.
- Okay.

292
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,502
Mom, what the hell is he doing here?

293
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,580
I busted him out for Christmas.

294
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:37,061
- You could've warned me.
- Warned you?

295
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,022
You need to be warned
about seeing your own brother?

296
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,623
Ever since he came at me
with a knife? Yeah.

297
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:47,259
Okay, so how long is he out for?

298
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,101
For good. He's living with me now.

299
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,779
So I guess you're happy to be home.

300
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,423
Happy is a concept I try not to buy into.

301
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:10,580
It just gets me into trouble.

302
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,342
Listen, Nate...

303
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,027
I'm really sorry
about everything that happened.

304
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,817
I know I have to take responsibility
for what I did...

305
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,298
but I was sick.

306
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,265
And now you're not?

307
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,022
I'm still sick.

308
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,028
I'll always be sick.

309
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:47,580
Just the cards I was dealt.

310
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,180
I can manage it through medication,
for the most part...

311
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:56,178
but it's something I'll have to live with
for the rest of my life.

312
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,868
It's not up to me.

313
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:03,738
Merry Christmas!

314
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,627
We can't stay long
because my mother's watching the kids.

315
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,348
Ramon, you shaved. You look so young.

316
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:12,700
- We brought some presents for the boys.
- Thank you. You're so sweet.

317
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,586
Just little things. Where are they?

318
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,422
Augusto's asleep. Julio's in the den
watching <i>The Grinch...</i>

319
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,420
for about the thousandth time.

320
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,379
I'll just put these under the tree.

321
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:27,347
Oh, please!
You haven't gotten that wall fixed yet?

322
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,148
Ramon would have had it finished by now.

323
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,544
What possessed you to make fig pudding?

324
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:35,701
It sounded Christmassy.

325
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,986
Well, it looks like throw up.

326
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,267
None of it was very good.

327
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,420
Be nice.

328
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:44,067
Make better stuff.

329
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:48,467
How about
if we sing some Christmas carols?

330
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,499
Come on, I got a CD.
We can all sing along to it.

331
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,545
You've gotta be kidding me.

332
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,620
Come on, we'll scare the neighbors.

333
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,745
Okay, you two sing songs.

334
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm gonna go get a Ding Dong
and watch <i>The Simpsons.</i>

335
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:05,341
- Motherfuck!
- Keith, relax.

336
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:08,863
I just wanted her to have a good Christmas,
you know?

337
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:11,668
After everything that she's been through.

338
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:16,739
You've been through a lot yourself lately.
You can afford to cut yourself some slack.

339
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,383
It doesn't mean you're a doormat.

340
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,262
- Are you sleeping any better?
- Not really.

341
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,624
I was reading an article
on post-traumatic stress...

342
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,018
I'm not suffering from anything, David.

343
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:43,067
What happened, happened.
It's a part of my job.

344
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:44,821
Let's just move on.

345
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:00,259
Why don't you and Taylor come to my house
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?

346
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,227
- Why?
- Because I'd like for you to be there.

347
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:06,377
Then why'd you wait until the night before
to ask me?

348
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,302
Because my mom didn't bring it up
until yesterday.

349
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:10,708
Your mother.

350
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:14,822
Jesus, Keith, all I did was invite you over
for Christmas dinner.

351
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:20,148
I don't think Taylor's quite ready
for something like this yet.

352
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,661
Are you sure Taylor's the one
who's not ready?

353
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:32,620
Just help me pick out a few poinsettias,
and we can be on our way to church.

354
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,063
Dear God!

355
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,222
What happened?

356
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,341
Oh, my goodness!

357
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:47,704
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Were you robbed?

358
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:51,221
- Did they hurt you?
- I am hurt, yes.

359
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,788
Where are you hurt?

360
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,861
There was fight. They break my legs.

361
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:00,386
We have to get you to the hospital.
Claire, back the car up to the door.

362
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,658
Mom?

363
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:18,185
You should take that down.

364
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,305
No. I love it.

365
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:23,821
- You look so mysterious.
- It's kind of ghoulish.

366
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,509
I don't like to think of myself
in that way anymore.

367
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:30,978
Then you'll just have to take
a new picture for me...

368
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,787
of how you feel now.

369
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,142
I know!

370
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,626
You should take Brenda
and Nate's wedding photos.

371
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,382
We're engaged.

372
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,101
Congratulations.

373
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,701
That is so great.

374
00:27:58,349 --> 00:27:59,418
Thank you.

375
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,979
I love it when people
who really should get married do.

376
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:09,062
It doesn't happen that often, you know.

377
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:11,266
Now, you just hush.

378
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,462
It's true.

379
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,579
I can't believe she got Billy
out of the hospital...

380
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:24,137
so she would not have
to spend Christmas alone.

381
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,947
Fucking evil bitch.

382
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:29,987
He's not ready.

383
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,028
Really? I thought
he actually seemed pretty okay.

384
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:37,068
He's not okay. He's sick,
and nobody wants to deal with it.

385
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,539
Which is the way it's always fucking been!
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

386
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:44,588
I've been a fucking nursemaid
more than enough for one lifetime.

387
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,507
Merry Christmas.

388
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,784
You're bashful.
Don't worry. I don't see nothing.

389
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,067
Good morning, dear.

390
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,743
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

391
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,744
You haven't taken your painkillers.

392
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:18,424
- I hate pills. They make me crazy.
- Shut up and take them.

393
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,261
Shouldn't he be in the hospital?

394
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,898
We were there half the night
waiting for a doctor after you left.

395
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:27,901
- This is so hot!
- Merry Christmas, everybody.

396
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,299
He's gonna be here eight weeks?
You've gotta be kidding me.

397
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,778
That's how long he has to stay off his legs.

398
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:38,780
Mom, surely there's a better arrangement.

399
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:42,145
He has two broken legs.
What was I supposed to do with him?

400
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:44,504
He doesn't even have insurance.

401
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:49,022
- Then who's paying for all...
- I am.

402
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:59,465
David, later this afternoon,
I want you to lift Nikolai into his wheelchair.

403
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:10,142
<i>There was that time we was coming down</i>
<i>the big hill at Lone Pine.</i>

404
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,017
I hit a patch of ice and went down.

405
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,941
Jesse comes barreling around that hairpin.

406
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,621
He seen me there in the middle of the road.

407
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:23,378
And instead of running me over...

408
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:26,947
he laid his bike down
and slid it into a bunch of trees.

409
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,020
He busted out his teeth.

410
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,826
'Cause that's just the kind of man
that he was.

411
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,588
A-fucking-men.

412
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,382
He was a fine friend and a good husband.

413
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,868
"From Jay Leno."

414
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:46,861
Sure, he always sends flowers.
Never comes.

415
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,227
This world's a lot worse off without him.

416
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:55,099
The In-N-Out truck's out back.

417
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:59,507
We're gonna put on Jesse's favorite song...

418
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,149
and folks can help themselves
to some grub.

419
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:13,463
My brother lives up there,
which I've always been jealous of.

420
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,266
Once, when I was in junior high...

421
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:19,147
my dad was embalming someone
in the basement.

422
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:23,427
And the plumbing got backed up
and blood started squirting out of this hose.

423
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,021
- It was like a scene from <i>The Shining.</i>
- Nasty.

424
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,701
It was the first time I really thought about
what they did down there.

425
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:38,503
- Hello.
- Mom, this is Toby.

426
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:41,103
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
- You, too, Toby.

427
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:44,261
- Thank you for joining us today.
- Thank you for having me.

428
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:48,945
Claire, surely that's not what you're
planning to wear for Christmas dinner?

429
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:53,625
No, I've got my Laura Bush pantsuit
on underneath. I didn't want to get it dirty.

430
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,261
Please, come in.

431
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,623
So, what did you get me for Christmas?

432
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:16,458
- Who the fuck lives in Reseda?
- So, what did you get me for Christmas?

433
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,859
Why are you even asking me?
You've barely ever spoken to me.

434
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,783
Who else is gonna be there?

435
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:24,303
I always wanted a silk smoking jacket.

436
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,664
- Dad, I'm on the phone.
- Something really garish...

437
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,944
with big embroidered peacocks.

438
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:32,388
Look, I've gotta go.
Just e-mail me directions.

439
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:35,063
Maybe I'll show up and maybe I won't.

440
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:40,302
God, can't a person
have a phone conversation around here?

441
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:42,823
Somebody special, huh? What's his name?

442
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:47,342
- Gabriel. Trust me, he's not that special.
- Don't waste your time with him, kitten.

443
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,705
- Because you deserve somebody special.
- Right.

444
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,987
You wanna go with me later to the airport
and pick up your big brother?

445
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:57,424
I can't. I've got last-minute shopping to do...

446
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,864
Could you try to be home for dinner?

447
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:04,022
Because we hardly ever have
the whole family together, and it's...

448
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,627
Merry Christmas.

449
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,542
- What's going on in here?
- Biker funeral.

450
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,543
- Can't we stay down here?
- Very funny.

451
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,377
Hey, Pete.

452
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,425
We're about to head upstairs
and have our Christmas dinner.

453
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:27,498
So?

454
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:31,423
- You've been here all day...
- Probably gonna be here all night.

455
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,983
You go on and eat. We don't need you.

456
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:44,347
It'll be fun.
Nikolai's out of his mind on Percodan.

457
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,978
Well, I think that's everything.

458
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:59,303
- Dinner looks amazing, Mrs. Fisher.
- Thank you, Toby.

459
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:04,303
Probably one of the bikers
looking for the bathroom.

460
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,504
Look who's here.

461
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,863
- Hello.
- Hey, Keith.

462
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:09,509
- You made it!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

463
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,461
I hope it's okay that we came by.

464
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,985
Of course it's okay.
We're so happy you could join us.

465
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,337
Does everyone know Taylor?

466
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,943
Your mom hasn't looked at me
since she saw the ring.

467
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:20,747
Have some more wine.

468
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,940
Hey, Keith. Hey, Taylor.

469
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:26,146
- That's a skinny turkey.
- It's a goose.

470
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,422
This is lovely. We're all here together.

471
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:38,137
Keith, would you say grace for us?

472
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:41,503
Yeah, sure.

473
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:49,105
Lord, for food in a world
where many walk in hunger...

474
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,306
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear...

475
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,620
and for friends in a world
where many walk alone...

476
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:59,020
we give you thanks, O Lord,
on this Christmas Day.

477
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:00,904
Amen.

478
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:07,103
- That was lovely, Keith.
- Thank you.

479
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:11,188
Here you go, Nikolai.

480
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:20,984
Your mom will always hate me.

481
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:25,577
That's because you're a woman trying
to steal her baby.

482
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,023
Whatever.

483
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:34,387
Toby seems nice.

484
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:37,666
Yes, Toby's very nice.

485
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,302
Not your type, huh?

486
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:45,181
A deranged psychopath?
No, I guess he isn't.

487
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,739
Billy told me once that...

488
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,465
he got so used to living with crazy people...

489
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:57,337
that when he was sharing a room
with a guy who thought he was Pinocchio...

490
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:02,105
the only thing that seemed weird about it
was that the guy pronounced it "Pino-chio."

491
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,618
So you've been talking to Billy?

492
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,979
Yeah, mostly through e-mail.

493
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:12,467
- He's really funny.
- Isn't he?

494
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:42,781
I've got a huge headache.
Can we go home now?

495
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:44,821
Bren, I'm working.

496
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:48,023
I'm leaving.
Come home when you can, okay?

497
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,383
I promise.

498
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:57,103
Where do you keep your toilet plunger?

499
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,268
Morning, Mr. F.

500
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,704
Rico, what are you doing here?
It's Christmas Eve.

501
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:42,984
Yeah, I have to do Mrs. Doyle.

502
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:46,061
- Her viewing is this afternoon.
- Let David take care of it.

503
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:49,744
- No, she's pretty simple.
- That's why I want David to do her.

504
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,583
I like to feed him the slow pitches,
if you know what I mean.

505
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:55,738
Sure.

506
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,663
I'm serious, kiddo.
Get the hell out of here. Go home.

507
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:01,058
Spend the day with the little one.

508
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:04,937
They grow up so fast,
you gotta enjoy it while it lasts. Go on.

509
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,348
Thanks, Mr. F.

510
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:13,267
- You have a merry Christmas.
- I intend to.

511
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:32,027
- She took my kids back to her mothers'.
- What?

512
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,907
You couldn't keep your fucking mouth shut.

513
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:39,227
Stop it!

514
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,028
- Merry fucking Christmas, Rico.
- Are you okay?

515
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:44,942
- Baby?
- You fucking told her?

516
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:48,780
I had to. I couldn't even look her in the eye.

517
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,066
She was so happy yesterday.
She told me she got him a Rolex watch.

518
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:55,061
- She has a right to know.
- I told you not to fucking tell her!

519
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:56,901
I'm sorry. I had to!

520
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:00,021
Fucking homo!

521
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,027
Fucking fuck!

522
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:23,707
They must not like that dead man too much.

523
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,826
Why do you say that?

524
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:30,502
Because they're all so happy he's dead.

525
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:37,221
I think it's about time we get you home.

526
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:40,938
No, but it's Christmas,
and I want to watch the funeral.

527
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,577
Too bad.

528
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,385
I'm really glad you came.

529
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:50,102
Why don't you come back with us?
I could make some hot chocolate.

530
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:54,826
I got a present or two that I didn't want you
to open in mixed company.

531
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,259
Let me talk to Nate.
I'll see if we can wrap this up.

532
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:13,742
- I think we should start moving them out.
- No, it's Christmas.

533
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:18,307
- Keith asked if I wanted to go with him.
- Go.

534
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,787
- I've got everything under control.
- Okay.

535
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,823
Thanks.

536
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:29,618
- Merry Christmas, Nate.
- You, too.

537
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:52,386
- What do you say we get out of here?
- You're not having fun?

538
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:56,508
No. This is like every party my parents have,
only with better music.

539
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,019
Where do you want to go?

540
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:05,859
We could drive around Hancock Park
and look at the Christmas lights.

541
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:08,702
Yeah, right. Not without a carton of eggs.

542
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,300
Why are you so hostile?

543
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,425
- I'm not hostile.
- Yes, you are.

544
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:21,741
You act like you're incredibly put out by,
I don't know, being alive.

545
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:25,262
Maybe you think that's cool, but really...

546
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,380
it's just irritating.

547
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:34,024
Okay, thanks for the input,
which is totally irrelevant, but...

548
00:41:34,629 --> 00:41:37,382
Apparently you need to feel all superior
or something.

549
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:40,541
I mean, if you just take a look at your life...

550
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:43,669
you really don't have that much
to be angry about.

551
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:47,981
- You don't know anything about my life.
- Yeah, and I'm not really sure I want to...

552
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:51,379
considering how you like
to shit all over everything.

553
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:54,304
You know what?

554
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:58,985
I fully support your little desire
to have a life you'd see on Nickelodeon...

555
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:02,421
but I don't support
you being a judgmental dick.

556
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,940
Maybe I should just go.

557
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:10,698
Maybe.

558
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,905
Okay. Merry Christmas.

559
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:15,737
Whatever.

560
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:26,259
I'm glad I could spend one last Christmas
with Jesse.

561
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,785
He was a crazy son of a bitch,
but I sure loved him.

562
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:34,022
I can tell.

563
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:39,308
God, did he know how to live!
It was full throttle all the way.

564
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,865
We met in Sturgis, back in '<i>7</i>8.

565
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,147
I was sitting at The Broken Spoke
with the biggest badass in town.

566
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:51,908
But Jesse...

567
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,385
he had some balls on him.

568
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:59,785
He walked right up to me, I'll never forget it,
and he said:

569
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,419
"If I don't ask you to take a ride with me
I'll regret it the rest of my life."

570
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:08,744
And that ride lasted 23 years.

571
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:15,899
He always said his two favorite things
were riding his hog and riding me.

572
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,904
And he treated us both like queens.

573
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:24,503
You're probably wishing
he treated himself as carefully.

574
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:27,945
Honey, it just wasn't in his blood.

575
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:33,619
If he were a careful man,
he might have lived longer...

576
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,867
but would he have enjoyed his life as much?

577
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,588
Would I have enjoyed his life as much?

578
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:50,264
I had a bike in high school.

579
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,182
Had it for about a week before I wiped out.

580
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:56,305
Just fucked it up royally.

581
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,499
I still have a pin in my foot.

582
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:05,580
- I never got back on a bike after that.
- I could never give it up. No way.

583
00:44:06,669 --> 00:44:09,945
Closest thing to flying
without leaving the ground.

584
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:17,188
Sometimes I fool myself into thinking
I've lived my life to the fullest.

585
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:20,500
But compared to you and Jesse
I think I've got a lot to learn.

586
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:24,946
Honey, if I were a few years younger
I'd be willing to teach you.

587
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,939
I just might let you.

588
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:36,506
Jesse always said you gotta live every day
like you might die tomorrow.

589
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:39,541
- 'Cause you know what?
- You just might.

590
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,065
Here's a glass of water.

591
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:40,823
I couldn't find a bell.

592
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,628
So if you need me during the night,
just yell very loudly.

593
00:45:43,709 --> 00:45:45,222
I will be fine.

594
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,781
Did you call the police yet to file a report?

595
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:51,260
No, I will do that later.

596
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:57,185
I'll put this where you can reach it.

597
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:00,466
- I don't like for you to do this.
- Don't be silly.

598
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:05,508
You have two broken legs,
and you need someone to take care of you.

599
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:08,581
And I'm happy to do it,
so stop making a fuss.

600
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,018
What?

601
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:15,263
Nothing.

602
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,020
What I told you before.

603
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:21,266
That you are beautiful.

604
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:24,457
Stop it.

605
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:06,378
- I had the swirl in the dip just right.
- Just one for the road.

606
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:09,506
- Airport traffic's gonna be murder.
- Then you should get going.

607
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:10,942
All right.

608
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:46,100
I want to stay up and play
with what Santa Claus brought me.

609
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:47,622
Give it up, Taylor.

610
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:50,428
I could make you guys a cupcake
with my Easy-Bake oven.

611
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:52,943
He's a cop. He doesn't take bribes.

612
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:58,788
- Merry Christmas, baby.
- Mama!

613
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:05,064
I drove all day long just so I could be here.
That's how much your mama loves you.

614
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:08,222
I love you, too, Mama. I knew you'd come.

615
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:14,102
Billy didn't call or e-mail me all day.

616
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:16,143
So?

617
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:19,944
So, you know, it's Christmas.

618
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:23,662
You didn't exactly give him
a warm greeting last night.

619
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,946
That's what I'm saying.
If he'd written me, told me he'd be there...

620
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,021
I wouldn't have been so freaked out
by the whole thing.

621
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:32,669
Do you ever call or e-mail him?

622
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:36,546
Yeah, I e-mailed him in the hospital
last summer...

623
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:38,665
but he never wrote back.

624
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:44,504
He e-mails Claire all the time.

625
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:46,098
What?

626
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:50,548
Yeah, even while we were there,
she was running off to check her mail.

627
00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:56,939
Wait, when did this start?

628
00:48:57,029 --> 00:49:00,624
- Did you bring any of that reindeer cake?
- I asked you a question.

629
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:02,700
I don't know. She just told me tonight.

630
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:06,543
I don't want Billy having anything
to do with Claire, you understand that?

631
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:09,462
Why not? You said that he was okay.

632
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:13,102
He's okay enough
to walk down the street without a leash...

633
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:15,703
but he's not okay enough
to be near my sister...

634
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:19,145
who we both know
has this fucked-up attraction to sociopaths.

635
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:22,107
- Don't tell me...
- I am telling you. He is your brother!

636
00:49:22,189 --> 00:49:25,147
You keep him away.
And if you don't, I swear to God, I will!

637
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:26,787
What are you gonna do, Nate?

638
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,987
- Challenge him to a duel?
- Brenda, would you knock it the fuck off?

639
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,220
- Why don't you wear a cowboy cap...
- Would you fucking listen to me?

640
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:36,345
Will you shut the fuck up?

641
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,458
Fuck.

642
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:49,305
- It's okay.
- It's not my fault.

643
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:51,460
It's okay. It's all right.

644
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,787
- Shit.
- Yeah?

645
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:27,419
I think I'm gonna have... Shit.

646
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,627
Nate, look at me!

647
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:41,028
Get off! Get the fuck off! I'm fine!

648
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:51,901
Nate, it's okay.

649
00:50:57,909 --> 00:50:59,388
What was that?

650
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:09,539
So what are you taking for it?

651
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:11,628
Dilantin.

652
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:16,417
It's an anti-epileptic.
It's supposed to control the seizures.

653
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:20,499
- I thought it did, until tonight.
- We'll talk to your doctor.

654
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:23,581
Maybe we can switch you
to something stronger.

655
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:27,941
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

656
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:35,783
Why didn't you tell me about this?

657
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:41,304
I didn't want to be a burden.

658
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:46,105
You'll never be a burden.

659
00:51:56,189 --> 00:51:58,498
- Good morning.
- Hi.

660
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,744
Marilyn Johnson left that for you.

661
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,781
She had a belt buckle with a big skull on it.

662
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:12,506
I thought that was odd.
