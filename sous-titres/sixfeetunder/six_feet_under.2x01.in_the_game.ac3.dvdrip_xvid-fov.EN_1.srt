1
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,663
Tad? Is that you?

2
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,142
You're early.

3
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:53,081
<i>Time to kiss</i>
<i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

4
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,969
Seriously, several people told me
that my scene...

5
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:19,534
is really the only one
that's even remotely scary.

6
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,780
Becky, you make a major impact
in this movie.

7
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:28,413
Somebody even said that Angelica's scene,
it wasn't even scary at all.

8
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:32,219
Like, it was funny, and not in a good way.

9
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,717
We have to make sure
you don't get pigeon-holed now...

10
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:39,128
which is why I think
you shouldn't show your tits anymore.

11
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,767
What a piece of shit!

12
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:47,568
I know, it makes fucking <i>Blair Witch 2</i>
look like <i>Titanic.</i>

13
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,373
It's just so fucking gratuitous!

14
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,805
I think that
what makes this movie different...

15
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,713
is that the violence isn't so gratuitous.

16
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,814
It's more like the whole movie is about...

17
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:03,185
the whole psychological nature of fear.

18
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:07,119
I totally maxed out his Visa card
paying for it.

19
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,685
Then somebody in Joe Roth's office saw it
and said it was genius.

20
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,993
And now we have three meetings.

21
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,727
Seriously, you could write it.
I've read your poetry and it's really good.

22
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,939
I think I should direct it, too.

23
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:24,136
Yeah, and we should have
this really hot sex scene, all gritty and real.

24
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,578
You know, like, European.

25
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:31,209
I'm not showing my ass. My manager says
I need to stop showing my ass.

26
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,033
You have a piece of toilet paper
stuck to your shoe.

27
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,633
Shut up! Where?

28
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,840
- Honey, it's not working.
- What?

29
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,309
No, no. It's not gonna happen for me.

30
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,092
It's not. It's not gonna happen for me.

31
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,356
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:55,962
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Don't take it personally.

33
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,601
Don't make this about me.

34
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,969
What? Am I not allowed
to not have sex for once?

35
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,474
Is that what our relationship is now?

36
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,175
Wait a minute. You woke me up
by going down on me.

37
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,489
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,450
Maybe that car accident we had...

39
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:25,258
gave me some weird,
Oliver-Sacks-blow-to-the-head disease.

40
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,998
Sorry. My whole life seems like a bad dream.

41
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,509
It's like somebody else's life.

42
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:45,873
Like, if my life were a movie,
I'd fall asleep or I'd walk out.

43
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:53,218
- You still not seeing any clients?
- I can't.

44
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,553
I can't face it.

45
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:00,792
You know...

46
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,871
sometimes you just got to force yourself
to be active.

47
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:09,072
- When you're, you know...
- Like what?

48
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,169
When you're what?

49
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,947
You think I'm depressed?

50
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,744
- Are you?
- Yeah.

51
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,980
Doesn't mean I wanna talk about it.

52
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,119
Okay.

53
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
This is my sister-in-law, Angie.

54
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,636
- Angelica.
- It's nice to meet you.

55
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,707
Likewise. And this is Brody Farrell.

56
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,144
- Are you the next of kin?
- No.

57
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,442
Becky's parents died when she was two.

58
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,086
She was raised by her grandmother,
who also died.

59
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:59,658
She didn't really have anybody, except us.

60
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:04,759
- I see. Can I ask who will be...
- The cast of the movie.

61
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,456
We're all pitching in to pay for it.

62
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,101
We're going to need one person
to be designated as the...

63
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:16,038
- Brody will do that.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,872
She was sort of my girlfriend.

65
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:24,039
Do you know
what kind of service you'd like?

66
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,243
Cheap.

67
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:31,617
We provide a variety of services
for the more budget-conscious client.

68
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,588
- Sorry. Just let me turn this off.
- Take it.

69
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,590
I can handle it.

70
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,962
Please excuse me.

71
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,571
- David Fisher.
<i>- Hi, David. It's Kevin Miller.</i>

72
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:53,169
<i>You answered my personal ad</i>
<i>in the</i> LA Weekly. <i>I'm the fireman.</i>

73
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:55,980
Yes, hi. Of course.

74
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,213
We can start with
the most simple of traditional funerals...

75
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,217
which would include
our American Eagle casket here.

76
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,382
I don't think we should bury her.

77
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:09,090
Becky was totally terrified of the dark.

78
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,259
We can still have a viewing...

79
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:21,234
during which the casket will never
be closed, followed by a cremation.

80
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:26,711
That's good. And then we could scatter
her ashes some place she really liked.

81
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,872
Like Griffith Park,
or the Lava Lounge on La Brea.

82
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:35,246
I mean, I think we can skip the casket.

83
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,984
You sound like a really nice guy, too.

84
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,121
<i>I am a really nice guy. So, do you want</i>
<i>to meet for coffee later this afternoon?</i>

85
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:49,362
This afternoon? Sure. I have something
at 3:00, but I can meet you after that.

86
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,768
<i>Great, let's say at 4.00,</i>
<i>at the Up All Night Coffee House.</i>

87
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,670
<i>I'll be wearing a red baseball cap.</i>

88
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,675
Great, I love red.
It's one of my favorite colors...

89
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:01,075
- of which I have several.
<i>- Okay, see you then.</i>

90
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,884
This is a beautiful
and unusual cremains vessel.

91
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,717
The ashes actually fill these dolphins,
which are carved out inside.

92
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,486
She wasn't really into dolphins.

93
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,660
I remember somebody suggesting
she boycott tuna...

94
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:21,696
because of the whole
dolphins-getting-caught-in-the-net thing.

95
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,234
And she said:

96
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,330
"Fuck dolphins. I want a Nicoise salad."

97
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,841
- What are these?
- Those are keepsake miniature urns.

98
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,741
Sort of like lockets, if you will.

99
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,348
So everybody can get a piece of her.

100
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,822
Yes, it's an old custom from Thailand.

101
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,721
- Becky loved Thai food.
- So what did I miss?

102
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,475
I'm sorry I'm late.

103
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,843
Why weren't you at school today?

104
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,579
I was in school today.
I just wasn't in American History.

105
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:17,586
I mean, who needs to know
that shit anyways, right?

106
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,691
Somebody who wants to have a concept
of how the world works...

107
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:24,389
so they can have a fucking chance in life.

108
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,430
What crawled up your ass?

109
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:30,559
It's all lies anyways.

110
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,438
Where were you?

111
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:37,567
Andy and I skipped out after lunch.
We went to the car museum.

112
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,008
Did you get high?

113
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,612
I'm 18 years old, living in fucking California.
I'm not allowed to get high?

114
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,515
I'm worried about you, Gabe.

115
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,954
In case you don't remember,
I have good reason to be.

116
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,526
I'm sorry, okay?

117
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,499
But you don't have to worry about me,
I swear.

118
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,703
Just please don't lie to me.

119
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,008
I'm not.

120
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,383
I'm okay...

121
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,446
and I'm gonna stay okay...

122
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,389
as long as I have you.

123
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,179
<i>Let's take a look at your test results.</i>

124
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:56,685
Well, I have some very good news.
You tested negative for the HIV antibody.

125
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,121
Thank God.

126
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:01,724
You need to be tested again in six months,
just to be safe.

127
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:06,025
Let's see, negative for chlamydia,
all hepatitises, syphilis.

128
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,167
Positive for gonorrhea.

129
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,927
- What?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,137
Have you had any pain
or difficulty urinating?

131
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,640
- No.
- Any penile or anal discharge?

132
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,571
No.

133
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,611
Gonorrhea can be
completely asymptomatic...

134
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:25,344
but if it's left untreated, it can
lead to severe problems down the line.

135
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:28,945
I'm gonna give you some Cipro.
It usually knocks it right out.

136
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,447
Well, this is certainly embarrassing.

137
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,651
Did you engage in unprotected sex?

138
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,187
Yes.

139
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,461
Bad boy.

140
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:56,376
- How was school?
- Dull and depressing.

141
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,410
What are you reading?

142
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,314
<i>Now That You Know.</i>

143
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,722
Now that you know what?

144
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,250
That David is gay.

145
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,656
I take it you knew already.

146
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,235
How do you feel about it?

147
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,400
Are you hurt? Angry?

148
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,377
- Do you wish he wasn't gay?
- No.

149
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,943
Those are all valid feelings, you know.

150
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:35,219
I don't care if he's gay,
just as long as he's happy.

151
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,886
According to this book...

152
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,818
we should all be very open to how we feel...

153
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,494
and we should
try to express those feelings...

154
00:14:43,562 --> 00:14:46,326
because the foundation of intimacy is truth.

155
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:48,555
Okay.

156
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,966
Have you ever had any feelings
of same-sex attraction?

157
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,466
What? No, Mom.

158
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,569
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know.

159
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,312
When I was your age...

160
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,211
I actually had a little crush on Jane Fonda.

161
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,026
She's single again, so now's your chance.

162
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:25,926
I just never got into
that whole promiscuous thing, you know.

163
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,436
First guy I had sex with...

164
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:31,442
I ended up in a relationship with
for four years.

165
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:35,774
One-man kind of guy. Always have been.
What about you?

166
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,880
Definitely.

167
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,984
Sex just for the sake of having sex,
what is that?

168
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:45,922
Don't get me wrong. I love sex.
I'm a very sexual being.

169
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:51,062
I just think it's better when there's
something emotional going on behind it.

170
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:54,690
I credit my parents for that.

171
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,497
My mom and dad have been together
for almost 40 years.

172
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,401
They're still hot for each other.

173
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,736
And they've never been anything
but 100% supportive of me.

174
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,667
Wow.

175
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:21,851
I gotta get to work.
Listen, it's been great meeting you.

176
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,663
This was fun. Would you like to do it again?

177
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,492
I don't think so.

178
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,133
You seem like a really nice guy,
but I gotta be honest.

179
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,364
I didn't feel much of a spark.

180
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,342
Can't make it happen if it's not there, right?

181
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,718
It definitely looks like AVM.

182
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:56,987
Fuck.

183
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,394
So now what?

184
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,469
Well, that depends.
Remind me what your symptoms have been.

185
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,730
- Headaches.
- All the time?

186
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:13,008
No, just occasionally.
Mostly on the left side of my head.

187
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,172
Any seizures? Impairment of vision?
Sense of smell?

188
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:22,681
Once I had a flutter,
just on the edge of my vision.

189
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,553
I'm as blind as a bat.

190
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,888
Once I woke up,
I could see perfectly out of my left eye.

191
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,090
Lasted for a day and then it went away.
Who knows what the hell that was?

192
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,059
So what next?

193
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,097
Well, let's see.

194
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,269
It's in a not overly-eloquent brain area.

195
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,145
- You left-handed?
- No.

196
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,848
- That's not good.
- Why not?

197
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,581
And it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

198
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,624
Yeah, it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

199
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:01,517
Okay.

200
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:05,227
You want options, I'll give you the big three:

201
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,491
Cranial surgery. Not a picnic.

202
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,334
Embolization.

203
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,769
Closing off the blood vessels
by injecting glue into them.

204
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,832
Sometimes we use platinum coils instead.

205
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:22,005
And finally, radial surgery.

206
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,143
Focused radiation.

207
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,077
Die, you little motherfucker!

208
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:41,596
If I'd never been in a car accident
and gotten a routine x-ray of my skull...

209
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,292
this would've never even come up, right?

210
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,133
Until something happened.

211
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:50,665
It's possible that I could go my entire life
without it ever creating a problem.

212
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:54,642
- Anything's possible.
- Do you think I need surgery?

213
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,214
I can't really say, without more tests.

214
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:59,876
I think you might benefit from embolization.

215
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,285
However, anytime you close off
the large arteries going into an AVM...

216
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,257
the smaller blood vessels feeding it
tend to increase in size.

217
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,095
Okay, so it doesn't really work.

218
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,801
- There's only so much we can do.
- Oh, God!

219
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:22,032
Fuck! Fine. You know what?
Just don't do anything, okay?

220
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:26,771
I'm going to put this all out of my head,
no pun intended, and just get on with life.

221
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:28,005
I'm not sure...

222
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,811
I don't give a fuck what you think,
you arrogant piece of shit.

223
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,920
Okay, even if we decide not to do anything
at this juncture...

224
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,785
There's no "we." I decide.

225
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:40,518
I'd still like to get another MRI on you
in 12 months.

226
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:43,390
And I'd like
a fucking straight answer, asshole.

227
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,496
<i>It's kind of ironic.</i>

228
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:50,429
You don't smoke, you run every day,
eat all that healthy crap.

229
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,797
Shut up!

230
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:56,171
Now me, I smoked, I drank,
I ate any old thing I wanted.

231
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:01,002
And I inhaled embalming fluid
for God knows how long. You know what?

232
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,243
If it wasn't for that bus,
I'd have lived to be 93.

233
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:10,353
It's the first time I've driven since then.
You may want to fasten your seatbelt.

234
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:14,325
Well, who's the dead man in this car?
It's not me!

235
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:18,991
Fuck you!

236
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,767
<i>We thank you, Heavenly Father...</i>

237
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,600
for this and all thy blessings
in Christ's name. Amen.

238
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:34,798
Amen.

239
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:41,604
I've invited Nikolai to dinner Sunday night.
I'd like you all to be there.

240
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,114
Nikolai the flower guy?

241
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:47,816
Yes, he and I are having
a sexual relationship now.

242
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,956
I'm not sure if it's something
that's going to last, but there it is.

243
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:58,759
We're all adults. We're all sexual beings.
We should acknowledge that.

244
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:04,795
Okay.

245
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:10,900
Nate, I'd like you to invite Brenda.
Claire, I'd like you to invite Gabriel Dimas.

246
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:16,014
And, David, if you have a special friend,
I'd like for him to come, as well.

247
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,184
Why is my friend special?

248
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:24,188
All right. If you're having sex with anyone,
I'd like to meet him. Is that better?

249
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,621
Not really.

250
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,485
Stop acting like children!

251
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,591
- Where are you going?
- I'm just getting an aspirin.

252
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:38,295
Do you have a headache?

253
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,828
No, I read you should take an aspirin a day.
It keeps the blood thin.

254
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,774
Please, if our blood were any thinner,
we'd evaporate.

255
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:49,041
What's that supposed to mean? Is that
some sort of insult? We're thin-blooded?

256
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:53,107
Mom, no, it was a joke. I'm more
thin-blooded than any of us, probably.

257
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,019
Are you seeing anyone?

258
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:58,780
No.

259
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,453
Why not?

260
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,794
Sex is an important and healthy part of life.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

261
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:09,493
Yes, I know that.
Unfortunately, I'm not having any right now.

262
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:12,295
What happened to that cop...

263
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:14,394
the black man?

264
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,337
He met someone else.

265
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,951
Thank you.

266
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,720
You don't have any free time tomorrow?

267
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,858
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- I'd really like to see you.

268
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:38,361
<i>I have three shiatsu appointments.</i>

269
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,492
You're the one that wanted me
to get on with my life.

270
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,733
<i>You can still come Sunday night</i>
<i>for dinner, right?</i>

271
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,502
Even if just for the entertainment value.
It's bound to be a freak fest.

272
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,503
<i>I think so. Maybe.</i>

273
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,572
- I miss you.
- You just saw me.

274
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:00,747
<i>I know, I just...</i>

275
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:05,279
would really like to be with you
at this moment in time.

276
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,259
- Right now.
<i>- I'll see you soon.</i>

277
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:10,795
Sunday, okay?

278
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,196
I love you.

279
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,223
I love you, too.

280
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,791
- Hey, Rico.
- Hey, boss man. I've got a favor to ask you.

281
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:47,924
Okay.

282
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,833
Could you please drop her off
at the crematorium for me tonight?

283
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,571
Come on, man.
Vanessa's just a bit overwhelmed at home.

284
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,701
Julio's got a cold and Augusto
hasn't slept through the night for a month.

285
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,782
No, I can't.

286
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:10,214
I'm sorry, Rico, but I can't.

287
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,052
Okay.

288
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:20,622
Can you at least help me
put her inside the box?

289
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:23,793
Sure.

290
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:32,475
So, cardboard box? Classy.

291
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:37,542
She obviously didn't think her life was
worth anything, so it makes sense to me.

292
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,317
On three. One, two, three.

293
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:46,415
It's kind of sad.

294
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,490
It's not.

295
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:53,061
She threw her fucking life away.
It's not sad. It's pathetic.

296
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,216
We tend to forget how many gifts
God has given each and every one of us...

297
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:16,016
because our lives
are so filled with distractions...

298
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:19,621
crowded with messages
competing for our attention...

299
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:22,625
encouraging us to be unhappy
with our lives.

300
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,522
If only we looked younger...

301
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,760
had perfect skin...

302
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,391
zero body fat.

303
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:36,103
The truth of the matter is
God loves us just the way we are.

304
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,674
Some people said, "Congratulations.
You've really shaken things up." Whatever.

305
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:46,183
Most people in the congregation wouldn't
even make eye contact with me after that.

306
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,951
So now I'm back at St. Stephen's.

307
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,191
So, how are you guys?

308
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:02,297
- Good. We're good.
- Just got back from a weekend in San Diego.

309
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,868
- Spectacular.
- We went parasailing.

310
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:07,762
Keith won't admit it,
but he was scared to death.

311
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:11,234
I was not scared.
Might have had a little rush of adrenaline...

312
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,436
but that's the point, right?

313
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:16,838
I'll have him hang-gliding
by the end of the year, if it kills me.

314
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:21,750
In your dreams, fool! I am not breaking
every bone in my body just to impress you.

315
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,252
Seven years I've been hang-gliding.
I never broke anything.

316
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:28,053
- You're just lucky.
- Don't I know it?

317
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:35,598
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>only one of these men will be crowned...</i>

318
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,965
<i>Mr. Gay Black America!</i>

319
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,570
Did I tell you I'm moving?

320
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,077
- Where?
- Same building. A bigger place opened up.

321
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,517
We've been wanting to get a dog.

322
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,684
Great.

323
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,629
Do I seem more tense than usual?

324
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,699
You're not supposed to talk, remember?
It takes us both out of it.

325
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:17,098
The only conversation is between your body
and my hands.

326
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:22,843
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but we're on my dime here.

327
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:29,720
I discovered one of the worst things
about selling 3 million books...

328
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:34,352
is constantly feeling
like I have to apologize for it, you know?

329
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,424
It's like, "I make a ton of money,
so I must be part of the problem."

330
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:42,628
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

331
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,062
You do seem more tense than usual.

332
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:49,368
I'm not responsible for cancer.
I'm not responsible for world hunger.

333
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:53,773
What if I'm just happy,
and that's my contribution to the world?

334
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:59,244
I'm thinking of pitching a book
to my publisher.

335
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:03,981
Bit of a cultural history,
tracing the how, and the why, and when...

336
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:07,318
- it became such a sin to be happy.
- Drop.

337
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:10,656
Who knows, it might help
some of those poor sad fucks...

338
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,357
who are incapable of experiencing joy.

339
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,702
- Get out of my house.
- Excuse me?

340
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:22,303
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- What is wrong with you?

341
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,740
You don't have any respect for me
or what I do.

342
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:27,937
I'm just another servant
who has to listen to your bullshit...

343
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:32,177
and pretend like I don't think you're
the stupid asshole windbag that you are.

344
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:34,444
You crazy bitch.

345
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,316
I'm paying you for a shiatsu,
and I intend to get a shiatsu.

346
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,357
I don't need your fucking money.

347
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,759
I do not allow people to treat me like this.

348
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:55,100
Yeah? Well, if you don't
get out of my fucking house right now...

349
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:59,371
I'll call the <i>LA Times</i> and I'll tell them
about the lipo scars on your ass.

350
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,112
Right now.

351
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,611
Get out!

352
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,364
<i>So this is where the magic happens.</i>

353
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:29,599
Yeah, this is it.

354
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:34,845
What's that smell? It's like...

355
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:38,506
Disinfectant, burnt coffee, embalming fluid.

356
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:49,325
"For the velvety look and feel
of actual living tissue."

357
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:54,427
- No fucking way!
- You do not even want to know.

358
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,400
They have these plastic screws,
only bigger...

359
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:02,229
that they stick into people's orifices,
so stuff won't spill out.

360
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:05,572
- That's some kind of fucked up.
- Welcome to my world.

361
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:17,652
So this is where my brother was?

362
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:22,381
Jesus, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
brought you down here.

363
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,395
I'm the one who asked to see it.

364
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,104
What?

365
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,042
You're the first guy I've ever brought home
to meet my family...

366
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:48,547
and I feel weird, you know? I feel nervous.

367
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:54,920
Don't worry. I will be on my best behavior.

368
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:57,984
Okay? Come on.

369
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,739
Your mother is a good woman.

370
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:20,783
- Yes, we're aware of that.
- David, give him a break.

371
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,349
Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother.

372
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:26,754
He's been majorly cranky
ever since he stopped getting laid.

373
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,997
- How old you are?
- Thirty-one.

374
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:40,493
Good.

375
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,641
I had a son.

376
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:47,970
He would be a little bit older than you.

377
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,275
He was a student of medicine.

378
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,690
- Look who's here.
- Hello.

379
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,476
I've got major cotton mouth.

380
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,954
- Who wants to say grace?
- I will say grace.

381
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:37,686
"The poor shall eat, and be filled.

382
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,989
"And those that seek the Lord
shall praise him.

383
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:46,662
"Their hearts will live forever and ever.

384
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:52,941
"Glory be to the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

385
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:56,339
"both now and forever...

386
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,482
"and unto the ages of ages.

387
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:02,279
"Amen.

388
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:08,886
"Lord have mercy.

389
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,364
"Lord, bless.

390
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:19,832
"O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God...

391
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:25,099
"for the sake of the prayers
of thy most pure mother and all the saints...

392
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,371
"have mercy on us.

393
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:29,872
"Amen."

394
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,751
Nikolai, you are so beautiful.

395
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:41,154
Thank you.

396
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,791
You're such a beautiful person.
There is this total light coming out of you.

397
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:55,497
That's a very unusual compliment, Nate.

398
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:59,803
- Your brother is high.
- I know, look at his eyes.

399
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:08,974
- Are you all right?
- I am more than all right.

400
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,021
I haven't felt this good in...
I don't even know how long it's been.

401
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,354
Yes.

402
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,162
You know how long it's been
since I've heard you do that?

403
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:28,797
Remember when we were first going out,
you used to laugh all the time.

404
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,398
I miss that. Your laughter's like music.

405
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,977
- Nate.
- What?

406
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,138
You're high.

407
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,515
No, I'm not.

408
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,047
Am I?

409
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,552
Look at the light.

410
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:54,124
Oh, my God, I am high.

411
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,331
I love the little...

412
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,499
They're like halos.

413
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,939
What is he high on?

414
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,237
I wouldn't know.

415
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:14,011
I am so not hungry.

416
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:20,449
I think this went pretty good tonight.

417
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,957
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,791
- It was awkward and embarrassing.
- What?

419
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,730
I mean, my son is high on drugs!

420
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:34,668
What am I supposed to do about that?
Should I intervene? Join a support group?

421
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:37,497
He just seems happy.

422
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:42,611
We're going to the movies.

423
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,943
Good night, Mrs. Fisher.
Thank you for dinner.

424
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,382
What movie?

425
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:50,387
We haven't decided yet,
but we'll be back late.

426
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:53,617
Mom, you said yourself, we're all adults.

427
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:55,618
We'll be back late.

428
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,127
Good night.

429
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,069
It's all about flowing.

430
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:12,809
It flows up, it flows down.

431
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:16,005
And then, sometimes,
things stop it from flowing. You stay.

432
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,039
It's like you just move in a little pool.

433
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:23,210
You're like a little eddy.

434
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,288
And that's what it all comes down to.

435
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,561
Everything in my life, every thing...

436
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,429
You know, this thing in my head...

437
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,992
it's all about flow.

438
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,466
Flow?

439
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,576
Oh, my God!

440
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:59,284
That was so totally you!
That was just so totally David!

441
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:03,025
I love you.

442
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:07,086
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- No, you have to take him with you.

443
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,827
Hope I did nothing to fuck you up
when we were kids.

444
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,664
Not when he's like this.

445
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:14,565
Did you know I taught David
how to masturbate?

446
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:18,775
No, I didn't, and you know what, Nate?
That's fascinating, but I have to go.

447
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:22,574
No, just wait a second.
I just want to say goodbye. Come here.

448
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,004
Oh, God!

449
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:30,786
- I love you so fucking much.
- You're so fucking high.

450
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,922
But how'd I get that way?
You can't just get high out of nowhere.

451
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:38,325
- You have to take drugs. I didn't take any.
- Did you take any aspirin?

452
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:39,622
Yeah.

453
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:42,758
There may have been
a stray tab of Ecstasy...

454
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,495
in the aspirin bottle in the kitchen cabinet.

455
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:53,369
Oh, dear. You call me when you crash.

456
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:57,712
No, call me after you crash.
You know what? Call me next week.

457
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:09,155
I hope you like her.

458
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:14,255
- It's important to me that you like her.
- I do like her.

459
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:18,094
'Cause you're the only brother I have.

460
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:23,765
<i>Time to kiss</i>
<i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

461
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,736
Yeah, slice her up!

462
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,139
That was hostile.

463
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,444
Isn't that the girl that you guys are burying?

464
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,981
- She's hot.
- She's hot and dead.

465
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,958
<i>This calls for someone with experience.</i>

466
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:44,221
<i>Someone who knows her way</i>
<i>around Griffith Park.</i>

467
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,695
<i>- That's me.</i>
<i>- In the daytime.</i>

468
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:49,693
<i>You gotta love her.</i>

469
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:53,533
<i>In fact, if God gave me the ingredients</i>
<i>and told me to make a woman...</i>

470
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,268
<i>I'd make her just like my wife.</i>

471
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:04,878
<i>They lost no time in tucking into</i>
<i>the wonderful meal Boris had prepared.</i>

472
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:07,542
<i>And then there was a dessert.</i>

473
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:11,918
<i>I guess Boris knows I always like to have</i>
<i>lettuce for dessert, don't you, Boris?</i>

474
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:15,822
<i>I hope the meal was satisfactory.</i>

475
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,328
<i>It was delightful, Boris!</i>
<i>You're a wonderful cook.</i>

476
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:24,598
<i>It was nothing, Martha.</i>
<i>Straight out of the cookbook.</i>

477
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,634
<i>It's yummy, Boris.</i>
<i>I couldn't eat another thing.</i>

478
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:31,597
<i>Yeah, it's not bad for a first effort.</i>

479
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:35,570
Fuck.

480
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,157
Buddy boy!

481
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:35,132
Come on, saved a place for you.

482
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:42,305
Chinese checkers.

483
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:47,647
- I always hated this game.
- That's because you never played for money.

484
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:54,717
Nate, I want you to meet
a couple of friends of mine.

485
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,992
Well, honey, this is the man.

486
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:01,424
Death.

487
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,892
The Grim Reaper.

488
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:06,797
Cigar?

489
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:11,573
- No, thanks.
- Good for you, baby. That stuff is nasty.

490
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,802
- And this is...
- My partner.

491
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,277
That sounds so professional. I love it.

492
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,244
- Life.
- Shut up.

493
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,583
Oh, yeah, it's a whole yin-yang thing.

494
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:28,454
You telling me
you two are in business together?

495
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:31,757
Honey, me and him
are in all kinds of shit together!

496
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,925
Let's just say
it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.

497
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,591
It's your turn.

498
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:43,199
Shouldn't I wait for you
to start a new game?

499
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,606
This game ain't never gonna end.

500
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,812
You're either in the game, or you're out of it.

501
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:53,016
"On or off the bus," if you prefer.

502
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:55,741
All right, I'm in.

503
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:01,752
You gotta put something in the kitty, son.

504
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,557
- What are you betting?
- Everything.

505
00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:07,925
All right, I'll bet everything. Whatever.

506
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,809
- I'm shaking.
- Hey, buddy boy, no.

507
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:24,347
You don't wanna get this guy mad,
believe me.

508
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:27,509
I don't get mad.
I have people who do it for me.

509
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:37,986
Showoff!

510
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:41,898
But that always gets me going.

511
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:46,166
You wanna fuck me, puppet head?

512
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,940
Momma!

513
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:03,411
Yeah, baby! That's it.

514
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:06,881
Go to town, big daddy!

515
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:18,167
Big cosmic mystery.
Right here, right in front of you.

516
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:22,734
You can't say your old man
never took you any place interesting.

517
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,134
Yeah, but I'm high.

518
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,076
I know I'm high.

519
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:34,875
"All that lives, lives forever.

520
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,955
"Only the shell,
the perishable passes away."

521
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:40,183
Fuck, yeah.

522
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:44,454
"The spirit is without end. Eternal.

523
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,729
"Deathless."

524
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,498
<i>Now take this over here and...</i>

525
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:58,767
<i>Look at that, folks.</i>
<i>Look at that for a holiday dinner.</i>

526
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:04,375
<i>If we had some mint jelly,</i>
<i>that would be fabulous.</i>

527
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,143
<i>- Unbelievable!</i>
<i>- Smell that.</i>

528
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:09,008
<i>So all I get to do is smell it?</i>

529
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,955
<i>- Show them.</i>
<i>- Smell this.</i>

530
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,723
<i>- Isn't that wonderful?</i>
<i>- Oh, boy!</i>

531
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:30,839
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, no, did I wake you?

532
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,538
Yeah, you did. What's up?

533
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:40,883
I just wanted to thank you
for inviting me out...

534
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:44,318
- with you and Eddie yesterday after church.
- Okay.

535
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:47,052
<i>And to tell you that...</i>

536
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:50,454
it's really important to me
that we've remained friends.

537
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,030
If you'd ever like to do something,
just the two of us, I'd really like that.

538
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,504
Look, David, I'm happy that we're friends...

539
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:05,068
but I'm in a relationship. A good one.

540
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:10,536
- I know.
- You and me, it ain't happening.

541
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:16,218
Yeah, I know that. It's just kind of hard
for me to be around you and Eddie together.

542
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,250
You need to get over that.

543
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:22,050
Jesus, Keith, could you be
a little more self-righteous?

544
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:37,363
- Good morning, Mom.
- You're up early.

545
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:41,107
I've been having trouble sleeping recently.
Not sure why.

546
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,280
Where's Nikolai?

547
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:55,355
- Home.
- He didn't stay over?

548
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,884
Of course not.

549
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:02,655
You know, Mom...

550
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:06,728
if you did want for him to stay over,
that would be your right.

551
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:11,538
- I know that. I don't need your permission.
- No, you don't. Nor do I need yours.

552
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:15,635
Of course not.

553
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:22,085
You had a terrible time last night,
didn't you?

554
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:27,151
Kind of.

555
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,685
I did it for you. Arranged the whole evening.

556
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,455
- Why?
- Some stupid book told me to.

557
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:38,023
- Throw that book away.
- I intend to.

558
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:45,238
Does Nate have a problem with drugs now?
Is this something I need to know about?

559
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,533
I think he took it by accident.

560
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:50,546
How can something like that
be an accident?

561
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:59,880
Rebecca Milford's star shone all too briefly.

562
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:02,750
But, oh, how brightly it shone.

563
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:05,559
This is really boring.

564
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:08,961
How very, very brightly indeed.

565
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,334
No, it's hilarious, is what it is.

566
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:15,298
Gabe, a girl died.

567
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,034
So what? Everybody dies.

568
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:31,453
How did Ecstasy get in the aspirin bottle?
Is that Claire's idea of a joke?

569
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,617
I think I might have left it in there.

570
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:41,125
- Where did you get it?
- You remember the square-dancing guy?

571
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:48,797
Do you think you could get some more?

572
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:58,479
I wrote something about Becky...

573
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:02,082
that I'd like to share with everyone here.

574
00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:13,221
<i>Tiny Venus</i>

575
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:19,734

Right on. That's my man.

584
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,111
What are you doing down here?

585
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,179
It was a stupid idea
of me to go to a funeral for fun.

586
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,126
Yeah, I tried to tell you that.

587
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,055
- Okay, so you were right.
- Are you okay?

588
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,363
I'm fine. Why do you have to...

589
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:29,397
- I'm not a pet! I'm not your pet!
- I'm sorry.

590
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,764
I'm going home.

591
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,173
You said you guys were
all pitching in together to pay for this.

592
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:42,184
Yeah, I paid my $600,
and I'm not paying a penny more.

593
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,311
Do you know how rude that girl was to me?

594
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:46,515
You know how this is gonna make me look?

595
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,856
So? Go talk to Brody. He's the one who
supposedly can't come up with his share.

596
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,326
- You brought this funeral here.
- So?

597
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:56,594
So maybe you need to come up
with the difference.

598
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:00,028
Maybe you need to get off my case...

599
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:04,130
considering I just gave your wife $500
so she can pay for fucking diapers!

600
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:08,609
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me.

601
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:12,742
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- She asked me for it.

602
00:51:32,502 --> 00:51:34,231
What are you doing?

603
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,708
This way, she'll always be a part of us.

604
00:51:42,245 --> 00:51:46,511
You fucking moron.
You're all fucking morons.

605
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:51,615
You are all such incredibly stupid losers!

606
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:54,290
- Chill.
- You people are fucking disgusting!

607
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:56,588
- Who the hell are you?
- Fucking bunch of junkies!

608
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,424
- This is not cool.
- Did you see what these people are doing?

609
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:02,158
I know, but this is our business,
these are our clients.

610
00:52:02,232 --> 00:52:03,631
They can do whatever they want.

611
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,693
We'll see you back here real soon, okay?
And we'll be snorting you next time!

612
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,906
"All that lives, lives forever.

613
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,478

Really?

618
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:37,299
- I never read it.
- You read it at my house.

619
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:41,531
- I don't think so.
- Don't you remember? I went on and on...

620
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:45,200
about the Peter Brook production
of <i>The Mahabharata</i> in London?

621
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:54,684
But it felt so profound. Are you telling me
it's just recycled crap from my brain?

622
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:56,912
>From your drug-addled brain.

623
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:06,889
Hello?

624
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:11,230
<i>So were you just not going to tell me</i>
<i>or did you just forget?</i>

625
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,767
Forget what?

626
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,663
A certain test you took recently.

627
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:21,904
They posted the results today.
Congratulations, Mr. Funeral Director.

628
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,074
You gotta be shitting me.

629
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:32,685
<i>I'm looking at your name, plain as day.</i>
<i>"Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, Jr."</i>

630
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:36,390
You know, I had totally forgotten about that.

631
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:41,463
I'm proud of you, Nate.

632
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,360
Thanks.

633
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:47,965
I'll see you later.

634
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:54,101
- Where are you going?
- I have a client at 8:30.

635
00:53:55,278 --> 00:53:58,645
- That's a little late, isn't it?
- No, it's not that late.

636
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,015
Can I come over later?

637
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:05,348
Not tonight, okay?

638
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:12,559
I'm having enough trouble
just being with myself right now.

639
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,321
I'm sorry. It's not you.

640
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:20,468
It's me. I'm fucked up.

641
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:28,137
And you can't fix it.

642
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:56,097
You're in the game now, buddy boy...

643
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,227
whether you like it or not.
