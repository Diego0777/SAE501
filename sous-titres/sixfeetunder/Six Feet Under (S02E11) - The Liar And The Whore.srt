1
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,138
<i>Trash. As in trailer trash.</i>

2
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,219
They're 20 minutes late with my Vioxx again.

3
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,339
I'm in such pain.

4
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,138
I'm in such agony.

5
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,894
I wish the Good Lord would take me soon.

6
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,332
How are things at home with you and Rico?
He still acting crazy?

7
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,493
I don't know,
but he definitely has a bug up his ass.

8
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,173
Mid-life crisis.

9
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,297
He's too young for that.

10
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,295
Honey, men start having their mid-life crisis
in their early 20s...

11
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,737
and they keep on having them
every three to five years after that.

12
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:34,654
You're gonna have to eat more than this,
Mrs. Kippleman.

13
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,130
- Shit!
- Now what?

14
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,897
Vanessa, she's got no pulse.

15
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,135
Shit!

16
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,410
- She's a full code?
- I don't know.

17
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,420
Come on, Edith, come on.

18
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,460
A world-class complainer like you
isn't gonna give up that easy.

19
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:12,257
- How about these?
- The green pants.

20
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:17,220
- Actually, these are olive.
- I can get myself dressed, you know.

21
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm just trying to help.

22
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,693
- Did I ask for your help?
- No.

23
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,817
Then what the hell are you doing
in my room?

24
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,540
Hey, you don't talk to David that way.

25
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:29,090
You'd better start showing some respect
around here.

26
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:31,820
- Or what, you're gonna put me in jail?
- What did you say?

27
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:32,936
Let her go.

28
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,774
We've got to start setting
some serious boundaries with her.

29
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,136
Look at all the shit she's had to deal with.

30
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,781
Not to mention the past couple of months.
She's 9.

31
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,658
- I know how old she is.
- I'm just saying...

32
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,413
Do you want to pick a fight with me?

33
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,857
No, do you want to pick a fight
with a 9-year-old about her attitude?

34
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,659
This morning I do.

35
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:53,292
Too fucking bad. I know you're nervous
about your old man coming...

36
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,930
but I don't have to let you
take it out on Taylor. Or me.

37
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,411
- It's 9:30.
- So?

38
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,894
Let me sleep late.

39
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:13,257
It's the last enjoyment I'll know
before I become a cog in the wheel...

40
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,616
making mocha lattes
for the people who have a life.

41
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,171
- Don't you think that's a little dramatic?
- Not really.

42
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,134
- Can I make you something to eat?
- No, thanks.

43
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:27,254
You never eat a decent breakfast anymore.

44
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,814
This is a glass of orange juice.
This is an apple.

45
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,894
That's two of my daily servings of fruit
recommended by the USDA.

46
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,972
Claire, are you depressed?

47
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm not even gonna answer that question.

48
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,537
Whatever you're going through,
I hope you don't blame me.

49
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:54,734
I was just calling you.

50
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,858
What, you can be late all you want
but I'm not allowed to be?

51
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,375
- Calm down.
- Why? I'm pissed off!

52
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,055
I get pissed off sometimes.
I have a right to express it.

53
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,530
Express it to somebody else,
because I've got to run.

54
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,816
Brenda and I have a meeting with Rabbi Ari.

55
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,495
- You're thinking of converting?
- Maybe.

56
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,331
What? I'm already circumcised.

57
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:19,100
- Anything I need to be aware of here?
- I did a pickup this morning at Bay Breeze...

58
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,580
another referral from Vanessa.

59
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:24,939
Great, another chance for Rico to act
like we owe our entire livelihood to him.

60
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,500
Hello! Mr. Fisher?

61
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:29,095
Dave, you've got to lighten up, man.

62
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,450
Can I help you?

63
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,214
- Are you Nathaniel Fisher?
- No, he's deceased.

64
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,771
Wait a minute, that's me.
I'm Nathaniel Fisher, Jr.

65
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,852
Consider yourself served.

66
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,817
- Shit.
- Who was that?

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,057
You remember Mrs. Collins?

68
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,935
The waitress who got locked
in the walk-in overnight?

69
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,775
No, the wife of the guy who fell off the boat,
got sliced up by the propeller.

70
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,499
Yeah, the bargain hunter.

71
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,297
She wanted to see the body.

72
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,578
- You didn't.
- She made me.

73
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:17,932
Now she's suing us for emotional distress
to the tune of $500,000. Fuck!

74
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,300
There's an ashtray over there somewhere.

75
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:27,496
You should really clean this car out
sometime, you know.

76
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,732
What the fuck is this?

77
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:37,020
It's some creepy thing
my Aunt Sarah sent me for my birthday.

78
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,979
I don't know what happened.
Usually she has pretty good taste.

79
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:43,497
It's filled with some nasty Chinese
holistic herb shit.

80
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,620
Newsflash! These aren't Chinese herbs.

81
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,695
- They're not?
- These are shrooms.

82
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,771
My aunt sent me mushrooms?

83
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:58,377
Whatever you thought you were
doing tomorrow, plan on blowing it off.

84
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,692
- What's wrong with today?
- I have a date with Mr. Schussler.

85
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:05,057
- Mr. Schussler the vocational arts teacher?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,777
And you can't fuck for shit
when you're on shrooms.

87
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:14,094
Marriage is a profound experience
that can deeply enrich your life...

88
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,570
and even bring you closer to God.

89
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,575
But our culture has many misconceptions
about it.

90
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,539
Like marriage will cure Ioneliness...

91
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:26,535
or that most of our satisfactions in life
should come from our partner.

92
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:29,215
Or that good sex means good marriage.

93
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:33,216
And the truth is that marriage is different
for different people.

94
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,815
So in this and our next five sessions...

95
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,893
we'll talk about what marriage means to you.

96
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,940
I'm curious.

97
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,458
- Have you ever been married?
- No, I haven't.

98
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:48,138
But I have counseled many couples
in my congregation...

99
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,735
both before, during, and after marriage.

100
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,891
One thing I can say without hesitation...

101
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,415
is you can't have a good marriage
without honesty.

102
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,490
Yeah.

103
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:59,493
That kind of goes without saying,
doesn't it?

104
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,774
Are you completely honest with each other?

105
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,936
You don't have to answer that right now.

106
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:13,172
It's just something to think about
for next week.

107
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,537
- Would you like some cucumber salad?
- No, thank you.

108
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,693
- I made more than enough.
- I reading paper.

109
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,136
Fine.

110
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:00,531
Take it, go ahead, take it.

111
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,900
I'll be back.

112
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,178
Like Terminator, no?

113
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:22,056
What is he? Did he threaten you?

114
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:25,091
Mind your own business, woman!

115
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:35,972
Can I just say that I think
total honesty is not always the best thing?

116
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,336
What about privacy?

117
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:41,697
What about trying to maintain the mystery
of a relationship?

118
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,569
Sometimes truth is irrelevant.

119
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,496
Brenda, I did something stupid.

120
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,300
I'm listening.

121
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,261
The trip to Seattle, my friend Lisa?

122
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,730
I slept with her. She's pregnant.

123
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:19,496
I don't even know how to respond
to something like this.

124
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,418
What do you feel?

125
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:28,218
I don't know what I feel.
I don't feel anything.

126
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,180
I feel numb.

127
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:38,930
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I'm telling you now.

128
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,939
What do you expect me to do
with this information?

129
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,010
Christ, Nate! This whole wedding thing
scares the shit out of me...

130
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:52,379
but I've been trying to make myself believe
that we could actually...

131
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,700
Almost done.

132
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:14,256
Okay.

133
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,494
Okay, then.

134
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:25,780
How bad is it?

135
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,091
- Your brother showed her the body?
- Yes.

136
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,617
- It was in pretty bad shape, huh?
- Yes.

137
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,340
I think she's got a pretty airtight case.

138
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,651
I think that you guys
are more or less fucked.

139
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,857
She made him show her the body.

140
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,297
I can certainly argue that point,
but, David, she was under duress...

141
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,975
and this woman is going to describe
in great detail...

142
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:49,211
exactly what she saw
when she's up on the stand.

143
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:52,134
On top of that,
she's hired herself an aggressive law firm...

144
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:55,736
that nobody likes to mess with,
so I think that we should try to settle.

145
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,698
How much money do you guys have?

146
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,931
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Where were you?

147
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:06,218
With Brenda. We were in the middle
of something pretty intense.

148
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,373
Do you know how much trouble we are in
because of this lawsuit?

149
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,053
I have things I've got to deal with.

150
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,257
I have a life, too. I have a kid now.

151
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,809
At least I try to keep it separate
from the business...

152
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,938
that you seem so hell-bent
on flushing down the fucking toilet!

153
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,973
We are fucked, Nate!

154
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,739
And you fucked us.

155
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,979
I'm afraid my daughter's suffering from
depression and I don't know what to do.

156
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:37,373
Most teenagers suffer from mild depression
at one time or another.

157
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:40,021
- Is that true?
- True enough.

158
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,658
But I'm pretty familiar
with clinical depression...

159
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,733
- and I don't see Claire suffering from that.
- You don't?

160
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:50,257
Look, she's the kind of person...

161
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:54,050
that needs her life to be meaningful.
I'm sure you know this better than I do.

162
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,450
No, I don't feel as though I do.

163
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:00,177
And by the way, who doesn't need their life
to be meaningful?

164
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,410
You'd be surprised.

165
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,140
She has no idea how easy she's had it!

166
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,652
Do you want to know what you can do
to be more supportive of Claire?

167
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:10,777
Of course. That's why I'm here, I think.

168
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,818
This is a brochure for LAC-Arts.

169
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,731
I think Claire should think about
going there.

170
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:25,415
It's a great school
for someone with her creativity.

171
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,692
- You really don't think she's depressed?
- I don't.

172
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,931
- But can I speak candidly?
- Please.

173
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,973
I think it's possible that you might be.

174
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:47,653
It's me. I'm leaving another goddamn
message on your voice mail.

175
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,217
Listen, I really need to talk.

176
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,733
Billy, God damn it, I need you.
I really need you.

177
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,055
God damn it, where the fuck are you?

178
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,059
Mr. Charles, hey!

179
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,377
It's good to see you again.

180
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:30,776
You met me when Keith brought me down
to San Diego last...

181
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:34,251
- It's been over a year ago.
- I know who you are.

182
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,734
Hey, Lucille. I'm sorry I'm so late.
I guess I missed dinner, huh?

183
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,772
- I left you a plate in the microwave.
- Thank you.

184
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:49,980
- Hey, you're home.
- Yeah. I'm sorry I'm so late.

185
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,693
Did you get my...

186
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:54,981
- Where's Taylor?
- Brushing her teeth.

187
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:58,540
- Did she floss first?
- Yes, I watched her.

188
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,818
Listen, I put fresh linens on.
Extra blankets in the hall closet.

189
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,335
Keith, your mother and I want
to have a word with you.

190
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:07,140
- Can't it wait until morning?
- No, I don't think it can.

191
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,090
- I can leave the room if you'd like.
- I don't care if you're here for this or not.

192
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:16,379
Keith, we'd like to take Taylor home with us
when we go back to San Diego.

193
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,770
- What, for a visit?
- No, to live.

194
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,735
- Why?
- This isn't any of your concern, sir.

195
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:26,372
- I'm sorry, but I think it is.
- No, David, let's hear him out.

196
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:32,332
For one, we have a yard big enough
for her to play in.

197
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:34,617
We'll be able to spend more time with her.

198
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,773
And we'll be able to offer her more stability.

199
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,895
It's what's best for the child,
and you know it.

200
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:43,776
Fine.

201
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,412
Ari, hi.

202
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:07,130
I'm sorry to just drop in like this so late,
but I was in the neighborhood.

203
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:11,214
Well, nearby, speaking to somebody
who's interested in arranging a funeral.

204
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:14,418
- His own, actually. What do you call that?
- A pre-need.

205
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,650
Right.

206
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,894
So I was wondering
if you would be willing to help him?

207
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:22,700
Yeah, sure.
Just give me his name and number.

208
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,614
- I'll call him first thing tomorrow.
- Okay.

209
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,015
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

210
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,894
Okay, that's bullshit.

211
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,690
I'm coming in, and you're gonna offer me
something to drink.

212
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:42,816
That is a lot for her to absorb.

213
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:49,457
She already knew about the AVM,
but I just told her about the baby today.

214
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:53,574
You said we'd never have a good marriage
without honesty.

215
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,936
- I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

216
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:04,139
Why do you think you have so much trouble
being honest with Brenda?

217
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:08,260
- I don't think it's particular to Brenda.
- With women, then.

218
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:13,931
- I don't have trouble being honest with you.
- I'm a rabbi, Nate.

219
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:18,253
- You don't look like a rabbi.
- I am a rabbi.

220
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:22,411
Unavailable to you,
not even in your wildest dreams.

221
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:25,500
That's why you don't have trouble
being honest with me.

222
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,572
There's nothing at stake.

223
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:33,300
How do you feel about becoming a father?

224
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,370
I don't know how I feel about it.

225
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:41,097
I certainly never imagined
it would happen like this.

226
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:45,335
All of our actions have consequences.

227
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:50,217
We may not even be aware of them,
but they exist nevertheless.

228
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:57,174
You should consider it a blessing.
What if you had never known?

229
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:05,690
Sorry.

230
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:08,896
Just give her some time, Nate.

231
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,300
Time. Right.

232
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,371
We got another one from Bay Breeze!
That's the fourth one this year.

233
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:49,773
Yes, I'm aware of how many referrals
your wife sends our way.

234
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:53,650
Just making sure you know
where the business is coming from.

235
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:00,291
- Something funny about this one, David.
- Funny how?

236
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:09,697
The certificate says the cause of death
was congestive heart failure.

237
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,012
So? Old people have their heart
quit on them all the time.

238
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:16,457
Yeah, but she's got these contusions
around her neck.

239
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,739
Old people bruise easily.

240
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:24,211
Those probably happened
while they were trying to resuscitate her.

241
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,700
Maybe.

242
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,213
What the fuck?

243
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,334
A hot dog?

244
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:01,492
You tell me. I don't think something this big
just happened to go down the wrong way.

245
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:12,300
Is it okay if Parker spends the night
at our house tonight?

246
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:13,700
Of course.

247
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,332
Would you like me to pick you up
a frozen pizza and some videos?

248
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,652
No, I think we're good.

249
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:26,699
Are you doing something
with Nikolai tonight?

250
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,535
I think he's losing interest in me.

251
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:32,733
He's been spending a lot of time
alone lately.

252
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:37,179
He was living here
with plastic casts on both legs...

253
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:39,855
and peeing in a bedpan
for, what, six weeks?

254
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:41,818
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:45,612
Just give him some space.
Guys need a lot of space.

256
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:50,574
He doesn't know how to take care of himself
and he needs my help!

257
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,500
If you say so.

258
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,134
I'm a little confused
about this term "pre-need."

259
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,177
It's a payment structure that allows you to...

260
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:08,855
Make the purchase before you need it.
I get that.

261
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:10,374
I may be dying. I'm not an idiot.

262
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:13,259
My question is
with the choice of the word "need."

263
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,060
I mean, who really needs a funeral anyway?

264
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,496
If you're dead you don't need shit.

265
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,574
Yes, the funeral is really
for the people you leave behind...

266
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,454
to help them come to terms...

267
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,374
What if you're not leaving anybody behind?

268
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:32,093
What if your whole fucking life has been
one big waste of time for everybody...

269
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:35,014
- including yourself?
- You don't know that.

270
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:43,131
I'm all for thinning out the human race.
There are just too many fucking people.

271
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:48,496
Anthrax, smallpox. I say bring it on.

272
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:52,612
You'd probably like that, huh?
Good for business.

273
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:57,533
Maybe I should just leave this information
with you and I'll come back later.

274
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,456
Sorry if I'm being antisocial.

275
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:06,775
Sit down.

276
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:17,570
The good rabbi went through all the trouble
of setting this up.

277
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:20,175
Besides, I may not be here tomorrow.

278
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:26,415
- You mind if I ask...
- What I have?

279
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,611
- Pancreatic cancer.
- I'm sorry.

280
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:35,060
It's one of the worst ones you can get.

281
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,133
I did not know that.

282
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:43,692
Yeah. I should be dead already.

283
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:52,937
So this is just gravy time.
It's extra frosting on the cake.

284
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,053
Most people
last up to maybe six months, tops.

285
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:02,293
Me, I've been hanging in here
for over a year.

286
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,337
Can you fucking believe it?

287
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,777
I'll bet you never met anybody
half as lucky as I am.

288
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:14,014
And you pulled this relatively intact
out of the deceased's airway?

289
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,170
That's correct.

290
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,139
What made you decide to look in her throat?

291
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:22,051
I would have gone in there anyway
to swab her out...

292
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:24,132
before I started embalming her.

293
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:28,294
- But I had my suspicions.
- What made you suspicious?

294
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,976
The contusions around her neck.

295
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,097
These contusions could've been made
when they tried to resuscitate her.

296
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,773
They could have.

297
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:41,252
If they tried to resuscitate, why didn't they
find the frankfurter stuck in her airway?

298
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,809
It was stuck pretty far down.

299
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:48,691
Some of these nursing homes aren't exactly
up to speed on their CPR training.

300
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:51,454
She was brought over
from the Bay Breeze Nursing Home?

301
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,940
That's correct.

302
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,412
And who tried to resuscitate her?

303
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,935
Wait a minute. I think I got that.

304
00:23:58,141 --> 00:24:02,100
Dolores Willitts and Vanessa Dial...

305
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:07,057
Diaz. Vanessa Diaz.

306
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,093
She is my wife.

307
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:22,094
- Where is Nikolai?
- He's out on a delivery.

308
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:26,537
Tell him I stopped by, and I come back later.

309
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:30,341
How much money does Nikolai owe you?

310
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:34,052
- Excuse me?
- How much money does Nikolai owe you?

311
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:37,175
- Who are you?
- I'm his friend.

312
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,856
- His lady friend?
- That's right.

313
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,091
It is none of your concern.

314
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:50,770
Tell me how much he owes you,
and I'll pay you the money.

315
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,694
- You will pay me the money?
- Tell me how much it is.

316
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,331
$8<i>7</i>,000.

317
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:01,415
Oh, my.

318
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:06,894
- I had no idea it was that much.
- You don't have that kind of money, do you?

319
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,577
As a matter of fact, I do.

320
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:33,569
- You would do this for Nikolai?
- Please, I'm trying to count.

321
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,772
Nikolai's a lucky man.

322
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:49,259
What is your name?

323
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,901
Ruth Fisher.

324
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:56,700
I would've taken a check, Ruth Fisher.

325
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:46,016
Who's this pretty little girl
who wants to join the party?

326
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,490
Isn't it way past your bedtime, honey?

327
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,613
Brenda, honey.

328
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:55,537
Mommy and Daddy have company,
and you need to go back up to bed now.

329
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,499
<i>Margaret, you're stigmatizing the situation</i>
<i>for her.</i>

330
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:00,853
<i>No, I'm not, Bern.</i>

331
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,777
Keith, you cannot let them take my baby.

332
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:12,939
Karla, they're only as far away as San Diego.

333
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,054
I think it's for the best.

334
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:18,850
There ain't no fucking way it's for the best.
Are you crazy?

335
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,931
Daddy didn't even need an excuse
to smack the shit out of me or you...

336
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:26,616
- and look what that did to us.
- Look what that did to you.

337
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,455
I don't want Taylor growing up
with that shit.

338
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,692
But you don't mind her growing up
with a mother who's a drug addict?

339
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,136
I might be a drug addict,
but I never hurt my child.

340
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,974
That's the way people raised their kids
back then.

341
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:41,292
I'm tired of you blaming everything
gone wrong in your life on Dad.

342
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:45,090
Please. You know how
the slightest little thing would set him off.

343
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:46,933
I think he's changed.

344
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,013
People can change.

345
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:54,975
People don't change.
They just get older, that's all.

346
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:07,337
- David Fisher, how the hell are you?
- Jesus!

347
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,179
Certainly not in any mood
to deal with the likes of you.

348
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:15,856
Honey, you could stand to work on
those manners. Hi, Nate.

349
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:18,250
I understand you boys are being sued.

350
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:20,297
So what, you've come here to gloat?

351
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:24,977
I just wanted you to know we are paying
poor Mrs. Collins' legal fees.

352
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,780
And, honey, we've got awfully deep pockets.

353
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,056
Y'all, this thing is gonna go on forever.

354
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,975
In the end it's gonna drag you boys down,
I can guarantee you that.

355
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:38,054
Now, we are still willing to buy
this little mom-and-pop shop of yours...

356
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,496
at a drastically reduced price, I'm afraid.

357
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:43,698
But I think that if you're smart,
and I'm betting you are...

358
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:47,137
you'll go on and get out
while the getting's still halfway good.

359
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:49,610
I'm curious, Mitzi.
What do you get out of this?

360
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:53,137
I like to win, honey.
It's the way I was brought up.

361
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:56,970
I hope you don't expect me to apologize
for it, because I'm not gonna do it.

362
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,416
I don't expect anything from you.

363
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:01,810
But I wonder, at the day's end,
when you're alone...

364
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:03,971
staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror...

365
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:06,336
do you really like who you see
looking back at you?

366
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,059
I love what I see.

367
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,451
See, I just don't buy that.

368
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:14,698
Because if you did
you wouldn't be doing this.

369
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,139
You know, it's a crying shame...

370
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:21,419
that someone as cute as you has to be
such a goddamn doom-and-gloomer.

371
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,780
You boys think it over
and let me know what you decide.

372
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,931
Personally, I think it's a no-brainer...

373
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,694
but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

374
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,690
- But I don't have the money.
- What do you mean?

375
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:38,375
- Of course you have the money.
- I don't. It's all gone.

376
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:40,850
- Where did it go?
- That's none of your business.

377
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:45,253
Mom, we need that money in order to offer
Mrs. Collins some kind of settlement...

378
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,138
or we're seriously screwed.

379
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:51,055
The only time you tell me what's going on
in your lives is when you need money.

380
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:54,975
If you'd told me about this before,
the money would've been there. It's gone.

381
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,258
- You guys, this is my friend Parker.
- Hi.

382
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:02,336
- We're just gonna be upstairs.
- Bye.

383
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,614
I give up.

384
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:22,939
That was weird. That was totally weird.
Are they always like that?

385
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,575
Always.

386
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:36,735
My God! Your room is so beautiful.

387
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,698
We should do something.
What do you want to do?

388
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,411
I don't know. What do you want to do?

389
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:47,617
What do you feel like doing?

390
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:50,935
- I feel like throwing up.
- Me, too.

391
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:54,140
- Is it normal?
- Totally.

392
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,535
These shrooms are fucking kick-ass.

393
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:02,931
Holy shit, you have a sewing machine?

394
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,216
Yeah, I found it in the attic.

395
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,771
It belonged to my dad's mom.

396
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,300
- Let's make something.
- Do you know how to use it?

397
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:15,054
Yeah. My God, it's so fucking cool.

398
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:20,813
People used to have
to make their own clothes all the time!

399
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:24,496
People used to have to make
their own soap. Can you believe that?

400
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,493
People used to have to kill their own cows
and stuff.

401
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:30,049
I really wish we could've been alive
back then.

402
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,335
Me, too.

403
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:47,658
<i>Hi, it's me. I'm not here,</i>
<i>so talk to the machine.</i>

404
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,135
Thank you for seeing me, Mrs. Collins.

405
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:02,099
I just want to apologize
for the unfortunate incident...

406
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:06,413
that brings us to this unpleasant juncture.

407
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:10,092
My brother is new to this business.

408
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:11,739
He didn't know what he was doing...

409
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,540
when he showed you
your husband's remains.

410
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:16,771
That's not my problem, is it?

411
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:19,819
No, of course not.

412
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:24,499
You were vulnerable
when you asked him to do this...

413
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:27,499
and he shouldn't have.
But, nevertheless, you did ask him.

414
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,219
What's your point?

415
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,772
- What's my point?
- Yeah.

416
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:34,098
Do you even have one?

417
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,611
You know it's not my fault or my brother's...

418
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,898
that you allowed your husband
to smack you around all those years.

419
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:46,973
- That's your problem.
- You've no right to talk about my marriage.

420
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:49,700
You chose to be a doormat,
or a punching bag...

421
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,614
or whatever metaphor for victimhood
you're comfortable with.

422
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:54,817
You stayed in an abusive marriage...

423
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:57,290
and wasted God knows how many years
of your life.

424
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:00,851
Years you'll never get back.
And that makes you furious, doesn't it?

425
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:03,216
You've probably spent
your entire miserable life...

426
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:05,895
blaming other people
for all the mistakes you've made.

427
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:07,733
Now you want us to pay for that?

428
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,813
Jesus, lady, just how fucking low
are you willing to sink?

429
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:14,930
This lawsuit of yours
is gonna cost my family our business!

430
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,613
That's my point!

431
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,770
There. Are you happy?

432
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:26,380
Now get out.

433
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,616
Get the fuck out of my house!

434
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,338
Can you spare a joint?

435
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,413
I love halter-tops.

436
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,053
Are you looking at my tits?

437
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:37,860
I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.

438
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,377
Are you looking at my tits?

439
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,493
My God, I wish I could've lived
during the Renaissance.

440
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:47,856
Those are so fucking beautiful.

441
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:49,933
I love those pants.

442
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:53,220
So when you walk it makes music, right?

443
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:56,411
See, if we live our lives the right way...

444
00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:59,618
then every single thing we do
becomes a work of art...

445
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,931
even the pants we wear...

446
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:05,615
- or just the way we make our bed.
- Wow.

447
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:08,454
That's the whole fucking problem
with the world right now.

448
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,738
It's that we don't try to be creative
with every single thing we do.

449
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:13,459
Martha Stewart does.

450
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:20,859
I thought you might be getting hungry,
so I made you girls some sandwiches.

451
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:22,738
We are so not hungry.

452
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,818
We'll eat them later.

453
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:29,293
All right, then.

454
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,095
I'll come back later to get the tray.

455
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,572
- Mom?
- Yes, dear.

456
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:38,981
Here, I made these pants for you.

457
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,293
Thank you, Claire.

458
00:35:45,261 --> 00:35:46,899
These are lovely.

459
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:50,293
I love you, Mom.

460
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,572
I never tell you how much,
because I'm afraid to for some reason...

461
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:59,098
but right now I want you to know I love you.
I think you're so beautiful.

462
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:01,693
I love you, too.

463
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,492
You don't know my dad, David.

464
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:41,096
He's like a pit bull when he gets his jaw
locked on something. Believe me.

465
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:44,332
What happened to the Keith who fights
for something he believes in?

466
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:48,050
- For something we both believe in?
- This isn't that simple.

467
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:51,930
Are you taking his side 'cause looking
after Taylor is too big a commitment?

468
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,855
No, I'm taking his side because,
for once, I think he's right.

469
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:00,894
You know what I think?

470
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:04,815
I think you're not sure that two gay men
should raise a child.

471
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,971
- That's your shit.
- Then why aren't we fighting for her?

472
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,097
Because they have more time
to spend with her.

473
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:19,412
Please. Your father plays golf all day
and your mom plays with her...

474
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,857
for half-an-hour, tops,
then pops in a video and gets on the phone.

475
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,296
I am not ambivalent about wanting kids.

476
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,815
Then you're ambivalent
about wanting kids with me?

477
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:30,096
Of course not. I just want to be ready.

478
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,093
Life doesn't work that way.
It just dumps things in your lap...

479
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,411
and then you try to make the best of it.

480
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,810
I'm tired of talking about this.

481
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:45,253
You know what this is really about?
You're afraid of him.

482
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:46,569
Fuck you.

483
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,616
As much as I hate you treating me
like a doormat...

484
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,773
it's even worse seeing your father
treat you like one.

485
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:56,978
- You think I treat you like a doormat?
- Sometimes.

486
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,256
Why don't you stand up to him?

487
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,899
I don't think I treat you like a doormat.

488
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,099
Sometimes you do.

489
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:13,860
Go to sleep.

490
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,616
We both have to get up early.

491
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:34,131
Okay, you guys need to go now.

492
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:39,694
Okay, then.

493
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,332
Can I have your number?

494
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:50,173
Why? So we can date?

495
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,176
Late.

496
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:23,812
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

497
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,012
How did it go with the police?

498
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:31,138
How do you think it went?
They kept us there all night.

499
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:34,019
They didn't even talk to us
until about an hour ago.

500
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:35,853
At least they didn't arrest you.

501
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,138
Do you think I could shove a hot dog
down some old lady's throat?

502
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:42,293
No, of course not.

503
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:46,135
But you could have noticed it was there.

504
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:51,336
You know who they think did it?

505
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:53,696
The roommate, Ramona Kippleman.

506
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:58,060
But that old bitch is smart.
She's not saying anything to them.

507
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:00,616
- So that's that?
- Yeah.

508
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:03,613
Except now, thanks to you, I'm out of a job.

509
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,295
- What?
- They fired Dolores and me for negligence.

510
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:08,690
They had to hang it on somebody.

511
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:12,852
What was I supposed to do?

512
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:15,296
Hide a murder
so you could keep some shitty job?

513
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,258
Of course not, Rico...

514
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:20,697
but now I have to go out
and find another shitty job.

515
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,131
You got Julio off to school?

516
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:32,660
- Yeah.
- And where's Augusto?

517
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:36,213
He's taking a nap.

518
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:44,497
I'm gonna try and get some sleep
before he wakes up.

519
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:59,057
Where's your friend Parker?

520
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,090
My God, those are so hideous.

521
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:05,376
They're not hideous in the least.

522
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:08,259
I like them. And do you want to know why?

523
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:12,209
Because my daughter,
whom I love very much, made them for me.

524
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:15,219
Look, that wasn't me. It was somebody else.

525
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:18,698
I may just wear these pants
until the day I die.

526
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,260
Please don't.

527
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,889
God. What made me ever think
I could be an artist?

528
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,178
Here, this is for you.

529
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:30,457
I don't know why I bother.

530
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,415
I think you have real talent, Claire.

531
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:39,133
But go ahead and throw it away,
if that's what you're set on doing.

532
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:58,812
Taylor, would you go to your room?
I need to speak to your grandparents.

533
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:01,014
Yeah, sure.

534
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:09,779
David and I talked it over and decided
Taylor will stay with us for now.

535
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,375
At least until the school year's up.

536
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:14,533
The hell you say.

537
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:16,896
- Keith...
- Stay out of this, Mom.

538
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:21,252
That child is coming home...

539
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:24,100
with me and your mother.

540
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:27,489
Taylor's staying with me and David,
and that's final.

541
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:29,014
- You...
- Do it.

542
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,134
I dare you.

543
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:57,017
I was handling situation...

544
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:59,853
you stupid woman.

545
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:04,175
- You have no right to talk to me this way.
- You have no right!

546
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:07,692
Christ Almighty...

547
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,371
What's going on?

548
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:17,897
Nikolai owed someone some money,
and I paid them back.

549
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:22,291
- What?
- You can't try to fix others' problems...

550
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:24,576
without them asking, cupcake.

551
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:27,934
You're too co-ey. That's your problem.

552
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:29,818
- "Co-ey?"
- Codependent.

553
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,334
I know what it means.

554
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:33,651
And you know something, Robbie?
I hate that word.

555
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,891
That word is totally inappropriate here.

556
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:40,054
I am a mother. I have a family.
Family members depend on one another.

557
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:44,100
You can't be intimate with someone
and not be dependant on them.

558
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:47,896
I wasn't aware Nikolai was a member
of your family.

559
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,771
I feel so bad about treating my mother
like shit all the time.

560
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:01,179
What makes you think
you treat her like shit?

561
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:06,018
I made her these pants,
harlequin pants with bells on them.

562
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,296
My God, they're so queer.

563
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:10,856
And she's actually wearing them.

564
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:17,291
She means well.
She's just so clueless and...

565
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,257
I don't know, embarrassing.

566
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,260
Everyone's embarrassed by their parents.

567
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,856
Where's the picture of you
and what's-her-name?

568
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,100
We broke up.

569
00:44:35,541 --> 00:44:37,418
You guys looked so happy.

570
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:40,857
I mean, in the photo
she always looked really happy.

571
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:44,497
I just assumed you were...

572
00:44:45,381 --> 00:44:48,691
- in it for keeps.
- Well, we weren't.

573
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,133
What time is it?

574
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,018
We still have about 10 minutes.

575
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:02,571
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

576
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,370
No.

577
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:07,216
Is there something you want me
to talk about?

578
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:09,610
No, not really.

579
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:14,939
I've got some Psych homework
I could be doing.

580
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:19,894
So, see you.

581
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:43,454
Would you like me to make you
something to eat?

582
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,894
No, thanks.

583
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:50,732
Have you made any definite plans
for the wedding?

584
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:54,370
To be honest, there might not be a wedding.

585
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,053
Really and truly?

586
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,054
- Really and truly.
- What did she do?

587
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,738
It's not something Brenda did.
It's something I did.

588
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:08,255
Maybe it's for the best.

589
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:11,289
Or maybe it's not for the best.
Maybe it just is.

590
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:13,849
And now I just have to live with it.

591
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:20,858
Are you sure you wouldn't like me
to make you something to eat?

592
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:26,297
A grilled cheese sandwich?

593
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:57,695
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:03,453
I tried calling you.

595
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:15,531
People make mistakes, Nate.

596
00:47:18,141 --> 00:47:21,577
They don't always know
why they do the things they do.

597
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:26,100
You don't love this Lisa chick, do you?

598
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,212
- No.
- Good.

599
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:34,057
Because I still love you.

600
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:40,018
And I can't lose you.

601
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:43,340
I can't.

602
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:47,219
I need you, Nate.

603
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:55,937
As fucked up as you are...

604
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,855
you are the sanest thing in my life.

605
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:03,373
- Let's work this out together, okay?
- Okay.

606
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,260
I love you.

607
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:24,258
English
