1
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,401
I just remembered, I owe you money.

2
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:49,270
Well, thank you for sparing me
the awkward confrontation.

3
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,951
- Are you starting to feel exploited?
- Yeah, but in a good way.

4
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,626
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

5
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:03,271
- Are you looking at my balance?
- It's okay. Size isn't everything.

6
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,431
Funny.

7
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,304
So does bad music make people deaf...

8
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,942
...or do deaf people have
really bad taste in music?

9
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,586
Well, there is Beethoven.

10
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,061
- Come on, let's go.
- What the fuck is that shit?

11
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,299
- Hurry.
- My receipt.

12
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,347
- Come on, that's all right, just...
- Look, it's all yours.

13
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,097
Do you think you can do
that kind of offensive shit in public?

14
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:27,821
- We're sorry, man, we didn't...
- Oh, he's sorry, huh?

15
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,294
Look, Pete, let's go.

16
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,261
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you!

17
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:37,494
Fuck! Run!

18
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,612
Help!

19
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,850
The other one got away.

20
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,249
Fucking freak!

21
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:57,287
Fucking pervert!
Read a Bible, you pervert!

22
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:02,011
Johnny, come on. Come on,
let's go. Come on.

23
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,237
Okay, here we go with Uncle Nate.

24
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,197
- You got him?
- Just about.

25
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:25,032
- Put your hand under there. There we go.
- All right, I got him. I got him.

26
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:27,631
Okay, but don't hold him
like he's a football.

27
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,112
It's more like you're carrying
a watermelon.

28
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,436
- All right.
- See?

29
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:34,517
- Okay.
- Adjust, adjust, adjust. There you go.

30
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,796
Hey, there, little guy.
Who looks just like his daddy, huh?

31
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:42,113
When a baby's born
it always looks more like its father...

32
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,909
...which is nature's way
of establishing paternity.

33
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,713
We're hoping he grows out of it.

34
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,782
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he will.
Oh, yes, yes.

35
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,148
David, come meet Augusto.

36
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:57,542
I just have to get Mr. Perlmutter
dressed for his viewing.

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,785
David, please, come take
one look at him.

38
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,544
Nate was an extremely gassy baby,
always crying.

39
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:07,495
David, on the other hand,
hardly ever made a peep.

40
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:12,897
When are you guys gonna grow up
and make this woman a grandmommy?

41
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:20,575
Well, certainly not until after
Mr. Perlmutter's got some clothes on.

42
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:40,365
You know, it's kind of funny,
me coming back to school in a hearse.

43
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,847
It's hilarious.

44
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,607
This sucks.

45
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,006
Does everybody know?

46
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,676
I don't know. Who'd you tell?

47
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:59,483
No, I mean, like, did they make
an announcement or something?

48
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:03,802
Don't you think you would've gotten,
like, a couple of cards if they had?

49
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,675
No.

50
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:08,999
It's not cool to OD.
Freaks people out.

51
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,920
Who gives a fuck what
these people think?

52
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,793
Everyone's too obsessed with
what people think about them...

53
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,751
...to think about anyone else.

54
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,790
You're a freak.

55
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:23,226
Yeah, well, so are you.

56
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,663
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

57
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,546
- That's the guy who OD'd.
- Yeah, it is.

58
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,830
What the fuck are you looking at?

59
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,055
What, you called me over here to show
me a picture of you and the gravedigger?

60
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,661
I need your key back,
because you've crossed a line...

61
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:51,141
...and I don't feel like
I can trust you anymore.

62
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:58,251
- You think I took that picture?
- I will not play this game with you!

63
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,090
I won't deal with you
when you're off your meds...

64
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,250
...because I don't even know
who you are.

65
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,848
For someone with so much animosity
towards the psychiatric profession...

66
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,968
...you sure love to push pharmaceuticals.

67
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,929
Makes sense, as you're no stranger
to medication yourself.

68
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,968
You're sick, Billy. You have to
stay on your medication...

69
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:19,972
...or you get scary, okay?

70
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,247
You're not scared of me.

71
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,807
I'd never hurt you. You're the most
important person in my life.

72
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,803
Yeah, well, did you ever stop to think
that maybe that's fucked up?

73
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:39,200
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Just...

74
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,318
Just take the meds.

75
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:46,312
Okay. I promise.

76
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,632
Now give me the key.

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,149
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda.

78
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:58,828
I just... I just told you I'd take
the medication!

79
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,985
Jesus Christ, you don't have to be such
a bitch! When did you turn into Mom?

80
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:10,631
Okay. I don't give a shit.
You want your fucking key?

81
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,630
Great. Here, take all the fucking keys.

82
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,583
I could have an extra copy at home.

83
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,020
Yeah, I could always change the locks.

84
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,420
Do you know how easy it would be
to break into this place?

85
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,616
I'd like you to go now.

86
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:29,978
Get your wet suit, clothing, robes.
Take them.

87
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,572
I just told you I'd take
the medication, Brenda!

88
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:42,774
I told you I would take
the medication, please.

89
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,332
You have to take care of yourself now.
I can't do it, not anymore.

90
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,971
Please, Brenda, you're the only person
I can talk to.

91
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:54,013
You're the only one that hears me.

92
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:57,969
Billy, you have to get a life
of your own, okay?

93
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,883
Please.

94
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,121
You probably read about it.
It was on the news...

95
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:22,361
...what happened to Marc.

96
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,520
Yes.

97
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:31,160
The coroner still has his...
They still have him.

98
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:36,397
In situations like this,
when there's been violence...

99
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,874
...the family may prefer
a closed casket.

100
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,506
- No.
- Honey, I think he looks pretty bad.

101
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:46,070
I have to see him.

102
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:54,464
I brought some pictures,
so you'll know what he looks like.

103
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,546
Wasn't he such a beautiful boy?

104
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:10,061
Why does a thing like this happen?

105
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,893
Come on, now, we all know
why this happened.

106
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,254
That is not a reason.

107
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:20,171
It's the only reason.

108
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,451
If he wasn't...

109
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,856
He'd be alive today.

110
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,608
You know, I was always
so worried about AIDS.

111
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:37,167
I never even thought that just being
out on the street...

112
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,285
What is wrong with people?

113
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,893
Could've told him this happens.

114
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:46,449
I would've too if he'd ever just
talked to us about it, ever come out...

115
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,963
...and told us what he was.
- Well, what do you expect, Marcus?

116
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:54,046
You can't even say it.

117
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,351
Hey, Dave.

118
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,915
I'll be right with you.

119
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:23,111
Okay, okay.

120
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:27,864
- Jesus.
- Oh, boy.

121
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:29,149
Okay, Cinderella...

122
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:32,504
...we're gonna have to work overtime
to get you ready for the ball...

123
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:37,102
...because men don't make passes
at girls with big gashes.

124
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:41,338
That was funny, right?
Daddy's Mr. Funnyman.

125
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:46,144
Let me just run Augusto upstairs,
and I'll be right back down to do him.

126
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:50,459
I can handle this, Federico. Why don't
you take the rest of the day off?

127
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,502
That's a pretty tough job, Dave.

128
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:54,262
The skull's all shattered up there.

129
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:56,738
You might have to rebuild
the tissue on his cheek.

130
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,661
I can do it.

131
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,850
Hey, thanks, man.

132
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,449
I'm so damn tired I can barely
see straight.

133
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,453
- Get some rest.
- You bet. Good luck.

134
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:14,286
Let's go, buddy. Let's go, buddy.
Let's go.

135
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:20,083
And I told him not to come around
for a while.

136
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:24,530
- That's it?
- Oh, what else could I do, Nate?

137
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:27,723
You could talk to the police.
You could get a restraining order.

138
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:31,803
I don't need you to tell me how to handle
this. That is so arrogant and patronizing.

139
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,727
I just need you to listen to me.

140
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,919
You can't just wait for the next
fucked-up thing Billy does.

141
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,594
You need to do something now.

142
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:43,322
Do you think that was easy for me,
just cutting him off like that?

143
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,316
Do you even comprehend
what it's like...

144
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:48,321
...to be responsible
for someone your whole life?

145
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:52,799
Do you even get the concept
of loving somebody that much?

146
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:56,437
Yes, I get that concept.

147
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,916
He's sick.

148
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,506
He's not just sick, he's dangerous.

149
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:10,627
He built a bomb. He broke into our hotel
room and took pictures of us in bed.

150
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:14,223
- What's he gonna do next time?
- I took his key away from him.

151
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:18,060
Yeah, well, he didn't have a key
in Vegas. That didn't keep him out.

152
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,508
I'm sorry. I know you don't trust
your parents...

153
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,587
...but I really think they're right on this.
He needs to be somewhere.

154
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:36,254
This is so not how I need you
to be right now.

155
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:45,094
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna discuss this with you.

156
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,258
In fact, you know what?
Why don't we just take some time off?

157
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,972
You dump Billy,
so now you're gonna dump me?

158
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:54,776
Don't you fucking analyze me!

159
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,044
You might as well throw away your key,
because I changed the lock.

160
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:14,880
Where's Claire?

161
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:18,875
Well, she claims to be at a movie,
but what do I know?

162
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:22,361
Nobody ever tells me
what's really going on.

163
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:29,994
That boy who got beat up
on the street...

164
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,993
...was he doing something?

165
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,668
He was getting cash.
Didn't you read the paper?

166
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,154
Yes, I just thought you might
know more about it.

167
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,434
Do you like the hen?

168
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,986
Yeah, very much.
What did you stuff it with?

169
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,025
Chestnuts, bread crumbs, celery.

170
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:55,630
Do you wanna know
all the ingredients?

171
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:59,142
No, thanks.

172
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,180
Are you going out tonight?

173
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,822
No, not tonight.

174
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:08,945
Are you?

175
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:12,139
Me? No.

176
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,173
But, you know...

177
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:20,057
...sometimes I do see Hiram
on occasion.

178
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,900
And I know you don't like that...

179
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,817
...but I also know you love me
no matter who I see in my private life.

180
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,330
Well, that's good, Mom.

181
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,844
Why'd you drop jazz vocals
sophomore year?

182
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,520
Because the music teacher
was a crackhead.

183
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,363
I'm serious, Claire.

184
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:58,038
So am I. He got busted and fired,
and then jazz vocals was discontinued.

185
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,601
Do your homework.

186
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,914
What happened
with the literary magazine?

187
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:10,552
Censorship. I wrote this totally,
like, harmless...

188
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:14,959
...like, cartoon story about this girl
who can make people's heads explode...

189
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,629
...and apparently it was
too disturbing to publish.

190
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,791
The debate team?

191
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:23,232
They debated what the prom theme
should be.

192
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:28,306
I mean, God, the people in this school,
they have the mentality of teenagers.

193
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,704
- You are a teenager.
- Yes...

194
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,990
...but I actually think about things
beside trying to figure out...

195
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:37,389
...how to puke after lunch
without anyone noticing.

196
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,903
So, what do you do for fun?

197
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,740
I don't know. What do you do for fun?

198
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:51,942
I go bowling with my friends.
I take hikes with my girlfriend.

199
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:55,103
- I bake.
- You bake?

200
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,143
Your turn.

201
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,297
I read.

202
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:06,540
I go online and make up
freaky cyber identities.

203
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,537
You know, sometimes
I'm a Scientologist.

204
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,694
Sometimes I'm a young, Christian wife.

205
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:16,887
What about friendships that are
based on the truth? Any of those?

206
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:24,322
Sometimes I hang out with
Parker McKenna. I kind of like her...

207
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,490
...even though she's pretty much
a split-personality freak.

208
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,360
Dating anyone?

209
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,757
Dating? You mean, like,
getting drunk and screwing?

210
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,281
- Lf that's what it is.
- Yeah, that's what it is. No, I'm not.

211
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,197
Keith, got a minute?

212
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,122
Yeah, sure. What's up?

213
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:51,712
I wanna put you on security
for the Marc Foster funeral on Thursday.

214
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,673
Okay, why?

215
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,711
The wackos turn out for these things.

216
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,708
- Why me?
- Come on, Keith.

217
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,113
You're a good, smart cop,
and you use your head...

218
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,036
...before you use your gun, all right?

219
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:08,474
So it has nothing to do with the fact
that I'm gay, right?

220
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,069
What do you wanna do,
sue me for discrimination...

221
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,946
...or show up and protect
this kid's family?

222
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,387
Oh, God, I look like something
Chef Boyardee makes.

223
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,499
So you never told your parents
you were gay either?

224
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,583
Oh, please, they knew.

225
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:36,777
I just didn't want my dad making me
feel guilty about it all the time.

226
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:40,498
Maybe he could've accepted it
if you'd given him a chance.

227
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:44,899
You heard him.
He thinks it's my fault I'm dead.

228
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:48,092
That's not what he was saying.
He was saying it's a sick world.

229
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,370
- I'm the one who was sick.
- Shut up.

230
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:56,092
So I liked men.
I never should've given in to it.

231
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:58,490
It's not what God intended.

232
00:17:58,695 --> 00:18:01,891
I could've had a family and a normal life.
You could've too.

233
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:05,489
That life would've been a lie and
unfair to your wife and children...

234
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,569
...who would've hated you.

235
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:10,729
Not if I never looked back.

236
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,881
Not if I had faith.

237
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,364
God challenges us like this,
so we'll choose good...

238
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:19,758
...so we'll triumph over evil.

239
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,321
Only thing is, so few of us do.

240
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,120
It's not a choice.
God already made the choice for you.

241
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:33,238
That's just liberal propaganda
to justify your own depravity, Jim.

242
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:40,474
No matter how nice you fix me up,
I'm still going to hell, and you know it...

243
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,635
...because you're going there too.

244
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,339
Brenda, pick up the phone.

245
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,700
Don't just lay there and say, "Fuck you."

246
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:10,257
Okay, I'm sorry I pissed you off.
I know you're under a lot of pressure...

247
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,138
...but so am I.

248
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,336
So let's talk about it, okay?

249
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,614
Call me.

250
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,690
Hey.

251
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,008
Yes, this is Fisher & Sons.
Can I help you?

252
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,092
I'm terribly sorry.

253
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,247
Yes, we can pick up the body...
The deceased.

254
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,490
Which morgue?

255
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:46,491
A residence, okay.
What's the address?

256
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,479
- Robbie?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did my tree hit you?

257
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:59,959
- Do you have a moment?
- Well, I don't know, Ruth.

258
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,839
I got a whole big bunch of ferns
out back I gotta cut up...

259
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:06,753
...so you can make some more of those
beautiful, one-of-a-kind arrangements.

260
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:10,713
How did you tell your parents
you were...

261
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,640
Into flowers?

262
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:17,868
Well, it was obvious from the beginning.
My first word was "perennial."

263
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,075
How did you tell them you were gay?

264
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,308
What makes you think I am gay?

265
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,507
Just because I have
a refined aesthetic...

266
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:30,275
...you make assumptions
about my personal life?

267
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,103
I'm so sorry. You're not gay?

268
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,662
Yes, I'm gay.

269
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,105
But I certainly don't see
how that's any of your business.

270
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,910
Do I ask you about
your intimate sexual life...

271
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,784
...even though it is on full display
in the workplace? No, I do not.

272
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:49,417
I tolerate the repercussions,
but I don't pry.

273
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:52,823
I'm sorry. I'm asking because my son...

274
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:58,576
Oh, dear Lord, save it for Geraldo.

275
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,820
Someone in the family shows signs
of homosexuality...

276
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:05,900
...and suddenly it's a national crisis.
Coming out to my parents.

277
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:11,934
Honestly, why don't you tell me the most
horrible moment from your intimate past?

278
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:18,206
- It was horrible?
- It's none of your business.

279
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,532
I'm sorry I offended you, Robbie.

280
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:31,640
That is a shitty place for the lily.

281
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:39,761
Mr. Jacoby?

282
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,189
Oh, fuck.

283
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,793
Jesus, Billy, you fucking psycho.

284
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,743
Did I get you?

285
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:14,416
Come on, man, it's paint.
Why aren't you laughing?

286
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:15,944
I don't think it's funny.

287
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:17,822
Oh, no, it's just plain fun.

288
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:21,618
You know, if you mix up the letters
in "funeral," you get "real fun."

289
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:24,092
How much do you love that?

290
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,055
You stay away from my sister.
She's just a kid.

291
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,290
Now, that's kind of ironic,
don't you think? You telling me that.

292
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:42,884
What'd they tell you?

293
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,486
They tell you I made a bomb?

294
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,122
They tell you who it was for?

295
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,479
I know you wrote things
about your family.

296
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,878
Liar!

297
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:02,366
Don't fucking lie to me.

298
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,998
He thought he was such a genius,
everybody thought.

299
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,798
He even had Brenda fooled,
which blows my mind.

300
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,563
Well, okay, she was young.

301
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,238
- Are you talking about Dr. Feinberg?
- No, Trevor, you fucking moron.

302
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:20,672
Trevor. Perfect fucking Trevor.

303
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,795
He thought he was the king of Brenda,
which is such adolescent shit...

304
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:28,784
...as if you could know somebody for a
few months and replace their whole life.

305
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,350
Their family.

306
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:34,826
Brenda's not allowed to love anyone
as much as she loves you?

307
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,143
Able.

308
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,267
She's not able.

309
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:45,109
You know what? You're right.

310
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,585
Bren never even told me about Trevor.
She doesn't trust me.

311
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,378
You don't get to call her that.

312
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,338
You call her Brenda.

313
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:58,582
You know, she broke up with me today.

314
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,140
- Really?
- Yeah. Took away my key.

315
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,169
Well, it's probably for the best.

316
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:31,570
You and Brenda was never a good idea.

317
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,849
Yeah, tell me about it.

318
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,645
Listen, I gotta go, so you take care.

319
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,109
Hey.

320
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,873
Hey.

321
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,636
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, just...

322
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,072
...give me a second to recover.

323
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,345
Still bad, huh?

324
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:17,547
It's just fucking tiring
trying to act normal all day.

325
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:20,027
I know what you mean.

326
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:26,498
So, what's the stupidest thing
anyone's said to you today?

327
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,257
Packy Walker told me that he once
had to get his stomach pumped...

328
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:37,140
...because he ate his dog's
deworming pills.

329
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:40,097
He thought they were ludes.

330
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:44,532
Well, isn't it comforting to know
that being miserable...

331
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:47,494
...is still better than being an idiot?

332
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,800
All right.

333
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,122
You wanna hear the most horrible
moment from my intimate past?

334
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,842
No, sister, I do not.

335
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:25,522
I was married to my husband
for 30 years.

336
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:31,195
I never slept with another man until I
started having sex with my hairdresser.

337
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:44,233
And the first time my hairdresser
friend and I had intercourse...

338
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:48,225
...he asked me to pleasure
myself, so he would know...

339
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,825
...you know, how I did that.

340
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:57,187
And I couldn't.

341
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:02,384
Because I had never pleasured
myself in my life.

342
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,868
I was 52 years old.

343
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,906
And I had to learn how to...

344
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:11,865
Masturbate.

345
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:14,142
From a hairdresser.

346
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:17,983
Oh, my.

347
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,020
Oh, my.

348
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:28,500
Well, Ruth, thank you for sharing that.

349
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:33,011
But I'm still not gonna tell you
about coming out to my parents.

350
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:37,449
- Why not?
- Because I never did, cupcake.

351
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,211
My daddy would've never spoken
another word to me...

352
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:44,009
...and my mother would've just gone
insane, right there on the spot.

353
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:45,763
How do you know?

354
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:50,085
A child knows what his parents
need him to be.

355
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:54,602
My mother is one of those women that
never did anything but raise children.

356
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,607
So, if you came out wrong,
like the opposite...

357
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,686
...of what she was trying to make
you into, then, you know...

358
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:03,765
...her whole life is a failure.

359
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm not like that.

360
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:16,273
Did he ever actually threaten you?

361
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,278
Telling the new boyfriend you wanted
the old boyfriend dead...

362
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,154
...while you're playing with a knife.
Yeah, that seems like a threat to me.

363
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:35,068
How come you never told me
about Trevor?

364
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,468
It's such ancient history.

365
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:40,186
You said you'd never been
serious about anyone.

366
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:43,144
I was 18.

367
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:47,378
- Did you love him?
- Yes.

368
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:49,943
So, what happened?

369
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:52,785
Billy got sick.

370
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:54,977
Trevor went to Yale without me.

371
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,938
Billy got rid of him
because he was jealous.

372
00:30:58,185 --> 00:31:02,495
Everyone was jealous of Trevor.
He was ridiculously gifted...

373
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:04,932
...one of those people everybody
secretly hates...

374
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:10,095
...because he's good at everything
and always gets what he wants.

375
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,968
- Well, he didn't get you.
- Oh, please. He could do better.

376
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:20,170
He did, actually. The woman he married
won the National Book Award last year.

377
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,612
You know, you're
ridiculously gifted too.

378
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:27,810
You could be one of those people
who has everything.

379
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:41,877
If you don't wanna deal with this,
I might have to wanna call your parents.

380
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,237
Well, you might have to wanna call
my parents...

381
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,118
...but unfortunately, they're
in South Africa at the moment.

382
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,401
I have absolutely no idea
how to contact them.

383
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,993
Would you stop fucking around?

384
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:54,791
I love you, and I'm sure
whatever you feel about me...

385
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:56,754
...you don't wanna see me dead.

386
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,913
Are you okay?

387
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:10,552
No.

388
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:13,708
Do you want me to take you
to a doctor?

389
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,709
What, now you think I'm crazy too?

390
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:20,908
No, no.

391
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:25,747
Goddamn it, why are you
shutting me out?

392
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,624
I just wanna be alone, okay?

393
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:35,378
I just wanna go to sleep.

394
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:41,583
Well, good night.

395
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,476
Why didn't you tell me about
your relationship with Gabriel Dimas?

396
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:37,241
I guess I just wasn't in the mood
for a lecture on inappropriate friends.

397
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,073
What makes you think I'd do that?

398
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:43,272
Well, some people don't think
he's the greatest influence.

399
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,946
And what do you think?

400
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,072
I think that I'm as much of an influence
on him as he is on me...

401
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:53,665
...so it's not like it only goes one way.

402
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,273
Right.

403
00:33:55,474 --> 00:34:00,546
Relating to another person is a way
that we relate to a part of ourselves.

404
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,385
It's like, he's, like, an extreme version
of me, you know?

405
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,341
I can see that.

406
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:15,655
But what he's going through,
it's so much more.

407
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:18,857
But I understand, you know?

408
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:24,421
Feeling like you've got this shadow
over you all the time.

409
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:28,536
What's your shadow?

410
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:35,531
Death, I guess.

411
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,729
Death and silence.

412
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:44,566
Is that crazy?

413
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,327
What's the silence?

414
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:53,926
I don't know.
It's, like, sadness...

415
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,317
...or fear, maybe.

416
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,237
It's, like, you know, everybody's
so scared...

417
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:04,280
...that they're gonna say
the wrong thing...

418
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,558
...because, like, you know,
when you bury someone...

419
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,836
...that's, like, the most sensitive time
in a person's life.

420
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:14,433
So it's, like, my family,
they're just so careful.

421
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:17,997
It's like they almost become invisible.

422
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,389
That was heavy.

423
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:34,193
What's going on?

424
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:38,309
Nothing. I'm just being a freak.

425
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,184
You don't have to be afraid
that you'll say the wrong thing.

426
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,382
That's just it. I'm not.

427
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,817
I mean, I do say the wrong thing.

428
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:54,019
But, it's, like, this is gonna
sound stupid...

429
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:57,019
...but, like, I talk so much shit
all the time, you know.

430
00:35:57,226 --> 00:36:03,492
And that's just another way
to not say...

431
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:06,172
Whatever.

432
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:09,051
To not say what?

433
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:20,090
I'm not here for the school
or for your mom.

434
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,976
I'm just here for you.

435
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:27,564
This is confidential, right?

436
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,087
Gabe didn't OD by accident.

437
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:44,879
He did it on purpose, I think.

438
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:48,402
Well, most ODs aren't really
just accidents.

439
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,993
Right, so, what can I do
as the friend of a person...

440
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:52,796
...who would do something like that?

441
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:58,315
Like, I know all the "I can't save him"
stuff, and I went to the websites.

442
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:04,469
And it's all, like, what you can't do.
So, what can I do?

443
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,637
Try not to make yourself invisible.

444
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,589
This isn't about me.

445
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:12,232
That's not a very good start, is it?

446
00:37:22,512 --> 00:37:25,662
At least my tie can be straight, right?

447
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,579
You should've left me
the way I was.

448
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,098
Let the world see me
for who I really am...

449
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:35,059
...an abomination of nature.

450
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:37,342
Shut up.

451
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:40,180
Who you are is nothing
to be ashamed of.

452
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,739
That's a little hard to buy,
coming from somebody...

453
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:47,777
...who cruises for dick on the Internet
and has unsafe sex with prostitutes.

454
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:50,176
They made a shrine at the place
where you died...

455
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:53,928
...with pictures of you and flowers.

456
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:56,892
People go there and hold candles
in your honor.

457
00:37:57,098 --> 00:38:00,373
- What people?
- Your friends, your community.

458
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:02,771
Bleeding-heart faggots
with nothing better to do.

459
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:06,684
Guys who fucked me when they were
drunk and then never called me back.

460
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,447
There are people who love you.

461
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:11,650
But not as many as hate me...

462
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:14,446
...and you.

463
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,765
Nice job.

464
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:28,163
Man, that is the best work
you've ever done, David.

465
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:33,643
- Thanks.
- Nice, very nice.

466
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:42,755
Hey, there's, like, 200 homos
outside. Oh, shit.

467
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,757
Already? It's only a quarter of.

468
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:50,155
You'd think the family wouldn't want
all of that coming in here, you know?

469
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,948
All of what?

470
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:56,154
There's this one guy,
he's dressed like Jackie Kennedy.

471
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:59,908
You think this guy's mother
really needs to see that today?

472
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:04,868
How'd you get those abrasions
on his cheek so smooth-looking?

473
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:08,506
I used diaper rash cream.
You left some.

474
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:15,019
You know, Rico, I'm a homo.

475
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:22,216
I may not dress like Jackie Kennedy,
but I have sex with men.

476
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:35,652
Don't... Don't talk to me
about that. All right?

477
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:39,527
Why should I hide it from you? You
change your baby's diaper in my house.

478
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,529
You show me a videotape
of your wife giving birth.

479
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:45,249
Where I come from...

480
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:49,446
...if men need to do that sometimes...

481
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,212
...they don't talk about it.

482
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:54,721
They don't leave their families.
They're men.

483
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,200
I am a man!

484
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:08,119
So I took the height of tree A and
divided it by the length of shadow B.

485
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:12,681
So do you see how I got
to tangent C?

486
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,035
Since when were you such a trig bitch?

487
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:20,438
Don't get me wrong.
I know it's totally pointless.

488
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:24,235
Just somehow, teaching you
makes it seem more interesting.

489
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,872
It must be the power.

490
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:32,991
Well, you are...

491
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:37,187
...a very stimulating teacher.

492
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:43,987
I love your grasp of the material.

493
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,618
Well, maybe we should grasp
the next one.

494
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,979
Which one?

495
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:53,983
Number five.

496
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,062
Come on.

497
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:11,616
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

498
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:14,209
Allergies.

499
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,853
Hey, come on.

500
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:23,571
I'm scared.

501
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,048
It's okay.

502
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,246
I'm scared too.

503
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:37,761
I'm scared you're gonna disappear.

504
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,359
I'm not gonna disappear.

505
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,960
What are you scared of?

506
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:58,281
I'm scared I'm not gonna finish
my math homework.

507
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,156
Hey, I told you.

508
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:10,667
I'm scared that you...

509
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:12,310
...are too good for me.

510
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,344
Oh, you're crazy.

511
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:27,988
I finally find a woman I wanna commit to,
and she makes it totally impossible.

512
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,067
You think that's a coincidence?

513
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:33,782
What is that supposed to mean?

514
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:37,535
Maybe if she made it easier,
you wouldn't be so eager.

515
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:42,533
I need more garlic.

516
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:46,823
You've always been bored
with the girls you could have...

517
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,741
...and fascinated with
the ones you couldn't.

518
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:54,213
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?

519
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:06,608
Your brother's gay, isn't he?

520
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:12,165
I think that's a question for him.

521
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:14,932
Has he told you?

522
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,045
No, he has not told me.

523
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:20,083
But it's obvious. Everyone knows.

524
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,718
Am I supposed to say something?
I tried to discuss it. He wouldn't let me.

525
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:25,679
I guess he doesn't wanna talk about it.

526
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:28,036
It's not good for him
to skulk around like that.

527
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:30,157
He's very tense. It's not good for him.

528
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:32,958
- Breathe, Mom.
- I know how to breathe!

529
00:43:33,164 --> 00:43:37,713
I don't appreciate you blaming me for
all your problems, thank you very much.

530
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:42,309
Your carrots are burning.

531
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,348
Haven 't you seen a little girl
called Bunny?

532
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:49,147
- About your age,
- No,

533
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:51,234
- A new girl,
- No,

534
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:52,835
With a dress, just like yours,

535
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:56,710
Look, there's no point
in questioning the children,

536
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,787
What are you doing here?

537
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:18,700
I know what to do.

538
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:20,744
I know how to fix it.

539
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:23,498
Yeah? Fix what?

540
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,701
Oh, it was a big mistake.

541
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:29,697
But I'm gonna fix it, okay?

542
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:33,014
Oh, my God, Billy, what have you...?

543
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,017
- Did you hurt him?
- No, no, no, I fixed it.

544
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,731
- Oh, God.
- See, I can't be him anymore.

545
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:43,575
He's somebody else now.
I did it for you.

546
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:45,806
Now we can bury him.
And the best part is...

547
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:48,608
...now the nurse won't
ever be able to find him.

548
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:50,610
You've lost a lot of blood.

549
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,202
- Let me get a towel.
- We just have to get yours now.

550
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:59,524
This way, you'll be safe from her too
for the first time.

551
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,243
Then we can bury them,
and you and I can be new people.

552
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,598
And we can forget about everything
bad that they wrote.

553
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:08,684
I don't want us to be new people.

554
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,877
I like us the way we are.

555
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:15,158
Well, I already did it, Brenda,
so you have to do it too.

556
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:18,758
Okay.

557
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,359
Give me the knife.

558
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:25,514
- I wanna do it.
- No, you did yours. I should do mine.

559
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:27,596
Nathaniel saved Isabel on the sailboat.

560
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:29,311
It's a book. It's fiction.

561
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,395
He saved her for the first time.
She always saved him before.

562
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:36,144
Nathaniel and Isabel are not real.

563
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:46,866
I need to do it.

564
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,743
Billy, get off!

565
00:45:56,147 --> 00:45:57,296
Billy, get off me!

566
00:46:00,266 --> 00:46:02,301
I'm warning you. This is gonna hurt.

567
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:13,134
Yes, hello. I need an ambulance.

568
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,516
- It's in the Bible.
- Your son's burning in hell.

569
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:11,113
- God hates fags.
- God hates morons.

570
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:14,467
- The wages of sin is death and AIDS.
- Amen.

571
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:17,271
You leave these people alone,
or so help me...

572
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:19,430
- It's my right to be here.
- This is America.

573
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:23,790
It's my right to tell the truth. God killed
Marc Foster, and I'm here to celebrate.

574
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:28,465
God just shoved your stomach into
your lungs, and I'm here to celebrate!

575
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,906
- Look, God just got you in the face.
- What's wrong with you?

576
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:34,866
He started it.

577
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:37,137
- You all right?
- That man ought to be arrested.

578
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:40,543
- We'll take care of it. Watch yourself.
- I demand that man be arrested!

579
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:44,214
This is a funeral. Show some respect.

580
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:49,417
- What happened? Did something happen?
- No, nothing happened.

581
00:48:02,457 --> 00:48:05,528
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

582
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:10,205
Damn, you messed that guy up.

583
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,850
No, I'm sorry for how I've been.

584
00:48:14,252 --> 00:48:16,288
I'm just...

585
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:19,361
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:24,644
You know, I have to work not to be
worrying about you all the time.

587
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:27,486
You could get yourself killed if...

588
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,279
- lf what?
- Lf that's what you want.

589
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:36,322
- That's not what I want.
- Are you sure?

590
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:38,354
Yes.

591
00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:45,792
I'm sorry for how I was with you
when we were together.

592
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,430
I don't know why it's so hard for me.

593
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,596
It's hard for all of us.

594
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:57,710
But you know that you're right, that
you're a good man. For me it's like...

595
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,632
...I agree with them, you know?

596
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,188
Like it is my fault,
and I should be able to fix it.

597
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:06,943
- There's nothing to fix.
- But it's not who I wanna be.

598
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,859
I wanna be the guy at church
with the kid on his knee.

599
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,464
You can have a kid
on your knee, David.

600
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:16,667
That guy probably hasn't slept
with his wife in five years.

601
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:24,379
I feel like my father would hate me
if he knew.

602
00:49:24,824 --> 00:49:26,701
You told me he did know.

603
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:28,814
And he never said anything.

604
00:49:29,023 --> 00:49:31,172
Did you?

605
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:51,167
Would you shut up? My mother'll
fry your balls for breakfast...

606
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:53,091
...if she catches you in here.

607
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,691
Nice.

608
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:57,485
So is that pretty much what you eat
in a funeral home?

609
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:00,045
Yeah, why?

610
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:16,616
Hey.

611
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:21,336
I had Billy committed.

612
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:48,203
Mom?

613
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:51,963
Are you okay?

614
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:55,122
I have a terrible headache.

615
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:59,038
- Well, maybe we can talk later.
- What?

616
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:00,994
What?

617
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:04,396
I'm gay.

618
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,112
Why didn't you ever tell me?

619
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:10,471
- I am telling you.
- Before, before.

620
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:13,669
- Don't you trust me?
- What do you mean? I'm telling you.

621
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:17,075
But I've tried to discuss it with you
several times.

622
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:19,231
Look, I just wasn't comfortable, okay?

623
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,743
- What does it matter now?
- Why not?

624
00:52:21,954 --> 00:52:26,309
- When I was clearly trying to be open?
- You know, Mom...

625
00:52:27,432 --> 00:52:30,706
...you may be trying to be open now...

626
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,104
...and that's great.

627
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:37,181
But that's not how you've been
for all my life.

628
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:39,861
You and dad, no one talked
about anything.

629
00:52:40,107 --> 00:52:42,142
None of us are like that, except Nate...

630
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:46,303
...and that's just because he has
no other way to distinguish himself.

631
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,618
I've always loved you.

632
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:52,456
I know you love the part of me
that's your son.

633
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:56,694
What part of you isn't my son?
You're all my son.

634
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,330
I don't think you know me very well.

635
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,570
Well, whose fault is that?

636
00:53:03,337 --> 00:53:05,566
I'm sorry.

637
00:53:14,093 --> 00:53:17,323
And, you know, when you've tried to
bring it up before or now even...

638
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:20,448
...it's like you've decided
you should know who I am.

639
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,522
You're willing to see me how
you look at something horrible...

640
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:27,118
...like a corpse, because it's
your job, your duty.

641
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:29,602
It revolts you,
but you make yourself bear it.

642
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:32,604
Well, you're wrong.
You don't revolt me!

643
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:37,673
I don't choose which part of you I love,
like some kind of chicken!

644
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:46,110
It was just so much easier
when you were little...

645
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,078
...and you would tell me everything.

646
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:54,276
And when you were upset,
I could always fix it.

647
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:59,067
I don't know how to take care
of you anymore.

648
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:01,782
Just let me...

649
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:04,063
Just let me take care of myself.

650
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:07,185
But do you? I'm afraid that you don't.

651
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,390
I do.

652
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,546
I will.

653
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:24,775
Well, that's all that I wanted to say.

654
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:27,054
All right.

655
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:30,662
We're having veal.

656
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:45,971
Well, Mommy still loves you.

657
00:54:46,176 --> 00:54:49,053
Does that make everything better?

658
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,883
- Yeah, I didn't think it would.
- What are you still doing here?

659
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:59,245
I could've come out to every mother
in the world, and I'd still be dead.

660
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:14,161
Oh, what, you're gonna interrupt him
and his matching love stud?

661
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:17,242
Both of them will be in hell
with us, by the way.

662
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:20,480
But something tells me they're gonna
have a lot more fun.

663
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:22,752
Stop, stop.

664
00:55:22,962 --> 00:55:25,111
Make me.

665
00:55:31,558 --> 00:55:35,266
Please, God, help me.
Take this pain away, please.

666
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:39,468
Fill this loneliness with your love.

667
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:42,905
Help me, God. Please help me.

668
