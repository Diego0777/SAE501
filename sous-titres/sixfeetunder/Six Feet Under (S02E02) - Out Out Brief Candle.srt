00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:14,845
Episode 2x02
Out, Out, Brief Candle

2
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,777
100 yards, 10 times.

3
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:51,327
80 yards times 8.
60 by 6.

4
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,263
40 by 4. 20 by 2.
All in under 14 minutes.

5
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:57,514
You know the drill. 
Let's toe the line, gentlemen!

6
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,703
Listen I gotta make this cut to get that scholarship.

7
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,174
Look, man, just don't stop running. 
Don't stop running for nothing.

8
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:05,578
You keep on with me, 
you'll be on the startin' line with me. 

9
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,534
Come on, baby.

10
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,350
- Do you want to play football?
- Yes, sir!
11
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,724
- I said, do you want to play football? I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

12
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,619
Set.

13
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:19,395
Plus vite.

14
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:27,048
On se dépêche, lavettes !

15
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,674
Courez. Vous me comprenez,
ou je parle chinois ?

16
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:34,168
- How you doin', Sam?
- Just worry about your own self

17
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:42,905
Touchez cette putain de ligne !

18
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:49,121
Tu traînes, Josh.
Avance ! Avance !

19
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:52,729
- This is me beatin' you
- Dream on, faggot!

20
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,992
Vous y êtes.
Allez, allez !

21
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:07,962
Man down! Man down! 
We've got a player down!

22
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,571
Fight through it, Sam.

23
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,557
Sam ?

24
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,962
Sam ?

25
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:23,162
Okay, he's breathing.

26
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,867
Fuck!

27
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:41,896
Give a hand for Sam, everybody.
This is the spirit of a real football player here!


28
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,266
Do you think caviar 
is too pretentious?

29
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,370
Well, with the foie gras and the smoked salmon,

30
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,966
it might seem like you're trying 
a little too hard to impress him.

31
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,424
Fuck.

32
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:09,540
I do want to impress him without it looking like 
I could give a shit, which, actually, I don't.

33
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,116
So, why do you want to impress him?

34
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,607
I don't know.

35
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:17,212
Because Trevor was a big part of my life once.

36
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:22,164
Cause his wife won a fucking National Book Award.
Because I have nothing else to obsess about.

37
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,791
Well, you have me.

38
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,467
You I take totally for granted, 
don't you know that?

39
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,153
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

40
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,186
Yeah, you and me both, 
fuck-o.
41
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:36,463
That's the thing about depression. 
If you really allow yourself to feel it, 
it gets very boring very fast.

42
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,438
You're not jealous, are you?

43
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,527
Of Trevor ?

44
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:44,264
Should I be?

45
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:47,018
No. Of course not.

46
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:51,577
So what if he's the man whose masterly 
touch ushered me into womanhood?

47
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:54,768
The one I ultimately compare all other men to?

48
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,517
Okay, okay, fine.

49
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:58,634
But, just so you know, you'll only have yourself to blame 

50
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:01,944
when I go all alpha dog and beat him 
to a bloody pulp in front of his wife and kid!

51
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,659
Oh, my Hero !

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,232
I'm gonna kick his ass.

53
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,668
Fucking Trevor.

54
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,944
Fucking Trevor.

55
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:24,646
Good morning, Mrs. Huntley.

56
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,914
Looks like another scorcher, huh?

57
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:32,286
Where are my new acquisitions, Mr. Gilardi?

58
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:33,552
I'm on it.

59
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,787
What you're on is my shit list, cowboy.

60
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:40,063
I made you personally responsible 
for finding three homes

61
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,740
that we can dump at a profit,

62
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,607
and what do I get from you? 
Diddly squat!

63
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:48,009
I already closed
McKenzie Bros. and Dayle Montgomery!

64
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,606
Three new homes, Mr. Gilardi.

65
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:53,393
Apparently, 
I misjudged your capabilities.


66
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:57,318
What about Fisher & Sons?
You've been after them for months now.

67
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,018
Well, they're more resilient 
than I expected.

68
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,315
Jeez Louise! 
Man, play like you've got a big dick! 

69
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:05,905
Can you get them for me or not?

70
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,908
You said I had till the end of the year.

71
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,701
Well, Christmas came early this year. 
You're fired.

72
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:12,707
What ?

73
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,732
Your presence is no longer required. 
You're hereby rendered irrelevant.

74
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,798
You can't be serious! Mitzi!

75
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:24,701
I can do this. I swear. 
Now just give me another chance!

76
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:29,006
You know, just because I fucked you,
that doesn't put us on a first name basis!

77
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,479
Well, you're dressed early.

78
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,139
We have an intake at 9:30. 
Josh Langmead.

79
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,762
Am I supposed to know who that is?

80
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,148
Don't you watch the news?

81
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,127
Not if I can help it. 
It's too depressing.

82
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:52,884
Josh Langmead is the Cal State football player 
who died of heatstroke yesterday.

83
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:57,307
21 years old. In perfect health.
Till his brain fried.

84
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,375
Fuck.

85
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:03,707
Well, I'm off to Torrence.

86
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,629
I have a breakfast meeting with 
the Living Splendour sales rep.

87
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,925
Wait a minute. That means...

88
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,578
Now that you're a licensed 
funeral director,

89
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,432
we can get twice as much work done around here!

90
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,032
Just do me a favor.
Don't even mention the word "cremation."

91
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,139
Okay.
Can I mention the word "condescending"?

92
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,057
Be back by noon!

93
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:37,470
We thought Josh would want to be wearing 
his number for the viewing.

94
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,637
Well, of course.

95
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:51,848
I took him to his first Rams game 
when he was 3. 

96
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,928
It wasn't long after 
that he started wanting to play football.

97
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,862
He had...

98
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,850
He had NFL sheets.

99
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,242
Curtains. Pajamas.

100
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:12,989
Five Halloweens in a row, 
he went as Bo Jackson.

101
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:20,394
It was his dream to play pro.

102
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:25,016
I bet he could've, too.
I think he was good enough.

103
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,800
He was certainly motivated enough.

104
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,133
You ever play ball?

105
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,877
Football. No, no way.

106
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,096
My dad wouldn't let me.
He said it was too d...

107
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:40,038
I played a little baseball in high school.

108
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:49,645
Have you made a decision about a casket?

109
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:51,977
We'd like the Titan 4.

110
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:53,619
How much is that?

111
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,257
9200 $.

112
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:05,166
What the hell? 
It's only money.

113
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:12,219
Well, granted, 
1400 square feet is a bit cozy,

114
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,414
but the layout is so ergonomic 
that it feels twice as large.

115
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:19,902
Honey, it's got a sun roof!

116
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,521
- Girl's gotta get a better poker face.
- Yeah, too late.

117
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:28,133
It's very good that you brought 
your own inspector.

118
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,420
Uh, no, he's my cousin. 
He's in construction.

119
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:35,147
- So what's with the foundation?
- Oh, nothing. Perfect shape. 

120
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:41,535
Well, part of it was rebuilt two years ago, 
to the tune of 20,000.

121
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,828
So, it's better than new now. 

122
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,252
Excuse me.

123
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:48,564
What do you think, man?

124
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:51,504
I'm not living here, man. 
I've got a house. 
What do you think?

125
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,658
I don't know. 
Vanessa likes it.

126
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,564
Yeah, Vanessa likes dragging you around by your crank,
 too, is what I think.

127
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,385
You're talking about my wife, man.

128
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,875
Vanessa and me are tight, man. You know that.
It's not about her.

129
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,957
I'm just breaking it down to you the way 
the guys have been telling me.

130
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,484
You've been acting like a candy-ass bitch 
ever since you got married.

131
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,140
Screw you, Ramon!

132
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,132
Hey, screw me all you want! 

133
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,778
You know I'm right.

134
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,601
What are all these people doing in our new house?

135
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,391
Baby,

136
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:24,496
- do you really like the house?
- Yes! Yes!

137
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:28,238
Rico, the house is good.

138
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:31,001
It's got some little problems, 
but nothing I can't fix.

139
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:35,289
Rico, there's a yard for the boys. They'll be able 
to walk to school. You're closer to work. 

140
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,070
Ramon, can we use your truck to move?

141
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,208
Nate Fisher.

142
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,066
Hi there, Nate, 
this is Sheri from Appleby Caskets.

143
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,576
We received your fax order,
and I'm awfully sorry,

144
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,501
but the Titan 4 is no longer in production.

145
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:33,252
Oh, you've got to be shitting me!

146
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,722
Well, you must not have our 2002 catalogue!

147
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:39,325
- I can pop it in the mail if you'd...
- Well, what's the closest casket to the Titan?

148
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:44,335
Oh, that would probably be our Haven 2.
4100 wholesale. Usually retails for about 11600 $.

149
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,723
- Son of a motherfuck!
- Sir!

150
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,490
Alright, I'll have to get back to you.

151
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:08,478
I swear, I fuckin' hate public school!
This year-round shit? Fuck!

152
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,421
Well, we get October off, and six weeks in the spring. 
What do you want?

153
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:17,203
This Persian girl who used to be my best friend at Archer,
till I fucked her brother,

154
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,441
she's spending the entire summer in France!

155
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:24,158
Where the fuck is Gabe?
He was supposed to meet us here like 10 minutes ago!

156
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,625
Dink, it's gonna be alright, man.

157
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,397
Everything is chill.

158
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,823
It's not chill.

159
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:33,434
The cops have that fuckin' video 
at every school in L.A.!

160
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:37,825
Which means they haven't ided us yet, okay?

161
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,663
Which means they probably can't id us,

162
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:42,250
and anyone who could is 
gonna keep quiet if they know what's good for him.

163
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,430
You'd better fuckin' hope so...

164
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,797
You fucker! Did you fuckin' tell somebody?

165
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,786
Because if you fucking told somebody,
I will fucking kill your bitch-ass, do you hear me?

166
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,103
- No, asshole!
- What about Andy?

167
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:56,629
How am I supposed to know? 
He's your fuckin' best friend!


168
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:02,932
What ?

169
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:06,952
Uh, you were supposed to meet us like 10 minutes ago.
We're waiting.

170
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,564
Jesus, Claire, don't pussy whip him.

171
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:10,928
You gotta act like you don't care.

172
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,247
Guys hate it when they're pussy-whipped.

173
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:15,736
Like you've ever stuck around 
long enough to find out, 

174
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,281
Wonder Slut!

175
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,178
What, Squirrel Nut?

176
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,260
Your soul's on fire.

177
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:25,244
I know.

178
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,693
Your souls are on fire.

179
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:32,196
Whoa, you are not on the list of people 
who get to touch my tits!

180
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,145
Andy, what is wrong?

181
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:49,879
- Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
- This is so fucked up!

182
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,915
Oh, God!

183
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,759
Andy, Andy, say something to me.

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,871
I don't know what to do right now!

185
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,576
Andy! Oh my God!

186
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,648
Andy! Look at me!

187
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:03,983
Go get the nurse!

188
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:06,030
- Did he take something?
- Go!

189
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,466
You stop it, stop it, you fucking bitch, 

190
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,608
or I will kick the shit out of you.
Do you hear me?

191
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:14,257
What the fuck are you looking at?

192
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,278
I told you last week that the Titan Series 
was out of production.

193
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,479
Yeah, well, I think that you should have torn 
the damn page out of the catalogue!

194
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,777
It was an honest mistake.
We'll give them the Haven 2 for 11600$ instead.

195
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,906
- David, they're already paying more than they can afford.
- You don't know that.

196
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,729
God, I cannot tell you how much 
I hate it when you patronize me!

197
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,460
I'm being understanding. You want patronizing? 
I'll give you patronizing!

198
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:35,842
Hey, guys.

199
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:38,326
Hey, Rico. 
Langmead's in the reefer.

200
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,546
Yeah. 
You guys got a moment?

201
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,342
Yeah, what's up?

202
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:44,648
Vanessa and I found a house.

203
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,025
Oh, Rico, that's great!

204
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:49,035
Yeah, yeah, we really like the house!

205
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:52,629
And, uh, we can swing the monthly payments,

206
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,900
if we put down 20%.

207
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,470
What are we talking about?

208
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:01,331
Well, we pieced most of it together,

209
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,828
but we're about 11 grand short.

210
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,864
11.000 ?

211
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,800
Yup. By tomorrow.

212
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:14,711
Look, we'll pay you back,
over 18 months, at 7% interest.

213
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:18,268
Now, that's a lot better than the bank, 
and not too far off the market.


214
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,955
We'll let you know by tomorrow.

215
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:25,957
Thanks.

216
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,013
But right now, Mr. Langmead needs your attention.

217
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,533
I'm on it.

218
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:37,310
See? I am understanding.


Scene Eleven: Nikolai's Flower Shop



219
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,328
That's a lovely arrangement.
What is it?

220
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,429
Scalene vase.

221
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,196
Didn't they teach you anything at Daffodil University?

222
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,323
Actually, it's...

223
00:15:56,324 --> 00:16:00,166
a combination of inverted T and scalene.

224
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,327
It's my own design, 

225
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:07,456
and it's yours.

226
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,031
No. I just wanted to learn how to make one.

227
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,236
It's a gift from my heart.

228
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,010
Seriously.

229
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:19,127
Thank you so much, Robbie.

230
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,116
Okay, Ruth,

231
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:31,088
this is going to be hard for me to say, but...

232
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,589
I forgive you.

233
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,670
Forgive me? For what?

234
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:40,881
You destroyed the natural order
 of the universe, cupcake.

235
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:44,416
Everything was perfectly quiet and boring 
around here before you came,

236
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,962
and now Nikolai's all aflutter,

237
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,431
wanting to make improvements.
I'm expected to work.

238
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,327
For his own carnal reasons,
he favors you over me.

239
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,900
And for that, I forgive you.

240
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,926
I resent that!

241
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:03,293
I've always conducted myself 
with complete professionalism!

242
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,883
Whatever, Ruth, I forgive you.

243
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,536
I don't need your forgiveness!

244
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:15,536
Oh, no, no, goddammit!
It's not supposed to go this way!

245
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,763
What isn't?

246
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:22,042
OK, Ruth, I'm graduating from The Plan tomorrow,

247
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:25,148
and I would really like it if you would be my witness.

248
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:27,330
The Plan? What is The Plan?

249
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,731
It's a multi-disciplined course that allows you

250
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:32,200
to think way beyond yourself,

251
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:36,418
and rebuild your life, from the ground floor, 
plank by plank.

252
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,225
That sounds awful!

253
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:41,514
It teaches you how to feel really good about yourself

254
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,288
and get what you want out of life.

255
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,904
Do you want to go?

256
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:53,021
It would really mean a lot to me, Ruth.

257
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,484
- Wow!
- Pretty sweet, huh?

258
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:16,395
Each portal is lit by recessed halogens.

259
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:20,170
Tasteful signs for the model name,
materials, and pricing.

260
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,733
And this little drawer here?

261
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,695
This displays your interior upholstery fabric.

262
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:28,891
Point of purchase
does not get any better than this, my friends.

263
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,697
It's very impressive.

264
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:32,723
Impressive?
It's fucking gorgeous!

265
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,707
It's a completely interactive retail experience!

266
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,896
'Cause human beings, 
we're tactile.

267
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:40,093
We like to touch the fruit before we buy.

268
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:43,656
I can't believe you guys!
You're still using a catalogue!

269
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,932
Now these caskets here, 
there're on the upper level.

270
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,965
They appeal to men.
It's at their average height.

271
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,156
Down below are the ladies' favorites.

272
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:54,330
I have seen the future, and this is it!

273
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,948
Dave, where would it go?

274
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:57,598
We put it in the second viewing room!

275
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,056
What, the room that we've been using for storage?

276
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:00,539
David, that room needs serious work.

277
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,080
So? We use this as a reason to do it! Haven't we been 
planning to do that with the money Mom gave us anyway?

278
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,542
Dave, that money is almost all gone.

279
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:13,917
A two by five like this will not break your back.
21500 $.

280
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:18,674
I'll tell you what.
20500.

281
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:23,260
That includes installation.
I'll even throw in a fresh coat of paint for your room.

282
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,111
You cannot beat that with a stick.

283
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:28,102
Nate, you always say we need 
to spend money to make money.

284
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,638
Alright, how long to install?

285
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:33,190
Give me the word, and you'll be
making sales in two days.

286
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,566
- You really like it?
- Who wouldn't?!?

287
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:43,757
I've never seen David happier.
It was like Christmas morning when we were kids.

288
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,863
Whoa! Working out a little aggression there?

289
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:56,728
We're having chicken piccatta.
It needs to marinate over night.

290
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:00,742
You never cook like this for me.
You never even cook.

291
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:05,303
And when Trevor goes back to New Haven,
I need you to forget that I can!

292
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,555
Alright. What should I wear?

293
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:11,703
Speedo? Hair extensions?
Wear what you want. I don't care.

294
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:14,251
Don't wear one of your funeral suits.

295
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,204
Oh, I thought you don't care.

296
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:23,103
Wear something that makes you look like
the sexy bad boy you really are.

297
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,342
Something that makes Mister Wife and Kids 

298
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:27,825
question all of his middle-class choices.

299
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,420
I'm all for that, just as long as you wear something low-cut in the back,

300
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,579
so he can see my name branded on your ass!

301
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,798
Hello! Hello?

302
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,174
Hello?

303
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,294
Hello?

304
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,422
Hey. New casket wall, huh?

305
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:27,270
You boys are doing better than I thought.

306
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,574
I'm Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

307
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,140
David Fisher.

308
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:35,937
Do you need to plan a funeral?

309
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,213
You have no idea who I am do you.

310
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:46,328
I'm Southwest Regional Director 
for Kroehner Services, International.

311
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:52,110
I was hoping that maybe you and your brother 
might share a cup of coffee with me.

312
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:04,733
Well, hello!
Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

313
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,942
Nate Fisher.

314
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,634
You're a runner, huh?

315
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,306
It's bad for your knees.

316
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,252
Yeah, well, everything's bad for something.

317
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,357
So I hear.

318
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:20,260
Why are you here?

319
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:23,659
I made it abundantly clear to Matt Gilardi 
we're not interested in selling.

320
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,946
Oh, Matt Gilardi is no longer with Kroehner.

321
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,420
Yup. I fired his worthless ass,

322
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:32,562
because I didn't like the way 
that he was representing our company.

323
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:34,757
And that is why I'm here today.

324
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:40,723
To do a little damage control, 
and apologize to you boys.

325
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:41,799
Right.

326
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,615
Oh, I don't blame you for not trusting me.

327
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,999
Frankly, I'd be worried about you if you did.

328
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,314
- Cream with three sugars.
- Well, thank you.

329
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:52,097
You didn't put rat poison in here, did you?

330
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:54,894
Drink it and find out.

331
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,449
Oh, please!

332
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,459
You boys aren't afraid of Big Bad Mitzi, 
are you?

333
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,143
Come on.

334
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:06,381
The economy is in a tail spin.

335
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:10,833
Corporations are downsizing, and resizing, 
and reorganizing,

336
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,015
including Kroehner.

337
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,427
We can't afford to take you over.
Honey, we've got problems of our own.

338
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,561
Okay, let's just cut the foreplay.

339
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,352
But that's the best part.

340
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:21,154
It's not that we don't trust you.

341
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:23,125
We despise everything you stand for:

342
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:25,329
corporate profits over personal service,

343
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,140
stockholders over clients,

344
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,779
greed over everything else,

345
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,641
so I think you should take 
your gesture of good faith,

346
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,102
and shove it up your ass!

347
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,162
Ooh, well that's one opinion.

348
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:39,167
Anything that you would care to add, David?

349
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,972
No, I think Nate pretty much summed our position up.

350
00:23:43,868 --> 00:23:46,151
Well, alrighty then.

351
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:49,646
I'll just show myself out.

352
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:56,336
By the way, you might want to clean out your coffeemaker.

353
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,789
Your coffee sucks.

354
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,202
This is not so good.

355
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,114
Well, who the fuck is named Mitzi anyway?
That sounds like something you name a fuckin' chiuaua!

356
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,824
Pretty bitchin', huh?

357
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,912
When did you start getting all excited over caskets?

358
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,803
You're turning into David!

359
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:28,752
Don't ever say that again!

360
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,891
Very nice.

361
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:34,879
Oh, welcome to Casketeria!
May I take your order?

362
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:39,420
So, Mr. Langmead is all ready to go.

363
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,061
Great.

364
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,038
Yeah. So, Nate, have you guys had a chance
to think about what we...you know?

365
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:48,876
- Uh, yeah...
- yeah?

366
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:51,631
- Yeah, let's go in the office.
- Okay.

367
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:01,470
So do these really open?
Can you, like, hide shit in here?

368
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:03,570
Can you close the door?

369
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,580
Close the door doesn't sound too good.

370
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:15,907
We can't give you a loan right now, Rico.

371
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:20,116
Look, we just spent a fortune
on the new casket wall,

372
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,967
and now we have to maintain an emergency fund

373
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:26,004
in case Kroehner starts acting up again,
which suddenly looks very likely.

374
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:29,313
It was a tough choice, I'm sorry.

375
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:33,097
How much did that casket wall cost?

376
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:38,802
Rico, our first priority is 
keeping this house open.

377
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,392
The more income we make, the more you can make.

378
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:45,413
Tell me one thing. Did you and David decide to buy that wall
before or after we spoke.

379
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:54,774
Wow. You know, first you won't make me a partner,
now you won't even...

380
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,554
God, you know, I've had it with you moping
about not being a partner.

381
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,020
It's not happening, alright?

382
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:01,686
I wish I could help you, but I can't.

383
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:07,283
I mean, fuck, we're your employer, alright!
We're not a goddamned savings and loan!

384
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:14,183
I'm sorry, Rico.

385
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:19,152
If it were my money,
I'd give you all of it, you know that.

386
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:28,798
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll pass it along to my kids,
after playing in a parking lot next to a dumpster!

387
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:38,471
Fuck!

388
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,052
I'm scared.

389
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,770
What's gonna happen to me now?

390
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:11,076
Well, that''s not my problem, pal.

391
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,948
What?

392
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:21,147
I was so young.

393
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:22,977
Why me?

394
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:26,057
Well, why the fuck not you? What?
Did you think you were immune to this?

395
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:28,463
Everybody! 

396
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:31,715
What makes you so fuckin' special?

397
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,580
What do you think?

398
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,790
I'm not signing up for anything.

399
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:53,491
Oh, I'm not selling anything.
I'm a visitor, just like you.

400
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:58,561
Do you know how you can tell?
The Elevated wear plastic tags.

401
00:27:58,562 --> 00:27:59,913
The Elevated?

402
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,756
Oh, you'll learn the lingo.

403
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:05,504
My daughter is graduating today. 
You?

404
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:08,345
My business associate is graduating.

405
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:10,578
So what exactly is this?

406
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:13,374
Well, I don't know for sure myself.

407
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,246
But Shelia has never been happier,

408
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,265
so I wanted to see what it was all about.

409
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:21,234
<i>Let's get started.</i>

410
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:24,855
<i>Today just might be the most important day 
of your entire lives.</i>

411
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,546
Come sit with me.
There's safety in numbers.

412
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,120
You cannot design a life that works
without first drafting a clear blueprint.

413
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:43,232
And you cannot construct a life that has meaning
without first laying a solid foundation.

414
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:47,163
You are the architect of your life.

415
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:49,855
Not your emotionally distant father.

416
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:52,769
Not your overly critical mother.

417
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,424
Not your petty, fairweather friends.

418
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,765
You !

419
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,452
It was hard the first time I stood up for myself.

420
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:15,373
I always wanted everybody to like me.

421
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:19,450
Even though I hated myself, you had to like me.

422
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:21,876
When I rebuilt my foundation,

423
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:26,760
and I was able to honor
and elevate the better part of me,

424
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:30,041
I realized I really like me.

425
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,191
So you don't have to!

426
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,191
I'm not a salvage job.

427
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:43,437
I am not a teardown.
I am not junk.

428
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:48,667
It's taken me many years to say that.
To believe it.

429
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:53,550
There are days that I slip,
and I treat people like shit.

430
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:58,397
Like I treated myself for the last 30 years.

431
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:01,504
But then I swear I'm going to win this.

432
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:08,277
I'm going to build the life that I always wanted to live.

433
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:20,100
I thought it was too late.

434
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,063
Two terrible marriages.

435
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:28,569
Children who won't even return my phone calls.

436
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,334
It hurts.

437
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:34,047
I'm 41 and I feel like I'm 80.

438
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:36,675
But I have value.

439
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,182
I'm still here.

440
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,857
And as long as I believe in myself

441
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:47,163
and speak fiercely from the Eye,

442
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:49,613
then there's still hope.

443
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,652
There's no mortgage on my life.

444
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,934
I own it.

445
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,174
Thank you, Mom.

446
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:32,524
Well, that was humiliating.
As if my self-esteem wasn't low enough.

447
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:33,756
It's kind of funny.

448
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,830
All that time we were racquetball partners,

449
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:37,774
we actually never played racquetball.

450
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:41,741
I am serious about wanting to learn how to play.
Are you available Thursday afternoon?

451
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,893
I don't know. I'll check.

452
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,922
Hey, wanna drop by my niece's birthday party later?

453
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,763
- Eddie's on call.
- Uh, sure.

454
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:54,740
I got a couple of errands to run.
I'll call you later.

455
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:58,843
I've got nothing to do.
I'll just tag along, if that's okay.

456
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:04,871
Oh my God. Did you hear?
Andy was doing Fry!

457
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,114
I'm sorry. In English?

458
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:08,948
Fry ! Wet ! Illy !

459
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:11,278
You're telling me you've never heard of Fry?

460
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,790
I'm sorry. My parole officer frowns 
on controlled substances.

461
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:19,056
Okay. You take your standard garden variety doobie, right?

462
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:23,445
You dip it in embalming fluid,
cut it with God knows what, and BAM!

463
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:27,177
All your states are altered and you see God!

464
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:32,201
Or...you're in tweaker hell,
bouncing off lockers, and swallowing your own tongue, like Andy.

465
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,087
Embalming fluid? 
Are you kidding me?

466
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,751
I've smelled that shit! It's like lethal!

467
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:39,550
You oughtta get out more.
Live a little.

468
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:41,921
- You've done this?!?
- No.

469
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:44,473
But if you ever wanted to make a quick buck...

470
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:48,464
Oh, fuck off, Parker! I am not getting 
into the pot and embalming fluid business!

471
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:50,695
I've had enough run-ins with the police, thank you!

472
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:55,891
At 50 $ a pop, you might change your mind.

473
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:02,193
Oh my God! That fuckin' asshole!

474
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:04,450
Right?

475
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:08,397
I mean, Andy's gonna be in detox for like a week!

476
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:13,078
Look okay?

477
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,788
It looks fine.
It looks like a page out of Gourmet Magazine!

478
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:19,157
Excellent !

479
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:22,217
You know they put hairspray on food 
before they photograph it sometimes?

480
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:23,218
Really?

481
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:26,538
Yeah, I used to go out with this food stylist in Seattle.

482
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:31,550
I mean, they do stuff to food that is way worse
than what we do to bodies, believe you me.

483
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:42,180
Okay. Tell me I look beautiful.

484
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,110
You are beautiful.

485
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,192
You even mean that. Okay.

486
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:01,288
- Hi!
- Hi!

487
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,476
Will, at least say "Hello!"

488
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,813
Hello!

489
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:10,000
Wow, Bren, it's great to see you!
It really is.

490
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:13,892
Oh my God! I'm gonna cry!

491
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,985
- You must be Dawn!
- Hi! Oh, it's nice to meet you.

492
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:21,922
Thank you so much for letting us bring Will.
Trevor really wanted you to meet him. 

493
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,527
Oh, I really wanted to meet him.

494
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,128
Hey, hi, Will!

495
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,916
Will, can you say hi?

496
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,816
He'll crash in a little while. I promise.

497
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,208
- Hi. I'm Trevor.
- Nate.

498
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:35,526
Oh! Nate. Dawn.

499
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:36,719
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

500
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,782


501
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:42,708
This place is really cool.

502
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,585
- Yeah. So, wine anyone?
- I'd love a glass.

503
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,823
...

504
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:51,094
<i>I want wine!</i>

505
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:55,389
Oh, you do? Well, what do you say?

506
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,795
<i>Hi, Mr. Pooh Bear. Do you remember 
what we discussed in the car?</i>

507
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,692
....

508
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,142
"I want wine, please!"

509
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,360
Please

510
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:09,136
So, how's the press tour going?

511
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:14,268
Oh, God, I feel like such a sell-out!
I actually did "Politically Incorrect" last night!

512
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:15,704
Wow! Was it fun?

513
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:18,566
Oh, hardly. It was me, Kobe Bryant,

514
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,386
that emaciated chick from "The Practice," 
and some twelve year old rap singer

515
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,510
I'd never even heard of!

516
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:28,611
I read your first book.
I thought it was brilliant.

517
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:29,975
Thank you!

518
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:34,123
- I can send you a copy of the new one, if you'd like.
- I would. Thank you.

519
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:36,849
You know, I read "Charlotte: Light and Dark."

520
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,074
Oh, dear! Why?

521
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:43,510
In grad school. I had this idiot professor who insisted

522
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:48,272
qthat it was the perfect profile of a classic borderline personality.

523
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:51,483
You've heard that before, right?

524
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:54,682
I actually went to the library, looked up the symptoms

525
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:57,215
and started behaving like that just to fuck with them!

526
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:58,751
Seriously?

527
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:02,145
That's brilliant!
How old were you?

528
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:05,976
I must have been 9 or 10.
It was towards the end.

529
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,246
Personally, I think it's a crock of shit.

530
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,244
Did you ever notice how the majority 
of borderlines are women?

531
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:15,272
I see it as just a misogynistic 
attempt to pathologize women

532
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,166
who refuse to toe the patriarchal line!

533
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:24,026
Yeah, yeah, I spent 6 months in Seattle 
on a teaching fellowship.

534
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:25,215
Ever do any cliimbing up there?

535
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,486
Oh, yeah, some boulder climbing.
Normal climbing with ropes but...

536
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,258
Are you a cragger?

537
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:35,179
Eh. Rank amateur urban kind, but I love it.

538
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,284
You done climbing rock?

539
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:41,721
Yeah, that's where I learned.
I never knew 30 feet was so high off the ground.

540
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:43,590
30 feet? That's nothing!

541
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:46,431
I've got a couple of buddies.
They're real thrillseekers.

542
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:47,781
I mean, they climb high,

543
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:50,744
but no way I can do that.

544
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,303
Gotta think about more than just myself now.

545
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:03,191
Bren looks great.

546
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,088
How's she doing?

547
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,094
Oh, she's doing great.

548
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,904
- Man, she is so fucking smart!
- Yes, she is!

549
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:14,666
She used to run circles around me,
I can tell you that.

550
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,536
Everybody expected such great things from her.
551
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,915
How's her brother?

552
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:28,156
He's in the hospital 
right now.

553
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:43,585
I just really wanted to get out of my head,

554
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:47,272
so I took 18 months of classes, 
down at the Shiatsu Institute,

555
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:50,918
thinking I'd do it until I figured out 
what I really wanted to do.

556
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,838
And here we are 10 years later.

557
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,953
- But you love what you do, right?
- I do.

558
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,238
That's the key.
And you know what?

559
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,801
There is this girl in my health club.
She doesn't do shiatsu,

560
00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:05,798
but I swear. She is gifted.
Gif-ted!

561
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,894
You know, there's a science to shiatsu.

562
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:12,337
Chinese medicine dates back over 2000 years.

563
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:19,248
Hmm...This is delicious, Brenda.
You know, I never cook like this.

564
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,529
I can make pasta, but that's about it.

565
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,608
She's got me beat. I can make toast.
And ice cubes.

566
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,200
Nate does pretty good microwave popcorn.

567
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:30,431
What do you do, Nate?

568
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,386
I'm a funeral director.

569
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:36,506
Really?

570
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:45,033
What--what--what makes one to decide to--uh--
become a funeral director?

571
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,675
Well, I was born into it, actually.

572
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,263
Sort of like being born into the Mafia.

573
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:04,873
Hey, not so fast there, hotshot!
It's a tow road!

574
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:28,644
Will ! Will !

575
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:29,944
Time out.

576
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:34,197
Sometimes he becomes completely irrational 
just to gain attention.

577
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:37,425
Hell, sometimes I do that.

578
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:47,463
Oncle K !

579
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,532
Hey, baby girl! 
Happy birthday!

580
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,068
I'm 9.

581
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:54,681
Oh, well, I guess that means
I can't call you "Baby Girl" anymore.

582
00:39:54,782 --> 00:39:56,350
You better not!

583
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,449
This is my friend, David.

584
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,841
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

585
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:02,927
So where's the party?

586
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,930
You want some? It's good.

587
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,584
This is for you, sweetheart.

588
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,127
I saw this in the store!

589
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:38,499
Yeah, I can't believe they still make these!

590
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,121
- I thought you'd like it.
- Thanks, Uncle K.

591
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,825
- Where's Mommy?
- In the bedroom, sleeping.

592
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:53,785
- I'm going to go and talk to her for a little bit, alright?
- Okay.

593
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,122
Carla !

594
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:21,861
Carla !

595
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:29,605
Hi...

596
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:31,781
Thought you wasn't comin' till later.

597
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:35,696
It is later.
What happened to Taylor's birthday party?

598
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,505
Shit!

599
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:42,036
I got home from work and was bone-tired.

600
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:45,382
I'll take her to the flea market on the weekend,
get her something.

601
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:46,820
That's all you did for her birthday?

602
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,443
Buy her an Entennmann's cake?!?

603
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,139
It's her favorite.

604
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,785
What are you on?

605
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:59,474
- Don't lie to me!
- I ain't on nothin'! Ok?

606
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,698
What? You think I'm suicidal or 
just plain stupid?

607
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:05,826
I think you need to stop living just for yourself,
and start thinking about that little girl in there.

608
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:09,793
I am 7 months clean! I work 2 jobs
and take care of my kid!

609
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:13,076
What? I forgot her motherfuckin' birthday!
Do you want to arrest me for that?

610
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:16,319
Look, you can do all the damage you want to yourself.
I can't stop that.

611
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,242
But I'm not gonna let you fuck up her life!

612
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:21,016
- Take your hands off me.
- Carla...

613
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:25,108
I will file an assault charge,
and you do not want that.

614
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,058
My sister had one of these when she was a kid.

615
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,362
But I broke it.

616
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,952
On purpose?

617
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,238
No. I wanted to make a pizza,

618
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:43,040
and I put in a 300 watt bulb, and the whole thing melted!

619
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:44,682
That's dumb!

620
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:47,007
Yeah, I know, and I was 17.

621
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:52,545
<i>You don't give a fuck about her! I'm talkin' to you!</i>

622
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:54,870
<i>You don't know shit! Get the fuck out of my house!</i>

623
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,607
<i>I do! I do!</i>

624
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:00,560
- Do you live in a house?
- Yup.

625
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,395
A big house?

626
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:04,280
Not that big.

627
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:08,226
Got a daddy?

628
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:11,003
I used to.

629
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:20,419
- We gotta go, okay?
- Okay.

630
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,977
Alright, listen, uh...

631
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,387
I'll come back tomorrow

632
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:27,623
as soon as I get off work,
and we'll go to the movies, okay?

633
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:29,369
Okay.

634
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,846
We gotta go.

635
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,297
Oh, my God!

636
00:43:51,788 --> 00:43:53,972
What was I thinking?

637
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:57,357
Well, I was only 19.

638
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:59,687
Aw, come on, it wasn't that bad.

639
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:05,008
"There's this girl at my health club. 
She is gif-ted!

640
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,717
Gif-ted".

641
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:08,326
What a dork!

642
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:10,664
His ears were filthy.
Did you notice that?

643
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:11,849
No.

644
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,352
Now, her I liked.

645
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,654
That kid! What a freak!

646
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:19,247
tart saving up for therapy now!

647
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,901
We need some friends.
Some couples we don't hate.

648
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,048
We have each other.

649
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:32,863
Maybe we should volunteer some place.

650
00:44:33,512 --> 00:44:35,691
No, I'm serious.

651
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:38,854
Do something good for the world.

652
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:41,734
Exchange Program.

653
00:44:42,171 --> 00:44:45,710
Habitat for Humanity. Meels on Wheels.

654
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:49,118
Just give more, consume less.

655
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:52,384
Brenda, I'm dying.

656
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:56,431
What? What did you say?

657
00:44:56,432 --> 00:45:02,471
After the auto accident, I had x-rays, MRIs,
and they found something.

658
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:08,382
They found... it's called AVM, I don't know. 
And I think I'm gonna die from it. I don't know when.

659
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,876
I'm so scared.

660
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,162
Are you listening to me?

661
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:23,338
Yeah.

662
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,997
Meels on Wheels.

663
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,682
You really wanna do that?

664
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,820
I don't know. I have to do something.

665
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,657
I hate my fucking life.

666
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:36,499
What's wrong?

667
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,831
I was watching Trevor and Dawn tonight,

668
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:46,705
thinking...
they're just so...so complete.

669
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,242
Like they have something
that I will never have, ever.

670
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:54,976
Either I wasn't born with it, 
or it was beaten out of me,

671
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:57,139
or maybe,

672
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,190
maybe I made myself into a self-fulfilling prophecy,

673
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:01,045
and I really am a borderline personality.

674
00:46:01,046 --> 00:46:03,535
Now, wouldn't that be ironic? 

675
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,927
Hey, what's going on with you?

676
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:10,991
Je ne sais pas.

677
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,973
I don't know. I spent my childhood performing 
for clinicians,

678
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:17,907
the rest of my life taking care of my trainwreck 
of a brother,

679
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,747
and I have no idea who I am.

680
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:27,925
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
Want one?

681
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:31,449
No thanks.

682
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:45,470
God, I can't wait until our next funeral!

683
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,598
 What do you think, Mom?

684
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,724
It's very modern.

685
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:52,835
We figure it'll pay for itself in less than 8 months.

686
00:46:52,836 --> 00:46:55,229
What did we spend on this?

687
00:46:56,957 --> 00:46:58,969
About 20000 $.

688
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:03,204
How much is left in the reserve fund 
I gave you?

689
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:04,586
I'll have to check.

690
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:07,759
I want a full accounting of how you spent that 93000 $.

691
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,652
I'm an investor in Fisher & Sons. 
That wall is part of my investment, and I want a return!

692
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:13,840
Well, of course, Mom.

693
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:17,458
I am speaking fiercely from the Eye!

694
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:19,703
Do you mind?

695
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:25,300
I don't know.

696
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,614
I just need one of you to sign right here,

697
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,103
and we'll be done

698
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:32,926
Do we need to write you a check right now,
or can we just mail it to your office?

699
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:35,770
Uh, you might want to open this first.

700
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:38,947
It's beautiful.

701
00:47:38,948 --> 00:47:41,023
- It's great.
- It's great.

702
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:50,243
"Enjoy the new casket wall. It's on me. Kisses. Mitzi Dalton Huntley.".

703
00:47:50,644 --> 00:47:52,379
Why would she pay for our wall?

704
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,168
She didn't pay for it.
Appleby Caskets is owned by Kroehner.

705
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:57,928
Since when?

706
00:47:57,929 --> 00:47:59,957
Since three weeks ago.

707
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,006
Enjoy.

708
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:08,672
She has us selling Kroehner caskets!

709
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:11,209
Wow. She's good.

710
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:14,266
Well, I guess we can at least help out Rico now.

711
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:16,815
Yeah, that's a good idea.

712
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:19,865
Then we go under, and he's out of work,
and he can't afford to pay us back.

713
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:21,941
Which won't matter 
because we won't exist anymore.

714
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:24,967
David, we just saved 20000 $.

715
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,698
We didn't save 20000 $ !
We just didn't spend it!

716
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:30,994
Actually, we just lost 1600 $

717
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:36,200
because we had to give the Langmeads the Haven 4 for 10500, 
thank you very much!

718
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:47,353
Honey, of course I love the house,

719
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:50,004
but, believe me,
they are never gonna give us the money.

720
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:51,891
You love the house, though.

721
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,461
We just have to keep on looking, baby.

722
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:58,065
No, we don't. I went to the realtor this morning,
and we got the house!

723
00:48:58,066 --> 00:49:01,801
I wrote a check for the down payment,
and now Julio can have his own room!

724
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:05,614
What? Where did you get the money? What do you mean?

725
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:08,577
Okay, don't be mad.

726
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,618
You went behind my back and asked your sister for the money?
Are you crazy?

727
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:25,795
- Rico, I wasn't about to lose that house.
- I provide for this family, NOT HER!

728
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,483
I've gone 8 to 10 hours a day

729
00:49:27,484 --> 00:49:29,700
missing my kids
to get us what we need.

730
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,060
I DON'T NEED HER FUCKING HANDOUTS!

731
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:34,805
Please, I don't want to hear
any machismo bullshit today!

732
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:39,734
What did you say to me?

733
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:44,854
Baby,...

734
00:49:45,724 --> 00:49:47,819
we have a house.

735
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,253
It's our first house.

736
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,792
Can you be happy?

737
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:55,318
I'm cancelling that check.

738
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,410
Listen to me.

739
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:00,002
When the transmission went last month,
where'd the money come from?

740
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:03,763
When I chipped my tooth
and we couldn't afford the dentist, 
who paid for it?

741
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:07,664
Angelica's doing good. She has extra money.
She's family.

742
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:10,761
She loves us. She wants to help us.

743
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,857
So please,

744
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,776
put down the phone.

745
00:50:27,628 --> 00:50:30,457
We have a house.

746
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:36,020
Everything is good.

747
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:57,291
How's Andy?

748
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:01,005
He's gonna be okay.

749
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,406
What was he on?

750
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:07,531
Some weird shit. 
I don't really know.

751
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:13,052
Because I heard he smoked
a joint dipped in embalming fluid.

752
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:15,418
I wouldn't know.

753
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:18,858
That wouldn't be embalming fluid 
that you stole from my house, right?

754
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:22,841
What the fuck is wrong with you?

755
00:51:22,842 --> 00:51:25,339
Do you have any idea how much trouble this could get us in?

756
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,740
I mean, first of all, he could've died.

757
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:32,585
And my brothers could be getting a fucking phone call 
from the cops right now,
and you're gonna bring this on my head?

758
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:34,383
Would you stop?

759
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:38,531
Look, I gave Andy 5 or 6 to sell,

760
00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:40,932
and he fucking smoked them all.

761
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,889
I am sorry that I fucked with you.

762
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,122
But you took me down there, and I saw the stuff,
and I just wasn't thinking.

763
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:50,771
Oh, you were thinking.
You were thinking about yourself!

764
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:54,101
Claire, listen to me.
Listen to me.

765
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:57,698
Look, the cops have a videotape of me and Andy and Dink
766
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:59,394
robbing a fucking convenience store,

767
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:02,446
and now I'm worried that Andy's gonna turn me in.

768
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:09,135
Who the fuck are you?

769
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:16,566
Fuck! Everything I touch turns to shit!

770
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,728
Everything is shit!

771
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,112
Everybody was right about you.

772
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:32,289
You are the only good thing that I have left.
Please don't give up on me.

773
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:35,859
Please.

774
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:42,485
No.

775
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,858
Oh, Christ.

776
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:14,401
You know, you're really starting to piss me off.

777
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:18,124
What? What? What?
What the fuck do you want from me?

778
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,678
I want you to see me!

779
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:22,809
Look at me!

780
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,160
Look at me!

781
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:56,653
That's more like it.

782
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:26,940

00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:56,436
What is it?

789
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:07,208
Um--Listen, if I've been a dick or something, 
I'm really sorry.

790
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:15,578
