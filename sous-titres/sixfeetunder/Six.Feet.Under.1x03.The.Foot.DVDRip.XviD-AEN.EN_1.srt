1
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,657
Okay, this here's the dough mixer.

2
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,737
You gotta get in there, really scrub it...

3
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,408
...hose it down every night.

4
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,375
Keep the bugs out.

5
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,218
Because someone found a roach in
a loaf of wheat once and sued.

6
00:01:55,901 --> 00:02:00,498
- Can't you just spray it with Raid?
- Then you got poison in bread, kill 100.

7
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:02,135
Is that good?

8
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,698
Oh, Jesus.

9
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:18,416
I gotta get to my chiropractor.

10
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:20,500
Hey.

11
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:24,055
Think anyone's
ever had sex in here?

12
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:28,065
Now, why the fuck would
you even think that?

13
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,178
Romano?

14
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:46,260
Romano?

15
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,780
Romano, are you okay?

16
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,387
That was...

17
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:30,111
You made the weirdest noise back there.

18
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:34,231
If I were you, I would not
get into a weird-noise contest.

19
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:36,429
Oh, yeah?

20
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,115
Oh, boy.

21
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,752
I love this song.

22
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,677
This, really?

23
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,029
Yeah.

24
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,595
My dad had all these
old big-band records.

25
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,997
It always reminds me of...

26
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,795
I don't know, being a kid.

27
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,917
Still being blissfully ignorant
about what a sick joke life can be.

28
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:04,002
I would've pegged you
as more of a fan of...

29
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,433
What? Sting?

30
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:10,034
U2? You know, grew up in the '80s
but too straight to be into the really...

31
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,075
...hard-core punk stuff.
- Oh, yeah?

32
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:14,593
I suppose you were into
the hard-core punk stuff.

33
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,478
I think it was just the heroin talking.

34
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:25,357
Oh, man, I love that look.

35
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:28,115
No, I really should go.

36
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:31,125
Mom and David and I are having
some sort of family meeting...

37
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:35,606
...to discuss whether we should
sell the business to Kroehner.

38
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,322
God, I hope we will.

39
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,007
Why?

40
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,884
So that I can get the hell
out of here and go back to Seattle.

41
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,278
Why don't you come with me?

42
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,126
Why on earth would I do
something like that?

43
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,643
Because you are my woman.

44
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,727
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,968
How come my name is
branded on your ass?

46
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,291
I love that look.

47
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,529
You don't understand
how serious this is.

48
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,884
We're under siege by
a major corporation.

49
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:13,006
- Stop being so dramatic.
- Mom, it's a fact.

50
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:15,523
David, we all have problems.

51
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,726
This oat bran is stuck on here
like cement...

52
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,812
...because you didn't soak
any water in it.

53
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:22,450
Listen to me.
Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers...

54
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,135
...to demand money upfront.

55
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,213
Now Continental Caskets wants us
to pay...

56
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,977
...for anything we put in the show room
before we sell it.

57
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,929
That's thousands of dollars.

58
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:33,936
Your father never let these things
get to him like you do.

59
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,413
He never had to deal with
this kind of situation.

60
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,927
I'm sure things will work out.
They always do.

61
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,607
- No, they don't.
- Good morning.

62
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,172
What's going on with you?

63
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,056
Nothing.

64
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:14,536
You're not leaving here until you
put some food in your stomach.

65
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,940
I'm starving.

66
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:24,021
Are you bulimic? Is that what we're
going to have to deal with now?

67
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:27,184
Mom, apparently you want a child
with an eating disorder.

68
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,139
Morning.

69
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,540
How was your run?

70
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:34,660
I haven't gone yet. I stayed over
at Brenda's last night.

71
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:36,221
No one cares where you were.

72
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,067
Why do you have to tell people
every single thing you do?

73
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:43,342
Sorry, I forgot we're all supposed
to live under a shroud of secrecy.

74
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,505
So I think we should sell.

75
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm not saying that just because I don't
want anything to do with this business.

76
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:59,230
Have you looked at their offer?
A lot of money. Stock options?

77
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,423
Do you have any idea
how arrogant you are?

78
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,828
You don't get to decide
what we're doing.

79
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,626
I own half, Dave.

80
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,028
You haven't spent the last
11 years working here.

81
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,224
You didn't give up
anything for this.

82
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,833
Is this really what you want...

83
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:14,184
...or are you trying
to make a dead man happy?

84
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:18,506
We should have this
conversation later.

85
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,505
- Why can't she be a part of this?
- Thank you.

86
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,905
Nate, this is all I know.

87
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:31,948
Stay and run the place for Kroehner.
Go to law school like you wanted.

88
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,068
Take my trust fund.
I'll take the cash.

89
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,750
I think Nate's right.

90
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,233
Who knows how long any of us has left?
We should do what makes us happy.

91
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,876
Fine, sell, what do I care?

92
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,068
- You mean it?
- Sure.

93
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,671
Let's just invalidate my entire life.

94
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,278
I'll go to Gilardi today
and tell him our decision.

95
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,040
Oh, I don't know.
I guess the one with the satin interior.

96
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,792
Ma, there were five with satin interior.
Let's just go with the Classic Regal.

97
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,598
- I liked the White Pearl.
- The Classic Regal will be fine.

98
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,203
Who cares anyway?

99
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:17,115
My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces
by a big, giant dough mixer.

100
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,361
Oh, Ma, Pop wasn't
in that many pieces.

101
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,764
Ma, he's gonna look just as you
remember him. Right?

102
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:30,918
It says in your brochure you have
a gifted restorative artist. Whatever.

103
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,005
Can he make sure Pop look good
enough for an open casket or not?

104
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,284
Because you know,
we'll go elsewhere.

105
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:41,448
You'll be completely satisfied
with our work. I guarantee it.

106
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,519
Humpty Dumpty, huh? Train tracks?

107
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,209
Dough mixer.

108
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,279
Can you go to St. Joseph's
to pick him up?

109
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,970
Not today.

110
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,810
It's my cousin Ramon's baby's
christening. I told you.

111
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,641
I'll give you 50 bucks extra.
A hundred.

112
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm the godfather, David.

113
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,762
Shit. I can't go because
of Mrs. Bond's viewing...

114
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,851
...and Kroehner told Marty
if he does our pickups...

115
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,567
...he'll lose all their business.
- So send Nate.

116
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:14,562
You know, I know he hates this shit,
but he's your partner now, right?

117
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:24,567
- He's, like, in a lot of pieces.
- Humpty Dumpty, I know.

118
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,051
Careful, that could be his head.

119
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,293
- Jesus.
- Or his pelvis.

120
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,886
It's probably his head.

121
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:36,576
- What happened to Rico, he get canned?
- No, he's just busy.

122
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:38,450
You new over there?

123
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,728
No, I'm just a temp.

124
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,807
I heard old man Fisher kicked.
You know him?

125
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,850
Not really.

126
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,689
Hey, no offense, pal,
you might want to call your agency...

127
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,337
...and ask for a new assignment.
- I'm already on it.

128
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:04,378
Hey, Gabe. I looked for you in the quad
this morning, but I didn't see you, so...

129
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:08,098
Maybe you stayed home because
you were tired or something, but...

130
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:13,936
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you and...

131
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:18,582
Not in any serious way,
I was just thinking about you casually.

132
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,856
Okay. Bye.

133
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,135
I wanna kill myself.

134
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:33,661
Hey, Morticia!

135
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,786
Foot slut!

136
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,265
It's such a fucking easy decision for him.

137
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:59,464
And then Mom takes his side.
Big surprise.

138
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,151
It's like I don't even exist.

139
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:03,627
Like me giving up law school
meant nothing.

140
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,984
So fight. If you really want to keep
the business, don't give it away.

141
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:11,472
See, that's just it. All day long, I've
been feeling this incredible sense of...

142
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,346
Relief.

143
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:17,183
I don't know if I want to keep it.
I could do anything. I'm still young.

144
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,990
- Right?
- Are you kidding? You're still a baby.

145
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,954
What about that one?

146
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,388
That's a little Mayberry for me.

147
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:31,387
Something simple and clean.

148
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:34,031
Like the ones that hang
in a deserted truck stop...

149
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:37,628
...when that handsome
drifter blows into town.

150
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:40,068
Of course.

151
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,671
What about that one?

152
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,198
Not bad.

153
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,276
I could see Ava Gardner
lying beneath it...

154
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,710
...plotting to steal Clark Gable
from Grace Kelly.

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,514
People start their lives
over all the time, right?

156
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,917
- That guy just cruised you.
- Really?

157
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,317
Bitch.

158
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,558
Right in front of me,
like I'm not even here.

159
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:05,718
He did?

160
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,482
And I missed it?

161
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:09,236
Oh, sorry.

162
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,003
- Oh, Ruth.
- Amelia.

163
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,362
Another casserole.

164
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:17,714
Lemon bars.

165
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,481
The kids will love them.

166
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:22,516
Don't you have candy striping today?

167
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:27,597
I did, but I told them
my best friend needed me.

168
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,362
- You've made the right decision.
- I know.

169
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,038
I never realized how much money there
was to be made in the funeral business.

170
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:37,283
Death-care industry.

171
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:40,207
And it's only gonna grow,
with all the baby boomers and all.

172
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:43,442
- Gee, there will be bodies everywhere.
- Hopefully.

173
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,766
And all in final resting places
provided by Kroehner.

174
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,040
With a little help from Fisher & Sons.

175
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,208
You know, we've had our eyes
on your operation for some time.

176
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,643
Your father was a nice guy, but he
didn't know how to run a business.

177
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:58,728
Well, my dad was never
in it for the money.

178
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:02,811
I think he was more concerned about,
you know, helping people.

179
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,401
You wanna help people,
join the Peace Corps.

180
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:08,287
- Yeah.
- Greedy little Nazi fuck.

181
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,046
So how exactly will this work?

182
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:14,609
We won't change the appearance
of your unit at all.

183
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,964
Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading,
perhaps.

184
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,564
But preparation of loved ones
will now take place...

185
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:23,324
...at a centralized location,
which services several other units.

186
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,050
Technicians on staff,
constantly producing.

187
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:29,289
So it's like a little factory.
Of embalming.

188
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,768
Preparation for visitation.

189
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,730
- We maintain a small fleet of vehicles...
- Hearses?

190
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:36,610
- Funeral carriages.
- Dead wagons.

191
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,809
Removal vans.

192
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:44,293
Once you centralize operations, you'd be
amazed how you maximize profits.

193
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,255
So in the end, we're all just
human McNuggets.

194
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,939
Just as we began.

195
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,619
I like you, Nate.

196
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,096
You hear that, buddy-boy?
He likes you.

197
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,690
Wow, you are so cool.

198
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:02,820
Your initial payment, sir.

199
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,734
The rest will follow after both our
lawyers have held up the process...

200
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:10,740
...Iong enough to justify their fees.

201
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,061
In the meantime, we'd like to send
a facilities inspector out to...

202
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:16,539
...take a look at things
as early as next week.

203
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,381
You know, like the president.

204
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:29,264
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right. Later.

205
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,537
Hey.

206
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:35,857
What's going on?

207
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,857
You fucking asshole.

208
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,937
Why is my car covered with
words like "toe sucker"?

209
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:50,109
I... I don't know. L...

210
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,462
You didn't, for instance, blab to
your friends that you bagged me...

211
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,104
...and that I sucked your toes?

212
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:00,223
I might have told one person.

213
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:05,426
Andy. He just... He asked me what I did
the night before, so I told him. I mean...

214
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,902
It's not like I thought this
was gonna work out...

215
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,991
...because I know nothing
ever works out...

216
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:17,470
...but I guess I just wanted
to enjoy this for a little bit.

217
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:21,270
Instead, the whole world's calling me
"this little piggy lover."

218
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:25,674
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,229
I mean, come on. So what?

220
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,552
- So it got out. Who cares?
- Know what I wish?

221
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:34,831
I wish that just once people wouldn't
act like the clich'es that they are.

222
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,711
This can go to Goodwill.

223
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:41,873
And this...

224
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,308
And this one too.

225
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,760
Maybe Nathaniel's clothes
are too dull for Goodwill.

226
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,274
- Does Goodwill ever refuse anything?
- Ruth. If you want to cry, cry.

227
00:15:55,481 --> 00:16:00,032
- What are you talking about?
- Just let it out. That's why I'm here.

228
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:02,472
For the last time, I'm fine.

229
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:06,311
I just think it's very interesting. You're
supposed to be making two piles.

230
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:09,162
One for Goodwill
and one for memories...

231
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:11,672
...and yet you have not
held on to one thing.

232
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,920
The memory pile was your stupid idea.

233
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,115
What can I do with Nathaniel's
old clothes?

234
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:20,841
Make pillows, a quilt?
I ought to just burn them all.

235
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:25,044
How can someone with so little
clothing have so much clothing?

236
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,203
What is this?

237
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:29,995
Nothing.

238
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,162
It's stupid.

239
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,043
Something about visiting the pyramids,
taking ballet lessons?

240
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,683
I wrote down things I might
want to do now that I'm...

241
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,686
- I have more time.
- Well, I think that's wonderful.

242
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,198
No, it's not.

243
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,118
It's stupid. I don't even want to do
any of these things.

244
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:49,207
I just did it because
some book told me to.

245
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,799
- What am I, gonna be in Swan Lake?
- Why not?

246
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,048
You see stories like that on the news
all the time. It's inspiring.

247
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,721
It's depressing. It seems so desperate.

248
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,808
Maybe it's a little desperate.

249
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:05,084
Besides, who knows?

250
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:09,242
It's always possible
you might meet a man.

251
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,843
That part of my life is over.

252
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,572
You're supposed to flip this mattress
every two months.

253
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:20,808
I do mine every 14 weeks.

254
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:25,248
Well, I can't remember ever flipping this.
It's probably been 20 years.

255
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:26,775
Come on, get up.

256
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:30,612
You haven't finished going
through Nathaniel's clothes.

257
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:35,013
Ruth.

258
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,726
Ruth, how can I help you?

259
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:40,930
You can lift this up with me.

260
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:44,775
An uncovered mattress is so sad.

261
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,652
Help me turn this over!

262
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,536
All right.

263
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,331
Okay.

264
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,052
All right.

265
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:08,891
Does it feel any different?

266
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,934
No.

267
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,542
Save our park!

268
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:24,784
Save our park!
Save our park!

269
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:29,025
Save our park!
Save our park!

270
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:33,140
No more money for politicians!
Money for parks!

271
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,144
Save our park!
Save our park!

272
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:02,706
What are you doing?

273
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,348
You have a gift.
You can help people.

274
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,702
Fine.

275
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:14,508
Go back to peddling soy milk
and nailing waitresses.

276
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:16,591
What do I care? I'm dead.

277
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:20,909
Move it, asshole!

278
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:26,750
Save our park!
Save our park!

279
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,469
So now you don't want to sell.

280
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,671
- I know it sounds crazy.
- No, not at all.

281
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:35,392
We'll keep the business for the rest of
the day, then sell it again tomorrow.

282
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,269
- Hear me out.
- This is a good system.

283
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,867
We'll sell in the mornings,
keep it in the afternoons.

284
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,229
Sometimes, we sell again in the evenings
when we can't make a decision.

285
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,236
David, you're not being fair.

286
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,794
When I didn't want to sell,
you could've cared less.

287
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,352
When Nate doesn't, you listen.

288
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,315
Okay, I'm a terrible mother, who's
responsible for all your problems. Happy?

289
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:00,032
So you had some revelation, and
now you wanna be a funeral director?

290
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,995
- How long is that going to last?
- He does have a point, Nate.

291
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,354
- You don't always stick with things.
- You can't be in the same room...

292
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:07,517
...with a dead body.

293
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,761
I know, but there's a reason for that.

294
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:14,322
This is what I'm supposed to do.

295
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:17,118
Which is why I've spent so much time
running away from it.

296
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,361
My whole life, I've been a tourist.

297
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,718
Now I have the chance to do some
good instead of just sucking up air.

298
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:37,804
I know it's a lot to ask of you, I know,
but I just really think that we can do this.

299
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,363
You and me, together.

300
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,725
Brothers.

301
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,999
Like we used to be.

302
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,888
We could still sell to Kroehner
and both manage Fisher & Sons.

303
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,320
Yeah, but then we're just
spokesmodels...

304
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,204
...working to make fat Republican
stockholders richer.

305
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:59,720
Kroehner doesn't give a shit
about people. We care.

306
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:03,766
- We can help them through their grief.
- This is a business, Nate, not a charity.

307
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,361
Of course it's a business, but...

308
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,564
...it's more than that, and you know it.

309
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,728
Okay.

310
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:18,162
Great.

311
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:21,573
I'll call Gilardi and tell him
he can kiss our collective ass.

312
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,049
Language.

313
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:27,054
Maybe Dad knew what he was doing.

314
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:35,773
You did not have to waste this stuff
on me.

315
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,968
Oh, please. My parents got a case of it...

316
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:42,410
...from some TV movie they
were technical advisors on.

317
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,769
Some serial-killer thing for cable.

318
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,051
Oh, they're such whores.
They'll do anything.

319
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,533
Gosh.

320
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:52,698
Can you believe this
stuff is expensive?

321
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,937
You know, I've always wanted to tell off
some corporate suit, some...

322
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:01,213
...greedy little
Nazi fuck, you know?

323
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:03,575
That's very hostile.

324
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,491
No, I was very diplomatic. I just said,
"Thanks, but we changed our minds."

325
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,898
What did he do?

326
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,253
He didn't do anything.
What's he gonna do?

327
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:15,820
- This is completely unacceptable.
- The Baxters changed their mind.

328
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:20,063
- They're going with the Unger Mortuary.
- Was there a reason?

329
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,895
They probably just underbid you.

330
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,777
Hal Unger never underbid anybody.

331
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,978
He moved to Florida. They were
bought out by Kroehner months ago.

332
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,063
Sign here.

333
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,745
You know...

334
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:39,021
...I didn't just decide to stay in
Los Angeles because of the business.

335
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:42,220
- I had another reason.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this.

336
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:46,104
- I've got such a nice buzz going.
- It was you.

337
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,184
Nate, get serious.

338
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:50,426
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

339
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,508
You're staying here because
you found something you want to do.

340
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,580
I am the extra bonus
that probably won't work out.

341
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,101
Sometimes your honesty
gets really tiresome.

342
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:06,180
- I don't want any children.
- Who said anything about children?

343
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:08,543
I was referring to you.

344
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:11,028
I got something for you.

345
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:24,546
Open it.

346
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,707
Glenn Miller Orchestra
at the Hollywood Palladium.

347
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,715
Brenda, this is so cool.
I've never been to the Palladium.

348
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:37,273
You grew up in L.A., and you've never
been to the Palladium? Pathetic.

349
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,432
These are for three weeks from now.

350
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,914
How'd you know
I wouldn't be in Seattle?

351
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,075
I didn't.

352
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,240
Morning, Rico.

353
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:39,768
Just what I need, another boss
breathing down my neck.

354
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,799
Put me to work.

355
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,365
Hello?

356
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:05,562
Pregnancy's kicked Vanessa's hormones
into overload. I gotta talk her down.

357
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:09,163
If you wanna help, take Mr. Romano
out of the bag and put him on the table.

358
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:12,729
Remember, breathe through
your mouth, man. He's pretty ripe.

359
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,493
Oh, Christ.

360
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,695
- Nate.
- Great, look what you made me do.

361
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,539
Oh, gross.

362
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,659
I want to talk to you
about something.

363
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:03,619
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
a little busy swimming in a man's guts.

364
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:08,140
I don't know what this is.

365
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:12,894
I'm picking up a part of a person,
and I don't even know what part it is!

366
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:16,380
Fine, I'll talk to you later.

367
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:17,539
Oh, God.

368
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,544
Sorry.

369
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,939
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,946
I work here now.
I have to be a part of things.

371
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,982
Let Rico take care of him.

372
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:51,024
I have a job for you that's much better
suited to your particular talents.

373
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:07,264
Morning, Nate.
Lovely day, isn't it?

374
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:09,623
I've seen better.

375
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:13,269
I only wanted to say hello,
seeing that I'm your new neighbor.

376
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:18,550
We just bought that house
across the street.

377
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:22,146
Got it for a song too.

378
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:26,906
Oh, and by the way, we're planning to
put you out of business in six months.

379
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,995
They're opening a Poseidon Society
across the street?

380
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:31,993
That's right.

381
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,427
What is a Poseidon Society?

382
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,346
They sell cremations, cheap cremations.
Now, for a fraction of what we charge...

383
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,356
...you can dump off the relative
you never really liked...

384
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:44,072
...at the Torch Mart across the street.

385
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:47,191
I guess we have to just
continue to do our best.

386
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,957
And how exactly do we do that?

387
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,435
You know Lou the florist,
that sweet old guy?

388
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,393
He just upped what
he charges us by 200 percent.

389
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,360
And that chemical dealer
on Figueroa is now suing us...

390
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,633
...over some nonexistent
shipment of cavity fluid.

391
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,561
Every other supplier that we have
in common with Kroehner...

392
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:07,595
...suddenly developed
some problem with Fisher & Sons.

393
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,679
For some reason,
by the name of Kroehner...

394
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:12,477
...the Health Department
is going to inspect us next week.

395
00:28:12,683 --> 00:28:15,038
Yeah, so what? Isn't everything clean?

396
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:19,397
Yes, but any inspection means
we have to update something.

397
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:23,075
If it's the ventilation system, we're sunk.

398
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:26,198
We should've sold.

399
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,557
Nate? I'm having a problem.

400
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:33,038
You don't happen to have
Mr. Romano's foot on you, do you?

401
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,677
Do you remember picking up the foot?

402
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:43,040
I think so, but my eyes were shut,
and I was trying not to vomit.

403
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:45,637
I'm not happy.

404
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,001
Well, that's very interesting, David,
because I'm ecstatic.

405
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:54,120
Maybe the morgue
never gave us that foot.

406
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,046
Both feet are listed
in the paperwork, Nate.

407
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,402
Just think, Nate. Is there
any other point you could've lost it?

408
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:02,602
- Lost what?
- Nothing.

409
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:06,361
If you lost something, look under the
bed. That's where things always turn up.

410
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:09,723
- I doubt that applies in this case.
- That's what people always say...

411
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,572
...then they find what they're
looking for under the bed.

412
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:16,289
- Mom, we're really busy down here.
- The upstairs machine is broken.

413
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:17,973
I called the repairman but...

414
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,052
Oh, my God, what is this?

415
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:28,084
Someone left a Kleenex in their pocket,
and now it's all over everything.

416
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,324
It's disgusting.

417
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,127
Nate, retrace your steps.

418
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,455
Is there any other point
you could've lost the foot?

419
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:44,335
I almost dropped him at the morgue,
but the bag didn't open.

420
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,532
I tripped on the stairs,
but nothing fell out.

421
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:51,174
Banged into the freezer.
Spilled him onto the floor...

422
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:55,089
- And I picked him up from off the floor.
- It should be here.

423
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,775
I'd say it's an $8 million lawsuit.

424
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:02,377
At least.

425
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,703
- Here she comes.
- Like my new shoes? They're size 12.

426
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:15,972
Toe slut.

427
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,304
Amelia?

428
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:08,151
It's me, Ruth.

429
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:11,982
Your best friend needs help.

430
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:27,947
Is he all put together?

431
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,945
- Oh, he's 100 percent there.
- Absolutely.

432
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:33,385
I'd like to see him.

433
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:40,036
I'm sorry, our embalmer
is a little on the artistic side.

434
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:42,911
He gets crazy if he has any input.

435
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,268
It's best to wait until
we're completely done.

436
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:48,269
One more thing.

437
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,832
His shoes.

438
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,519
- What are you, an idiot?
- Those are his favorite shoes.

439
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,395
He has perfectly comfortable loafers,
which would be much more appropriate.

440
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,516
Yes, I myself have loafers
which are just like walking on air.

441
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,360
We should've just
told her the truth.

442
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:11,201
"Sorry, Mrs. Romano, but my idiot
of a brother lost a part of your husband."

443
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,359
Yeah, that would've worked.

444
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:14,757
Where are you going?

445
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,442
I have someplace I have to be.

446
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,442
When I return, I hope to
be greeted by a foot...

447
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:22,602
...a solution as to how to stop
a billion-dollar corporation...

448
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:26,957
...from putting us out of business
and pruned hedges.

449
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,756
- Aren't you glad you're out of the house?
- Yes, this is just what I needed.

450
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,083
We should try and get a seat
right in front.

451
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:40,962
- I'm placing a bet.
- We should just try and enjoy the day.

452
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,558
I don't see why we need to gamble.

453
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,563
That's sweet.

454
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:52,039
You both look so happy.

455
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:54,241
It's just an act.

456
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,526
Just enjoy it while it lasts,
which isn't very long.

457
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,120
Excuse me?

458
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:03,243
You think you have forever,
but you don't.

459
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,602
Soon you start to get on each
other's nerves...

460
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:09,365
...then you don't tell the other person
as much as you used to.

461
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,133
What's the point?
You thought they understood you.

462
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,130
- But they never did, not really.
- Ruth.

463
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,847
Finally, not only do you not
tell him anything real...

464
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:18,646
...you actively start lying to him.

465
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:22,447
Then when you think it can't get
any worse, he up and dies.

466
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:28,888
- I think I see a shorter line over there.
- Bye.

467
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,732
No matter what you do,
you end up alone!

468
00:33:31,936 --> 00:33:34,530
Not knowing who you are
or what you really want!

469
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:38,696
Ruth, Ruth, why did we
come here today?

470
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:42,648
To have fun. Aren't you having fun?

471
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,053
I think it's wobbling.

472
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:51,047
It just looks like it's wobbling because
you've been staring at it for so long.

473
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:53,330
It's definitely wobbling.

474
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,292
You're hallucinating.

475
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,455
Life is strange.

476
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,539
If one of those tiny screws
isn't screwed on tight enough...

477
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,733
...that thing could fall
and kill us instantaneously.

478
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,536
Just chop us to bits like a Cuisinart.

479
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:10,973
And an assassin with a semiautomatic
could walk through the door...

480
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,732
...and spray our brains all over the place.

481
00:34:14,943 --> 00:34:20,302
The sun could become a supernova
and engulf the entire planet in flames.

482
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,381
David Fisher.

483
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,304
We just got a call from Claire's school.
She's in trouble.

484
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,898
- Can't Mom handle this?
- She's MIA.

485
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:36,179
And besides, I think you might be
interested in what they told me.

486
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,186
What? Start from the beginning.

487
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:45,223
Jesus.

488
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:49,867
Okay, I'll be right there.
Until then, tell Nate to...

489
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:52,503
Oh, great, he's MIA too?

490
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,065
All right, bye.

491
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,746
There's a rumor going around school
that my sister put a dismembered foot...

492
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:04,500
...into some boy's locker.
- Shut the fuck up.

493
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:23,070
She did it. I know she did.

494
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,027
Where's the foot now?

495
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:28,146
I don't know.
The student who found it...

496
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:31,109
...denies that it ever happened.
- Okay, where's your sister?

497
00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:33,784
No one knows.
A police report has been filed...

498
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:36,545
...and now Mom is supposed to meet
with the principal.

499
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:39,225
I don't understand kids.

500
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,793
When I was her age, I never
would've taken a foot.

501
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:45,354
David, I can help. I'm a cop.
That's what I do for a living.

502
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:49,279
You find feet?

503
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,478
What the fuck am I gonna do?

504
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,271
Tell me who lived here again.

505
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,159
The Fritzens.

506
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,834
I have totally fucked things up.
Kept us from selling.

507
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,590
Now we're gonna go under, and it's
because of me. I'm a fucking moron.

508
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,758
You used to hang out over here?

509
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:11,513
Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play in here
after school. Both her parents worked.

510
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:16,238
Brenda, this is serious.
My entire family could go bankrupt.

511
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:21,434
So swallow your pride,
go back to the corporation and sell.

512
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:26,875
They'll cut their offer in half now,
knowing we're so quick to buckle under.

513
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,078
Plus, I really don't wanna let
that greedy little Nazi win.

514
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:33,084
Oh, so this is a pissing contest?

515
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:42,526
Nate, I'm going to kiss you!

516
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:48,600
I lost someone's foot today.

517
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,961
Sorry.

518
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,488
I really thought I had, like, this...

519
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,524
...profound revelation.

520
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,961
Fuck, if this isn't what I'm supposed
to be doing with my life, then what is?

521
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:09,642
Living it.
And you're doing that, so relax.

522
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,322
You don't give a fuck about
what I'm going through.

523
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:18,643
Sure. As much as I can, given we've
known each other less than a month.

524
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:27,845
There's no big investment. I mean, that's
part of the appeal for both of us.

525
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:31,487
Right?

526
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,693
Right?

527
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:53,018
Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me
in this room. I wouldn't let her.

528
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:57,612
- You can't control things. Nobody can.
- Shut up.

529
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,209
There's only one thing that's certain.

530
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:06,778
- Everything changes.
- Shut. Up.

531
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:29,699
I already talked to the cops.

532
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:32,374
I don't understand why
I have to go through this again.

533
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:35,054
- Because this time I want the truth.
- Man...

534
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,940
A witness already said she saw you
running down the hall...

535
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:41,184
...screaming the crazy funeral-home
girl put a foot in your locker.

536
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,106
It was a joke. It was just a joke.

537
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:45,822
She's kind of a loser,
and we all pick on her.

538
00:38:46,028 --> 00:38:49,783
- She totally asks for it.
- Modern technology is really something.

539
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,782
- I don't care, man.
- You should.

540
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:57,539
We have chemicals we put on your hands
to see if you've touched human remains.

541
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,661
No way.

542
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,385
You want to tell me
what really happened today?

543
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,343
L...

544
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:09,264
Who's that?

545
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,664
That's my partner.

546
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:15,228
You better be glad you don't have to
mess with him.

547
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,901
That guy's into some crazy-ass shit.

548
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:21,151
Now, either you can tell me
where you put the foot...

549
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:24,664
...or you're gonna be dealing with
that crazy-ass motherfucker.

550
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:47,267
Big Shirley by a nose!

551
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,352
She won!

552
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,033
Oh, God, I just can't believe it.
I won $ 16.

553
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,559
I told you this would be fun.

554
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,958
- How much did you win?
- I don't know.

555
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,550
- Four thousand.
- Four thousand what?

556
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,957
Dollars.

557
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:21,356
And by the way, I had an affair
with a hairdresser last year.

558
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:26,355
- You did?
- Yep.

559
00:40:38,447 --> 00:40:41,405
Are you a cup?
How many cups are you?

560
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,759
I'm a loaf of bread.

561
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,566
Hello?

562
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:50,283
Okay. Talk slowly.

563
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:56,648
I'm gonna see you in a few hours.

564
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,160
Slow down. Slower.

565
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,362
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

566
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:06,120
- Because you have to.
- Brenda.

567
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:10,810
Just stay there.
I'll call you in a half-hour.

568
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,525
- Promise?
- I promise.

569
00:41:14,613 --> 00:41:18,492
- Who was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

570
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:22,726
- I gotta go.
- Brenda, who was it?

571
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:27,373
Just someone else, okay?
Just back off.

572
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:31,933
I can't deal with this right now.
I'll call you.

573
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:42,247
I'm glad you're staying in town.

574
00:41:48,658 --> 00:41:53,938
- He threw it out of his car?
- He was taking it to show some friends.

575
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,177
Then it hit him,
he might get in trouble.

576
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,372
What with people not supposed to
be in possession of others' feet.

577
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,015
- He tossed it out.
- I've gotta get home.

578
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:04,416
Just drop me off, and I'll
pick up my car later.

579
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:07,500
All right, I'll take a look
where he said he tossed it.

580
00:42:07,702 --> 00:42:11,661
- You don't have to do that.
- Hey, how can I sleep?

581
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,933
Knowing that there's
a foot on the loose?

582
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:18,819
- You lost $25,000? It's just gone?
- I suppose it still exists.

583
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:21,140
It's just not mine anymore.

584
00:42:22,024 --> 00:42:25,700
- I'm waiting for an explanation.
- Don't talk to me like a child.

585
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,099
I was on a...

586
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:29,023
What do you call it? A roll.

587
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:32,263
So I kept betting more and more,
and I just felt so good...

588
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,379
...like I was living someone else's life.
I was up $9000!

589
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,862
And then I started to lose.

590
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:43,458
And then I started to feel like me again,
and so I kept betting more and more...

591
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:46,501
...and losing more and more.
- You should've been more careful.

592
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,826
I don't want to be careful.
I want to feel alive.

593
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,021
There should be a way to do that
that's a little less expensive.

594
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,784
I have a right to make mistakes, Nate!

595
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,379
You of all people shouldn't
begrudge me that.

596
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:05,665
What?

597
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:13,343
I lost $25,000. Okay, you got it
out of me. Now leave me alone!

598
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:36,832
Hey.

599
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,708
Claire?

600
00:43:40,557 --> 00:43:42,787
- You're David's friend.
- Keith.

601
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:46,391
What's going on?

602
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:51,828
Not much.

603
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,318
So where's Claire now?

604
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,079
I gotta say I'm totally relieved.
That I didn't lose it.

605
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:06,917
Hey.

606
00:44:13,122 --> 00:44:15,683
Nice job, Rico.

607
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,839
- Thank you.
- Boy, they did do a marvelous job.

608
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,993
They ought to, they charged a fortune.

609
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,555
Can I assist you, Miss Romano?

610
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:35,119
I know it's silly...

611
00:44:35,326 --> 00:44:39,400
...but I just wanted to see with my own
eyes that Pop's all put together right.

612
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,643
We get to do that, don't we?

613
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:54,608
Okay. Good.

614
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:05,490
I think I'll be able
to sleep much better now.

615
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:20,206
- Rico, you gave him a foot?
- Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:22,291
I thought it was for the best.

617
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:24,689
Remember that leg of lamb
that your mother had...

618
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:27,409
...in the back of her freezer for forever?
- Okay, stop.

619
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,413
Embalmed, wrapped in latex
and duct tape.

620
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:35,209
I was following him home
to get it back when I saw him toss it.

621
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,884
Now I've been here for
hours, and I can't find it.

622
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:41,089
- Describe it to me again.
- It's a foot.

623
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,891
Why did you take it in the first place?

624
00:45:44,097 --> 00:45:47,568
Well, at the time, it seemed like a good
way to pay him back for something.

625
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,133
I just wanted to shake him up.

626
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:54,048
I don't understand how guys
can be so unshakable.

627
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,895
I know what you mean.

628
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,493
Did you ever suck a guy's toe?

629
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:06,937
Yeah.

630
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,772
Me too.

631
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:17,139
Have you been
watching Mrs. Romano?

632
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:19,421
Yeah.

633
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:21,899
Been watching her all night.

634
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:23,935
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

635
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,898
Casket climber.

636
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:30,297
Her? She doesn't look that energetic.

637
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:34,261
Yeah. Those are the ones
that really go for it.

638
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:38,335
So we should probably have
a conversation with Rico...

639
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,697
...about what's going on with Kroehner.

640
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:44,223
Okay.

641
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:48,417
So there was no baby christening
the other day. I lied.

642
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:51,499
But I only took one
meeting with Gilardi.

643
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:55,861
- You met with him? Why?
- Hey, Gilardi called me, okay?

644
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:58,379
I have the right to consider my options.

645
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,945
My father put you
through mortuary school.

646
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:07,989
- I wanna go with you!
- Mrs. Romano! Mrs. Romano!

647
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:09,261
- It's okay.
- Mommy!

648
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:12,225
Grab her legs! It's okay.
It's okay. Here we go.

649
00:47:12,432 --> 00:47:14,184
- Here we go, Mrs. Romano.
- I'm sorry.

650
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,909
I give up.

651
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:27,110
It's not here.

652
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:32,468
This probably isn't over.

653
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:39,867
If there's a lesson to be learned, it's
that your actions have consequences.

654
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:42,875
Yeah, well, Gabe should learn that.

655
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:50,669
I know you and my brother are,
like...

656
00:47:51,279 --> 00:47:53,031
...gay.

657
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:57,756
Okay.

658
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,118
What do you see in him?

659
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:09,959
- He's just David, you know?
- I know. That's why I'm asking.

660
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:15,281
He is smart. He's kind. He's funny.

661
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:20,592
I know he can be a little uptight,
but underneath that, he's...

662
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:26,159
...such a little boy. Innocent.

663
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:27,400
And I like that.

664
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:32,082
Most of the men I meet, well...

665
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,641
...they kind of just want me
to be one thing.

666
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,156
What, like, big, black sex cop?

667
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:40,757
"Sorry I was speeding, officer, I guess
you'll have to punish me now."

668
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:42,366
Yeah.

669
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:47,164
And I don't want to be that.
Rent a video.

670
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:48,966
David...

671
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,639
...he gets me.

672
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:57,325
When someone sees you as you
really are and wants to be with you...

673
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,204
...that's powerful.

674
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,846
Whatever.

675
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,729
I wish I could know
the David you know.

676
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,926
You could be a little nicer to him.

677
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:17,124
He's under a lot of stress...

678
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,972
...with that cremation place
opening across the street.

679
00:49:20,773 --> 00:49:23,891
What cremation place?

680
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:26,210
She stole a foot?

681
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,007
From a person?

682
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,764
Yes. Would it have been better
if it was an animal's?

683
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,044
A little bit.

684
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:36,692
You wake up one day
and your baby's stolen a foot.

685
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:40,446
- Where have I been?
- Losing $25,000.

686
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:46,289
Hey.

687
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:54,613
Okay, I've had a long day.

688
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:58,416
Oh, David, I ran into your friend Keith.

689
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,176
- Who's Keith?
- You met at Dad's thing.

690
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,010
- I never met a Keith.
- Yes, you did, the cop.

691
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:07,939
I asked him to help out.

692
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:11,134
He'll see what he can do
about there not being an official report.

693
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,856
Why does this person have to be
so involved in our life?

694
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:17,453
Claire, we should probably talk about
getting you some help.

695
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,214
You are not my father.

696
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:24,614
If you need a project, get a dog.

697
00:50:25,744 --> 00:50:28,782
Keith says the school's probably
gonna make me see a shrink anyway.

698
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,623
Oh, dear.

699
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:32,861
By the way, that house
across the street?

700
00:50:33,786 --> 00:50:35,105
It's on fire.

701
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:59,904
I guess this should solve
all your problems.

702
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,942
Freckles!

703
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:22,067
Freckles!

704
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,310
Here, girl!

705
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:33,383
Freckles!

706
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:48,642
