1
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,476
- I am such a fucking idiot!
- No.

2
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,986
- I should've dumped him years ago.
- Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,955
- I feel 20 pounds lighter.
- More like 180 pounds.

4
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:04,753
- What do you think he's doing tonight?
- Oh, he's fucking his little grad student.

5
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,427
Thinking he's king of the world.

6
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:12,716
God, I wish I knew who invented Viagra.
So I could shoot him.

7
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,398
- I'll drink to that.
- Hear, hear.

8
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,355
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, it fell down my shirt!
Hold this, hold this, I have an idea.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,674
Wait. Driver. Hey, driver.

10
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:28,912
Take us to Miyagi's, okay?
Because I feel like dancing.

11
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,192
Look what I found.

12
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:36,920
Oh, promise me,
no dancing on the tables tonight.

13
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,159
You just open this.

14
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,718
Hold it. Hold it.

15
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:48,162
- Come on.
- Come back down, honey.

16
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:51,556
- Come on.
- I'm king of the world!

17
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:56,839
I'm king of the world.
I'm king of the world!

18
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,560
This is how you study
for the funeral director's license?

19
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,921
You must really like wearing a suit.

20
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,167
There's always a chance
we might get a walk-in.

21
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:41,647
There's always a chance
we might get abducted by aliens.

22
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:48,931
What's the longest we've ever gone
without a body?

23
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,288
I remember Dad saying something
like nine days during the '84 Olympics.

24
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:56,246
"The great drought of '84."

25
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,202
Dad used to do Walter Brennan:
"Come on, little Luke...

26
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:02,292
...let's stitch this dead guy up
because Ma's made a mess of catfish...

27
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:05,214
...and I'm powerful hungry."

28
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,684
Okay, well, thank you
for making me feel like an idiot.

29
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:13,929
No, I just... You knew
a whole side of Dad I never did.

30
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,369
Nine days, huh?
We just might beat that.

31
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:22,536
"When a family places money
in a funeral trust for a pre-need...

32
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:25,337
...how much money can the funeral home
use for other purposes...

33
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:27,927
...until the family
requires your services?"

34
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,174
Fifty percent.

35
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,567
- Twenty-five percent?
- Zero, none.

36
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,935
I knew that.

37
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,174
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me,

38
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,019
It's about time. I've been calling you
for six days straight.

39
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,452
Yeah, I've been Incredibly busy.
Lots of new clients, sorry.

40
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,937
- How's Billy?
- Better.

41
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,611
It only happens once a year, you know?
Twice at the most.

42
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:59,176
- So when can I see you?
- I don 't know, Tuesday?

43
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,180
- Is he staying with you?
- Yeah, just for a few more days.

44
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,534
Listen, I gotta go. I'll call you, okay?
I promise.

45
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,374
We think we're weird,
being undertakers' kids?

46
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,495
Be thankful our parents weren't shrinks.

47
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,821
"How many days does a family have
to cancel a contract for services?"

48
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:19,937
I get sick of this bizarre behavior
I'm supposed to figure out.

49
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:24,144
- She's pissed when I can't. It's neurotic!
- Would you concentrate on this, please?

50
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,503
You need to get your license
so you can handle your share of things.

51
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:30,174
- "How many days...?"
- Three days.

52
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:35,656
It's not exactly the California bar, David.
Come on. Make me earn it.

53
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,736
"When a funeral home
advertises their services...

54
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:43,624
...which two pieces of information are
legally required on all advertisements?"

55
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:56,623
I'd start with some heavy-duty
armature material and plaster of Paris.

56
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,861
Mastic compound for her face,
tissue builder and wax for her features.

57
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,059
I'd finish her off with a good sealer.
She'll leak like a garden hose.

58
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:13,470
A little airbrushing and a high-quality
foundation and she's good to go.

59
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:19,223
- How much time would you need?
- At least a day to do it right.

60
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:24,674
- The Fishers can spare you for a full day?
- I'm not auditioning for you.

61
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,832
This is a one-time freelance job
and I use my own materials.

62
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,672
Kroehner's texturizers, they blow.

63
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,343
- How much?
- 1500.

64
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,913
Okay.

65
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:40,511
For someone with your talent,
that's a bargain.

66
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:46,552
Stop blowing smoke up my ass.
I'm not quitting the Fishers.

67
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:50,834
- Mr. F. Put me through school.
- Have her done by 5.

68
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,427
And she'd better look flawless.

69
00:06:56,718 --> 00:07:02,191
Don't think about how steep it is.
You've got eight more miles.

70
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,628
Come on, keep it moving.

Carlos Castaneda can blow me.

76
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,479
Tell me about it. Where's the "spiritual
transcendence" part from the brochure?

77
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,877
This is like fucking boot camp.

Have l...? Have I thanked you
for getting me high this morning?

79
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,598
Like 12 times.

80
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,440
- Just making sure.
- Claire, Topher!

81
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:42,242
You're straggling. You know the rules.
The group stays together.

82
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:46,916
- Period.
- Jawohl, mein Kommandant,

83
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,998
I got a new way to make money. We
rent out the slumber room for meetings.

84
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,800
- Twelve-step groups, that sort of thing.
- Are you insane?

85
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:56,798
Drunks and drug addicts
inside our home?

86
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:00,443
- The insurance issues alone...
- Then how about senior dance lessons?

87
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,996
Twice a week at 50 bucks a pop.
That's $5200 a year.

88
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:06,244
- That's six months' property tax.
- What if we've got a viewing?

89
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,201
They work around our schedule.
Old people have nothing else to do.

90
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,480
They dance here, have fun.
Who gets a call when they drop?

91
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,802
- That's not a bad idea.
- Good. They're coming here at 2.

92
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,001
No more comments about me
not pulling my weight for a while, okay?

93
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,681
Is this a new company policy,
casual Fridays?

94
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,928
- Nice of you to drop by, it's noon.
- I stayed after 9 last night...

95
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,645
...restocking and sterilizing.
You mean, you didn't check?

96
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:38,882
If it's all right with you guys,
I need the day off.

97
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,652
- Vanessa's got an ultrasound.
- She just had one last week.

98
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,844
They just want to do another one.

99
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,163
I think I should be there with her,
don't you?

100
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:49,291
- Of course, you could've called.
- I left my jacket in the prep room.

101
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:53,413
It's got my wallet, my insurance card,
all that stuff. Thanks, guys.

102
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:58,367
Great, once again I'm the asshole
and you're the cool guy.

103
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,964
You tell him tomorrow
he's cleaning out the body fridge.

104
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:02,933
I want it scrubbed, hosed
and disinfected.

105
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,086
- You tell him.
- It's Fisher & Sons.

106
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,413
- Sometimes you have to be the bad cop.
- Well, you're so good at it.

107
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:24,926
Rico!

108
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,609
Nate, please. Don't do that.

109
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,248
I got a lot on my mind
with the ultrasound, you know?

110
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,613
- David wants you to clean out the...
- The walk-in, I know.

111
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,380
Your brother's got a bug up his ass
about cleanliness.

112
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,415
I know. When we used to play G.I. Joes,
he always wanted to give his a shower.

113
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:50,338
Yeah, well. I'm running late.

114
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:52,254
Where's your jacket?

115
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:57,499
Oh, shit! I must've left it at home.

116
00:09:57,703 --> 00:10:01,013
Told you, man, I got a lot on my mind
from the ultrasound.

117
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,975
- See you.
- See you.

118
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,975
Now begins the vision quest
part of our journey.

119
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:17,133
Oh, great, now we get to starve
and sweat ourselves...

120
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:21,862
...into a hallucinogenic state of ecstasy.
- Gonna get harder in the next few days.

121
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,939
You all know how tough physically.

122
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:28,175
Now the mental challenges begin.

123
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:32,175
Okay, starting now, you guys lead.
I just follow.

124
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:38,945
So I hope, for my sake, you've all
perfected your map and compass skills.

125
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,505
- Parker.
- Oh, God. Not Parker.

126
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,700
Which way do we go?

127
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,029
- That way.
- What are you waiting for? You lead.

128
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,827
Fucking Girl Scout.

129
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:07,870
- Good call, Parker.
- So who do you think plays Parker...

130
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:11,702
...in the movie of her life?
Sandy Bullock or Julia Roberts?

131
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,744
Oh, please, she'd never rate that high.

132
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:18,072
She'd get like one of those Buffy
or Dawson 's Creek chicks, tops.

133
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:23,027
- What is that?
- This?

134
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,953
Khinkali.

135
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:30,469
It's like dumpling
with spicy meat inside.

136
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:34,988
I cannot believe
you never hear of khinkali.

137
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,875
You know, you need to go out
from the house more.

138
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:42,349
I get out. I took a very enjoyable trip
to San Bernardino just a few weeks ago.

139
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:47,189
You should come to my neighborhood.
All Russian. You would love it.

140
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:50,947
People with passion, full of life.
Not like your family.

141
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,513
- What do you mean?
- Russians speak from here.

142
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:59,510
From the heart, with their souls. Not like
Fisher, from here, like a little mouse...

143
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,352
Not like that.

144
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,473
If it's so wonderful in Russia,
you should take the first flight back.

145
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,071
In Russia, I was engineer.

146
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,917
- Knock-knock.
- Hiram.

147
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,517
Tried my hand at Jamaican chicken.
Turned out good.

148
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:21,318
- Thought you might like some for lunch.
- That's so thoughtful. Thank you.

149
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,242
- Hiram, this is my boss, Nikolai.
- Hi.

150
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,361
- She has a lunch.
- Here, try some.

151
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:32,362
- Please.
- You burned it.

152
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:36,273
- Nikolai!
- Ruth is busy.

153
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:42,037
- I'm on my lunch break.
- Lunch is over. Now we work.

154
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,997
Sorry I got you in trouble
with your boss.

155
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:51,243
Don't you worry, I can handle him.

156
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:05,081
Everybody ready and allemande left.

157
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,923
Right and left grand.

158
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,998
Good, good.
Swing your partners.

159
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,284
And promenade home.
Very good.

160
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,489
- Hey, Vanessa, is Rico there?
- No, should I page him?

161
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,125
It's nothing important.
I wanted to run something by him.

162
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:28,686
- Okay,
- Did you have your ultrasound already?

163
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,087
Yeah, last week.

164
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,164
You're not having one today?

165
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,722
Oh, yeah, yeah,
but not till this afternoon.

166
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,686
I'm sorry, Nate,
the UPS guy's at the door, I gotta go.

167
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:45,567
And I'll tell Rico you called, okay?

168
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,049
- Shit!
- Shit.

169
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:52,646
Hey! Don't say that, papito,
That's a grown-up word.

170
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:08,373
Very good, very good,
ladies and gentlemen.

171
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,250
Now, if I could have your attention
for just one second.

172
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:14,092
I wanna teach you a new figure.
You're gonna love it.

173
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,653
Your friends are gonna be
very impressed. I promise.

174
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:20,568
It's called the Hungarian Swing.
And I need a volunteer.

175
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,572
So if I could just borrow you
for one second.

176
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,691
I promise it won't hurt a bit.
It goes like this.

177
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,495
You're gonna stand right hip
to right hip.

178
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,260
Your other hand is gonna go
on your partner's waist.

179
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,572
Your left hand is gonna
go up over the head.

180
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:39,854
Now you're gonna swing
one and a half times.

181
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,662
She will turn
one and a half times...

182
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:46,736
...into the promenade position.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

183
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:51,380
Let's do it again with the music, okay?
Not so fast.

184
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,701
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
with the music. Here we go.

185
00:14:55,903 --> 00:15:00,341
Okay. And two, three, four.

186
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:13,542
Kiss him.

187
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,184
Interesting technique, where'd you
train?

188
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,856
Cypress College,
interned at Fisher & Sons.

189
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:35,345
Oh, so you're the guy from Fisher.
You got out of there just in time.

190
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:39,622
- Kroehner's gonna bury them.
- I don't think so.

191
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,027
Somebody burned down the funeral home
Kroehner was building across the street.

192
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,779
Somebody?
You ever heard of "Jewish lightning"?

193
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,421
Oh, sorry, did I offend you?
I'm Jewish, I can say that.

194
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:55,544
Kroehner burned down their own building
for the insurance money?

195
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:59,745
Trust me, it's not over. It's,
like, Matt Gilardi's personal vendetta.

196
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:02,182
Fisher is history.

197
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:08,148
Take care now, get home safe.

198
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:11,391
Aren't they a trip? I love them.
Old people still know how to boogie.

199
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:15,382
- Yeah. More than me.
- Oh, I can change that.

200
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:19,668
- I'm Kurt, by the way.
- How'd it go?

201
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,628
- Terrific.
- Great.

202
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,953
- So I guess you'll be coming back.
- I hope so.

203
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:31,153
- This really was a great idea, Nate.
- So it seems, Dave.

204
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:36,386
So, Dave.
You free tomorrow night?

205
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:41,429
Yes. We're in the middle of a dry spell.
He's got nothing but time.

206
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,396
How's about 8?

207
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:49,196
- 8, for dinner? Is... Is okay.
- Great, I'll pick you up.

208
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,310
See you tomorrow.

209
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,357
- You just pimped me out to that kid.
- That kid wants to jump your bones.

210
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:08,633
Oh, come on, David.
I watch Will and Grace, I have gaydar.

211
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay, don't say "gaydar."

212
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,313
I sure wish we could
light up that joint,

213
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:17,158
Yeah, Dennis is watching us
like a hawk.

214
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:21,436
Now that we've officially established
ourselves as the antisocial losers.

215
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:24,442
We'll just... We'll just sneak off
after we set up camp.

216
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,034
While the rest of the bush youth
groom each other for lice.

217
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,597
Hi, Claire.

218
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,678
Hi.

219
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:38,719
You...? You two are friends?

220
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:42,282
We go to the same school.
We're not exactly friends.

221
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:45,603
We're not exactly enemies, either.
We have classes together.

222
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,038
One.
Shouldn't you be leading us?

223
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:53,924
Now the guy with braces is doing it.
You know, everyone gets a turn.

224
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,925
I thought we were gonna do
daredevil shit.

225
00:17:56,128 --> 00:18:00,041
- We're just following a fucking map.
- I know, this is fucking adolescent.

226
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:03,958
- Do you guys have some pot?
- Maybe.

227
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,846
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

228
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,121
What'd you use for the cheekbones?

229
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,847
Elmer's glue, dental floss,
and modeling clay.

230
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:27,840
I should've had your work videotaped.
These lesser lights could learn from you.

231
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:29,644
I have a lot to learn myself.

232
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:33,763
- Any interest in consulting?
- My plate is full.

233
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,887
- How about something more permanent?
- What's gonna happen to Fisher & Sons?

234
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,483
What do you care, is your name Fisher?

235
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,526
Within eight months,
I can offer you your own home.

236
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:48,410
There's a position opening up
in San Diego early next year.

237
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:51,493
- I'll think about it.
- Sure, take some time.

238
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:55,291
Talk it over with your wife.
Oh, and by the way?

239
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,647
This offer lasts 48 hours.

240
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,931
Brenda.

241
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,818
Bren.

242
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:48,220
Hello?

243
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,941
Billy?

244
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:05,422
Fuck!

245
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:08,904
- Crickey.
- Who the fuck are you?

246
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:13,140
Name's Connor. Connor Thompson.
You gotta be Nate.

247
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:18,101
Oh, yeah, Brenda's
given me the John Dory on you.

248
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:22,944
- Never told me you were this territorial.
- What's with the broken glass?

249
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:26,263
One too many largies last night.

250
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:34,384
- Do you mind putting something on?
- Don't worry. I don't fancy blokes.

251
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,308
Nice pants, though.

252
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,741
- Is Brenda here?
- Doesn't look like it.

253
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,580
- Well, do you know where she is?
- Nope.

254
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,182
Oh, I'm not rooting her,
if that's what you think.

255
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,543
No, she made it quite clear
that wasn't an option.

256
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,545
Her heart's got your name on it now.

257
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,307
No, that would be her ass.

258
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:08,585
You're thinking I'm pretty suss,
aren't you?

259
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,826
Hey.

260
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:17,629
Any you guys seen Topher?

261
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:21,666
I bet you can't wait to get back
to Stepford.

262
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,434
What a freak.

263
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,477
Take it you two have met.

264
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:40,637
These took forever to dry.

265
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,909
Hey, you.

266
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,437
Apparently you were mad at me because
I went to the desert without you.

267
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,916
- No.
- What's with Crocodile Dundee, then?

268
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:04,161
- Why the fuck are you doing his laundry?
- Oh, this is really unattractive behavior.

269
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,478
Sorry,
I guess I'm just a little weirded out...

270
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:10,198
...that I keep running into
naked guys at your house.

271
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,837
They're still warm.
Thanks, Lollies.

272
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:18,523
Connor is a very old friend
from a totally previous life.

273
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:21,033
He hasn't been in L.A. For 10 years.
Don't freak!

274
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:22,962
I am not freaking.

275
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:26,521
Just exactly where
does nature boy sleep?

276
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,158
Why didn't you tell me about him?

277
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:41,758
Because I knew that you
would react like this.

278
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:48,159
I am touched that you're jealous.
Now get over it.

279
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:54,205
Because you have no reason to be.
I promise.

280
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,477
- Lf I was fucking him, I'd tell you.
- Oh, Jesus, that's comforting, thank you.

281
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:03,568
Come to dinner tomorrow.
Connor's cooking some Australian thing.

282
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,000
- And Billy's coming over.
- Oh, Billy's coming over.

283
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,009
I thought he was staying with you.
You've been fucking lying to me!

284
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:12,009
I have spent the last six days
worried sick about you.

285
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:15,328
- And you've been partying your ass off!
- Okay! L...

286
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,762
I fucked up.

287
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,602
Okay?

288
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,567
I've been under a little pressure lately.
With my brother...

289
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:30,368
...having a nervous breakdown
and everything, I was...

290
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:33,566
...just trying to simplify things.

291
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:38,967
Don't blow this out of proportion,
please, Nate.

292
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:44,211
Okay.

293
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:49,450
What time tomorrow night?

294
00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:05,208
Topher?

295
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,848
- You fucking asshole!
- Jesus.

296
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:18,656
Oh, fuck. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm...

297
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,218
- Fuck me! Fuck.
- Oh, shit!

298
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:27,255
Look, look. If she tells anybody,
no one will believe her.

299
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:30,738
Everybody thinks she's, like, crazy.

300
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:34,216
The sexual habits of the koala
are quite mysterious,,,

301
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:37,620
,,, because of their complicated
reproductive systems,

302
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:41,452
The male koala 's penis
is forked like a snake's tongue,

303
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,903
The female has two vaginas
which share a common opening,

304
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:50,462
- What you watching?
- PBS, very funny.

305
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,577
What's up?

306
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,583
Well, I just thought you should know.
I called Vanessa.

307
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:58,981
And there's no ultrasound today.

308
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:03,145
And I also think Rico took a couple
bottles of stuff from the prep room.

309
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:07,898
Shit!
Fucking Kroehner.

310
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:12,739
I'll call around, see what I can find out.
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

311
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:17,226
I was going to, but I got distracted
by you and the square-dance guy.

312
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:21,501
It's not like Rico has an exclusive
contract with us or anything.

313
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:24,428
- So he's moonlighting.
- Moonlighting's when you take a job...

314
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:27,348
...when your first job is over.
He takes a job for Gilardi...

315
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:30,348
...while with us. It's treason.
- Stop being such a drama queen.

316
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,860
Stop acting like you're honorary mayor
of West Hollywood all of a sudden.

317
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,583
He lied to our faces.

318
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:45,342
Yeah, he did.

319
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,069
Hey, Claire.

320
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:58,703
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

321
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:00,632
- I thought you and Topher...
- It's okay.

322
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:05,226
- Whatever, it's none of my business.
- No, it's okay, I just, I don't know.

323
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:07,869
I hope you won't just write me off now.

324
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:12,433
I mean, maybe it'll even, like,
break the ice.

325
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,827
Yeah.

326
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:22,545
I just kind of, you know,
think you're funny and cool.

327
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:26,512
And well, sometimes
I feel boring and lame around you.

328
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:32,634
And I think it's because, I don't know,
I kind of want to be your friend.

329
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,670
- Why?
- Why not?

330
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,198
Okay, but this is totally weird.

331
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:09,112
How's Vanessa?

332
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:14,314
She's great. Yeah.
The baby's strong as a bouncer.

333
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:16,401
How's Chloe Yorkin?

334
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:19,764
Some of your more ardent fans
in prep rooms around L. A...

335
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:23,480
...are calling this one
your Sistine Chapel.

336
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:30,405
Look. I told Gilardi
it was a one-time thing.

337
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:36,003
I mean, come on, guys, you gotta
understand. It wasn't for the money.

338
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,477
I mean, her head was like a...

339
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,964
...like a watermelon somebody hit
with a sledgehammer.

340
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,080
I mean, a case like that
doesn't come along every day.

341
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,841
What did he offer you to leave?

342
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,287
What are you offering me to stay?

343
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,130
What? You guys thought I would stay
out of loyalty?

344
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,367
Unlike you two, I have a wife and kids
to think about.

345
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,041
What do you want?

346
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:12,889
- I want to be a partner.
- That would require a significant...

347
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,845
...financial investment on your part.

348
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,804
That's what partners are.

349
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,241
Rico, let David and me talk.

350
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,843
Don't do anything until
we have a chance to counter, okay?

351
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,410
Okay.

352
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:40,613
We can work out
some profit-sharing plan.

353
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:45,971
He's finally figured out he's worth more
than we can pay him. We're fucked.

354
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:52,335
Okay, today, we're gonna climb
about 3000 feet...

355
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:57,208
...to a shelter close to the summit.
Now we have to move fast.

356
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,177
- When it gets dark, it gets cold.
- Why did you sleep with him?

357
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:03,217
I don't know.
Just to see if I could.

358
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:08,575
So who hasn't been leader yet?

359
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,612
- I haven't.
- Me, neither.

360
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,931
Claire.

361
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,616
- What?
- Which way do we go?

362
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,612
I don't know, I really don't care.

363
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:24,381
- Somebody else pick.
- Come on.

364
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:28,939
- Want to consult your map and compass?
- No, I think I lost my compass anyway.

365
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:31,299
Then borrow one from someone else.

366
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:35,820
Look, just pick someone else, okay?
Please.

367
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:46,854
Okay, that way. I think we should
go that way. It's obviously the path.

368
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,942
Okay, maybe someone else
would like to...

369
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:52,815
Hey, Claire paid her 1200 bucks too.
Doesn't she get a turn?

370
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:56,063
Don't pull me into your shit, okay?

371
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,019
Okay, look.

372
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:06,698
All right, let's all take out
our maps and our compasses...

373
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,741
It's Claire's turn, Dennis.

374
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:15,782
I think we should follow Claire.
And she said we should go this way.

375
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:22,946
Okay. This way it is.

376
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,867
- Thanks a lot.
- What?

377
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,869
Now this trip is finally starting to be fun.

378
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:37,150
I prefer busy to quiet.

379
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:43,349
Some people, they like nothing to do.
Me, it drives me crazy.

380
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:48,631
Besides, no customer, no money.

381
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:54,186
When I walking by this restaurant
every day while I going home.

382
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:57,984
It's Ethiopian restaurant.
No customer.

383
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:01,752
Every night, night after night,
no customer.

384
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:04,907
How they can make a living?
I don't know. I don't understand this.

385
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,592
I thought Ethiopian people
don't have no food.

386
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,307
Maybe that...

387
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,158
I boring you?

388
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,191
- Heavens, no.
- Good. Watch you don't cut your finger.

389
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,914
Did you really put a foot
in Gabe Dimas' locker?

390
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:52,033
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:56,521
That is like the greatest thing ever.
If anyone ever deserved it.

392
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,999
- Did you have sex with him?
- Oh, yeah.

393
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:03,275
- Did you suck his toes?
- Yes.

394
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,839
I'm gonna have to ask
the two of you to turn around.

395
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:08,956
- What?
- I'll accompany you to the last camp.

396
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:10,995
A jeep will take you back
to base parking.

397
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:13,315
You're kicking us out?
You can't do that.

398
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:17,803
Yes, we can. It's all in the contract
that you and your adult guardian signed.

399
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,964
Anyone who witnesses a group leader
having sex with a student...

400
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,835
...can be thrown out? I doubt it.
- You purposely led us off...

401
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:28,801
...the predetermined course,
endangering everyone's safety.

402
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:31,362
And I'd be willing to bet
there's drugs in your pack.

403
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:35,197
You can't go through my stuff.
You need a search warrant.

404
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:39,447
Okay? Now, look,
we can do this the easy way...

405
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:41,719
...or we can get cops involved.
What do you want?

406
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,525
- You are such a total loser.
- This is not a game, you little bitch!

407
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,965
- You are fucking with people's lives.
- Those people...

408
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,846
...are completely innocent bystanders.
Hello!

409
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:03,082
- David Fisher.
- The adult guardian of Claire Fisher?

410
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,206
- Yes, that is correct.
- I'm with Sierra Crossroads,

411
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:10,167
Your daughter was discovered with
marijuana, She's leaving the expedition,

412
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:14,207
Transportation 's on its way to take her to
her car, She should be in L, A, tonight,,,

413
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:18,168
,,, instead of Sunday as planned,
Any questions?

414
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:21,525
No. Thank you for calling.

415
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:26,610
Your dad sounds like a real tight-ass.

416
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,972
Castaneda, huh?

417
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:34,371
- People still read that?
- Look, don't even, okay?

418
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:37,170
All need for us to interact
has been removed.

419
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:44,615
- Listen, how well do you know Parker?
- Hardly at all.

420
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,326
I'd really hate it if she's one
of those people who would...

421
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:52,293
...create a huge stink and ruin my life
just for the entertainment value of it.

422
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:58,415
- Sorry, I don't really know her.
- God, I hate pissing outdoors!

423
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:01,734
Parker, don't light that.

424
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,776
So who's in charge
while you're here babysitting us?

425
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,853
- Topher.
- What?

426
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,177
He hates this whole
Sierra Crossroads bullshit.

427
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:16,533
What, are you kidding? He's
been doing it since he was 14 years old.

428
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:20,332
- You're full of shit.
- It's one of the things...

429
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:23,455
...that helped him get accepted
to Stanford.

430
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:26,815
- Topher is going to Stanford?
- Prelaw.

431
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,501
This whole experience
just gets more and more irritating.

432
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:35,573
Here's your ride.

433
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:53,856
Ten minutes.

434
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,023
Damn, she looks good.
You took Polaroids, right?

435
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:17,509
Polaroids?
I borrowed Jacob's digital camera.

436
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,499
You blended the filler material
just perfect.

437
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:28,909
Honey, she really is your Sistine Chapel.

438
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:32,821
- You think?
- Baby, you know.

439
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:37,228
- Too bad you gotta bury her.
- Yeah.

440
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,391
- She looks beautiful, doesn't she?
- Never better.

441
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,744
You should've seen her yesterday.

442
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:47,462
- You're gonna take the offer.
- I haven't decided.

443
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:51,384
No, I said, you're gonna take the offer.

444
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:55,554
- Where would I be without the Fishers?
- In a house, not some lousy apartment.

445
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,828
They treat you like a migrant worker.

446
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:04,268
- They'll never make me a partner.
- Not ever.

447
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:08,746
$ 1500 a restoration.

448
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:15,114
Tuition at SC's highway robbery,
so calling helps pay for books and beer.

449
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,271
It's either that or become a beeper boy.
I'm not quite ready to go there.

450
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,233
So, what's with
the International Male shirt?

451
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,198
This? Oh, l...

452
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,273
- I borrowed it from my sister.
- It looks good.

453
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,588
I bet it looks even better off.

454
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:40,470
So you were talking
about square dance calling.

455
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,194
It's my grandparents' group.

456
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,041
They practically raised me
after my parents kicked me out.

457
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:47,198
Kicked you out?

458
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,915
- When they found out about you?
- When my father walked in on me...

459
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:53,921
...and my high-school boyfriend
fucking on the desk in his study.

460
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:57,116
It was awful.
My mother had a complete breakdown.

461
00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:00,999
My parents eventually split.
It was a total movie for Lifetime.

462
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,633
What about you?
What'd your parents do?

463
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:06,200
When I came out?

464
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,081
My dad was okay with it.
My mom's still a little uncomfortable.

465
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,794
It baffles me that anyone
even gives a shit, you know?

466
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,517
Here you go. Here you go.
Enjoy.

467
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:20,800
- You have a boyfriend?
- No.

468
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:25,400
- Why not?
- I'm not sure.

469
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,439
You ever have one?

470
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:31,687
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah, several.

471
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,324
You've got the longest eyelashes
I've ever seen.

472
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:39,962
I've always liked older guys.

473
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,807
- I'm the older guy.
- Guys my age are idiots.

474
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,366
They're fun to fuck,
but it usually ends there.

475
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:52,126
And I hate the way they treat older men.
Tired old queen, fossil, troll.

476
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:55,050
As if we're not gonna end up there
ourselves one day.

477
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:00,763
I'm getting my master's in social work...

478
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:04,249
...with a concentration on services
for seniors, so it's a pet peeve of mine.

479
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:06,808
- Are you a top or a bottom?
- What?

480
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:13,529
Oh, I'm versatile.

481
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:17,005
Bottom, good, this will work out well.
You want to get out of here?

482
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,494
Yeah.

483
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:28,445
So the bastard carked it.
I lost my investment, my bike...

484
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:32,205
...fucking everything.
- Connor, this always happens to you.

485
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:36,655
Oh, well. I guess I can always go back
on the banana roll?

486
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:41,177
Do you remember, what was that,
that thing in Texas?

487
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:44,176
- You lost your bike in Texas!
- Oh, not that fucking woman.

488
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:47,017
Yes, it was like '95 or something.
What was that?

489
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:50,097
Well, I thought I was gonna get a root.

490
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:55,097
Hey, Nate.

491
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,649
Listen.
I'm sorry about last week.

492
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,300
I go off the meds now and then
just to feel alive.

493
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:10,097
I'm sure you must have thought
I was a total psycho.

494
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,221
It crossed my mind.

495
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:17,013
Well, I'm not.

496
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:34,016
I don't want to come
between you and my sister.

497
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,214
She's happy with you.

498
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:42,659
Happier than I've seen her
in a long time and I mean that.

499
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,825
That is so tragic.

500
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:51,266
So, what's the story? Just
another spunk to add to your collection?

501
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:58,023
So, what's there left for me to do?
Become an air hostess?

502
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,778
I think you should get a TV show
where you wrestle things, right?

503
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:06,147
- But not animals. Things.
- What kind of things?

504
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:11,982
Like household objects.
Like refrigerators.

505
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,269
And here's the title of it, right,
A Sandwich Short of a Picnic,

506
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:21,105
That's the fucking way I like it too.

507
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,183
Yeah, hey, caller,
what's your John Dory?

508
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:27,065
What fucking language
are you speaking?

509
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:33,943
Nate, buddy. Chill.

510
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:44,667
This car is, like, total Graceland
on wheels.

511
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:49,744
Total love nest.
Have you ever fucked in here?

512
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,947
Once.

513
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:56,189
I know this record exec,
a friend of my dad's.

514
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:59,275
He's got like this total
make-out van from the '70s.

515
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:02,947
He thinks it's so cool
and it's just not.

516
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:06,308
How do you think Dennis
knew I had pot?

517
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,909
So your dad died, huh?
What was that like?

518
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:17,710
I don't know.
It doesn't seem real.

519
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,549
- I never knew anybody that died.
- I grew up in a funeral home, so...

520
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,597
...I was always around it.
- Okay, was that, like, completely weird?

521
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,232
Yes.

522
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:37,319
My dad's a big shot at Disney.

523
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:40,400
Really, why don't you
go to private school?

524
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:45,552
He divorced my mom a long time ago.
He likes his new family better.

525
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:49,119
He won't give my mom alimony,
because he caught her having sex...

526
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:54,444
...with, like, this retarded guy.
- Fuck.

527
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:59,076
I'm kidding.
My mom gets killer alimony.

528
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:01,719
I just keep getting kicked out
of private schools.

529
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:08,758
I thought you were, like, this total
overachiever. Like, little Miss Perfect.

530
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:11,474
Good. That's what
I want people to think.

531
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:17,124
When in reality you're, like,
this compulsive liar, danger slut.

532
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:24,481
I thought you were,
like, this Goth arty freak girl...

533
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:31,037
...who was, like, tragic and suicidal.
- Oh, my God, that is so not who I am.

534
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,679
Nobody is ever who they seem to be.

535
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,244
Nobody interesting.

536
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,131
You told me two lesbians
took a bath in my bathtub,

537
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,601
I don't get this show.

538
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:51,605
- It's a game show.
- I know that.

539
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:54,280
I just don't understand
why people like it.

540
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:57,246
My friend Amelia
says it's her favorite show.

541
00:42:57,453 --> 00:43:02,208
It's a great show.
My son likes Once Upon a Hamster,

542
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:05,804
When I was his age,
I was crazy for Mad Magazine,

543
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:08,968
Ernie Kovacs, the Marx brothers.

544
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:14,533
Anybody that took potshots
at sacred cows. I mean, anybody.

545
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:41,534
Yeah, I loved all that stuff.

546
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:44,054
Irreverence was my drug of choice.

547
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,649
Still is, I guess.

548
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:01,577
Nate, mate.

549
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:05,896
I'm really glad you
and Lollies hooked up.

550
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:11,416
I mean, personally I couldn't handle her
playing Freud all the fucking time.

551
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:16,131
I don't give a fuck
why I am the way I am.

552
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:21,099
Well, she is a complicated woman.

553
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:23,898
No, she's not.

554
00:44:39,307 --> 00:44:42,902
I found this in a shoebox
and made you a copy.

555
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:47,979
Oh, that's killer, Billy.
Oh, it's a great shot, mate.

556
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:52,306
Oh, look at you in your sluggos.

557
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:58,784
Poor yabbie wouldn't know
if his ass was on fire.

558
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,299
Useless as the bottom half of a mermaid.

559
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,661
Put some sunnies
on your stale bottle of piss.

560
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,026
Let's have a bobbley,
you daggy deadshit.

561
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,984
Crock a bingle, you googlie.

562
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,142
Drongo.

563
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:37,112
- When was that taken?
- Two summers ago. In Perth.

564
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:40,546
I thought you said you hadn't
seen him in a decade.

565
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:44,873
No, I said Connor hasn't been to L.A.
In a decade.

566
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:46,715
Where do you sleep, mate?

567
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,988
Because that sleeping bag
hasn't moved an inch in days!

568
00:45:50,236 --> 00:45:55,265
- They sleep in the same bed, where else?
- Don't crack a fit, Nate, mate.

569
00:45:55,477 --> 00:46:00,871
- I mean, she's totally wrapped up in you.
- Oh, you just shut the fuck up, cowboy!

570
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:04,554
Okay, I didn't tell you, because
I knew you would react just like this.

571
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,595
Well, how else am I supposed to react?

572
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:10,673
I'm supposed to make an old friend sleep
on the floor to protect your macho pride?

573
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:12,995
- You have a shiatsu mat!
- Come on, man.

574
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,431
Haven't you ever slept with a woman
and not had sex with her?

575
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,960
- No!
- Outside, get some air.

576
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,876
"Go outside, get some air."
Fuck you!

577
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:30,550
I'm leaving!

578
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:37,751
Have fun with your Aussie fuck mate,
fucker!

579
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:53,158
Damn, you are versatile.

580
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:01,919
You think I'm being a possessive asshole
for wanting Brenda for myself?

581
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:05,277
Wanting to feel connected with someone
doesn't mean you're possessive...

582
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:07,762
...or an asshole.
But until there's a commitment...

583
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:09,686
...you have no claim on her.

584
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,082
A woman doesn't have to wait
to be chosen anymore.

585
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,483
- She can do the choosing.
- Lf she waits too long...

586
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:17,248
...the right guy might just move on.

587
00:47:17,728 --> 00:47:20,687
You're right, dear.
You're so right.

588
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:25,246
A chartered bus out of Vegas
overturned on the 10 last night.

589
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:29,923
Forty-four passengers.
Most of them dead.

590
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,049
- You sleep well last night?
- Yes, thank you.

591
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,324
You sleep at all last night?

592
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:41,246
- How'd the funeral director's test go?
- Oh, man, I choked.

593
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:43,841
- What a cluster fuck.
- Language.

594
00:47:44,052 --> 00:47:46,691
- You just said "asshole."
- Nate, I need you to pass that test.

595
00:47:46,892 --> 00:47:50,363
Yeah, well, Dave, I need you to
lighten up on me, starting now.

596
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,326
Hey.

597
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:02,687
First of all, I just want to thank you guys
for everything that you've done for me.

598
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:07,611
But I think it's time for me to move on.
I have to think about my future.

599
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:12,014
- My family's future.
- You're leaving us? Oh, dear.

600
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:14,366
You haven't given us a chance
to counter Kroehner...

601
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:15,890
Am I a partner?

602
00:48:22,137 --> 00:48:26,050
You guys didn't even talk about it.

603
00:48:30,098 --> 00:48:32,658
Thank you, Federico.

604
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:37,089
I'm sorry that we can't offer you more.

605
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:42,336
You will always have a job
waiting for you here.

606
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,376
Kroehner will never appreciate
how good you are.

607
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:51,618
You'll just be a part of their
assembly line.

608
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:54,970
Yeah. We'll see.

609
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:04,463
A word of advice, guys.
Don't turn your back on Gilardi.

610
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:08,061
Well, so much for loyalty.

611
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:11,620
Nate, he's given us five years.
He doesn't owe us anything.

612
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,258
Nobody owes us.

613
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:37,697
My only defense is
I think I was hallucinating.

614
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:43,947
That and the thought of you
with another man makes me crazy.

615
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,059
Sorry.

616
00:49:47,709 --> 00:49:50,177
I'm just a guy that way.

617
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:53,947
- So where's Connor?
- Oh, God, I threw him out.

618
00:49:54,149 --> 00:49:56,186
There's only so much of him I can take.

619
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,741
- So you forgive me?
- Sure, why not?

620
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:06,466
Good.
Now it's your turn.

621
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:12,348
- You want me to apologize?
- Yes.

622
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:20,028
For trying to use Billy's meltdown
and Connor's visit to push me away.

623
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:23,829
For being impatient with my very valid
emotional response to each one.

624
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:26,952
And for always asking me to adjust
my behavior and feelings...

625
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,384
...but never being willing
to do that yourself.

626
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,714
Okay, that's fair.

627
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:38,872
I apologize.

628
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:46,193
- Part of you wants me to bail.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

629
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:48,753
Why?

630
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:58,670
Because we've already gone further
than I have with anybody since...

631
00:50:58,878 --> 00:51:01,916
Since a long time ago.

632
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:07,311
Because every time I've ever believed
in a happy ending...

633
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,990
...I've gotten severely fucked.

634
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,792
Sorry.

635
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:19,390
Well, do me a favor.

636
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:22,594
Promise me from here on out
I am the only naked man in your bed...

637
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:24,918
...and in your life.

638
00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:27,801
I'm serious, Bren.
Promise me.

639
00:51:31,243 --> 00:51:33,074
I promise.

640
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,237
I love you and I want to be with you
for the long haul.

641
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:39,197
But there's a limit to the amount of shit
I will put up with.

642
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:41,918
Did you just make me
a lifetime commitment...

643
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:44,878
...right before the thinly veiled
threat of abandonment?

644
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:48,715
Well, I don't remember
using the word "lifetime."

645
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:52,515
Oh, well, I won't hold you to it.

646
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:07,526
Sorry I'm so weird about intimacy.

647
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:10,962
I guess spending your childhood
being picked apart...

648
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:15,048
...by behavioral psychologists
will do that.

649
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:18,527
Yeah, well, not being able
to sleep at night...

650
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:23,087
...because you know your basement's
full of dead people takes its toll too.

651
00:52:39,732 --> 00:52:41,688
Sorry.

652
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:47,522
Nate Fisher.

653
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,003
Remember that chartered bus
that overturned last night?

654
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,125
They were all locals.
We're getting three.

655
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:56,373
- The first family will be here in an hour.
- I'm on my way.

656
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:59,965
- And try to curb your enthusiasm.
- This will be tough without Rico.

657
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:01,767
See you later,

658
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:24,856
- Good Lord, what did they do to you?
- Don't ask.

659
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:34,810
So did Mom freak
when you told her I got busted?

660
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,375
I didn't tell her.

661
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,850
- Okay, why?
- I don't know, other stuff came up.

662
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:43,938
It seemed like a low priority.

663
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,932
- Are you going to?
- Probably not.

664
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:55,136
I'm sorry the Crossroads thing
didn't work out like you had hoped.

665
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,254
Actually, it was kind of amazing.

666
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:01,779
I think I really learned
something valuable.

667
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,057
Everything I think I know is wrong.

668
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:15,814
Hey, what happened to that guy Keith?

669
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,744
It just didn't work out.

670
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:30,781
- That's too bad.
- Life goes on.

671
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:36,145
That it does.

672
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:40,742
Well, there's work to be done.

673
00:55:11,620 --> 00:56:06,275
