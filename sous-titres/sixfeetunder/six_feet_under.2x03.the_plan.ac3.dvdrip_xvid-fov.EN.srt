1
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,939
Okay, let's go then.

2
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,036
Are you packed?

3
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,074
Don't forget the dog, honey.

4
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,049
Don't forget the dog, honey.

5
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,122
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,893
He's not in the car, is he?

7
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,298
- Why is he talking about a dog? What dog?
- We had a dog in Boulder.

8
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,907
- What is this?
- We're in the hospital.

9
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,749
You're sick, remember?

10
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,146
But you're gonna be just fine.

11
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,950
Rita, lying to him
doesn't help anybody but you.

12
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,757
Stop it.

13
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,362
- Nurse!
- It's okay to let go.

14
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,999
I'm going to beat it.

15
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,634
But maybe you can't. You don't have to.

16
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,476
Why would you say that?

17
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,510
I don't want you to be scared.

18
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,548
I don't want to die.

19
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,751
I'm not gonna die.

20
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,086
That's just your body. It's not you.

21
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,488
That's bullshit, Eileen.

22
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,300
Excuse me.

23
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,229
Here you go.

24
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,037
We're going to increase your morphine,
all right, Mr. Piper?

25
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,889
Do you see?

26
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,828
Rita, above his head.

27
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,162
The light.

28
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,658
Oh, yes, he's a good boy.

29
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,231
Better hurry up.
We've got Mrs. Piper at 8:30.

30
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,359
Yeah, I'll be right there.

31
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,828
What are you doing, Dave?
Downloading pics from mansluts. Com?

32
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,473
Great, Dave, thanks.

33
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,569
I thought we should have
all the information.

34
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,377
- I have all the information.
- I don't think you do.

35
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,848
If you don't get this treated...

36
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,580
you could have seizures with
muscular twitching, loss of verbal skills.

37
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,317
You could even have
some kind of hemorrhage at some point.

38
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,122
Or I could be in the wrong airplane
at some point, or so could you.

39
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,855
All right? Come on.

40
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,272
The Parliament. It's very elegant.

41
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,641
Yes. I like it.

42
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,142
But Michael thinks it's tacky.

43
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,083
That's the Cleveland.
It's a more affordable choice.

44
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,288
But, as you can see,
it's not quite as gracious.

45
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,957
Really? No, but it's just so self-effacing.

46
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,432
But why?

47
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,039
- Mrs. Piper?
- I'm sorry.

48
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,703
Can you excuse me for a moment?
I can't carry on two conversations at once.

49
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,214
It's exactly like that horrible IKEA couch
your mother bought us.

50
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,654
Michael claims to love this one.

51
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,420
In my opinion, he's trying to do
what he thinks his mother wants...

52
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,519
which is typical, really.

53
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,029
Fine, deny it. Why change now?

54
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,434
Would you like to sit down for a minute?

55
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,063
I'm fine. It's just Michael's here.

56
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,303
He didn't want to deal with this stuff
when he was alive.

57
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,241
You know, the funeral.

58
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,537
Now he's very opinionated.

59
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,148
I'm a psychic, so, you know...

60
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,914
That must be very interesting for you.

61
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,415
It's just more information.

62
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,233
This room has a lot of pain in it.

63
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,968
Well, yes.

64
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:51,003
You have a lot in your mind.
On your mind, I mean. Don't you?

65
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,011
Yeah, I guess so.

66
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,412
Don't worry. It's okay, all right?

67
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,881
It's all gonna be okay.

68
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,884
Thanks.

69
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,456
Okay, honey, if it's what you want.
It's your funeral.

70
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,337
Look, she gave me her card.

71
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,610
"Spiritual Consultation
and Past Life Regression"?

72
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,412
For God's sake, who does this?

73
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,546
Who spends $100 to be told
they were once Eleanor of Aquitaine?

74
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,356
Or whoever, the Marquis de Sade.

75
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,555
So what do you think happens
after we die? Heaven?

76
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,119
- Or Hell.
- Really?

77
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,261
But with angels, devils, or brimstone,
or whatever?

78
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,531
I don't know what it looks like,
or who's there...

79
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,200
but I do believe there are consequences
for the way we live our lives.

80
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:04,739
You know,
sometimes I kind of feel like Dad's around.

81
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,453
Do you ever?

82
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,250
Nope.

83
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,032
You know we have the Independent
Funeral Directors' lunch today, right?

84
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,896
Why do I have to go? That's your thing.

85
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,665
It's your thing, too, now. These are
your colleagues. You need to know them.

86
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,764
I know who they are. I met them in Vegas.
They're freaks.

87
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,470
- They're not freaks.
- Nobody likes the Brazil nuts, David.

88
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,046
Not the local guys.

89
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,606
I'm sure the LA morticians
are a lot more fun than those from Montana.

90
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,653
You're an LA mortician now, Nate.
This is your community.

91
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,520
It's polite for the first person downstairs
to make the coffee.

92
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,252
Even if that person has a penis.

93
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,261
It's also polite for the first person
who uses the bathroom...

94
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,265
to spend less than 45 minutes in there.
Even if that person has a vulva.

95
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,996
- Oh, goodness, everyone's here.
- With all their genitalia.

96
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,904
- Excuse me?
- Mom, would you like some toast?

97
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,137
No, thanks.
I have to be in the Valley by 10:30.

98
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,372
- What's in the Valley?
- I'm going to a seminar.

99
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,973
- What seminar?
- Something Robbie invited me to. The Plan.

100
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,074
Isn't that a cult?

101
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,177
No, it's one of those
self-actualization things from the '<i>7</i>0s...

102
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,348
where they yell for 12 hours
and don't let you go to the bathroom.

103
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,086
Oh, no. Really?
Should I bring some kind of jar?

104
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,357
- A jar?
- I suppose that's not much of a solution.

105
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,263
You're on your own for dinner.
I won't be back until after midnight.

106
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,461
The thought of Mom being self-actualized
is kind of making me nauseous.

107
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,703
You sure it's not the thought
of Mom pissing into a jar?

108
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,271
<i>So, Tahira,</i>
<i>why can't you forgive your father?</i>

109
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,043
<i>When I was 16...</i>

110
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,478
<i>he had a dream</i>
<i>that I had given myself to a man...</i>

111
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,682
<i>who was not the husband</i>
<i>I had been promised to.</i>

112
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,518
<i>For that, he set me on fire.</i>

113
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,820
<i>I was able to save myself.</i>

114
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,156
<i>But I had to leave the country</i>
<i>so he would not kill me.</i>

115
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,027
<i>And always...</i>

116
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,333
<i>I will have the scars from this.</i>

117
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,003
<i>That's horrible. Truly horrible.</i>

118
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,236
<i>How could he do this to me?</i>

119
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,511
<i>But as long as you hold on to that anger</i>
<i>toward your father...</i>

120
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,347
<i>you will be on fire.</i>

121
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,781
<i>You may have left the country,</i>
<i>but you are still living in the same house.</i>

122
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,593
<i>And in that house,</i>
<i>there is a room that is still burning.</i>

123
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,527
<i>Who lives in this room?</i>

124
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,033
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Your father is still living in this room.</i>

125
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,870
<i>So you never invite anyone in,</i>
<i>and you go through life alone.</i>

126
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,575
<i>You must open that door.</i>
<i>Put out the flames.</i>

127
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,704
<i>You must invite your father</i>
<i>to come visit you.</i>

128
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,980
<i>- But he won't even speak to me.</i>
<i>- That is your old blueprint.</i>

129
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,651
<i>That is what you want to believe...</i>

130
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:01,056
<i>because you are too afraid</i>
<i>to tear down the walls and rebuild.</i>

131
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,424
Come on.

132
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,053
Stop blaming the victim.

133
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,293
<i>All right, who here thinks I'm being unfair?</i>

134
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,601
<i>Be honest.</i>

135
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,345
<i>Ruth, do you agree?</i>
<i>Until Tahira forgives her father...</i>

136
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,613
<i>she will never feel safe in her home.</i>

137
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,181
- Well, maybe, but...
<i>- Speak up.</i>

138
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,584
<i>We all paid to hear you.</i>

139
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,654
<i>Why don't you stand?</i>

140
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,191
Her father did such a terrible thing.

141
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,495
I don't see why she has to have him
as a houseguest.

142
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,834
<i>If you don't agree with me,</i>
<i>why didn't you raise your hand?</i>

143
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,407
I was just trying to understand your point.

144
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,069
<i>Or do you think</i>
<i>that your opinion doesn't matter?</i>

145
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,874
<i>That perhaps you are just a guest here?</i>

146
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,415
<i>Are you a guest in your own house, Ruth?</i>

147
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,575
I don't think so.

148
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:03,315
Yes, she tiptoes around herself
like she's afraid of waking someone up.

149
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,013
<i>The only person sleeping</i>
<i>in your house is you.</i>

150
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,323
- I do have three children.
- See? She's not even listening.

151
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,920
<i>Ruth, you have to get out of bed...</i>

152
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,592
<i>open the windows,</i>
<i>and let some light into your house...</i>

153
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,660
<i>so that you can see the way things are.</i>

154
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
<i>Then, and only then...</i>

155
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,640
<i>can you begin renovating your life.</i>

156
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,305
<i>So, Tahira, are you ready to renovate?</i>

157
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,009
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

158
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,377
<i>So, when you call your father,</i>
<i>what will you say first?</i>

159
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,049
<i>Hello?</i>

160
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,249
Sorry, my beaker exploded.

161
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,056
That's okay. Catch your breath.

162
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,724
How's it going?

163
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,936
I have hydrochloric acid in my hair,
but other than that, I'm fine.

164
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,200
Really?

165
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,474
No, but I'm incredibly bored
with myself right now.

166
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,380
Let's talk about you.
How's your girlfriend? What's her name?

167
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,544
Jenny. Fine, thanks.

168
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,615
How's it going with Gabriel?

169
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,987
I have no idea.
I haven't even talked to him in two weeks.

170
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,495
Is that her?

171
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,230
- What does she do?
- She's a jewelry designer.

172
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,236
Really? Does she have a store?

173
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,933
No, she has clients and she caters.

174
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,976
But we're not here to talk about Jenny.

175
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,184
It might help to tell me
what you're going through right now.

176
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,616
It's no big fucking mystery. I mean, it sucks.

177
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:50,220
It sucks to be pretty much in love
with a guy who's too fucked-up for life.

178
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,927
- What happened?
- Nothing really. Just...

179
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,464
Whatever.

180
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,135
It's not even his fault.

181
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,935
And it fucking pisses me off.
His whole family thing is so fucking unfair.

182
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,773
And I really just thought he needed...
I don't know.

183
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,475
- You?
- No.

184
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,543
But someone, maybe.

185
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,346
Some person on the planet who gives a fuck
about him, for once in his life.

186
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,081
Yeah, I did think that would matter.

187
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,556
It does matter.
No one can ever solve someone else's life.

188
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,755
So, basically, your job is totally pointless?

189
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,899
No one but a guidance counselor, I mean.

190
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,528
There they are.

191
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,074
That's the community?
I thought this was an event.

192
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,631
It's an event.

193
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,681
- Didn't I meet one of those guys in Vegas?
- Bobo from Peaceful Haven.

194
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,548
- Right. He spits.
- Yes, he does.

195
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,713
Stan, Jack, Bobo. This is my brother, Nate.

196
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,955
- Nice to see you, Nate.
- Nice to meet you, Jack.

197
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,660
Good seeing you, Bobo.

198
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,063
Congratulations.

199
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,569
We heard you just got your license
to operate a moving funeral.

200
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,761
Yep, finally went pro.

201
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,773
- Well, sit.
- No, go ahead.

202
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,639
- No, after you. Age before beauty.
- Right.

203
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,210
David tells us that you are very gifted.

204
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,843
He does?

205
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,114
We were just giving Stan grief...

206
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,154
for poaching our customers
with false advertising.

207
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,355
That sounds like something
Kroehner would do.

208
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,020
Fucking Kroehner. Those cocksuckers.

209
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,090
Sorry. Those cunts.

210
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:38,101
So this family goes off the 405.
We get five bodies, right?

211
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,365
In truth, my walk-in only holds three.

212
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,204
So my guy is working overtime
to get everyone juiced.

213
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,110
But sometimes you have to leave them out
for an hour or two beyond regulation.

214
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,308
It happens, right?
But those Kroehner fucks...

215
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,377
are just waiting for a chance to send in
their flacky at the DCA, and boom!

216
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,322
I get hit with a giant fine and a lawsuit.

217
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,354
I will ram a plastic screw up my anus...

218
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,489
before I give in to those fucks. No offense.

219
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:13,327
- Do we have a waitress?
- Yeah, she'll be back with the fries.

220
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,105
Those fucks.

221
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,734
They are fucks. They're fucking evil fucks.

222
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,870
They're sucking up all the mom-and-pops.

223
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,574
Businesses that people
spent their lives building up...

224
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,742
They don't care about people and lives.

225
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,048
All right, we appreciate your passion, but...

226
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,489
No, all they care about is money.
It's not just our industry. It's everywhere.

227
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,356
When corporations try and squeeze out
all the competitors...

228
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,261
the further management gets from labor,
the more alienation in the workplace...

229
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,300
- the more meaningless all our lives become.
- Fuck, yeah!

230
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,166
- It's hopeless, isn't it?
- No, I don't think it is.

231
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,229
We have to stick together
and save our energy to fight Kroehner.

232
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,743
- You know, Stan?
- Yes. I love this guy. Terrific!

233
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,043
I don't know, Gary. Twice in one day?

234
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,779
Claire, this is Detective Reese.

235
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,547
Why don't you sit down, Claire?

236
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,764
Any idea where Gabriel Dimas is?

237
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,601
- Why would I?
- He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

238
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,829
Yeah, so I know where he is
every second of the day?

239
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,240
You have noticed that he hasn't been
in school for the last two weeks?

240
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,744
Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

241
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,343
I don't.

242
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,950
Did you know that he held up
a convenience store with a gun?

243
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,049
- No.
- Did you give or sell him embalming fluid?

244
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,456
No. My God.

245
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,160
- So how do you think he got it?
- I don't know. The Internet?

246
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,434
- Don't they have catalogs for that stuff?
- Maybe.

247
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,963
Be a lot easier to get it from you,
don't you think?

248
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,106
No, because I would never
do anything like that.

249
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,572
I don't even know
where they keep that stuff.

250
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,156
So it's between Ethics of Evolution
and Biogenetics, I think.

251
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,727
- Biogenetics? Really?
- What?

252
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,354
Yawn, kind of, right?

253
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,163
Biogenetics might sound dull to you,
but it's actually very smutty.

254
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,738
It's all about sperm competition
and cryptic ovulation.

255
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,044
Oh, yeah? What else you taking?

256
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,242
- I'm only doing one class.
- I thought you were going back to school.

257
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,114
I said I was gonna take a class.
I still have to work, you know.

258
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,948
Fuck, if it's only one class,
why not pick something interesting?

259
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,384
How about this religious studies class?

260
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
"Cross-Cultural Perspectives
on the Afterlife."

261
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,788
Yawn.

262
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,032
- It's not boring. It's spiritual.
- Double yawn.

263
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,602
Why don't you sign up for that
and we can meet in the quad for lunch?

264
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,802
That would be so fun.

265
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,441
We could make out in the stacks...

266
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,009
sneak into the pool at night
and go skinny-dipping on acid.

267
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,742
Sounds like you did a lot of work at college.

268
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,115
I was only in school for two years,
but I learned a few things.

269
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,451
About breaking into school property
while tripping?

270
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,483
That'll help you in life.

271
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,958
What?

272
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,293
Come on, Bren.

273
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,066
- I was just in the middle of something.
- Look, it's been a while.

274
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,609
It's not that long.

275
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,312
It's been three-and-a-half weeks,
and on Tuesday it'll be four weeks.

276
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,440
Not that you're counting.

277
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,009
Yeah, I'm counting.
I mean, have you not even noticed?

278
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,014
It's normal, after a certain point,
for sex to slow down.

279
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,723
Yeah, slow down, okay. But stop?

280
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,919
People can go months after a certain point.

281
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,160
After a certain point, okay.
Like, six years, maybe. But six months?

282
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,902
- Seven.
- Not that you're counting.

283
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,369
You've never been with anybody
long enough to know this...

284
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,809
but there is a certain ebb and flow
that happens.

285
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,374
- Not for everybody.
- It does.

286
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,817
There will be times
when you are not attracted to me at all.

287
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,155
It's just a normal ebb.

288
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,955
How long does a normal ebb last?

289
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:32,486
I don't know, but that's the kind of question
that prolongs the standard ebb.

290
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,606
<i>Did you hear about the guy</i>
<i>at the nuthouse that walked around naked...</i>

291
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,938
<i>except for a hat and gloves?</i>

292
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,808
<i>And this nurse came up to him and said.</i>

293
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,847
<i>"What do you want?</i>
<i>You can't walk around..."</i>

294
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,973
Mom?

295
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,541
<i>And the guy says, "It's okay.</i>
<i>Nobody comes around here, anyway. "</i>

296
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,681
<i>And the nurse says, "Well, what do you</i>
<i>have on the hat and gloves for?"</i>

297
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,682
- It's so late. I was kind of worried.
- It goes until midnight.

298
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,952
Was it fun?

299
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,791
It was horrible.

300
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,763
- So you're not going back?
- No, I'm going back.

301
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,430
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't want to be rude.

302
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,634
They don't care about that.
They already got your money.

303
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,645
Well, there's that, too.

304
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,144
<i>- Don't you get bored around here?</i>
<i>- Well, sometimes.</i>

305
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,258
Do you want some tea or something?

306
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,421
All right, what did you break?

307
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,322
Nothing. I was just being nice. God!

308
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,533
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,865
I was imposing my old blueprint on you.

310
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,144
Excuse me?

311
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,977
In the old blueprint of my old house...

312
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,085
you're only nice to me
when you've done something bad...

313
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,281
or when you want something.

314
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,991
- That makes me feel like shit.
- I'm sorry.

315
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,591
But it really does seem that way to me.

316
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,998
I should go do my homework.

317
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,742
They give you homework?

318
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,342
I have to write a letter to my dead mother...

319
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,849
and forgive her
for all the terrible things she did to me.

320
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,545
That sounds fun.

321
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,315
And then I have to write
a private letter to myself...

322
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,187
outlining how I want to renovate my life.

323
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,321
Good night, dear.

324
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,828
Good night.

325
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,696
<i>The shovel's in the truck!</i>

326
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,154
- That's good.
- Rico, you forget something there?

327
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,025
Shit.

328
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,427
Sorry, man.
I got about two hours of sleep last night.

329
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,470
- Augusto?
- No, Angie, Vanessa's sister.

330
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,299
She walks out on her boyfriend...

331
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,210
and comes over to wail
in our living room all night long.

332
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,544
- Women.
- Yeah, I'm telling you, man.

333
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,916
And she shows up with this suitcase,
like she's got some right now that...

334
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,415
She has fancy Hollywood friends
who flash their money around all the time.

335
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,892
I'm like, "What, you can't go
somewhere there's a guest room?"

336
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,293
Rico, I'm really sorry about that loan.

337
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,366
It's just a really tight budget.

338
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:02,100
That's okay. We got the house.
Something else came through.

339
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,334
- That's great.
- Yep, the escrow closes next month.

340
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,475
That is super, man.

341
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,006
You and Vanessa
have been together, what...

342
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,013
five years now?

343
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,453
Married five, together eight.
Man, can you believe that shit?

344
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,928
Okay, so this is sort of a personal question.
You don't have to answer...

345
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,964
but do you guys still, you know...

346
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,268
pretty much have sex?

347
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,072
We've got two kids now,
so it slows down a bit.

348
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,539
Right.

349
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,880
How slow?

350
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:51,620
Right after the baby, Vanessa's got
all the wrong hormones and stuff.

351
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:56,755
So now, maybe three or four times a week.

352
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,665
- That's too bad, man.
- Yeah, that sucks.

353
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,899
It's not like the first two years.

354
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,036
- Yeah, you better enjoy it while you got it.
- No kidding, right?

355
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,277
This moron always goes over.

356
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,618
I should go in and correct his selfish ass.

357
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,179
Let them finish their game.
We go over sometimes.

358
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:42,162
- So how's Eddie?
- He's good. Things are good, I guess.

359
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,348
Keith, what's going on?

360
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,643
I think my sister's
fucking using that shit again.

361
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,950
My mom's come up from San Diego to watch
over her, like that's gonna fix anything.

362
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,790
According to her,
everything is just fine now.

363
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,230
I'm the one that's overreacting.

364
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,334
I don't think you're overreacting.

365
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,466
Thanks.

366
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,678
- Eddie hates racquetball.
- Really? Why?

367
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,184
Poor depth perception.

368
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,845
Can't play pool, either.

369
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,391
That's too bad.

370
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,701
Let's not beat around the bush, shall we?

371
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:51,433
Biology has a long history of being abused
as an ideological instrument...

372
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,007
to justify social inequities
and amoral behavior.

373
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,445
For those of you
who have not yet read my book...

374
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,244
the central argument I posit...

375
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,684
in <i>Genes Out of the Bottle.</i>
<i>Evolution in Biotechnology...</i>

376
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,155
is that genetic engineering is,
in and of itself...

377
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:10,854
the most effective argument
against biological determinism. Why?

378
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,363
The thesis that you present so brilliantly...

379
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,196
is that though biology manifests
in behavior...

380
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:21,728
as we can see in the instinct of human
males to seek a variety of sexual partners...

381
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,264
the fact that we have
the technology to modify genetics...

382
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,278
confirms the supremacy of culture
over biology.

383
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,405
Excellent. Other thoughts?

384
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,615
I have a question.

385
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,587
Isn't natural selection still operating
though, since members of the species...

386
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:42,025
who have access to genetic technologies
are more likely to survive and procreate?

387
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,259
That kind of reasoning leads us
into a very questionable ethical terrain.

388
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,460
- Other comments?
- What kind of reasoning? Scientific?

389
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,369
You can call it scientific, but
as I discussed at great length in Chapter 2...

390
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,341
your argument is a political assertion
that privilege is biologically determined.

391
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,037
I haven't actually read your book...

392
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,103
but you can't tell me
that survival isn't easier for people...

393
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,275
who are born with a private chef
and health insurance.

394
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,048
Maybe you should read the book
before commenting on its thesis.

395
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,947
Other comments?

396
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,417
- Yes?
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

397
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:20,255
Are we not allowed to disagree with you?
I'm just asking because I'm new in the class.

398
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,664
We certainly don't interrupt our classmates.
Go ahead.

399
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,729
In your discussion of bisexual
genital rubbing among pygmy chimps...

400
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,072
you note the exchange of sex for meat.

401
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,613
I was wondering how this might pertain
to contemporary human behavior.

402
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,943
Any theories?

403
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,222
So, where do you think he is now?

404
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,391
According to his wife, he's still here.

405
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:57,457
There's a big chunk of dead meat
in a cheapo box that's still here.

406
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:01,663
But do you really believe that's him?
The essence of who he was?

407
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,439
The part of him that hoped and dreamed,
and all that other crap?

408
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,775
You tell me. You're the one
who has all the answers now.

409
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,145
I never said that.

410
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:15,380
You'd think getting hammered by a bus
would make you a little less of a dick.

411
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,720
Sure, it's possible that we go on
after we die.

412
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,860
It's also possible that,
once the light goes out, it stays out.

413
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,060
You'll never know, buddy boy,
till it's your turn.

414
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,295
See, that's what you were hanging onto.

415
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,136
Excuse me?

416
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,668
- Michael.
- Is he here?

417
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,167
He's been with me the whole time.

418
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,742
- You think he'll stay with you?
- Not like this.

419
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,610
He's just helping me get used to it.

420
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,588
I hope you don't mind, but do you
get a sense of my father at all around here?

421
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,408
No. I'm sorry.

422
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,779
That doesn't mean he's not here.
This room is packed.

423
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,814
I can't get to everyone.

424
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,143
I think everything is ready.

425
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,285
- I do see a child coming into your life.
- No.

426
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,018
- Well, it might be you.
- I seriously doubt that.

427
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,163
I'm not sure which one of you I'm reading...

428
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,132
but I'm quite sure
there's gonna be a child here very soon.

429
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,960
I'm heading out now, okay?

430
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,372
This is Federico Diaz, our embalmer,
and his baby, Augusto.

431
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,875
This is Mrs. Piper.

432
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,009
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

433
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,009
- You made his body look very nice.
- Thank you.

434
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,953
Actually, his body gave me
a lot to work with.

435
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,046
Hardly any decay for a cancer death...

436
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:03,423
- Okay, Rico, see you tomorrow.
- Okay. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

437
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,765
Here we go.

438
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:20,905
Eileen asked that I close with a reading
from Michael's favorite poet, Walt Whitman.

439
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,080
"What do you think
has become of the young and old men?

440
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,517
"And what do you think
has become of the women and children?

441
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,452
"They are alive and well somewhere

442
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,092
"The smallest sprout shows
there is really no death

443
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,130
"And if ever there was, it led forward life

444
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,723
"and does not wait at the end to arrest it

445
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,268
"And ceas'd the moment life appear'd

446
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,500
"All goes onward and outward
nothing collapses

447
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,237
"And to die is different
from what any one supposed

448
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,511
"and luckier"

449
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,515
Let us pray.

450
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,218
O Lord, bless the departed soul
of our brother, friend, and son, Michael...

451
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,224
I'm just hanging around
to help you get used to it.

452
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,656
I am used to it, Dad. It's been six months.

453
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,398
Seven. Not that you're counting.

454
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,936
God is strength. In him, I will trust.

455
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,768
Amen.

456
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,947
- Are you done?
- Pretty much. What's up?

457
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,890
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Okay.

458
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,724
Get this. Bobo sold to Kroehner.

459
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,197
- Bobo sold? My Bobo?
- Your Bobo.

460
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,031
I can't believe this. He was so committed.

461
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,798
Think he's got a plastic screw
in his anus about now?

462
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,104
- I hope so.
- That old son of a bitch. I'm gonna call him.

463
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,415
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

464
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,251
- Where's Karla?
- She's just working late.

465
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,760
- Why are you fronting?
- Go to your room now, Taylor.

466
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,620
Mama hasn't been home since Tuesday.

467
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,794
- What?
- Now.

468
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,566
- But my stomach hurts.
- I'll get you some Pepto-Bismol.

469
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,732
- I don't want none of that nasty shit.
- Then go on.

470
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,439
Shit, bitch, I gotta get my goods.

471
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,841
Don't talk to your grandmother like that.

472
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,316
Is she sick?

473
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,480
She says that every night.
She just wants the attention.

474
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,547
Can you blame her? Her mother's off,
doing God knows whatever.

475
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,788
Karla's fine. She just had to go out of town.

476
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,490
- You talked to her?
- I wasn't in when she called.

477
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,692
But she left several messages.
Besides, I'm here with Taylor.

478
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,999
Don't blow this out of proportion
like you always do.

479
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,133
<i>Hey, Mama, I'm not coming home tonight.</i>

480
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,141
<i>Derek needs some papers, and I gotta go...</i>

481
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,643
- Can't she send him his papers?
- You remember how Derek was.

482
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,079
Always getting her
to do this and that for him.

483
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,550
Yeah, like raise his kid
without a dime from him.

484
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,780
<i>Sorry, I dropped the phone. Shut up!</i>

485
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,346
<i>Anyway, I'll call you as soon as I can, okay?</i>

486
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,318
<i>Give Taylor kisses for me.</i>

487
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,159
To get the phone company records,
we'll have to file a missing persons report.

488
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,666
Keith, why must you always
think the worst of her?

489
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,032
Let's just wait till she gets home.

490
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,071
- We don't even know...
- What are you gonna do?

491
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,333
Move up here
and take care of her all your life?

492
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,398
She has a child! Jesus, she needs help.

493
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:43,004
- You covering up for her is not what I mean.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

494
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,639
I am your mother...

495
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:48,776
and you will respect that
or I will smack the black right off of you.

496
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,463
Hi, there.

497
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,692
Hi.

498
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,669
Hard day?

499
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,070
How can you tell?

500
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,742
I'm good at people.

501
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,213
- Are you?
- Gotta be. Tax law.

502
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,654
I'm Scott. Scott Axelrod.

503
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,951
Candace Bouvard.

504
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,289
Nice to meet you, Candace.
Are you an actress?

505
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,360
No.

506
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,306
- I teach sign language to the newly deaf.
- Really?

507
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,947
- How noble.
- No, it's very lucrative.

508
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,419
And I really enjoy
communicating with my body.

509
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,925
I get that.

510
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,465
You know what? My friend is here,
but it's been great getting to know you.

511
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,202
I would love to take you to dinner sometime.
Can I give you my card?

512
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,766
You sure can.

513
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,141
How was school?

514
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:36,617
<i>All right, you have 20 minutes to do</i>
<i>what's most important in your life now.</i>

515
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,690
<i>What did you write to yourself</i>
<i>in your private letter?</i>

516
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,925
<i>Where are you locked out of your own life?</i>

517
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,968
<i>If you learn today</i>
<i>that your relationship with your mother...</i>

518
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,437
<i>has been blocking the door</i>
<i>to your happiness, then make that repair.</i>

519
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,602
<i>Right now. Waiting only gives you</i>
<i>more chances to make excuses.</i>

520
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,979
<i>There are phones in the hall.</i>
<i>See you in 19 minutes.</i>

521
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,949
Where can I find a Snickers bar?

522
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,111
Can't you think of more productive ways
to use this time?

523
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,316
Like what? Taking up smoking?

524
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,292
Why not try rebuilding
with someone right now?

525
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,494
I read your private letter to yourself.
If you really want closeness in your life...

526
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,866
you're gonna have to start
major renovations.

527
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,667
- In fact, I would gut.
- You read my private letter?

528
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:27,210
- Why don't you try calling your kids?
- I don't even know where my kids are.

529
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,212
The last thing they want
is for me to call on a Friday night...

530
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,044
so I can put in new flooring.

531
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,643
I've wanted to hear that my whole life, Dad.
Oh, fuck!

532
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,848
I love you, too, you sadistic old fuck.

533
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,983
Start with Claire.

534
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,790
Only you can be the architect of your life.

535
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,330
I was 12 years old.

536
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,382
This is your mother.

537
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,116
Yes, well, I just wanted to tell you that...

538
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,751
I feel like even though
I've been trying to be closer to you...

539
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,888
it hasn't really been working.

540
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,864
I wish you felt you could confide in me...

541
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,869
and maybe you don't
because you feel my opinion is worthless.

542
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,072
Because I don't really live in my house...

543
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:38,074
and so I suppose
that's the infrastructure I built.

544
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,514
And so I'm sorry.

545
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,912
- And?
- And I love you.

546
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,015
That's so good. I gotta pee like a racehorse.

547
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,689
<i>You have exceeded the time limit.</i>

548
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,392
<i>If you know the name of the movie</i>
<i>you'd like to see, press 1 now.</i>

549
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,913
Hello?

550
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,083
<i>- Claire?</i>
- Where the fuck have you been?

551
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,586
<i>- I'm fucked up.</i>
- Gabe, what is going on?

552
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:27,258
<i>Everything is all fucked up, Claire!</i>

553
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,926
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You just have to calm down right now.

554
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,596
<i>Look, I need you to come and get me.</i>

555
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,199
<i>Please.</i>

556
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,402
You know the cops
are seriously looking for you?

557
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,681
<i>I know that, okay? Why do you think</i>
<i>I need you to come out here and get me?</i>

558
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,309
Where are you?

559
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,318
<i>I'm up past Woodland Hills.</i>

560
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,180
Academia is one huge circle jerk.

561
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,026
All the sequestered people
desperately defending...

562
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,063
the one good idea
they have ever had in their lives.

563
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,428
So, what, that's it for going back to school?

564
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,297
Yep. Next?

565
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,009
- How was your day?
- It was weird.

566
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,980
Buried that psychic woman's husband,
and she was still talking to the guy.

567
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,982
- That's sad.
- Not for her.

568
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,487
I mean, she really believed he was there,
you know?

569
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:28,616
Well, she has to say that, right?
If she claims she's a psychic.

570
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,751
You don't think that that's possible?

571
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,956
What about you saying
that things happen that leave marks...

572
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,364
- in people, in places, in time?
- That's physics.

573
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,929
Energy affecting matter.

574
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,734
Talking to dead people is delusional.

575
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,470
So you definitely don't believe
in any kind of a life after death?

576
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,678
I think people live on
through the people they love...

577
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,678
and the things they do with their lives.

578
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,951
If they manage to do things with their lives.

579
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,190
But that's it? That's all there is?

580
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,124
There's nothing more?
There's nothing bigger?

581
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,386
Just energy.

582
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,898
- But there's no plan?
- No, there's definitely no plan.

583
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,767
Just survival.

584
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,476
- Should I have ordered the salmon?
- I don't know.

585
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,981
How can you live like that? What if you
found out you were gonna die tomorrow?

586
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,487
I've been prepared to die tomorrow
since I was 6 years old.

587
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,049
Really?

588
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,952
- Pretty much. We never got butter.
- Why since you were six?

589
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,458
Because I read a report on the effect
nuclear war would have on the world...

590
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:46,970
and it was pretty clear to me at that point
that this was definitely gonna happen.

591
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,803
When you were six?

592
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:53,066
And I wake up every day
pretty much surprised...

593
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,680
that everything is still here.

594
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,443
I don't understand
how you can live like that.

595
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,809
Well, I thought we all did.

596
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,461
- Who was that?
- I went to high school with him.

597
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,198
He's clearly had a nose job.

598
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,136
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

599
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,740
<i>Go on.</i>

600
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,111
<i>And imagine that everyone in this room</i>
<i>thinks you're an idiot.</i>

601
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,847
<i>Total fool. Complete moron. Absolute ass.</i>

602
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,556
<i>Feel familiar?</i>

603
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,956
<i>It's how you feel in the world, isn't it?</i>

604
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,127
<i>I want you to feel it deeply now.</i>

605
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,065
<i>Really feel that everyone in this room</i>
<i>thinks you're an idiot.</i>

606
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,935
<i>Close your eyes, Ruth. Feel you're an idiot.</i>

607
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,309
<i>Now tell me when you get the joke.</i>

608
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:25,095
<i>- Do you get the joke, Ruth?</i>
- No. I'm an idiot.

609
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,627
<i>Who wants to explain the joke to Ruth?</i>

610
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,471
<i>So we all feel the same way, right?</i>

611
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,815
<i>So who's really the asshole?</i>

612
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,550
- We all are?
<i>- Ruth, stand up.</i>

613
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,985
<i>Tell me what you wrote</i>
<i>in your private letter to yourself.</i>

614
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,890
It was a private letter. To myself.

615
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,056
<i>Tell me where your house needs repairs.</i>

616
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,896
Yeah, and don't bullshit the lady, cupcake.

617
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,095
I have a very nice house.

618
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:06,001
I have nice children, and a nice job,
and a nice gentleman friend.

619
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,136
Can't anyone just be happy? I'm happy.

620
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,175
<i>Who's buying Ruth's house?</i>

621
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,548
<i>We don't believe your house</i>
<i>is structurally sound, Ruth.</i>

622
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,351
Who knows better:
Me or a room full of complainers?

623
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,085
<i>What do you really</i>
<i>want to complain about, really?</i>

624
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,358
The fact that the blood stopped circulating
to my rear end four hours ago.

625
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,996
<i>Okay, what else?</i>

626
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,224
You want me to complain?

627
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,928
All right, then. Fuck this.

628
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,799
Fuck you. Fuck all of you,
with your sniveling self-pity.

629
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,207
And fuck all your lousy parents.

630
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,207
Fuck my lousy parents, while we're at it.

631
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,545
Fuck my selfish bohemian sister
and her fucking bliss.

632
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,450
Fuck my legless grandmother.
Fuck my dead husband...

633
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,421
and my lousy children
with their nasty little secrets!

634
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,617
And fuck you, Robbie,
for dragging me to this terrible place...

635
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,627
and not letting me have a Snickers bar!

636
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,890
I'm going to get something to eat!

637
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,926
<i>Congratulations, Ruth.</i>

638
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,265
<i>You have just leveled your fleabag hovel.</i>

639
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:10,004
Now you can build the house
of your dreams from the ground up.

640
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,267
Yes! Fucking yes!

641
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,537
Excellent.

642
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,671
Congratulations.

643
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,200
Jesus.

644
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,768
Okay, let's hop.

645
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,914
- Hi?
- We should just get going.

646
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,076
Okay.

647
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,683
But you could tell me
where the fuck you've been...

648
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,450
Yeah, like you care.

649
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,352
What?

650
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,225
Why did I just drive my ass
way the fuck out to nowhere?

651
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:10,062
Can we just talk about this
while we're driving, okay?

652
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,527
Jesus, it's hot as hell in this car.

653
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,081
Can you tell me where we're going?

654
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,254
Let's just head out to Angela's Crest
or something.

655
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,227
Angela's Crest? That's where serial killers
go to dump bodies.

656
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,787
You think you can think up
someplace a little creepier?

657
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,298
I don't care where we go.

658
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,530
I just want to go somewhere
where we can be alone for a minute...

659
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,265
and we can just talk, you know? Whatever.

660
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,271
- Are you fucked-up right now?
- What the fuck do you expect, Claire?

661
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,875
I'm freaked out. Everything's really
fucked-up for me right now.

662
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,008
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

663
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,382
- I'm trying to it figure out.
- What's to figure out?

664
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,978
Claire, just chill out, okay? Jesus.

665
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:12,094
Look, they know you gave Andy the fry,
or whatever the fuck it's called.

666
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,494
They know you robbed that store, Gabe.

667
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,297
You have to turn yourself in.

668
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,568
That is a genius fucking plan.

669
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,466
Hey, baby, you like to drink blood?

670
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:30,104
- That's incredibly original.
- Shut the fuck up, scumbag!

671
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,648
Look, you got a corpse in the front seat.

672
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,774
- I said, shut the fuck up!
- Oh, God!

673
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,315
Go.

674
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,216
Is he all right?

675
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,393
It's okay.

676
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,026
Just keep driving.

677
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,236
What are you doing?

678
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,945
- We have to go back.
- Are you insane?

679
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,277
We have to go back
and make sure that guy is okay.

680
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,216
- I didn't hit him, all right?
- How do you know? Are you sure?

681
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,150
I saw. He's fine, all right?

682
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,018
Then let's just go back
and make sure that he is all right.

683
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,058
I cannot go back there!

684
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,761
- God, I am fucked!
- You know this is just making it worse.

685
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,591
Listen to me. I need you
to just help me right now, okay? Please.

686
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,666
I can't help you!

687
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,303
I can't help you anymore! I can't.

688
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,739
Let's just keep going, okay?

689
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,075
Let's just keep going,
I'll figure out what to do.

690
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,842
I will figure it out.

691
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,383
Come on, please.

692
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,342
I'm going back.

693
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,615
- Claire, don't do that.
- Get off me.

694
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,689
Claire, give me that.

695
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,562
Okay, you have to get out now.

696
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,623
- Don't do this to me.
- Get out!

697
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,403
- Get out.
- Okay.

698
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,201
I'm just gonna get my bag, all right?

699
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,177
Thanks.

700
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,657
Oh, my God.

701
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,368
So, where do you think I am?

702
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,636
Heaven or Hell?

703
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,680
Apparently, you're here at the moment.

704
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,179
You think I'm in Hell.

705
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,784
Yeah, sure, I went to church.
That was just for business.

706
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,653
I didn't really believe in God.

707
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,751
I mean, not as anyone who you had
to please or impress to get promoted.

708
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:38,125
The only God I know
is a mean-spirited comedian in ugly pants...

709
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,802
whose every joke
has the same damn punch line.

710
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,535
And I'm thinking, that kind of attitude
lands me straight in Hell.

711
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,609
On the bright side, that means...

712
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,251
you'll have a familiar face waiting for you.

713
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,045
Look it up.

714
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,592
Leviticus 20:13.

715
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,654
I don't believe that anymore.

716
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,539
And I don't think you're in Hell.

717
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:27,242
But you can't quite see me hanging around
with Gandhi and Mother Teresa up there.

718
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,146
I miss you, Dad.

719
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,796
I thought you were at Brenda's.

720
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,862
She had a late client,
so I thought I'd, you know...

721
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,367
- help clean up.
- Thanks.

722
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,463
At this hour? That is a late client.

723
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,635
Some of them like her
to put them to bed, you know?

724
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,070
That's very sad.

725
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,982
- How long did you go out with that cop?
- About six months.

726
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,621
- Sex ever slow down?
- I was hoping you weren't gonna go there.

727
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,020
I'm sorry. Forget it.

728
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,990
- David, I need some help.
- What happened?

729
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,266
"Fuck my legless grandmother.

730
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,400
"And fuck you, Robbie,
for not letting me have the Snickers bar."

731
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,706
Oh, my goodness, the language.

732
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,111
I was so rude.

733
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,520
It was fantastic. <i>Quel</i> breakthrough.

734
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,181
Robbie, I don't even know how to thank you.

735
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,783
Don't thank me.

736
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,495
Just change.

737
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,326
So, what are you gonna do tomorrow
to start the renovations?

738
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,893
That's none of your fucking business.

739
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,026
Any idea where he'd go?

740
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,229
What was he wearing?

741
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,364
You know,
it's gonna be much easier on him...

742
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,468
if we can bring him in
before something else happens.

743
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,413
- But he doesn't even have the gun.
- You think he can't get another gun?

744
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,453
He was wearing jeans
and a green T-shirt, I think.

745
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,992
You're doing the right thing.
You know that, right?

746
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,327
- I feel like shit.
- You'll feel worse if someone else gets hurt.

747
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,771
Oh, my God.

748
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:10,009
When that cop asked me if I knew about
the <i>7</i>- Eleven thing, I said I didn't. But I did.

749
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,913
- Is that really bad?
- It's not great.

750
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,448
But you're telling the truth now, right?
So don't worry about that.

751
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,716
They wouldn't make me testify against him
or something, right?

752
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:23,316
That's not up to me.
But, anyway, that's a long ways off.

753
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,924
Okay, 'cause I don't wanna
do anything like that.

754
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,829
- Why are you still protecting this loser?
- Because she loves him.

755
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,902
And we understand that, Claire.

756
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,902
I really wish
you'd told us about this sooner.

757
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,241
How long did you know
about the embalming fluid?

758
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,907
Not that long. And I tried to tell Nate.

759
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,177
When the fuck
did you try and tell me about this?

760
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,549
She's telling you now, all right?

761
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,779
Okay, I'm sorry.

762
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,191
I'm sorry.

763
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,827
When you're ready, we're gonna get in
the car and drive down to the station.

764
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:09,267
A couple of detectives there are gonna
ask you pretty much the same questions.

765
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,075
- Will you be there?
- Yes, I'll be there.
