1
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,928
Over there. I just saw a fin.

2
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:08,051
Right. In the most polluted port in America?

3
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:11,327
- Nothing could live here.
- Really?

4
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:14,769
That makes me sad.
It looks so beautiful at night.

5
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,924
Yeah, so is Burbank.

6
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,728
- You're gorgeous, you know that?
- Shut up!

7
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,532
So why haven't you
ever talked to me before?

8
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,491
I was intimidated. You're very intimidating.

9
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,086
You're full of shit.

10
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:33,652
Of course they pick
a goddamn boat this year...

11
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,692
so nobody can leave
before Parkinson's jerk-off speech...

12
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:41,766
about what a fucking great company
this is, right?

13
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:42,968
Right.

14
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:46,370
Like anything that self-important fuck says
could change the fact...

15
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:49,604
that we'll be filing for bankruptcy
by the end of the year.

16
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,804
You're new here, aren't you?

17
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:53,805
Yeah, about six months.

18
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:56,361
I'd start sending out my résumé now...

19
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:01,086
unless you're one of
Parkinson's fucking inner circle.

20
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:02,851
If you are, then...

21
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,851
fuck me, right?

22
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:10,365
- Do you wanna go and get another drink?
- Please.

23
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,443
Excuse me. I guess I'm the asshole...

24
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,728
for telling the fucking truth!

25
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,562
Shit!

26
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,325
That's not fair.

27
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,809
You suck!

28
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:43,488
- Morning.
- God, you scared me!

29
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,925
- You're up early.
- I slept like a fucking baby.

30
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,893
- Yeah, me, too.
- After the night we had?

31
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,564
The sheer exhaustion factor alone.

32
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:56,372
Yeah, I gotta say it was worth the wait.

33
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,806
- So does this mean the ebb is over?
- For now.

34
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,372
Want a coffee?

35
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,645
- Wow, this is kind of racy.
- Hey, no!

36
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:12,325
- Is that your novel?
- I don't know what it is yet.

37
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,168
- When do I get to read it?
- When it's ready, if it's ever ready.

38
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:19,290
Well, who's Christina?
Is that your fictional alter ego?

39
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:21,250
Your Holden Caulfield?

40
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,006
She's more like my Humbert Humbert.

41
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,847
You know, my Constance Chatterley.

42
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,368
She's like Hermione
in the Harry Potter books.

43
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,205
What would you rather have:

44
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,568
Some overly-educated gasbag like Trevor...

45
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,565
or a semi-literate fuck machine like me?
Come on.

46
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,247
That's a no-brainer. No pun intended.

47
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:48,043
I have something for you.

48
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,763
I know it's small, but it is a diamond.

49
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,367
You think I care about diamonds?

50
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:59,529
Will you marry me, Brenda Chenowith?

51
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,729
Haven't we done this already?

52
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,490
- What?
- I love you.

53
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:12,802
Good.

54
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,171
Something else?

55
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,571
I thought we could announce it to my family
at dinner tonight.

56
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,928
I was gonna ask my mom to make dinner.

57
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,129
Look, we have to do this sometime.

58
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,442
- And what about your family?
- Are you kidding?

59
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,809
They are way too consumed
in their own divorce drama to even notice.

60
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,532
Let's just not tell them and say that we did.

61
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,525
And what about Billy?

62
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,051
You know, I haven't really talked to him
for a while.

63
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:44,168
Why don't I make you pancakes
from scratch...

64
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:45,606
like a good little wife-to-be...

65
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:48,002
before I fuck your brains out
and send you to work?

66
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,323
How about we skip the pancakes?

67
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,766
Shit, you're already dressed?
Am I holding you up?

68
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,366
No, not really.

69
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:05,043
- Well, maybe a little.
- You've got the best shower.

70
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:09,012
Mine's just this weird bolt
sticking out of the wall that sends out mist.

71
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,846
It takes five minutes just to get wet.

72
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,767
How come I always stay here?
It's time for you to stay at my place.

73
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:19,323
- After that great recommendation?
- It's nice.

74
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,291
MGM built it back in the '30s
to house starlets.

75
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:25,407
Great parquet floors,
unbelievable molding...

76
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:30,123
but some idiot did an '80s retro-fit
and ripped out all the good fixtures.

77
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:35,529
I'll be happy to stay at your house,
fixtures aside.

78
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:43,127
You know, I never thought
you'd call me back after that second date.

79
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,282
Why?

80
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,970
Because I never think
the good guys are gonna call back.

81
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,486
Who said I'm a good guy?

82
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:52,212
Well, it's been three weeks.
That's usually a sign.

83
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,842
Check with me in three months.
I'll tell you how you're doing.

84
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,811
Good morning. Sit. Have some breakfast.

85
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,482
- Most important meal of the day.
- Good morning, dear.

86
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,092
Apparently.

87
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,208
How would you like your eggs?

88
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,812
Surprise me.

89
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,009
Now, this is good, yeah?
All together for breakfast.

90
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,643
Well, I see it's Good Neighbor Day
at the Fisher house.

91
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:34,412
David, was that a new friend I saw
leaving this morning?

92
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:37,610
- Mom, please, I'd rather not discuss...
- What does he do?

93
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,366
He's a public defender.

94
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:42,729
You should have asked him in for breakfast.
We'd all like to meet him.

95
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:45,885
Yes, bring him next time.
I would like to meet him.

96
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,607
Where's Nate?
We have an intake in 15 minutes.

97
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:52,810
He called from the car.
There was an accident on the 10...

98
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:55,965
and he told me to ask everyone
to be here for dinner tonight.

99
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,692
He has something important to tell us.

100
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,884
A big family dinner.

101
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:04,171
It will be fun.

102
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,610
Everybody had gotten off...

103
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,731
and the lights were on.

104
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:14,689
You could see what a dumpy little boat
it actually was...

105
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,252
And he just wasn't there.

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,804
- It's hard to believe right now, but time...
- I got dumped at a party in college once...

107
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,242
it was the Kappa Sig luau...

108
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,447
by some guy whose name
I don't even remember.

109
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,762
The sun was coming up, and I just...

110
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,970
sat there staring at this stupid pig carcass...

111
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:40,487
in my stupid Hawaiian-print sundress.

112
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,005
Mrs. Collins, have you thought about...

113
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,482
Matthew and I had been married
for almost 20 years.

114
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,370
Can you believe that?

115
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,448
I met him when I was barely 20.

116
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,731
And now he's dead...

117
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,007
and I'm just that much closer to it.

118
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:09,731
I'm sorry, we don't allow smoking inside.

119
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:14,611
Please put that out. It's against
California State Law. We could be fined.

120
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,001
Sorry.

121
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,806
How long will it take?

122
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,885
It depends on the kind of service
you were thinking of.

123
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,646
Length of visitation,
should you choose an open casket...

124
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,167
My husband was dredged up
from Long Beach Harbor...

125
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,813
with a propeller slice
halfway down his body.

126
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,645
Closed casket, then.

127
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,850
How much? I can't spend a lot of money.

128
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,970
We're probably looking at around $<i>7</i>,000.

129
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,092
That seems like a lot.

130
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,687
It's about average, maybe a little less.

131
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,843
We'll take care of everything...

132
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,288
make it as easy on you as possible.

133
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,089
I need to think about this.

134
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:12,086
- Of course. Let us know what you decide.
- I can show myself out.

135
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,962
- Shopping around for the best deal.
- Isn't that her right?

136
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,044
She's wasting our time.

137
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,521
Oh, dear, when did you get so dried out?
You must be thirsty.

138
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,322
The flowers are lovely, Sarah. Thank you.

139
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,483
I just cut them on my walk
through the canyon.

140
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,803
Don't worry, you didn't put me out one bit.

141
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:51,445
This kitchen is exactly the same.

142
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:53,212
Yes, it is.

143
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,886
You look well.

144
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,446
- So do you.
- I only just got your messages.

145
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,966
I was in Madrid.

146
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,806
I wanted to stay through Christmas,
but I ran out of money.

147
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:07,612
The reason I was calling was because...

148
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,847
What I want to say was that...

149
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,412
I forgive you.

150
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,809
You're the only family,
apart from the children, that I have left.

151
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:21,805
I didn't want more time to go by
with our not talking.

152
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:24,726
We're sisters. We shouldn't be estranged.

153
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,445
I took this course called The Plan.

154
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,610
You did The Plan? You're shitting me.

155
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:36,164
That is so great, Ruth. You, of all people.

156
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,562
- What's that supposed to mean?
- No, it's very brave.

157
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:42,009
I know it couldn't have been easy for you.
I did it back in the '<i>7</i>0s...

158
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,926
when it was still called
"Transitional Focus."

159
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:48,011
Before Ernst Vollhoffer was busted
for tax evasion...

160
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:49,765
and sold it to the Canadians.

161
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,048
That's when it became The Plan.

162
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,844
I met Vollhoffer at a party once...

163
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,330
and he came on to me.

164
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,005
But I'd just dropped acid for the first time...

165
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:05,526
and I thought he was
some Mayan death priest...

166
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:09,401
who wanted to cut out my heart
and throw it into a pit.

167
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,531
So I blew him off.

168
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,370
Catherine Collins has decided to go
with the Unger mortuary.

169
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,045
Well, I guess that's that.

170
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,442
Unger is a Kroehner home, Nate.

171
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,566
Yeah, so?

172
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,645
So Kroehner charges about double
what we do.

173
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,921
That's the third funeral
Kroehner has stolen from us...

174
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,766
since Mitzi Huntley came to visit.
They are after us again.

175
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:40,969
Look, now you're just being dramatic.

176
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,772
This from a man
who basically lives in denial.

177
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:48,451
Look, Stan told me at lunch last week
that Kroehner stock had taken a nosedive.

178
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,525
Why would they be wasting their time
with small potatoes like us?

179
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,128
Maybe because you told Mitzi
to shove her good-faith gesture up her ass?

180
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:59,206
I told you guys that Kroehner wasn't
gonna let up, but nobody listens to me.

181
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:02,251
Not now, Federico. We needed that funeral.

182
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,722
How else are we paying for the fine
from the DCA?

183
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,247
That's $1,800 we don't have right now.

184
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,005
I asked you to check the proof.

185
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,926
No license number on a billboard
opposite a retirement home...

186
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:15,005
makes us look like amateurs.
We cannot afford to be vulnerable.

187
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:18,972
I'm not comfortable starting
on this woman's perm until I have a photo.

188
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,567
Any idea when that's supposed to arrive?

189
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,087
I have an inspector coming to my house
this afternoon.

190
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,767
It came in this morning
and I put it in her file...

191
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,606
which you would know
if you bothered to look.

192
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:34,853
I'm calling Catherine,
and I'm going to lowball Unger.

193
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:39,563
Even if we cut our profits in half,
we can show Kroehner we're willing to fight.

194
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,447
Hey, Mom.

195
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,202
Hello.

196
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,372
Who are you?

197
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,250
I'm your Aunt Sarah.

198
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,610
Claire, the Goddess
is clearly manifesting through you.

199
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:04,002
- It's very obvious.
- Thanks.

200
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,930
I thought you were dead.

201
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:13,084
The skin like milk. Treasure it while it lasts.

202
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:17,723
Ruth, you told your daughter I was dead?

203
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,246
Shame on you.

204
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,449
I never told her any such thing.

205
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,411
Claire, why would you lie about that?

206
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:27,610
Whenever you talked about her,
it just sounded like she was dead.

207
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,012
I just assumed.

208
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,693
Well, I've made a miraculous recovery.

209
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,363
Tell me exactly what you were feeling
when you made this.

210
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:45,484
- Boredom.
- Liar.

211
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,292
There's anger and yearning...

212
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:52,691
passion, resentment of the status quo,
some jealousy of it, as well.

213
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,208
Not the most original perspective,
but it's authentic.

214
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,771
I love this!

215
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:05,483
The technique: Very precise, very adult.

216
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,643
The death of romance
in a regimented, artificial world.

217
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,401
Lovely.

218
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,525
Actually, I found it in the garbage.

219
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,845
My dad threw it out after a funeral.
I thought it looked cool, so I kept it.

220
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,844
You're an artist, Claire.

221
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:27,287
- Please.
- I'm not saying you're any good, yet.

222
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:31,446
But if you focus and live fully,
you could become something.

223
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,123
If you're lucky and don't self-destruct.

224
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,124
- Right.
- You've got an eye.

225
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,364
You see through the veil.

226
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:42,123
It's a blessing and a curse.

227
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,362
Okay.

228
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,925
You need something red
in your relationship corner...

229
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,130
like a red velvet pillow.

230
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,810
Something bordello-ey.

231
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:57,090
You're resisting the carnal.
That's your mother rubbing off on you.

232
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:01,610
Put a plant in your knowledge corner
if you want to grow into your potential.

233
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:05,609
What is that, Feng Shui?
You're kidding, right?

234
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,532
You can drop the generic apathy crap.

235
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:12,723
That's just laziness.
You're more than that and you know it.

236
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,083
Hey, baby, sorry I'm late.

237
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,209
Rico, we are fucked.

238
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:22,806
It's definitely mold.

239
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:26,010
I told you so. See, this is why
Julio's cold don't get any better.

240
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:28,527
Maybe you've got structural damage
in your chimney...

241
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,571
and water's leaking in.
When the rain starts, it'll get worse.

242
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,052
Okay, what can we do?

243
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:36,125
I got to rip this all out
and see what's going on inside.

244
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,171
Maybe we can patch things up,
maybe it'll be bigger than that.

245
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:42,484
- How much is it all gonna cost?
- You got serious water damage here.

246
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,725
It could be anywhere from $3,000
to maybe $<i>7</i>,000 if your roof is involved.

247
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,565
Excuse me one second.

248
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,122
- We can get Ramon to fix it.
- Fix it?

249
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,410
He didn't even spot it. You heard him.
There's serious water damage.

250
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:00,644
- Any idiot would know that.
- Don't call my cousin an idiot.

251
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,291
Okay, no, I'll call you an idiot...

252
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,251
because you were too cheap
to get a real inspector initially.

253
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,561
I'm an idiot?

254
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,213
Maybe it wasn't the smartest idea
to go to your sister...

255
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:13,252
and buy this piece-of-shit house
behind my back. Now you think about that.

256
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,249
- God damn it!
<i>- What happened?</i>

257
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,252
I just got snapped running a red light.

258
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,803
We are living in a motherfucking
police state, I tell you what!

259
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:27,565
Any calls while I was at lunch?

260
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:31,441
<i>The Unger mortuary called to say the funeral</i>
<i>we poached from Fisher & Sons...</i>

261
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,252
<i>- is going back to them.</i>
- You're kidding!

262
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:37,807
We undercut them by almost $500.

263
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,646
<i>Well, now they've undercut us</i>
<i>by nearly $1,000.</i>

264
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,531
Oh, my God, I love this!

265
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,170
They're cute,
but they are such bad businessmen.

266
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,050
<i>Well, they won't last.</i>

267
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,004
What have I got tomorrow?

268
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:54,526
<i>Your trainer at 9.00...</i>

269
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:57,730
<i>then back-to-back performance reviews</i>
<i>from 1.00 to 5.00.</i>

270
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,804
Cancel everything except the trainer.

271
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:00,962
<i>All right.</i>

272
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:05,171
I think I need to spend a little quality time
with the fabulous Fisher boys.

273
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:11,205
- Ruth, do you have any tarragon?
- All the spices are in that cabinet.

274
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,125
Well, now I know what to get you
for Christmas.

275
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:19,252
Dean & Deluca have these
fantastic spices in test tubes.

276
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,291
Very mad scientist. You'll love them.

277
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,762
- What are you making?
- I'm not sure yet.

278
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,571
I'm making Chicken Kiev.

279
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:28,962
I bought all the ingredients
to make Chicken Kiev.

280
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:31,248
So we'll make Chicken Kiev.

281
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,328
Have tarragon, will travel.

282
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:37,441
Tarragon is not listed in the ingredients.

283
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,252
Following instructions?
Where's the creativity in that?

284
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,324
Cooking is alchemy, not a science.

285
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,529
It is if you want it to turn out right.

286
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,081
Is there anything I can do to help?

287
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,007
Smell.

288
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,291
This vodka is from Poland. You will like it.

289
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:00,931
Ruthie, why don't you join us?

290
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:04,562
Thank you, but I'll wait till dinner is served
to have a glass of wine.

291
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,211
Okay, suit yourself.

292
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,482
Where you learning to speak the Russian?

293
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:31,565
It's a long story.
Let's just say there was a man involved.

294
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,564
Of course there was.

295
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:35,962
Claire, when you are finished
mixing the herbs in...

296
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:39,648
you want to form the butter into little logs.
Eight of them.

297
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,052
No, not at all. It's deliciously sensual.

298
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,363
Wash your hands first, Claire.

299
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,883
You wild woman.

300
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,806
Nikolai is adorable and hot.

301
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:59,366
The sex must be spectacular! Good for you.

302
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:04,362
Oh, my God!

303
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,842
You're all grown up,
but your face is still 12 years old.

304
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:16,527
David, you remember your Aunt Sarah?

305
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,565
Yes, hi.

306
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,765
I'm sure you couldn't forget her if you tried.

307
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,492
- David, have some vodka.
- Yes.

308
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,849
This is so surreal.

309
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:31,449
The engagement dinner.

310
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,572
I feel like I'm in a training movie from
the '50s about how normal people behave.

311
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,689
Well, my family's anything but normal.

312
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:40,082
Compared to mine,
they're the fucking Cleavers.

313
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,085
Just relax and enjoy yourself, all right?
You look gorgeous.

314
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,209
- Everybody loves you.
- Not your mother.

315
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,853
All you have to do is sit back...

316
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,846
and be the center of attention, all right?
Come on.

317
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,363
So, Linda, what do you do?

318
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,970
- It's Brenda.
- Forgive me, I'm drunk.

319
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,085
It's all Nikolai's fault.

320
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:07,291
He's been plying me with vodka
since the moment he arrived.

321
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,804
I'm a massage therapist.

322
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:13,729
She's an amazing massage therapist,
and she's writing a novel.

323
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:14,928
You are?

324
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:17,846
I'm writing something.
We'll see what it turns into.

325
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:20,652
Have you ever read
<i>Charlotte Light and Dark?</i>

326
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,611
- Yes.
- Well, she's Charlotte.

327
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:27,044
- I didn't know that.
- What is this, Charlotte light and who?

328
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:29,852
It's this book
about this girl who's being analyzed...

329
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:32,811
and she's smarter than the people
who are analyzing her.

330
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:36,522
And so she's constantly fucking with them.
It's hilarious.

331
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:41,448
You continue to be drawn
to strong, complex women. Bravo.

332
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,968
Mom, this dinner is delicious.

333
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,649
I think it's a little sour, myself.

334
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,725
- No, it's one of the best you've ever made.
- It's great.

335
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,849
- Here, more vodka?
- Please.

336
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:59,246
I had a lover who was Russian.

337
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,925
He once told me...

338
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:04,722
that vodka was to Russians
what therapy is to Americans.

339
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,602
Something habit-forming and expensive...

340
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,368
that totally destroys your ability
to lead an authentic life.

341
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,007
Sorry, both my parents are shrinks.

342
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,367
And that was very painful for you.

343
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:23,287
But if it weren't for that, you probably
wouldn't be writing your novel, right?

344
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:27,605
Speaking of creativity, is everyone aware
of the budding artist in the family?

345
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,692
- No, who?
- You haven't seen Claire's work?

346
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:33,611
Shame on you. She needs feedback...

347
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,685
even if it's just so she can learn to ignore it.

348
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:40,322
Claire, I know so many creative people
from all over the world.

349
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:44,167
You must come stay with me
in Topanga Canyon and meet some of them.

350
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:45,402
Okay.

351
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:53,288
What?

352
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,364
Now's as good a time as any, I guess.

353
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:08,129
The reason that I wanted us all
to get together for dinner tonight...

354
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,046
is that Brenda and I
have decided to get married.

355
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,813
Good, married. This calls for a toast, yes?

356
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,531
Absolutely!

357
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,172
There you go. Something to toast with.

358
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,164
To romantic love:

359
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,451
Both the inspiration and utter folly of it.

360
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,362
Thank you. That's really kind.

361
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,847
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

362
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:38,086
So, Linda, I never would have taken you
as the type to get married.

363
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:41,526
Show us the ring.

364
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,888
Yeah, don't blink.
You might miss the diamond.

365
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:47,010
- Here you go.
- No, it's beautiful.

366
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,323
It's lovely. Ruth, did you see?

367
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,005
Yes, very nice.

368
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,603
I'll go put on some coffee.

369
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,207
Is there any more of that vodka left?

370
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:16,490
Ruthie, what's wrong?

371
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,809
Your son is going to marry.
This is a beautiful thing.

372
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,407
It's been a long day, that's all. I'm fine.

373
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,084
Just look at this mess.

374
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,090
Don't worry. I'm going to help you clean up.

375
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:42,926
Thank you.

376
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:49,291
God, there is so much emotion to navigate
where family is concerned.

377
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,571
Vicodin anyone?

378
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,651
No, thanks, I'm fine.

379
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,566
Okay, what's the deal
with me going to Topanga Canyon?

380
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:00,484
Mom totally freaked.

381
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,847
No one ever told you? Oh, my!

382
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,812
It seems I'm a terrible influence.

383
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:13,733
David and I went to stay
with Aunt Sarah one weekend...

384
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,849
and I kind of lost my virginity.

385
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,605
How old were you?

386
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,163
- Fifteen.
- How old was she?

387
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:23,325
- I'm not sure. 20-something.
- She was 32.

388
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:26,726
Oh, my God, that's totally fucked up!

389
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:31,091
Your mother has never forgiven me
and she never will, no matter what she says.

390
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:35,052
Granted, there was an awful moment
when David was lost...

391
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,012
but he was found completely unharmed
in the canyon the next morning.

392
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:43,648
Damn, I miss out on all the best stuff
in this family.

393
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:47,688
Well, that was a disaster.
Your mother hates me more than ever now.

394
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:49,843
- She does not hate you.
- Come on, Nate.

395
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,764
Who cares if she does?

396
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:56,049
I'm just glad it's over.

397
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:58,968
On to the next. We have a whole lifetime...

398
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:02,648
of tense and uncomfortable
family gatherings to look forward to.

399
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:22,292
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, where have you been?</i>

400
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,328
We had kind of a family dinner.

401
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,290
My brother's getting married.

402
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,568
- Are you drunk?
<i>- Yes.</i>

403
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,122
<i>My mother's boyfriend kept pouring vodka.</i>

404
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,250
<i>I'm gonna have</i>
<i>such a fucking headache tomorrow.</i>

405
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,324
Your mom's boyfriend was there?

406
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,722
<i>So how come you didn't invite me?</i>

407
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,006
Because I knew it would be excruciating...

408
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:46,890
and I wanted to spare you?

409
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:52,005
I wish you were here, or me there.

410
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,288
<i>Why?</i>

411
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,043
So we could have hot sex
and then fall asleep together.

412
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,089
<i>You could always come over here.</i>

413
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,562
I'm too drunk. I shouldn't drive.

414
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,009
<i>Or I could come over there.</i>

415
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,527
I'm too drunk. I shouldn't drive.

416
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:15,883
Take some aspirin before you go to bed,
and vitamin C. Drink lots of water.

417
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,609
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

418
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:20,887
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

419
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,287
Hey, Mom.

420
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,044
Here, let me help you.

421
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:35,292
You ready?

422
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:42,931
You should have used
your grandmother's ring.

423
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,522
God knows your brother
isn't going to use it.

424
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:48,286
And who knows
if Claire will ever settle down.

425
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:49,965
That ring was for you.

426
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,726
- I didn't even know about it...
- You are the firstborn...

427
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:56,692
and probably the only opportunity
for grandchildren that I will ever live to see.

428
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:59,367
Mom, you never even told me about it.

429
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:08,284
What I think this is really about
is you don't like Brenda.

430
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,965
That's not true.

431
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:13,081
I just don't want you to get hurt.

432
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,971
Is she pregnant?

433
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,406
No, she's not.

434
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:21,202
But she is the woman I love, Mom.

435
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:26,003
You may not think she's the best person for
me, but I do, and I need you to accept that.

436
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:41,322
We're glad you came back to Fisher & Sons.

437
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:44,723
You gave me the best price.
That's the only reason I'm here.

438
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:49,364
That other place wanted me to sign
some waiver before I could see the body.

439
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,451
Do you want me to do that, as well?

440
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,252
Mrs. Collins,
I don't think you want to go through that.

441
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,166
Your husband's body
experienced severe trauma.

442
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,652
It's beyond restoration.

443
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:01,531
Restoration? No, I don't want him restored.

444
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,371
What's the point?

445
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,567
Perhaps we should choose a casket.

446
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,927
You think it's a day like any other.

447
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:18,170
What you don't realize
is that anything can happen.

448
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,651
And then it does.

449
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,046
It happens.

450
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:27,125
And there's so much left unsaid.

451
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:31,042
And it was all just wasted time.

452
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:39,091
I just want somebody
to help me understand.

453
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,212
Just to help.

454
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:47,405
Can you help me?

455
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:53,166
The first line of C. S. Lewis'
<i>A Grief Observed</i> is:

456
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,370
"No one ever told me grief felt so like fear."

457
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,931
I'll get you a copy. I think it will help.

458
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,090
It's going to be okay.

459
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:05,886
No, it's not.

460
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,652
What's wrong?

461
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,328
Doesn't it ever get you down?

462
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,125
Sure, all the time.

463
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:27,810
You know, I keep thinking
it's going to get easier, but it just doesn't.

464
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,691
No, it doesn't.

465
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,603
It just gets more familiar.

466
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,488
Hello? Anybody home?

467
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,287
Hello?

468
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,727
Don't you two look sharp!
Just as sharp as a couple of little tacks.

469
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,407
Miss Huntley. What can we do for you?

470
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:57,882
Well, for one thing, you can call me Mitzi.

471
00:30:57,973 --> 00:30:59,804
Stop being so goddamn formal.

472
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:03,886
Now, how come y'all have not thanked me
for this snazzy casket wall?

473
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:09,322
Maybe I should thank you for selling
our beautiful and highly profitable caskets.

474
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:13,964
Seeing as how you've bought up, absorbed,
and shut down every other competitor?

475
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,089
What the fuck do you want?

476
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,284
What the fuck do I want?

477
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:23,532
I want you boys to come the fuck with me
on a little fucking trip.

478
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:25,126
What do you fucking say?

479
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,612
What kind of fucking trip?

480
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:28,649
Well, see, now that's a secret.

481
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:31,566
- We're very busy.
- Well, I suggest you get unbusy.

482
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:33,371
I understand Fisher & Sons...

483
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:36,809
forgot to put their license number
on a recently-printed advertisement.

484
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:39,851
We've already been fined for that.
So you can just turn around...

485
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,651
No, I'm not talking about the billboard.

486
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,408
I'm talking about the two-column incher
in the funeral pages of the <i>LA Times.</i>

487
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,290
It's run three weeks in a row now.

488
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:50,888
So that is three fines that you can avoid
if you just...

489
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:53,761
drop the attitude and come with me.

490
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,089
Federico, hi, it's David.

491
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,403
Nate and I are tied up
for the rest of the day...

492
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,644
so we need you to pick up the Collins body
from the Unger mortuary.

493
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:11,009
<i>- You can't just expect me to drop...</i>
- Federico, I need you to do this.

494
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:12,208
<i>Fine.</i>

495
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:16,051
Collins? You bad boy.

496
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:19,284
That wasn't very nice of you,
stealing a funeral from us.

497
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,648
- One that you stole from us first.
- Oh, please.

498
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,201
This whole self-righteous
chip-on-the-shoulder thing...

499
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,523
kind of worked for Russell Crowe
in <i>Gladiator.</i>

500
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,968
But you don't have the special effects
to back it up.

501
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:31,044
You get a big kick out of yourself,
don't you?

502
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,488
And you are a big stick-in-the-mud,
aren't you?

503
00:32:33,573 --> 00:32:34,847
Lighten up.

504
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:37,925
The whole purpose of this trip
is to have fun.

505
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:39,605
Just ask Bobo.

506
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:42,844
I said, now what's Mitzi doing
hiding all the way in the back?

507
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:46,050
Hi, darling, you know the Fishers?

508
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,567
- Bobo.
- Good to see you guys again.

509
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:52,248
Well, I need to mingle.
I'm not being a very good hostess.

510
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,371
She's quite a little spitfire, isn't she?

511
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:59,013
So when did you all become members?

512
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,287
Members?

513
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:04,730
Nothing beats flying out to Palm Springs
twice a month for a little golf.

514
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:08,089
You know, I met Merv Griffin last time.
Hell of a guy.

515
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,528
We're never selling to Kroehner.

516
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,772
Well, then you're idiots. No offense.

517
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:16,247
It must have been fun
having a sister growing up.

518
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,801
"Fun" is not the word I would choose.

519
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:21,453
God, I can't believe
I never even met her before.

520
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:25,606
It's for the best. Sarah has no boundaries
and she's completely self-involved.

521
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,253
She would have only disappointed you.

522
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:31,252
Whatever.

523
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:38,930
You know that I think if you work hard...

524
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:42,210
you can be good
at whatever you put your mind to.

525
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,285
Yeah, sure, Mom.

526
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:55,963
How long is my house gonna be like this?

527
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,123
This is a big job. You got to be patient.

528
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:01,649
Patient? Where was patient when
you told us to buy a house full of mold?

529
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,247
I'm not a licensed house inspector.
You knew that.

530
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,484
Besides, you should call that realtor
and sue her for nondisclosure.

531
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:10,406
Shit. I got to head down to Long Beach
before rush hour.

532
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:14,168
No, come on, baby. You got to stay here.
You have to deal with this.

533
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,807
I got to pick up a body.
That's what pays the mortgage.

534
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,566
- Let David do it. What are you, his lapdog?
- Shut up!

535
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:23,089
- Just shut up. Can you do that for once?
- Rico, calm down, man.

536
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:26,245
She's just stressed with the mess
and two kids. Who wouldn't be?

537
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,563
- Cut her some slack.
- Thank you.

538
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,325
I'm out of here.

539
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:35,850
He can be a real pain.

540
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:38,807
Yeah, you don't have to tell me that.

541
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:43,011
Don't you worry. We'll get this fixed
just as soon as we can, okay?

542
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:52,730
The house was built in '59 for Frank Sinatra.

543
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:55,122
If these walls could talk.

544
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:59,844
I don't even want to know what all happened
on that coffee table. Come on.

545
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:02,766
You see what you boys are missing?
This is the life.

546
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:04,605
Don't hurt yourself, Bobo.

547
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:08,811
Would you be a dear darling and fix us up
another batch of those frozen margaritas?

548
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,531
Thank you, lovely.

549
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:12,763
- She's single.
- I'm engaged.

550
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:15,044
Yeah, well, I'm married.

551
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:19,570
There are swimsuits and towels and such
in the cabana out by the pool.

552
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,686
Pepper used to be
captain of the USC swim team.

553
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,764
Now he's trying to make it as an actor.

554
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,969
God, they're a dime a dozen, aren't they?

555
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:32,692
- Why are we here?
- To have fun.

556
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,561
My God, boy, I don't even think
you know what that is.

557
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,121
Listen to me. I understand...

558
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:43,525
exactly how exhausting and depressing
running a small business like yours can be.

559
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:47,049
Your only job today
is to forget about all that.

560
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,202
Enjoy.

561
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:53,288
Well?

562
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,971
We should at least try to have a good time.

563
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,086
What's up?

564
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,921
I was just leaving you some laundry.

565
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,332
Thanks.

566
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:49,681
You got room for me in there, boys?

567
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:53,643
I want you to know Matt Gilardi
never got to come here.

568
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:57,209
Is that supposed to make us feel better
about how he harassed us?

569
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,284
And how you're continuing to harass us?

570
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:03,286
Please, you boys have got to get over
this victim mentality.

571
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,329
Finally, the sales pitch.

572
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,842
That's considerably more money
than we've ever offered you.

573
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,683
You know, this was our father's business.

574
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,128
It's not something
we can just walk away from.

575
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,852
David, nobody is asking you to leave.

576
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:28,847
We like things just the way they are.

577
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,686
We like our lives just the way they are.

578
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:43,244
Honey, it may be tomorrow,
it may be 10 years from now...

579
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,767
but y'all are going under.
It is just evolution.

580
00:38:45,853 --> 00:38:49,732
Kroehner's got the size, resources,
market share, lobbyists in Washington.

581
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:52,122
What do y'all got? Your pride.

582
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:58,011
Car's leaving for the airport in five minutes.
Y'all better hurry.

583
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:16,442
Should we have taken that offer?

584
00:39:17,173 --> 00:39:19,368
- What?
- Why are we doing this?

585
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:23,762
Fighting so hard? Maybe she's right.
Maybe this is a losing battle.

586
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:26,731
Don't tell me you got seduced by a hot tub.

587
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:30,204
So she dangled a fat check in front of us.
So the fuck what?

588
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:34,532
No, we can't give up, David, all right?
We can't. We just can't.

589
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,891
No medication?

590
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,489
Have you told Brenda yet?

591
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:54,210
Yeah, like a week ago.

592
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:57,047
- How'd she take it?
- You know Brenda.

593
00:39:57,573 --> 00:40:00,406
She pretends to be stronger than all of us.

594
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:19,692
Hey, you.

595
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,642
I didn't think you were coming.

596
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:31,771
Well, you know me.
I can't sleep without you.

597
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,851
You're the only thing in my life that works.

598
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:45,445
Oh, shit.

599
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,686
My client.

600
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,405
I got to get this.

601
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,089
Oh, God, I love you so much.

602
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:03,805
I just love you.

603
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:26,690
I enjoyed the sermon.

604
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:28,492
So do you have to work today?

605
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,211
- Not really.
- Good.

606
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,922
I thought you had to prepare
for a hearing tomorrow.

607
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:36,528
I'm thinking about blowing that off.
The guy's totally guilty.

608
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:38,763
I'd rather spend the day with you.

609
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:46,689
Hey, I didn't know you were here.

610
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:50,049
That's a big-ass lie.
I saw you staring in church.

611
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,442
- Who's this?
- This is Taylor.

612
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:55,047
- Taylor, this is my friend Ben.
- Hi.

613
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,006
So how are you?

614
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,607
- You want to go over and say hi?
- No, we'll be late for the movie.

615
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,729
You guys not talking now?

616
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:08,242
We had an argument. It's nothing.

617
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:12,645
Taylor, come on. Got to go.

618
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:14,772
I miss you.

619
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:16,967
Me, too.

620
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:25,252
Who's she?

621
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:28,687
Her uncle's an old friend of mine.

622
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:31,401
Roll onto your back, nice and slow.

623
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:38,047
I'm sorry. Happens to me all the time.

624
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:42,685
It's nothing I haven't seen before,
so don't be embarrassed.

625
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:44,764
Who said I'm embarrassed?

626
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:03,447
Easy.

627
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,367
Feels good.

628
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:15,091
- Like that?
- Yeah.

629
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:21,761
Harder.

630
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:26,722
Oh, God! Yeah.

631
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:29,485
Yeah, faster.

632
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:35,601
Come on.

633
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,006
So thanks.

634
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:02,331
Can I make another appointment
for next week?

635
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,412
I don't think that's such a good idea.

636
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:08,122
Okay.

637
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:11,327
I don't think I can see you again.

638
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:14,969
Well, thanks again.

639
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:17,692
Take care.

640
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:36,928
I know your brother doesn't want me to,
but I have to see him.

641
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:41,211
I really don't think you should
put yourself through that before the service.

642
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,931
There's been no restoration.

643
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,288
Seeing him like this
could make it that much worse.

644
00:44:45,373 --> 00:44:47,887
I spent over half of my life with that man.

645
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:50,646
I slept with him every night for 20 years.

646
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,803
Please just let me see him.

647
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:56,169
I have to see him once more.

648
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:59,368
I want to see him.

649
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:05,212
All right.

650
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:35,643
Look at you now, you fucking pig!

651
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,370
I'm glad you're dead!

652
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:40,809
I'm fucking glad!

653
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:43,653
And I hope it hurt like hell!

654
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:54,523
He can't hit me anymore...

655
00:45:55,973 --> 00:45:57,201
can he?

656
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,686
Thank you.

657
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,812
I could really love you, David Fisher.

658
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:49,486
Not quite the response I was hoping for.

659
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:58,042
- I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
- I'm sorry.

660
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:02,731
I'm really sorry.

661
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,843
I like you a lot, Ben.

662
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:07,888
But?

663
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:17,207
But I'm in love with someone else.

664
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:19,607
I see.

665
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:23,526
And when exactly
were you planning on telling me this?

666
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:27,447
It's not that I haven't enjoyed
being with you. You're a great guy.

667
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:30,445
You're a catch, and he's not even available.

668
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:34,563
I don't want to lie to you.

669
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:41,845
I just thought
it would be a good idea for me...

670
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:45,243
to get involved with someone else,
you know, healthy.

671
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:46,522
Great.

672
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,083
So next you'll be saying
you just want to be friends.

673
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:54,527
Well, now I know why you never wanted
to introduce me to your family.

674
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:08,726
Organic herbs and spices
from the Farmers Market.

675
00:48:08,813 --> 00:48:11,691
- Is Claire here?
- No, I don't know where she is.

676
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:15,449
If I'm going to avoid traffic,
I'm going to have to miss her. Damn.

677
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:18,570
Tell her this is for her knowledge corner.

678
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,764
She'll know what to do.

679
00:48:20,853 --> 00:48:23,162
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

680
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:26,452
Okay, Ruth, what the hell is going on?

681
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:28,125
What's going on?

682
00:48:28,733 --> 00:48:31,201
You waltz in here after 20 years...

683
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:34,330
insulting my cooking,
getting drunk with my boyfriend...

684
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:36,973
filling my daughter's head
with all kinds of ideas...

685
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,772
and reminding my sons
of traumatic events in their lives.

686
00:48:39,853 --> 00:48:44,244
Jesus Christ, the boy
was gonna lose his virginity sooner or later.

687
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,211
And Fiona is a great woman.
Very compassionate...

688
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:48,408
He was molested!

689
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:52,327
He was a horny 15-year-old
who couldn't believe his good luck.

690
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:56,682
I shouldn't be surprised you won't take
any responsibility. You never have.

691
00:48:56,773 --> 00:48:59,731
Okay, that's what this is about.

692
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:02,487
When mother died, someone had to step up.

693
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,724
Someone had to take care of Nanny,
but you just did as you pleased.

694
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,883
You never let anybody help you.

695
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:12,091
God forbid anything should interfere
with you feeling sorry for yourself!

696
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:15,324
If that's what you need to believe
to justify your own selfishness...

697
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,802
What do you want me to say, Ruth?

698
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:19,372
I want you to apologize.

699
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:23,969
Fine. I apologize!
Does that make it any better?

700
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:27,125
No, because you had more fun than I did!

701
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:32,048
Fun?

702
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,808
The only man I ever loved...

703
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:39,771
died when I was 21.

704
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:47,092
The children I so desperately wanted
were impossible...

705
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:50,531
because my ovaries are dry as stone.

706
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:54,084
And I'm a terrible artist...

707
00:49:54,173 --> 00:49:56,687
but I surround myself with people...

708
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:59,651
who have talent that I will never realize.

709
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:03,010
It's all hard, Ruth.

710
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:07,122
We just made different choices.

711
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:23,648
I'm sorry. I didn't know about the ovaries.

712
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:30,926
It's fine.

713
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:37,003
I'm sorry about Nathaniel.

714
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:39,612
Thank you.

715
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:44,162
I got your flowers a couple of months later.

716
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:47,166
I was in Peru.

717
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,930
Let me finish mopping.

718
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:17,604
- How's the writing?
- Good, really good.

719
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:24,209
Somebody had a good day.

720
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:26,964
It's just this woman...

721
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:32,128
who was screaming at the mangled body
of her dead husband who used to beat her.

722
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,932
Can you imagine hating someone that much
and staying with them for 20 years?

723
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:46,245
What makes you think people stay together
because it makes them happy?

724
00:51:50,493 --> 00:51:52,006
Promise me...

725
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,893
if things ever start to go nutso,
or you ever hate me...

726
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:57,248
that we'll deal with it.
We won't just cover it up?

727
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:01,565
Don't worry, I'll be long gone
before you can hate me.

728
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:05,693
I don't think I could ever hate you.

729
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:09,201
Besides, we know what we're doing here.

730
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,692
Absolutely.

731
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:17,049
So what did you do today?

732
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:19,241
Not much.

733
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:21,167
A client.

734
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,286
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:28,570
Releasing your cock
from the prison of your pants.

736
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:31,929
- Do you think that's wise?
- Do you want me to stop?

737
00:52:44,613 --> 00:52:46,092
It's just me.

738
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:47,886
Are you busy?

739
00:52:48,653 --> 00:52:51,963
I was just chatting
with this friend of mine online.

740
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:54,851
I found some things
I thought you might want.

741
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:56,082
What things?

742
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,245
Just some things
I've collected over the years.

743
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,884
- Are these all mine?
- Yes.

744
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:10,607
No way.

745
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,927
Oh, my God, it's Blue Pajama Man.

746
00:53:18,173 --> 00:53:20,004
I totally forgot about him.

747
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:22,402
I kept everything you ever did.

748
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:26,528
Mom.

749
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:39,726
Where's Nate?

750
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,924
He had left home already.

751
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:45,046
What about Dad?

752
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:48,164
He was probably working.

753
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:56,481
My God.

754
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:04,253
