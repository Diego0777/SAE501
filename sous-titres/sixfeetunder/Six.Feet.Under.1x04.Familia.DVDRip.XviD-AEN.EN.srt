1
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:45,598
- Piece of shit's whacked.
- Try the celly again.

2
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,921
And it ain't no piece of shit. The
alternator's a little temperamental.

3
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:55,362
Well, maybe the battery's dead,
like this phone.

4
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,999
Look, it ain't the battery.
It's the alt...

5
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:06,875
Hey, this is like one of them
Scream movies, huh?

6
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,961
More like Boyz N the Hood.

7
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:13,599
I'm gonna jet to that phone.
One of my dogs'll hook us up.

8
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,724
I know you ain't leaving
me here all alone.

9
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:20,006
Hey, look, you'll be safer in here.
Be back in three, all right?

10
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:24,439
- All right.
- Give me some love.

11
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,607
Ain 't nobody home,
Leave a message,

12
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,043
Hey, Luis, pick up the phone, dog.
Hey, wake up, man.

13
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,125
Damn.

14
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:08,001
Fucking lazy-ass punk,
motherfucker man.

15
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:13,923
Paco! Oh, my God!

16
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:20,442
Who the fuck is it?

17
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,332
Hello?

18
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,646
Hello?

19
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:27,326
Hello!

20
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,607
- Where you from?
- Your mama's pussy, bitch.

21
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:38,449
Paco! Paco!

22
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:42,523
Paco, no! No!

23
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:44,333
- Let's go.
- No!

24
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,248
No! No!

25
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:07,408
Miss Chenowith gave us her account
of your activities at the crime scene.

26
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,614
Crime scene? So you're
saying it was arson?

27
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:11,888
What's your story, Mr. Fisher?

28
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,088
The house is empty. I wanted to show
Brenda where I hung out as a kid.

29
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,569
I don't know why he
wanted to show it to me.

30
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,049
Can you tell us what you did
while you were there?

31
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,694
Walked around, looked at things.

32
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,291
You really expect us to believe you
broke into an abandoned house...

33
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,094
...just to walk around?

34
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,179
Okay. We fucked.

35
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,219
- You were there for an hour or so?
- Tops.

36
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,335
Could you walk us through what the
two of you did for that hour?

37
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:50,057
We made love.

38
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:54,495
Could you please be as
specific as possible?

39
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:58,173
Just to establish a timeline.

40
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:04,376
Well, he went down on
me for a while.

41
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,063
He's really good at it.

42
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:10,183
I don't exactly remember
the specifics.

43
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:13,621
He was in a state, like he had
a lot of aggression to work out.

44
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:16,140
She said that I was aggressive?

45
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,385
- Man, she should talk.
- Then he fell asleep.

46
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,015
- What happened then?
- We were exhausted, so we left.

47
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:28,346
I left to meet somebody. He was just
waking up. I don't know what he did.

48
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:32,625
- Can I go?
- I think we have everything we need.

49
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:36,979
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Peace out, guys.

50
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,542
Well, yeah, she left first,
I left right after that,

51
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:45,260
Are you aware that the property was
purchased by Kroehner Service?

52
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:49,137
Yes, Matt Gilardi said they were planning
to open a cheap cremation place...

53
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,747
...and put us out of business.

54
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:55,739
Was that the point where you called
him a "greedy Nazi fuck"?

55
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,942
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that is correct.

56
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,587
You think I set the fire?

57
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,508
Well, you have to admit...

58
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,907
...it does seem like a beneficial
turn of events for your business.

59
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,944
- So, what, do I need a lawyer?
- Not yet.

60
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,630
You're free to go.

61
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
Actually, one more thing.

62
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,905
Do you know where your sister
was on the night of the fire?

63
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,511
No, why?

64
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:32,150
I understand she had a run-in with
the law recently. A missing foot.

65
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:36,631
If she is developing a pattern of acting
out subsequent to her father's death...

66
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:39,148
Claire had nothing to
do with that fire.

67
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,503
How do you know?

68
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,989
I knew passing the health department
inspection was too good to be true.

69
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,867
It just meant something
else would go wrong.

70
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,465
Great, there goes a month's profit.

71
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,587
We can live without air conditioning.
Plenty of people do.

72
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:59,508
Yeah, people in the Third World.

73
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:02,149
We can't run a business
without air conditioning.

74
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,914
If we lose any more funerals...

75
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:07,506
...Kroehner won't have to take
us over. We'll be bankrupt.

76
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,664
- How much?
- Central air, three grand easy.

77
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:17,075
Guess what.
Gilardi tipped the cops off.

78
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:20,906
- Think I'm a suspect.
- That's ridiculous.

79
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:24,747
- Where's Claire?
- School. I hope.

80
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,994
Do you know where
she was before the fire?

81
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,077
Why, what is it? Oh, dear God,
they don't think...

82
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,634
Oh, she couldn't have.

83
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,632
Good news, bad news.

84
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,474
Compressor's fine. Bad news is, your
pneumatic actuator assembly is shot.

85
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,310
Normally, I could do it in a day, but
with this heat wave, give me five days.

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,795
- Five?
- What's it gonna set us back?

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,356
Shouldn't debt you more than
3700, parts and labor.

88
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,396
Our 10:00.

89
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,920
Tell them we'll have air conditioning.

90
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,751
Three days.

91
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,712
He would have been 21 next week.

92
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,074
We were gonna buy him a new bed.

93
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:18,158
- Now we're buying him a coffin.
- Three in the morning.

94
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,673
He shouldn't have been out with
that girl in that neighborhood.

95
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:26,162
It's the worst thing that can happen,
to lose a child.

96
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,878
We lost him years ago.

97
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,599
- We'll see to it that Paco...
- His name is Manny.

98
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:43,359
- His gang name was Paco.
- He goes by Paco.

99
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,763
And he wasn't lost,
he was assassinated.

100
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:51,595
We'll see to it that he
has a dignified service.

101
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,958
We've been to three funeral
homes. No one will take us.

102
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,880
We don't turn people away here.

103
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:02,400
But sometimes when families lack
the funds necessary or insurance...

104
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:05,162
- I got money.
- We don't want your money.

105
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,679
If your son is willing to finance...

106
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:12,724
- He's not our son!
- He's a gang leader. Alvarado Kings.

107
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,324
- Don't you read the papers?
- My name is Powerful.

108
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:24,408
Paco's gonna have a fat-ass
funeral whatever it costs.

109
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,922
We got mad cash, so long as
you all can do it up right.

110
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,079
Now, can you all do it up right
or should we move on?

111
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,449
If you'll excuse me.

112
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:43,521
Nate will show you flower arrangements,
which might be to your liking.

113
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,445
Lilies are always nice.

114
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:03,205
Federico, I need your help,
your expertise.

115
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:07,168
- I've got a really tough one upstairs.
- Decomp? Crispy critter?

116
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,842
Gunshots, no facial damage,
cut and dried.

117
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:14,014
The family wants a traditional
Mexican funeral.

118
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:17,571
Okay. What's a traditional
Mexican funeral?

119
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:21,655
But there's this other guy,
the deceased's gang leader.

120
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:27,373
And what does this have
to do with me?

121
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,852
I was hoping you would
talk to them for me. With me.

122
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:34,094
What, because I'm Latino,
I know about gangs?

123
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,253
Well, you probably
know more than I do.

124
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,294
And why's that?

125
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:43,209
Well, I just assumed that maybe
somebody in your family might...

126
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:45,886
No, no one in my family. Never.

127
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:49,210
I've worked here for years, and you
don't know a damn thing about me.

128
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,774
- That's not true.
- You own an atlas?

129
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,328
- An atlas?
- Yeah, because if you did...

130
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:58,094
...you'd know there's 2400 miles
between Puerto Rico and Mexico.

131
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,170
You're Puerto Rican?

132
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,888
Look, Federico, I'm
sorry. I just assumed...

133
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:19,056
We can't afford to lose this funeral.

134
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,141
And I'm afraid if Nate and I
are the point of contact, we will.

135
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:28,298
This is our blue opal, 20 gauge
aluminum and copper...

136
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:32,132
...with a light blue,
sovereign velvet interior.

137
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,937
- It's nicer than our car.
- It's beautiful.

138
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,698
It's not good enough.

139
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:48,012
Mrs. Bolin, if this is the casket you
want for your son, you should have it.

140
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,176
He is your son.

141
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,337
Hey.

142
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,741
Where you from, dog?

143
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,383
One moment, please.

144
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:18,820
"Where you from?" Like, where
my parents were born?

145
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:23,260
San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico.
"Where you from?"

146
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:28,144
As in, what gang I belong to? Yeah,
I'll tell you what gang I belong to.

147
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,739
The gang that's gonna help
you bury your friend.

148
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:34,417
The gang that's gonna be there
for you and your cholos...

149
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,747
...when every other home doesn't
wanna deal with your bullshit.

150
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:41,386
Your friend is dead, man.

151
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,060
Now, do you want me to help you
or you just wanna go heads-up?

152
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,264
It's good.

153
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:05,740
- I don't like it. It's dangerous.
- Not if we let Rico handle everything.

154
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,740
David, we are so white. If we
step in, we will totally fuck up.

155
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,312
Language.

156
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:13,743
I'm more worried whether
Claire started that fire.

157
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,063
Why would she? To help us out?
She hates us.

158
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:19,908
- Is Brenda a vegetarian?
- She'll eat anything.

159
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:29,148
Did you know the night dad died,
Claire was high on crystal meth?

160
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:32,188
Oh, my God,
isn't that a horse tranquilizer?

161
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,273
No, it's speed, really nasty speed
that makes you crazy.

162
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,625
If there are things
you don't want me to hear...

163
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:39,951
...go talk about them in another room.

164
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:45,308
- I assume she drinks.
- I can call and tell her to cancel.

165
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:47,512
No, I've been looking
forward to this.

166
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:51,107
I have some errands to run. I'll pick
up a nice chardonnay while I'm out.

167
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:54,787
- What errands?
- I can give you a list if you'd like.

168
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:00,751
You guys, this kid at school today
got busted for having a taser...

169
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,108
...because he showed it to
his friends at lunch.

170
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:07,630
What an idiot. There were like six
cops. It was absolutely hilarious.

171
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,790
What?

172
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,389
No, it's not really
a gang funeral. It's...

173
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,108
They needed a home,
we needed a body. Everyone wins.

174
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,118
Yeah, right. Who you gonna call
when the bullets start flying?

175
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,551
- Anyone but you.
- Oh, you damn straight.

176
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,070
Claire's gonna need a lawyer.
A good one.

177
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:34,956
Look, if she set that fire,
she'll do what's right. I'll see to it.

178
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:39,074
What's right is getting her top legal
counsel and having her plead the Fifth.

179
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:43,400
I don't care what you do, just keep her
out of the system. She'll be eaten alive.

180
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,560
Any chance you can snoop around
and find out their game plan?

181
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,230
I don't know. I already
interfered once.

182
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,321
- Are you guys pulling out or what?
- Yeah, in a minute.

183
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,838
Well, let's go.

184
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,874
Fucking fags, man.

185
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,043
Keith.

186
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,724
Keith!

187
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,677
- Say it again.
- What?

188
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:21,123
I said, say it again. The next time
you call someone a fucking fag...

189
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,199
...you make sure that fag
isn't an L.A.P.D. Officer.

190
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,959
You got that?

191
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,996
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:33,324
Now, you got my badge,
file a complaint. I dare you.

193
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:38,642
You get your punk ass out of here,
fucking bitch.

194
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:47,485
- Tore his ass up.
- I don't think he meant anything by it.

195
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,123
Do you hate yourself that much?

196
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,320
This is some fucked up way to
make a living. You know that?

197
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:25,963
- How's your day, man?
- You don't wanna know.

198
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:30,003
You ever see sunlight?
Or you gotta avoid it?

199
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:37,448
- Hey, you checking out my dick.
- I was not.

200
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:42,208
I'm just fucking with you, man.

201
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:46,488
Hi.

202
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:55,170
A gift from my parents.
They'll freak when they find out.

203
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,607
- You're an hour early.
- Really?

204
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,090
Yeah.

205
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:10,288
Not quite as Addams Family
as I'd expected.

206
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,057
Dave and I used to play Addams
Family when we were kids.

207
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,533
I was usually Gomez.
He was always Lurch.

208
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,452
The kitsch factor is substantial.

209
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:24,492
Hence your well-developed
sense of irony, I suppose.

210
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,856
- It's hot in here.
- Do I hear voices?

211
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:32,257
- Look who's early.
- It's a pleasure to see you again.

212
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:35,337
I'm so glad you could make it, dear.

213
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:39,858
Champagne. How festive. Thank you.

214
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,931
Excuse me, I'm knee-deep
in marinara. I'll go chill this.

215
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,214
Nate, give Brenda a tour.

216
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,691
- She hates me.
- Why do you say that?

217
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,812
Because it's true.

218
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,499
What's the matter?
Afraid Mommy might see?

219
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:06,092
Okay, okay. Can we not turn
tonight into psych 101?

220
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,976
Because trust me, we'd never
make it through the evening.

221
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,777
Somebody's defensive.

222
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:15,976
Nate, it doesn't matter if your
mother likes me or not. I don't care.

223
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,135
What's that shit?

224
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:27,094
Oh, hell no. No.

225
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,783
Hey, how come you don't
call your bone daddy?

226
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:36,855
Still pissed at him, right?
Hey, I'm feeling you, man.

227
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:40,502
What gives him the right to get up
in your world? You know, be so...?

228
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,095
So fucking self-righteous?

229
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:50,341
That's what I'm saying. You don't call
him nothing, but he went off on you.

230
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,744
Yeah. I think he's got a problem with
that stress-management shit.

231
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:57,257
Hey, or maybe he's one of
them rage-aholics.

232
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:01,063
- I mean, that boy went off.
- Just because some kid calls him a fag.

233
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:06,063
- It's so unnecessary.
- Well, he called you a fag too.

234
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:09,067
- So?
- So, what'd you do?

235
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,867
Nothing.

236
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,940
And Simon Peter stood
and warmed himself.

237
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,222
They said therefore unto him,
"Art not thou one of his disciples?"

238
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:30,108
- He denied it and said, "I am not."
- John 18:25.

239
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:34,782
No wonder he went
off on you, man. You know?

240
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:41,431
Hey, bury me naked, please.

241
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:43,862
It's a shame Diane Arbus is dead.

242
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:48,112
She could take some fucking
great photographs in here.

243
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:56,863
- What's the matter with you today?
- Nothing. I just have a lot on my mind.

244
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:00,623
- I don't wanna bore you with it.
- Thank you.

245
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,111
Come here.

246
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,828
- Why?
- Just do it.

247
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,268
What's wrong?

248
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:27,627
I'm about to become an undertaker,
and I'm scared to death of it.

249
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,226
A huge corporation wants
to put us out of business...

250
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,510
...and I'm worried my sister's not
only a crackhead, she's an arsonist.

251
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:40,393
- There's a lot of sadness in this house.
- It's a funeral home.

252
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:46,435
No wonder you ran away. You channel
other people's pain, you know that?

253
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,313
My father called it a gift.

254
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,914
It is a gift.

255
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:36,192
Oh, God!

256
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:42,832
- Oh, God!
- Guess dinner's ready.

257
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:47,642
So, what's it like to be interrogated?
Did you flash your crotch...

258
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,234
...like Sharon Stone in that movie?
- Claire.

259
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:54,358
They just keep asking the same
question different ways to trip you up.

260
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,399
That's cool. Was it fun?
I bet it was kind of fun.

261
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:00,922
- Not really.
- Think they'll wanna interrogate me?

262
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,004
No.

263
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:08,604
Nate, will you say grace?

264
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,402
- Wouldn't David rather?
- Please.

265
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:19,206
Thank you, Lord, for our health and
bounty through Christ. Amen.

266
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:21,325
What, are you on crack?

267
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,277
Squash?

268
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:28,888
Mom, Nate and I have been
working on a business plan...

269
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,398
...to figure out how we're
gonna fend off Kroehner.

270
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:36,047
Business plan? Your father
never had a business plan.

271
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,608
- Yeah, that's part of the problem.
- We'd like to go over it with you.

272
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:46,282
I don't need to see it.
It's your business, not mine.

273
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:49,684
- Is there sauce for the pasta?
- I'll get it.

274
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,008
- Brenda, what do you do for a living?
- She gives massages.

275
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,851
- Shiatsu.
- Now, what exactly is that?

276
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:00,327
It's a Japanese
bodywork technique...

277
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:05,128
...that involves pressure to points
on the acupuncture meridians.

278
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:10,361
Well, how interesting, acupuncture.
That's the pins, right?

279
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:15,768
- Yes. The pins.
- So you stick pins in people.

280
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:20,567
I use my thumbs, wrists, elbows.

281
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:23,965
So you stick your thumbs in people?

282
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:28,248
No. At least not as part of my job.

283
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:39,767
- I hope you stay for dessert.
- It's peach cobbler.

284
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,609
Yum.

285
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:54,896
This is a nice box. That
Federico is a good salesman, huh?

286
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,612
I'll say. You know what the
markup is on one of these?

287
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:59,854
Thirty-two hundred.

288
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,335
Hey, can I get like a nightlight up
in here? I don't like the dark.

289
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,054
Well, then you shouldn't have gone
and gotten yourself shot.

290
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,135
Shit, that's cold, man.

291
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,137
Mr. Powerful and his
entourage are here.

292
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,810
- I'll be right there.
- Who were you talking to?

293
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,059
Myself.

294
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:33,619
David, why did you stop
going to church with me?

295
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:37,975
I've been going to a different church
with a friend of mine.

296
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:42,137
That cop? The black man?

297
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:45,332
Don't be a pussy.

298
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:49,335
Yes, Mom, that cop, the black man.

299
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:29,783
I love you, Paco. Oh, God.

300
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,707
You all right?

301
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:58,030
I look like a fucking Bible
salesman. I look like you.

302
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,621
Man, what's up with this
whack-ass music?

303
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:13,227
- I'm not sure about the music.
- Yeah, it blows.

304
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:15,309
What about the "Ave Maria"?

305
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:17,264
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

306
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:52,348
Honey?

307
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:56,907
God, no. No, please.

308
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,353
No, no, no.

309
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,710
No!

310
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:20,355
It's like a mad scientist lab in here.
How can you live here?

311
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,915
Better than a Turkish prison.
Most days.

312
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,034
- Jesus.
- Told you.

313
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,879
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- I don't know. Shot at a few.

314
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,318
Everybody thinks I burned down
this house across the street.

315
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:50,277
- Did you?
- What do you think?

316
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:59,112
What's it like to shoot a gun?

317
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:01,513
You wanna try some time?

318
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:07,081
- Come down to East Los, be down.
- Are you serious? Because I will.

319
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:12,120
You're some kind of
tough, little bitch, huh?

320
00:28:16,884 --> 00:28:20,240
You didn't hear your road dog
calling for help on your machine.

321
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,560
You ain't gonna spend
the rest of your life...

322
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:26,155
...wondering why you didn't pick up
the phone the first time it rang.

323
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:28,196
You're hurting me.

324
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:32,518
You don't know shit, little girl.

325
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,322
Don't waste my time.

326
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:46,718
This one right here is my first one.
After that, man...

327
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:51,079
I mean, I got me this one right here
when I got jumped in. Check it out.

328
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:54,360
- That's very intricate.
- Yeah.

329
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:58,925
And this one. This one took me
three weeks to heal. Watch out.

330
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,438
That's the shit, huh?

331
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:11,719
- Can I help you?
- Hi, it's so good to see you again.

332
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,479
- How have you been?
- Fine.

333
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,559
So sad. I read about Manuel's death in
the Times. I had to pay my respects.

334
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,925
Oh, it's heartbreaking. The riots...
I mean, the uprising...

335
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,726
...was supposed to increase the peace
and all we have are more dead children.

336
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,205
Did you know him?

337
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,802
Oh, I feel I know all
these innocent victims.

338
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:39,680
This is not a good time. If you'd like
to forward a card to the family...

339
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:43,329
Well, maybe I could just
stay a few minutes.

340
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:48,807
A card. I'll do that.

341
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:09,455
You should have seen
my baby, so happy...

342
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:14,172
...such a smile that could
break your heart.

343
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:21,764
What kind of God lets a baby like
that get caught up in all that shit?

344
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,450
Drugs.

345
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,815
Guns.

346
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:29,770
Death.

347
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:40,537
Mrs. Bolin, I'm not gonna tell you
that it's all gonna be okay.

348
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,207
But it just takes time.

349
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,728
This is as bad as it gets.

350
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:50,172
I have nothing to live for.

351
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,617
You have your husband.
You have you.

352
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,535
You have the memory of that little
baby. You have to keep that alive.

353
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:06,014
My father died on Christmas Eve.

354
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:11,211
And there's so much I never said...

355
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:15,092
...never knew about him.

356
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,298
But he's a part of me.

357
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:23,021
And Manny will always
be a part of you.

358
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:28,698
Why didn't God take me
instead of my boy?

359
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,016
I don't know.

360
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:39,054
You gotta apologize to your boy Keith.
Otherwise, you're just a born bitch.

361
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,494
You're speaking like
this at your funeral?

362
00:31:41,705 --> 00:31:46,017
Damn straight. I say
whatever I goddamn please.

363
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:52,382
I've been to a ton of funerals.
You seen one, you seen them all.

364
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:56,505
- Even mine.
- No gunfire, no fights.

365
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:01,497
Nah. No Sharks, no Jets.

366
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,777
Just like any other funeral.

367
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:10,423
- You let down, huh?
- A little.

368
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:21,703
A Detective McBride just called. They
made a determination of the house fire.

369
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:25,982
- They termed it "cause unknown."
- So they ruled out arson.

370
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:30,740
No, they just can't tell.
Either way, the case is closed.

371
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,942
Which doesn't rule out the possibility
that Claire set that fire.

372
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,424
She didn't do that, Nate.

373
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,345
Well, what if she did, Mom? Pretending
it didn't happen is not gonna help.

374
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,699
I'm sorry about last night
with Brenda...

375
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:54,343
...when you walked in on us.
- I know what you're talking about.

376
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,868
- Where have you been?
- None of your business.

377
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,633
When did this become a police state?

378
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:09,387
I need an Altoid.

379
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:22,070
The original sin
wasn't eating the apple.

380
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,432
It wasn't questioning authority.

381
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:31,228
It was not giving God the chance
to give his side of the argument.

382
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:35,827
It was just taking the
serpent's word as gospel.

383
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:40,946
It was not going back to God
and saying, "Hey, what gives?

384
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:44,473
He said you are lying to us."

385
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:49,907
It was just assuming that God lies.

386
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,673
I'm sorry about the other day.

387
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:00,679
Aren't you gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm sorry too...

388
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:05,191
...for revealing my dormant psycho
side and scaring the shit out of you"?

389
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,230
You really think I hate myself?

390
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,512
- Good to see you, David.
- Hi.

391
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,670
I know where you are. I was there.
I'll wait for you because I love you.

392
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,311
But I'm not moving
backwards for anybody.

393
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:31,515
I'm not asking you to move backwards.
I'm just asking you to be patient...

394
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,553
...and a little calmer.

395
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:36,913
Do you have any idea what I put up
with on my job every day?

396
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:40,235
How many times the word "fag"
has been written on my locker?

397
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:44,920
How many times I wonder going into a
dangerous situation if I'll get back up?

398
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,279
We were stepped on
yesterday, David.

399
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:50,914
And I did something about it
because I am tired of it.

400
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:55,003
When you get tired of it,
you let me know.

401
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:06,201
- Morning.
- Hi.

402
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:12,882
You think I should make a peace
offering to your mother?

403
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:15,395
No, that'll just make things worse.

404
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:18,200
I brought it up yesterday.
She nearly bit my head off.

405
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:23,401
Oh, Jesus. It's no accident you
guys are undertakers...

406
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:27,600
...because you take every fucking feeling
you have, put it in a box and bury it.

407
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:32,438
Better that than examine every fucking
moment until the joy is drained out of it.

408
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,406
- Come here.
- No.

409
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,561
Just do it.

410
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,285
Sex does not solve everything, Nate.

411
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,726
You wouldn 't have to
worry about us,,,

412
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,365
,,, while you're working
and we're out of school,

413
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:04,001
Right, The family that plays
together, stays together,

414
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:08,841
And it'd be a groovy way to find out
exactly what's wrong with this country,

415
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,652
I'd be able to see all
the injustices firsthand,

416
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:14,241
Look, kids, everything
you say makes sense,,,

417
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,364
,,, and it would be marvelous
if we could go, But there's one,,,,

418
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:20,690
Claire, are you okay?

419
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:30,092
- No.
- Well, do you wanna talk about it?

420
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,293
Sure.

421
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:37,643
My pimp's threatening to beat me up
because I can't turn enough tricks.

422
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:43,134
What's worse is, he's threatening to
take away my smack. It's hell.

423
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:52,695
- Why do you have to be such a bitch?
- Why do you assume I'm in trouble?

424
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:57,208
Like you guys are such
shining examples. Jesus.

425
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:02,416
She's right, Mom, Do you want
Chris to pump gas all his life?

426
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:05,973
And Tracy to wait on tables
in some sleazy strip joint?

427
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,410
Kroehner is going to keep
strong-arming our suppliers...

428
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,973
...undercutting us, stealing funerals.

429
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:16,734
We're never gonna be able to compete
in terms of size or market presence.

430
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:21,012
Where we can compete
is quality of service, integrity.

431
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:25,935
- We'll give them the human touch.
- It all sounds good to me.

432
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,857
Is this over?

433
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,735
But we have to get our message out.
We'll need to market and promote.

434
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,171
Replace outmoded equipment
and install computers.

435
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,611
Fine.

436
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,249
In order to make this all work, we'll
need a significant financial investment.

437
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:47,137
- How much?
- Ninety-three thousand.

438
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:53,132
You want me to give you $93,000
from your father's life insurance?

439
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:54,781
Nobody else is going to do it.

440
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,701
We're still paying off a bank
note Dad took out years ago.

441
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,731
We hate to ask, Mom,
but we're desperate.

442
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:06,574
- Of course, you're not obligated.
- I know that.

443
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:10,701
When do you need it?

444
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:16,572
- You sure, Mom?
- But it's not a loan.

445
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:20,775
I'm now an investor
in Fisher & Sons.

446
00:38:21,945 --> 00:38:26,621
We'll establish a fair percentage
of equity and rate of return.

447
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:31,144
I can invest in either
my boys or tech stocks.

448
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:34,258
Anything's better than the track.

449
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:42,621
David, I'd like it if you'd come with
me to church every once in a while...

450
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:47,457
...now that your father's gone.
I shouldn't have to go alone.

451
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,581
Okay.

452
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:58,224
Well, that was weird.

453
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:01,747
It gets weirder. There was a message
on my machine from Gilardi.

454
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:04,861
He wants to meet with us today.

455
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,388
Hey, dog. Getting ready
to throw some blows?

456
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,983
If you were me, Paco, what would you
say to Gilardi? What would you do?

457
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,670
If I was you?

458
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,781
Shit, if I was you, I wouldn't
own a fucking funeral home.

459
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,829
But all right.

460
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:32,145
All right, say I'm doing my thing,
selling my shit.

461
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,504
Some punk ass tries to
clock me from my corner.

462
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:39,065
You know what I say?

463
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:47,191
I say, "Peep this, motherfucker! 5:00,
you near me, my corner or my shit...

464
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:50,704
...I'll cut your fucking stomach,
watch your guts spill out.

465
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:54,793
I'll let you live until
you slowly bleed to death...

466
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:57,873
...in front of your fucking kids."

467
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,273
Feel your heart racing?

468
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:13,546
Because when the other guy
feels like that, you won.

469
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,748
Come on, David.

470
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,188
You gotta stand up, man.
You gotta step up.

471
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,992
Yeah, you stepped up.
Look what happened to you.

472
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:28,596
That's right. For 20 years,
I lived my life like a man.

473
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,027
When are you gonna start?

474
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:43,079
- You lowered your offer.
- What can I say? The market fluctuates.

475
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,192
Thanks, but we don't see a need to
align ourselves with Kroehner right now.

476
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,358
Okay.

477
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,517
I'll make it simple.

478
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,310
You accept our offer
by the end of the day...

479
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,957
...or I'll make it my personal mission
to bury you by the end of the month.

480
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,358
David, you in on
this suicide mission?

481
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,555
David?

482
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,753
- You just threatened my family.
- Let's not be melodramatic.

483
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:17,313
What do you expect us
to do, run and hide?

484
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:20,993
- Sell and be grateful? Pack up and move?
- Lf you're smart.

485
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:27,794
You have the Kroehner organization
behind you. And what do we have?

486
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,043
You.

487
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:34,319
One day when your mind isn't
on Fisher & Sons...

488
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:37,562
...I will find you
or someone you love.

489
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,038
I'm not saying anyone
is going to die.

490
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:45,281
There are tragedies
far worse than death.

491
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:51,163
Things you couldn't even dream of, you
spineless, candy-ass, corporate fuck.

492
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:53,601
Just give me a reason.

493
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:04,199
It's your decision. Are we really
worth the trouble, Mr. Gilardi?

494
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:10,361
Lunch is over. Get lost.

495
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,519
Are you deaf?

496
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,446
- What the fuck was that?
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

497
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,882
Hi.

498
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,085
I hope you like fancy bath stuff. I went
a little crazy at the Beverly Center.

499
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:44,925
- Thank you. This wasn't necessary.
- Yes, it was.

500
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:49,370
I'm afraid you might not have seen
me in my best light the other night.

501
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:52,291
I saw more of you than I cared to.

502
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:54,964
Okay.

503
00:42:55,772 --> 00:43:00,324
Look. I'm not a very
traditional person.

504
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:07,530
And I don't really know what's
happening between me and Nate...

505
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:13,525
...but every once in a while
I get a glimpse...

506
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:17,853
...of things maybe working
out for us...

507
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:23,089
...and I'm really sorry
about what happened.

508
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,806
Be careful with him.

509
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:33,966
He's a lot more fragile
than he'd like to think.

510
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,453
Aren't we all?

511
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:43,530
- Well, thank you.
- My pleasure.

512
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,295
Are the Fishers around?

513
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:00,372
- You need David?
- All of them and you too.

514
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,331
Just tell me what
you're unhappy with.

515
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,530
Just get them, all right?

516
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:18,411
Will you join us?

517
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,741
Merciful Jesus...

518
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:44,018
...please bring rest and peace
to our fallen brother...

519
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,657
...son...

520
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:49,421
...friend...

521
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:53,181
...Manuel Paco Bolin.

522
00:44:55,344 --> 00:45:00,021
May he live with you
forever in your lightened truth.

523
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:05,614
- Almighty Father. Amen.
- Amen.

524
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:12,704
We also wanna thank the Fishers...

525
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:18,176
...who lost a father and husband.

526
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:22,817
Lord bring peace to
them in their grief...

527
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:26,938
...as you have in ours.

528
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:34,506
We'll miss you.

529
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:59,229
Hey, let go of me, you
fucking fag. I gots to go.

530
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,544
Jesus, you're just a kid.

531
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:05,983
So are you.

532
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:23,510
Hey, David.

533
00:46:24,674 --> 00:46:26,904
Don't be a bitch.

534
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:45,151
Shit. Now, I know why you
wanted to go bowling...

535
00:46:45,356 --> 00:46:47,586
...instead of a movie.
- I was state champion...

536
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:50,515
...in the Youth For Christ Bowling
League when I was 17.

537
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:55,074
- You're gonna beat the pants off me.
- That's my intent.

538
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:59,073
I got a college degree, and I still
cannot figure how this scoring works.

539
00:46:59,277 --> 00:47:01,996
Hey, you fellows together?

540
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:05,952
Yeah, we are.

541
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,351
That's cool.

542
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,952
Hey, Bren, the door's unlocked.

543
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:25,708
- Brenda?
- In the bedroom.

544
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,276
I'm just here to deliver a pizza,
ma'am. I don't want any trouble.

545
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,517
I got your tip right here.

546
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:35,880
Whoa.

547
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:40,277
Where's my pizza?

548
00:47:47,642 --> 00:47:53,991
Mom asked me to tell you that the
lavender bath scrub was delicious.

549
00:47:54,763 --> 00:47:57,436
She's not supposed to eat it.

550
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:04,274
- What's with all the candles?
- I'm burning up.

551
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:08,757
Burning up for your love.

552
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,804
What?

553
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,040
What?

554
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:29,678
You like some guy enough to have
his name burned in your flesh.

555
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:32,042
I would have done a lot
more than that for him.

556
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:41,315
- What's up with you?
- I had a really weird day.

557
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:48,198
Poor baby.

558
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:31,361
- Mom, are you okay?
- Fine.

559
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:39,090
Can I ask you something? And
you promise to tell me the truth?

560
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:40,966
Maybe.

561
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:45,091
- Did you set that fire?
- No.

562
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:49,131
No, I would never
do anything like that.

563
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:53,449
I may have swiped that foot, though.

564
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,091
Dinner's almost ready.

565
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:24,058
