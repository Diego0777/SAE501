1
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,858
<i>Trash. As in trailer trash.</i>

2
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,939
They're 20 minutes late with my Vioxx again.

3
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,059
I'm in such pain.

4
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,858
I'm in such agony.

5
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,614
I wish the Good Lord would take me soon.

6
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:16,052
How are things at home with you and Rico?
He still acting crazy?

7
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,213
I don't know,
but he definitely has a bug up his ass.

8
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,893
Mid-life crisis.

9
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,017
He's too young for that.

10
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,015
Honey, men start having their mid-life crisis
in their early 20s...

11
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,457
and they keep on having them
every three to five years after that.

12
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,374
You're gonna have to eat more than this,
Mrs. Kippleman.

13
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,850
- Shit!
- Now what?

14
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,617
Vanessa, she's got no pulse.

15
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:41,855
Shit!

16
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,130
- She's a full code?
- I don't know.

17
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,140
Come on, Edith, come on.

18
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:53,180
A world-class complainer like you
isn't gonna give up that easy.

19
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,977
- How about these?
- The green pants.

20
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:15,940
- Actually, these are olive.
- I can get myself dressed, you know.

21
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,420
I'm just trying to help.

22
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,413
- Did I ask for your help?
- No.

23
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,537
Then what the hell are you doing
in my room?

24
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:25,260
Hey, you don't talk to David that way.

25
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,810
You'd better start showing some respect
around here.

26
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:30,540
- Or what, you're gonna put me in jail?
- What did you say?

27
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:31,656
Let her go.

28
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,494
We've got to start setting
some serious boundaries with her.

29
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,856
Look at all the shit she's had to deal with.

30
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,501
Not to mention the past couple of months.
She's 9.

31
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,378
- I know how old she is.
- I'm just saying...

32
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:43,133
Do you want to pick a fight with me?

33
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:46,577
No, do you want to pick a fight
with a 9-year-old about her attitude?

34
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,379
This morning I do.

35
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,012
Too fucking bad. I know you're nervous
about your old man coming...

36
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,650
but I don't have to let you
take it out on Taylor. Or me.

37
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:04,131
- It's 9:30.
- So?

38
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,614
Let me sleep late.

39
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,977
It's the last enjoyment I'll know
before I become a cog in the wheel...

40
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,336
making mocha lattes
for the people who have a life.

41
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,891
- Don't you think that's a little dramatic?
- Not really.

42
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:22,854
- Can I make you something to eat?
- No, thanks.

43
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,974
You never eat a decent breakfast anymore.

44
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:29,534
This is a glass of orange juice.
This is an apple.

45
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,614
That's two of my daily servings of fruit
recommended by the USDA.

46
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,692
Claire, are you depressed?

47
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,140
I'm not even gonna answer that question.

48
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:45,257
Whatever you're going through,
I hope you don't blame me.

49
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,454
I was just calling you.

50
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,578
What, you can be late all you want
but I'm not allowed to be?

51
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,095
- Calm down.
- Why? I'm pissed off!

52
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,775
I get pissed off sometimes.
I have a right to express it.

53
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,250
Express it to somebody else,
because I've got to run.

54
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,536
Brenda and I have a meeting with Rabbi Ari.

55
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:09,215
- You're thinking of converting?
- Maybe.

56
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:13,051
What? I'm already circumcised.

57
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:17,820
- Anything I need to be aware of here?
- I did a pickup this morning at Bay Breeze...

58
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,300
another referral from Vanessa.

59
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:23,659
Great, another chance for Rico to act
like we owe our entire livelihood to him.

60
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,220
Hello! Mr. Fisher?

61
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,815
Dave, you've got to lighten up, man.

62
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,170
Can I help you?

63
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,934
- Are you Nathaniel Fisher?
- No, he's deceased.

64
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:37,491
Wait a minute, that's me.
I'm Nathaniel Fisher, Jr.

65
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,572
Consider yourself served.

66
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,537
- Shit.
- Who was that?

67
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,777
You remember Mrs. Collins?

68
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,655
The waitress who got locked
in the walk-in overnight?

69
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,495
No, the wife of the guy who fell off the boat,
got sliced up by the propeller.

70
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:04,219
Yeah, the bargain hunter.

71
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,017
She wanted to see the body.

72
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,298
- You didn't.
- She made me.

73
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:16,652
Now she's suing us for emotional distress
to the tune of $500,000. Fuck!

74
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,020
There's an ashtray over there somewhere.

75
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,216
You should really clean this car out
sometime, you know.

76
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,452
What the fuck is this?

77
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:35,740
It's some creepy thing
my Aunt Sarah sent me for my birthday.

78
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,699
I don't know what happened.
Usually she has pretty good taste.

79
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:42,217
It's filled with some nasty Chinese
holistic herb shit.

80
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:46,340
Newsflash! These aren't Chinese herbs.

81
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:49,415
- They're not?
- These are shrooms.

82
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,491
My aunt sent me mushrooms?

83
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:57,097
Whatever you thought you were
doing tomorrow, plan on blowing it off.

84
00:06:57,181 --> 00:07:00,412
- What's wrong with today?
- I have a date with Mr. Schussler.

85
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,777
- Mr. Schussler the vocational arts teacher?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:07,497
And you can't fuck for shit
when you're on shrooms.

87
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:12,814
Marriage is a profound experience
that can deeply enrich your life...

88
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,290
and even bring you closer to God.

89
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:18,295
But our culture has many misconceptions
about it.

90
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,259
Like marriage will cure Ioneliness...

91
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:25,255
or that most of our satisfactions in life
should come from our partner.

92
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:27,935
Or that good sex means good marriage.

93
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:31,936
And the truth is that marriage is different
for different people.

94
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,535
So in this and our next five sessions...

95
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,613
we'll talk about what marriage means to you.

96
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,660
I'm curious.

97
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,178
- Have you ever been married?
- No, I haven't.

98
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,858
But I have counseled many couples
in my congregation...

99
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,455
both before, during, and after marriage.

100
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,611
One thing I can say without hesitation...

101
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,135
is you can't have a good marriage
without honesty.

102
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,210
Yeah.

103
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:58,213
That kind of goes without saying,
doesn't it?

104
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:03,494
Are you completely honest with each other?

105
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,656
You don't have to answer that right now.

106
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,892
It's just something to think about
for next week.

107
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:27,257
- Would you like some cucumber salad?
- No, thank you.

108
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,413
- I made more than enough.
- I reading paper.

109
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,856
Fine.

110
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,251
Take it, go ahead, take it.

111
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:06,620
I'll be back.

112
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,898
Like Terminator, no?

113
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,776
What is he? Did he threaten you?

114
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,811
Mind your own business, woman!

115
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:34,692
Can I just say that I think
total honesty is not always the best thing?

116
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,056
What about privacy?

117
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,417
What about trying to maintain the mystery
of a relationship?

118
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,289
Sometimes truth is irrelevant.

119
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,216
Brenda, I did something stupid.

120
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,020
I'm listening.

121
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,981
The trip to Seattle, my friend Lisa?

122
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,450
I slept with her. She's pregnant.

123
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:18,216
I don't even know how to respond
to something like this.

124
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:23,138
What do you feel?

125
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,938
I don't know what I feel.
I don't feel anything.

126
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:30,900
I feel numb.

127
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:37,650
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I'm telling you now.

128
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:42,659
What do you expect me to do
with this information?

129
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:46,730
Christ, Nate! This whole wedding thing
scares the shit out of me...

130
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:51,099
but I've been trying to make myself believe
that we could actually...

131
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:10,420
Almost done.

132
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:12,976
Okay.

133
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:20,214
Okay, then.

134
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,500
How bad is it?

135
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:26,811
- Your brother showed her the body?
- Yes.

136
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,337
- It was in pretty bad shape, huh?
- Yes.

137
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,060
I think she's got a pretty airtight case.

138
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:37,371
I think that you guys
are more or less fucked.

139
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,577
She made him show her the body.

140
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:43,017
I can certainly argue that point,
but, David, she was under duress...

141
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,695
and this woman is going to describe
in great detail...

142
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:47,931
exactly what she saw
when she's up on the stand.

143
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,854
On top of that,
she's hired herself an aggressive law firm...

144
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:54,456
that nobody likes to mess with,
so I think that we should try to settle.

145
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,418
How much money do you guys have?

146
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,651
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Where were you?

147
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:04,938
With Brenda. We were in the middle
of something pretty intense.

148
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:08,093
Do you know how much trouble we are in
because of this lawsuit?

149
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:09,773
I have things I've got to deal with.

150
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,977
I have a life, too. I have a kid now.

151
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:14,529
At least I try to keep it separate
from the business...

152
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,658
that you seem so hell-bent
on flushing down the fucking toilet!

153
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,693
We are fucked, Nate!

154
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,459
And you fucked us.

155
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:31,699
I'm afraid my daughter's suffering from
depression and I don't know what to do.

156
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,093
Most teenagers suffer from mild depression
at one time or another.

157
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,741
- Is that true?
- True enough.

158
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:42,378
But I'm pretty familiar
with clinical depression...

159
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,453
- and I don't see Claire suffering from that.
- You don't?

160
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,977
Look, she's the kind of person...

161
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,770
that needs her life to be meaningful.
I'm sure you know this better than I do.

162
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,170
No, I don't feel as though I do.

163
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:58,897
And by the way, who doesn't need their life
to be meaningful?

164
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,130
You'd be surprised.

165
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,860
She has no idea how easy she's had it!

166
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,372
Do you want to know what you can do
to be more supportive of Claire?

167
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,497
Of course. That's why I'm here, I think.

168
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,538
This is a brochure for LAC-Arts.

169
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,451
I think Claire should think about
going there.

170
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,135
It's a great school
for someone with her creativity.

171
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:28,412
- You really don't think she's depressed?
- I don't.

172
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,651
- But can I speak candidly?
- Please.

173
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,693
I think it's possible that you might be.

174
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:46,373
It's me. I'm leaving another goddamn
message on your voice mail.

175
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,937
Listen, I really need to talk.

176
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:00,453
Billy, God damn it, I need you.
I really need you.

177
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,775
God damn it, where the fuck are you?

178
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,779
Mr. Charles, hey!

179
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:24,097
It's good to see you again.

180
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:29,496
You met me when Keith brought me down
to San Diego last...

181
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,971
- It's been over a year ago.
- I know who you are.

182
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:38,454
Hey, Lucille. I'm sorry I'm so late.
I guess I missed dinner, huh?

183
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:42,492
- I left you a plate in the microwave.
- Thank you.

184
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:48,700
- Hey, you're home.
- Yeah. I'm sorry I'm so late.

185
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,413
Did you get my...

186
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,701
- Where's Taylor?
- Brushing her teeth.

187
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,260
- Did she floss first?
- Yes, I watched her.

188
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:00,538
Listen, I put fresh linens on.
Extra blankets in the hall closet.

189
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,055
Keith, your mother and I want
to have a word with you.

190
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,860
- Can't it wait until morning?
- No, I don't think it can.

191
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:10,810
- I can leave the room if you'd like.
- I don't care if you're here for this or not.

192
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:15,099
Keith, we'd like to take Taylor home with us
when we go back to San Diego.

193
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,490
- What, for a visit?
- No, to live.

194
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,455
- Why?
- This isn't any of your concern, sir.

195
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:25,092
- I'm sorry, but I think it is.
- No, David, let's hear him out.

196
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:31,052
For one, we have a yard big enough
for her to play in.

197
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,337
We'll be able to spend more time with her.

198
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:36,493
And we'll be able to offer her more stability.

199
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,615
It's what's best for the child,
and you know it.

200
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,496
Fine.

201
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:02,132
Ari, hi.

202
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:05,850
I'm sorry to just drop in like this so late,
but I was in the neighborhood.

203
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:09,934
Well, nearby, speaking to somebody
who's interested in arranging a funeral.

204
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:13,138
- His own, actually. What do you call that?
- A pre-need.

205
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,370
Right.

206
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:18,614
So I was wondering
if you would be willing to help him?

207
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,420
Yeah, sure.
Just give me his name and number.

208
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,334
- I'll call him first thing tomorrow.
- Okay.

209
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,735
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

210
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,614
Okay, that's bullshit.

211
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:35,410
I'm coming in, and you're gonna offer me
something to drink.

212
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,536
That is a lot for her to absorb.

213
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:48,177
She already knew about the AVM,
but I just told her about the baby today.

214
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,294
You said we'd never have a good marriage
without honesty.

215
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,656
- I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

216
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:02,859
Why do you think you have so much trouble
being honest with Brenda?

217
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:06,980
- I don't think it's particular to Brenda.
- With women, then.

218
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:12,651
- I don't have trouble being honest with you.
- I'm a rabbi, Nate.

219
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,973
- You don't look like a rabbi.
- I am a rabbi.

220
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:21,131
Unavailable to you,
not even in your wildest dreams.

221
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,220
That's why you don't have trouble
being honest with me.

222
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,292
There's nothing at stake.

223
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:32,020
How do you feel about becoming a father?

224
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,090
I don't know how I feel about it.

225
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,817
I certainly never imagined
it would happen like this.

226
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,055
All of our actions have consequences.

227
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:48,937
We may not even be aware of them,
but they exist nevertheless.

228
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:55,894
You should consider it a blessing.
What if you had never known?

229
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,410
Sorry.

230
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:07,616
Just give her some time, Nate.

231
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,020
Time. Right.

232
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,091
We got another one from Bay Breeze!
That's the fourth one this year.

233
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:48,493
Yes, I'm aware of how many referrals
your wife sends our way.

234
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,370
Just making sure you know
where the business is coming from.

235
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,011
- Something funny about this one, David.
- Funny how?

236
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,417
The certificate says the cause of death
was congestive heart failure.

237
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:11,732
So? Old people have their heart
quit on them all the time.

238
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:15,177
Yeah, but she's got these contusions
around her neck.

239
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:19,459
Old people bruise easily.

240
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,931
Those probably happened
while they were trying to resuscitate her.

241
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:24,420
Maybe.

242
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,933
What the fuck?

243
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,054
A hot dog?

244
00:19:55,661 --> 00:20:00,212
You tell me. I don't think something this big
just happened to go down the wrong way.

245
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:11,020
Is it okay if Parker spends the night
at our house tonight?

246
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,420
Of course.

247
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:16,052
Would you like me to pick you up
a frozen pizza and some videos?

248
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,372
No, I think we're good.

249
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,419
Are you doing something
with Nikolai tonight?

250
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,255
I think he's losing interest in me.

251
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,453
He's been spending a lot of time
alone lately.

252
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,899
He was living here
with plastic casts on both legs...

253
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,575
and peeing in a bedpan
for, what, six weeks?

254
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,538
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:44,332
Just give him some space.
Guys need a lot of space.

256
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:49,294
He doesn't know how to take care of himself
and he needs my help!

257
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,220
If you say so.

258
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:02,854
I'm a little confused
about this term "pre-need."

259
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,897
It's a payment structure that allows you to...

260
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,575
Make the purchase before you need it.
I get that.

261
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,094
I may be dying. I'm not an idiot.

262
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:11,979
My question is
with the choice of the word "need."

263
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,780
I mean, who really needs a funeral anyway?

264
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,216
If you're dead you don't need shit.

265
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:21,294
Yes, the funeral is really
for the people you leave behind...

266
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,174
to help them come to terms...

267
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,094
What if you're not leaving anybody behind?

268
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:30,813
What if your whole fucking life has been
one big waste of time for everybody...

269
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:33,734
- including yourself?
- You don't know that.

270
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:41,851
I'm all for thinning out the human race.
There are just too many fucking people.

271
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,216
Anthrax, smallpox. I say bring it on.

272
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,332
You'd probably like that, huh?
Good for business.

273
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:56,253
Maybe I should just leave this information
with you and I'll come back later.

274
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,176
Sorry if I'm being antisocial.

275
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,495
Sit down.

276
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:16,290
The good rabbi went through all the trouble
of setting this up.

277
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:18,895
Besides, I may not be here tomorrow.

278
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:25,135
- You mind if I ask...
- What I have?

279
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:30,331
- Pancreatic cancer.
- I'm sorry.

280
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,780
It's one of the worst ones you can get.

281
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,853
I did not know that.

282
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:42,412
Yeah. I should be dead already.

283
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:51,657
So this is just gravy time.
It's extra frosting on the cake.

284
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:56,773
Most people
last up to maybe six months, tops.

285
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:01,013
Me, I've been hanging in here
for over a year.

286
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,057
Can you fucking believe it?

287
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:07,497
I'll bet you never met anybody
half as lucky as I am.

288
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:12,734
And you pulled this relatively intact
out of the deceased's airway?

289
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,890
That's correct.

290
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:16,859
What made you decide to look in her throat?

291
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,771
I would have gone in there anyway
to swab her out...

292
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,852
before I started embalming her.

293
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:27,014
- But I had my suspicions.
- What made you suspicious?

294
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,696
The contusions around her neck.

295
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:33,817
These contusions could've been made
when they tried to resuscitate her.

296
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:35,493
They could have.

297
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,972
If they tried to resuscitate, why didn't they
find the frankfurter stuck in her airway?

298
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,529
It was stuck pretty far down.

299
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:47,411
Some of these nursing homes aren't exactly
up to speed on their CPR training.

300
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:50,174
She was brought over
from the Bay Breeze Nursing Home?

301
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:51,660
That's correct.

302
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:54,132
And who tried to resuscitate her?

303
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:56,655
Wait a minute. I think I got that.

304
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:00,820
Dolores Willitts and Vanessa Dial...

305
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:05,777
Diaz. Vanessa Diaz.

306
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,813
She is my wife.

307
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,814
- Where is Nikolai?
- He's out on a delivery.

308
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:25,257
Tell him I stopped by, and I come back later.

309
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:29,061
How much money does Nikolai owe you?

310
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,772
- Excuse me?
- How much money does Nikolai owe you?

311
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:35,895
- Who are you?
- I'm his friend.

312
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,576
- His lady friend?
- That's right.

313
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:45,811
It is none of your concern.

314
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:49,490
Tell me how much he owes you,
and I'll pay you the money.

315
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:55,414
- You will pay me the money?
- Tell me how much it is.

316
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:58,051
$8<i>7</i>,000.

317
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:00,135
Oh, my.

318
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,614
- I had no idea it was that much.
- You don't have that kind of money, do you?

319
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:12,297
As a matter of fact, I do.

320
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:32,289
- You would do this for Nikolai?
- Please, I'm trying to count.

321
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,492
Nikolai's a lucky man.

322
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,979
What is your name?

323
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:50,621
Ruth Fisher.

324
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:55,420
I would've taken a check, Ruth Fisher.

325
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,736
Who's this pretty little girl
who wants to join the party?

326
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,210
Isn't it way past your bedtime, honey?

327
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,333
Brenda, honey.

328
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:54,257
Mommy and Daddy have company,
and you need to go back up to bed now.

329
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:57,219
<i>Margaret, you're stigmatizing the situation</i>
<i>for her.</i>

330
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,573
<i>No, I'm not, Bern.</i>

331
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:08,497
Keith, you cannot let them take my baby.

332
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:11,659
Karla, they're only as far away as San Diego.

333
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,774
I think it's for the best.

334
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,570
There ain't no fucking way it's for the best.
Are you crazy?

335
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,651
Daddy didn't even need an excuse
to smack the shit out of me or you...

336
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:25,336
- and look what that did to us.
- Look what that did to you.

337
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:28,175
I don't want Taylor growing up
with that shit.

338
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:31,412
But you don't mind her growing up
with a mother who's a drug addict?

339
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,856
I might be a drug addict,
but I never hurt my child.

340
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:36,694
That's the way people raised their kids
back then.

341
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:40,012
I'm tired of you blaming everything
gone wrong in your life on Dad.

342
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:43,810
Please. You know how
the slightest little thing would set him off.

343
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,653
I think he's changed.

344
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:47,733
People can change.

345
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:53,695
People don't change.
They just get older, that's all.

346
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,057
- David Fisher, how the hell are you?
- Jesus!

347
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:10,899
Certainly not in any mood
to deal with the likes of you.

348
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,576
Honey, you could stand to work on
those manners. Hi, Nate.

349
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,970
I understand you boys are being sued.

350
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:19,017
So what, you've come here to gloat?

351
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:23,697
I just wanted you to know we are paying
poor Mrs. Collins' legal fees.

352
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:26,500
And, honey, we've got awfully deep pockets.

353
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,776
Y'all, this thing is gonna go on forever.

354
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:32,695
In the end it's gonna drag you boys down,
I can guarantee you that.

355
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:36,774
Now, we are still willing to buy
this little mom-and-pop shop of yours...

356
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:39,216
at a drastically reduced price, I'm afraid.

357
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,418
But I think that if you're smart,
and I'm betting you are...

358
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:45,857
you'll go on and get out
while the getting's still halfway good.

359
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,330
I'm curious, Mitzi.
What do you get out of this?

360
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,857
I like to win, honey.
It's the way I was brought up.

361
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,690
I hope you don't expect me to apologize
for it, because I'm not gonna do it.

362
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,136
I don't expect anything from you.

363
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:00,530
But I wonder, at the day's end,
when you're alone...

364
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:02,691
staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror...

365
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,056
do you really like who you see
looking back at you?

366
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,779
I love what I see.

367
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,171
See, I just don't buy that.

368
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,418
Because if you did
you wouldn't be doing this.

369
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,859
You know, it's a crying shame...

370
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:20,139
that someone as cute as you has to be
such a goddamn doom-and-gloomer.

371
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,500
You boys think it over
and let me know what you decide.

372
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,651
Personally, I think it's a no-brainer...

373
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:29,414
but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

374
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,410
- But I don't have the money.
- What do you mean?

375
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:37,095
- Of course you have the money.
- I don't. It's all gone.

376
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:39,570
- Where did it go?
- That's none of your business.

377
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:43,973
Mom, we need that money in order to offer
Mrs. Collins some kind of settlement...

378
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,858
or we're seriously screwed.

379
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:49,775
The only time you tell me what's going on
in your lives is when you need money.

380
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:53,695
If you'd told me about this before,
the money would've been there. It's gone.

381
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:56,978
- You guys, this is my friend Parker.
- Hi.

382
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:01,056
- We're just gonna be upstairs.
- Bye.

383
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,334
I give up.

384
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:21,659
That was weird. That was totally weird.
Are they always like that?

385
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,295
Always.

386
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,455
My God! Your room is so beautiful.

387
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,418
We should do something.
What do you want to do?

388
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:44,131
I don't know. What do you want to do?

389
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:46,337
What do you feel like doing?

390
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,655
- I feel like throwing up.
- Me, too.

391
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,860
- Is it normal?
- Totally.

392
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:58,255
These shrooms are fucking kick-ass.

393
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:01,651
Holy shit, you have a sewing machine?

394
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,936
Yeah, I found it in the attic.

395
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:06,491
It belonged to my dad's mom.

396
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,020
- Let's make something.
- Do you know how to use it?

397
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,774
Yeah. My God, it's so fucking cool.

398
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,533
People used to have
to make their own clothes all the time!

399
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:23,216
People used to have to make
their own soap. Can you believe that?

400
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,213
People used to have to kill their own cows
and stuff.

401
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,769
I really wish we could've been alive
back then.

402
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,055
Me, too.

403
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,378
<i>Hi, it's me. I'm not here,</i>
<i>so talk to the machine.</i>

404
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,855
Thank you for seeing me, Mrs. Collins.

405
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,819
I just want to apologize
for the unfortunate incident...

406
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:05,133
that brings us to this unpleasant juncture.

407
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:08,812
My brother is new to this business.

408
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,459
He didn't know what he was doing...

409
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,260
when he showed you
your husband's remains.

410
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:15,491
That's not my problem, is it?

411
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,539
No, of course not.

412
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:23,219
You were vulnerable
when you asked him to do this...

413
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,219
and he shouldn't have.
But, nevertheless, you did ask him.

414
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:27,939
What's your point?

415
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,492
- What's my point?
- Yeah.

416
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:32,818
Do you even have one?

417
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:39,331
You know it's not my fault or my brother's...

418
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:42,618
that you allowed your husband
to smack you around all those years.

419
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:45,693
- That's your problem.
- You've no right to talk about my marriage.

420
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:48,420
You chose to be a doormat,
or a punching bag...

421
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,334
or whatever metaphor for victimhood
you're comfortable with.

422
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:53,537
You stayed in an abusive marriage...

423
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,010
and wasted God knows how many years
of your life.

424
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:59,571
Years you'll never get back.
And that makes you furious, doesn't it?

425
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,936
You've probably spent
your entire miserable life...

426
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,615
blaming other people
for all the mistakes you've made.

427
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,453
Now you want us to pay for that?

428
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,533
Jesus, lady, just how fucking low
are you willing to sink?

429
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,650
This lawsuit of yours
is gonna cost my family our business!

430
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,333
That's my point!

431
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:22,490
There. Are you happy?

432
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,100
Now get out.

433
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:28,336
Get the fuck out of my house!

434
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:57,058
Can you spare a joint?

435
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,133
I love halter-tops.

436
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,773
Are you looking at my tits?

437
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,580
I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.

438
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:39,097
Are you looking at my tits?

439
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:44,213
My God, I wish I could've lived
during the Renaissance.

440
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,576
Those are so fucking beautiful.

441
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,653
I love those pants.

442
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,940
So when you walk it makes music, right?

443
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,131
See, if we live our lives the right way...

444
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:58,338
then every single thing we do
becomes a work of art...

445
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,651
even the pants we wear...

446
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:04,335
- or just the way we make our bed.
- Wow.

447
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,174
That's the whole fucking problem
with the world right now.

448
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:10,458
It's that we don't try to be creative
with every single thing we do.

449
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,179
Martha Stewart does.

450
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:19,579
I thought you might be getting hungry,
so I made you girls some sandwiches.

451
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,458
We are so not hungry.

452
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,538
We'll eat them later.

453
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:28,013
All right, then.

454
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:31,815
I'll come back later to get the tray.

455
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,292
- Mom?
- Yes, dear.

456
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:37,701
Here, I made these pants for you.

457
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:41,013
Thank you, Claire.

458
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,619
These are lovely.

459
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,013
I love you, Mom.

460
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:53,292
I never tell you how much,
because I'm afraid to for some reason...

461
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:57,818
but right now I want you to know I love you.
I think you're so beautiful.

462
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:00,413
I love you, too.

463
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:36,212
You don't know my dad, David.

464
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:39,816
He's like a pit bull when he gets his jaw
locked on something. Believe me.

465
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:43,052
What happened to the Keith who fights
for something he believes in?

466
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:46,770
- For something we both believe in?
- This isn't that simple.

467
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:50,650
Are you taking his side 'cause looking
after Taylor is too big a commitment?

468
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,575
No, I'm taking his side because,
for once, I think he's right.

469
00:36:58,101 --> 00:36:59,614
You know what I think?

470
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:03,535
I think you're not sure that two gay men
should raise a child.

471
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:12,691
- That's your shit.
- Then why aren't we fighting for her?

472
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:14,817
Because they have more time
to spend with her.

473
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:18,132
Please. Your father plays golf all day
and your mom plays with her...

474
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:21,577
for half-an-hour, tops,
then pops in a video and gets on the phone.

475
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,016
I am not ambivalent about wanting kids.

476
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:26,535
Then you're ambivalent
about wanting kids with me?

477
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,816
Of course not. I just want to be ready.

478
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:31,813
Life doesn't work that way.
It just dumps things in your lap...

479
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:34,131
and then you try to make the best of it.

480
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,530
I'm tired of talking about this.

481
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:43,973
You know what this is really about?
You're afraid of him.

482
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,289
Fuck you.

483
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,336
As much as I hate you treating me
like a doormat...

484
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:52,493
it's even worse seeing your father
treat you like one.

485
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:55,698
- You think I treat you like a doormat?
- Sometimes.

486
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:57,976
Why don't you stand up to him?

487
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,619
I don't think I treat you like a doormat.

488
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,819
Sometimes you do.

489
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,580
Go to sleep.

490
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:17,336
We both have to get up early.

491
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:32,851
Okay, you guys need to go now.

492
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,414
Okay, then.

493
00:38:45,141 --> 00:38:47,052
Can I have your number?

494
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,893
Why? So we can date?

495
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:54,896
Late.

496
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:22,532
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

497
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:26,732
How did it go with the police?

498
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:29,858
How do you think it went?
They kept us there all night.

499
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:32,739
They didn't even talk to us
until about an hour ago.

500
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,573
At least they didn't arrest you.

501
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:37,858
Do you think I could shove a hot dog
down some old lady's throat?

502
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:41,013
No, of course not.

503
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,855
But you could have noticed it was there.

504
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,056
You know who they think did it?

505
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,416
The roommate, Ramona Kippleman.

506
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:56,780
But that old bitch is smart.
She's not saying anything to them.

507
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:59,336
- So that's that?
- Yeah.

508
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:02,333
Except now, thanks to you, I'm out of a job.

509
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,015
- What?
- They fired Dolores and me for negligence.

510
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,410
They had to hang it on somebody.

511
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,572
What was I supposed to do?

512
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,016
Hide a murder
so you could keep some shitty job?

513
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:15,978
Of course not, Rico...

514
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:19,417
but now I have to go out
and find another shitty job.

515
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,851
You got Julio off to school?

516
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:31,380
- Yeah.
- And where's Augusto?

517
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:34,933
He's taking a nap.

518
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:43,217
I'm gonna try and get some sleep
before he wakes up.

519
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,777
Where's your friend Parker?

520
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,810
My God, those are so hideous.

521
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:04,096
They're not hideous in the least.

522
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,979
I like them. And do you want to know why?

523
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:10,929
Because my daughter,
whom I love very much, made them for me.

524
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,939
Look, that wasn't me. It was somebody else.

525
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:17,418
I may just wear these pants
until the day I die.

526
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,980
Please don't.

527
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:23,609
God. What made me ever think
I could be an artist?

528
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:25,898
Here, this is for you.

529
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,177
I don't know why I bother.

530
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:32,135
I think you have real talent, Claire.

531
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:37,853
But go ahead and throw it away,
if that's what you're set on doing.

532
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:57,532
Taylor, would you go to your room?
I need to speak to your grandparents.

533
00:41:58,381 --> 00:41:59,734
Yeah, sure.

534
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:08,499
David and I talked it over and decided
Taylor will stay with us for now.

535
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:11,095
At least until the school year's up.

536
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:13,253
The hell you say.

537
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:15,616
- Keith...
- Stay out of this, Mom.

538
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,972
That child is coming home...

539
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:22,820
with me and your mother.

540
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,209
Taylor's staying with me and David,
and that's final.

541
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:27,734
- You...
- Do it.

542
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,854
I dare you.

543
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,737
I was handling situation...

544
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,573
you stupid woman.

545
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:02,895
- You have no right to talk to me this way.
- You have no right!

546
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:06,412
Christ Almighty...

547
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,091
What's going on?

548
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:16,617
Nikolai owed someone some money,
and I paid them back.

549
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:21,011
- What?
- You can't try to fix others' problems...

550
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,296
without them asking, cupcake.

551
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,654
You're too co-ey. That's your problem.

552
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:28,538
- "Co-ey?"
- Codependent.

553
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,054
I know what it means.

554
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,371
And you know something, Robbie?
I hate that word.

555
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,611
That word is totally inappropriate here.

556
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:38,774
I am a mother. I have a family.
Family members depend on one another.

557
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:42,820
You can't be intimate with someone
and not be dependant on them.

558
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:46,616
I wasn't aware Nikolai was a member
of your family.

559
00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:56,491
I feel so bad about treating my mother
like shit all the time.

560
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:59,899
What makes you think
you treat her like shit?

561
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:04,738
I made her these pants,
harlequin pants with bells on them.

562
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:07,016
My God, they're so queer.

563
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,576
And she's actually wearing them.

564
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:16,011
She means well.
She's just so clueless and...

565
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:18,977
I don't know, embarrassing.

566
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,980
Everyone's embarrassed by their parents.

567
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,576
Where's the picture of you
and what's-her-name?

568
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,820
We broke up.

569
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,138
You guys looked so happy.

570
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:39,577
I mean, in the photo
she always looked really happy.

571
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,217
I just assumed you were...

572
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,411
- in it for keeps.
- Well, we weren't.

573
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:54,853
What time is it?

574
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,738
We still have about 10 minutes.

575
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,291
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

576
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,090
No.

577
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:05,936
Is there something you want me
to talk about?

578
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:08,330
No, not really.

579
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:13,659
I've got some Psych homework
I could be doing.

580
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:18,614
So, see you.

581
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,174
Would you like me to make you
something to eat?

582
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:43,614
No, thanks.

583
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:49,452
Have you made any definite plans
for the wedding?

584
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:53,090
To be honest, there might not be a wedding.

585
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:54,773
Really and truly?

586
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,774
- Really and truly.
- What did she do?

587
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:04,458
It's not something Brenda did.
It's something I did.

588
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,975
Maybe it's for the best.

589
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,009
Or maybe it's not for the best.
Maybe it just is.

590
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,569
And now I just have to live with it.

591
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,578
Are you sure you wouldn't like me
to make you something to eat?

592
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,017
A grilled cheese sandwich?

593
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:56,415
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,173
I tried calling you.

595
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,251
People make mistakes, Nate.

596
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:20,297
They don't always know
why they do the things they do.

597
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:24,820
You don't love this Lisa chick, do you?

598
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:26,932
- No.
- Good.

599
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:32,777
Because I still love you.

600
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,738
And I can't lose you.

601
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,060
I can't.

602
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:45,939
I need you, Nate.

603
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,657
As fucked up as you are...

604
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:58,575
you are the sanest thing in my life.

605
00:47:59,101 --> 00:48:02,093
- Let's work this out together, okay?
- Okay.

606
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,980
I love you.

607
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:22,978
English
