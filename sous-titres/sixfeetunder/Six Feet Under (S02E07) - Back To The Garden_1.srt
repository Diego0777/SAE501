1
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,992
<i>... following Wall Street's sharp rebound...</i>

2
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:20,470
<i>and boosted by a renewed hope</i>
<i>in a government plan...</i>

3
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,280
<i>to lift the banking sector</i>
<i>out of its doldrums.</i>

4
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,359
<i>In currency trade...</i>

5
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,719
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

6
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,156
<i>Me and my buddy,</i>
<i>we just moved in next door.</i>

7
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,596
<i>We were wondering who lives here.</i>

8
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>I was just about to get in the shower.</i>

9
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,995
<i>Come on in, I'll be out in a moment.</i>

10
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,030
<i>Nice.</i>

11
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,239
<i>- She's hot.</i>
<i>- Yeah, you're telling me.</i>

12
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:54,079
<i>I thought I told you guys</i>
<i>to wait in the other room.</i>

13
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,435
<i>We thought you might</i>
<i>need some help getting clean.</i>

14
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,032
<i>This is so cool.</i>

15
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,512
<i>- Yeah, you like this, don't you?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

16
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,918
<i>Let's move over here.</i>

17
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,994
<i>You're a nasty girl, aren't you?</i>

18
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,352
<i>You guys are the best neighbors I ever had.</i>

19
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,948
David.

20
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,197
You're all wet.

21
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,838
Were you crying?

22
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,598
No, it was raining.

23
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,116
And, yes, I was crying.

24
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,678
I love you.

25
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,115
<i>We get just about all the minerals</i>
<i>and vitamins that bones need...</i>

26
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,917
<i>from things like sunshine.</i>

27
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,231
Didn't I ask you to clean up after yourself?

28
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,837
Why did you ask for an omelet
if you weren't hungry?

29
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,513
I was, but now my tummy hurts.

30
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,991
Again? Girl, you better eat some breakfast.

31
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,392
Maybe I'm full.

32
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,830
Eat half of it and you can watch MTV...

33
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,433
or don't eat and go to school hungry,
it's your choice.

34
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,396
That's good, bribe her.

35
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,430
Did I ask for your input?

36
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,550
- I gotta go.
- Go.

37
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,915
Your car is blocking me in.

38
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,594
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,434
What's wrong with me?
I'm taking care of Taylor...

40
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,670
I don't know where her mother is,
I haven't slept in two months...

41
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,398
since I shot and killed that man.
I'm sick of your shit.

42
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,913
I'm sick and tired of you
taking it all out on me.

43
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,308
This is way more than I signed on for.

44
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:34,075
I've got an idea. Find what's yours,
and take it when you leave.

45
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,593
Then I'll never have to
look at your ass again.

46
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,318
I have a better idea. I'll go right now.

47
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,472
If you find any of my stuff,
you can shove it up your tight white ass.

48
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:48,474
Who the hell you think you're talking to?
I know you didn't call my ass white.

49
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,793
My tummy hurts.

50
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,235
The answer is no, I'm sorry.

51
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,592
It's not like it's some stranger.
It's your sister.

52
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:13,348
It's not like it's Kabul. It's Topanga,
it's not even an hour from here.

53
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,794
You heard what was done to Nate.

54
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,313
I don't think anything was done to him.

55
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,072
In case you haven't hung out
with any 15-year-old guys...

56
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,911
they're like total hornswogglers.

57
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,388
It was a much more innocent time.

58
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,878
What, the '80s?

59
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,995
Your brother
was a much more innocent boy...

60
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,070
to say nothing of what happened to David.

61
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,514
He hiked three miles
down the canyon in pitch dark...

62
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,078
to get away from those people.

63
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,151
He cut his ear on a bramble.
The answer is no.

64
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,952
Have you thought at all about scaffolding?

65
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,155
When your house is falling apart,
you build scaffolding...

66
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,434
to support you
while you are doing the work.

67
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,477
And I think a great way
to build scaffolding...

68
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,108
is to revisit old experiences
but try them a new way.

69
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,751
So I'm going out there after school today...

70
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,911
and spend the weekend
and be back on Sunday.

71
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,836
<i>I haven't even told Justin yet.</i>

72
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,673
He doesn't know his father's dead.

73
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,515
Jewish tradition says
we have to bury him tomorrow.

74
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,431
You have had Jewish funerals
here before, right?

75
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,834
Of course.

76
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,310
We decided not to do this in our temple
because of the way Jeffrey died.

77
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,233
Jess, if you want,
I can do this with Jeffrey's mother.

78
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,276
Fuck it, I can do it.

79
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,950
What do you need to know?

80
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,673
He killed himself for no reason...

81
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,557
while I was at goddamn Gymboree
with Tess.

82
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,632
Tess is four.

83
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,191
While I was with her, my husband,
Jeffrey Shapiro...

84
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,512
who worked for the third best law firm
in LA...

85
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,716
and was three months away
from making partner...

86
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,671
He came home...

87
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,993
on his lunch break and he hung himself...

88
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,311
with his pants around his ankles
in our goddamn sunroom.

89
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,428
There's your fucking eulogy.
Can you say that in Hebrew?

90
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,917
So you'll be conducting the service, Rabbi?

91
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:37,150
I love my new place.
You have to come see it.

92
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,598
It's a condo, but it's like a hotel, too.

93
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,068
It's got a concierge and a bidet.

94
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,913
Get me one of those jumbo beers
on the side as well.

95
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,388
- I'll share it with her.
- Get your own.

96
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,151
Make it two, thanks.

97
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,269
To living alone, finally.

98
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,474
To bidets.

99
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,517
And to starting over, with us, sweetheart.

100
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,357
I think I was under much more
emotional pressure than I ever realized.

101
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,949
And I'm actually so sorry
for those awful things I said to you.

102
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,358
Thank you.

103
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,710
Aren't you sorry for hitting me?

104
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,790
Yes, that was insane of me, but...

105
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,268
No buts, Brenda. Just be sorry.

106
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,353
I know it was probably my fault,
but I don't want to know why.

107
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,551
So, now the headline.

108
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,435
That whore has moved in with your father.

109
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,747
Dad's seeing a whore?

110
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,194
The Whore of Tranquility Spa, Brenda.

111
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,952
Has your father said anything
to you about her?

112
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,314
What's in it for her, money?

113
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,914
I know she's not in it for sex.

114
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,797
Your father's not what he used to be
after years of Paxil...

115
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,949
Okay, that'll be fine, Mom.

116
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,114
All right, then. Let's talk about you.

117
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,873
You sure you want to lose
the focus just yet?

118
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,553
Come on now, what's up in your world?

119
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,670
Nate and I are getting married.

120
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:19,588
Is he smart enough for you?
Does he have what it takes, up here?

121
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,753
Like you? Like me?

122
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,915
No, Mom, he's not like us.

123
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:29,828
He doesn't think so hard he wants
to put a staple gun to his forehead.

124
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,274
I get it. He's uncomplicated.

125
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,678
I've been with a man or three like that.

126
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,196
But Bern always had me because I knew
he was much smarter than I am.

127
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,349
That's why it's still so hot with us,
all these years later.

128
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,032
And we're back.

129
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,910
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,069
So, how did he propose?

131
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,273
I asked him.

132
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,832
You didn't.

133
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,511
Yeah, I know, it's really funny.

134
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:08,036
It's almost as funny as the notion of you
trying to build a life on your own.

135
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,791
I don't see how he could kill himself
when he's got three kids.

136
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,837
- I don't think he meant to.
- He hung himself.

137
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,111
I talked to the Quincy down at the morgue...

138
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:28,432
and he says that the cops said
there was a porno playing in the VCR.

139
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,034
- And they found a bottle of Astroglide.
- What's Astroglide?

140
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,787
It's lube. Lubrication. For sex.

141
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,389
- Thank you, David.
- No problemo.

142
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,114
Wait a minute, I know about this.
He was doing autoerotic asphyxiation...

143
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,315
- like the guy in that band?
- You got it.

144
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,674
See, you cut off the air supply...

145
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,557
and that heightens the stimulation
in the ensuing orgasm.

146
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,188
Here's the giveaway:
They found a lemon wedge on the floor.

147
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,274
You keep the lemon in your mouth...

148
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,634
and at the moment of climax...

149
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,995
you bite down on it to wake you up,
so you don't die.

150
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,916
See, the lemon was lying
on the floor, untouched.

151
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:20,431
I'm calling to let you know
that Eddie and I broke up.

152
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,195
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

153
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,997
I broke it off with him.

154
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,112
All right, then.

155
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,071
Thank you for telling me,
I'm going to go now.

156
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,832
So, there's this part in my book...

157
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,389
where the main character
meets a high-class hooker.

158
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,595
Is this fiction, or nonfiction?

159
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,988
It's still kind of working itself out.

160
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,798
There's definitely someone based on you.

161
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,633
- Part of her is you.
- Excellent.

162
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,875
As long as she doesn't get raped
and murdered to pay for her sins.

163
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,268
I'm so sick of that tired old story.

164
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,714
She's way beyond conventional morality.

165
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,670
I can't wait to read it.

166
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,479
I jerked off a client the other day.

167
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,471
- I didn't know you did release.
- No, I don't.

168
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,470
He didn't ask me to.

169
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,473
So, I'm sure you can imagine
sometimes the guy gets a hard-on.

170
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,637
Normally I just ignore it.

171
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,028
So what, was this guy
just exceptionally hot?

172
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,757
No, not even.

173
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,234
So I'm giving the guy a massage...

174
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,356
he flips over, there's this hard-on.

175
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,154
It was kind of huge, but you'd never guess
by looking at the guy.

176
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,515
I could tell that he wanted me to touch it.

177
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,277
I thought, well, I would be crossing a line.

178
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,072
And then I did.

179
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,756
I crossed a line.

180
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,791
You are hilarious.

181
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,592
I mean, what is that?
Am I trying to be you or something?

182
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,193
I don't know. How'd you feel afterwards?

183
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,310
I was weirdly kind of inspired.
I wrote this really cool chapter about it.

184
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,033
- As long as it's all for your art.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,277
Aunt Sarah, hi!

186
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,109
Baby, is everything okay?

187
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,148
I thought we said
a "probably-maybe" about next weekend.

188
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,269
But this weekend is fine, it's just fine.

189
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,869
I thought it was this weekend.

190
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,798
I'm totally cool to go home
and come back whenever.

191
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,074
You're here, and you're mine.

192
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,749
I have to believe the universe sent you.

193
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,069
It's our annual <i>Howl</i> weekend.

194
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,514
- Allen Ginsburg <i>Howl?</i>
- Yes.

195
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,239
So you're down. Wonderful.

196
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,075
He was a dear friend.

197
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,714
We once shared a flat in Berlin...

198
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,075
until I got fed up with
the parade of Aryan starfucker boys.

199
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,633
I'm going to summon
his energy this weekend.

200
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:58,352
I'm expecting some visitors.
A wonderful poet named Basil...

201
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,514
and the painter Fiona Kleinschmidt,
have you heard of her?

202
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,111
A couple of freaks and some nasty hippies
from my druggie days.

203
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,917
It's going to be a riot.

204
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,955
Sure you don't want me to come back later?

205
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,678
Wouldn't hear of it.
I'll show you to your sleeping nook.

206
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,351
I love that bag.

207
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,274
- Why did you do that to me?
<i>- Do what?</i>

208
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,554
That. Just calling me and telling me that.

209
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,751
Hold on a second.

210
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,671
Mom, I'm on the phone.

211
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,319
Are you going to have supper?
I'm making pork chops.

212
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,197
No, Mom, I won't be having dinner with you.

213
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,197
Sorry. What do you want?

214
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,753
You called me.

215
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:43,472
I was calling to find out why you called me
to tell me you guys broke up.

216
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,868
You're my friend.

217
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,348
I thought you'd want to know
what happens in my life.

218
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:50,988
A month ago you didn't think
we should see each other anymore.

219
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,712
Things change.

220
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,996
Just what exactly is your agenda?

221
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,673
- I don't have an agenda, okay?
- Yeah, right.

222
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,390
- Wonderful.
<i>- Great.</i>

223
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,191
Thank you for sharing.

224
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,195
Shut up, just keep it shut.

225
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,552
I was just eating.

226
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,155
I spent most of the '90s thinking
that stripping was goddess work...

227
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:26,596
but I've come around to my original position
which is that it's just plain cheap.

228
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,396
I've always been astonished
at some of that pole work.

229
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,552
I once saw this woman, she could
hang upside down from 20 feet in the air.

230
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,434
She looked like an inverted Jesus.

231
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,911
It's the PVC boots.
They make your legs stick to the metal.

232
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,193
No way.

233
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,873
I would totally take my clothes off
on stage...

234
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,554
at least once, if I didn't harbor
a vague feeling of hatred about my body.

235
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,107
You're crazy, you have a beautiful body.

236
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,598
Thank you.

237
00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:00,118
That's Nate.
Listen, the whole prostitute thing...

238
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,394
- he wouldn't be into it.
- Whatever.

239
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,352
- Hey.
- Hi.

240
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,468
Oh, God.

241
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,471
Where'd you get the hummus?

242
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,868
Sorry, incredibly rude and hungry.

243
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,552
This is Nate, my fiancé.

244
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,911
This is my friend, Melissa.

245
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,909
Cool. Where'd you guys meet?

246
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,989
Melissa's a client of mine.

247
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,232
So does Brenda
have all your auras aligned?

248
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,198
Chakras. Did you note the tone of mocking?

249
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,996
Have you guys ever heard
of autoerotic asphyxiation?

250
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,991
Cutting off your air supply
so you can come harder? Sure.

251
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,197
There's a name for it in
the fetish community. It's called breath play.

252
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,238
I read a thing.

253
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,116
We have this guy who died of it...

254
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,918
and it's weird
because it's definitely suicide...

255
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,309
but is it accidental suicide
or just plain old suicide?

256
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,387
He was indulging in something
he knew could kill him...

257
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,438
but even if it's accidental
it's still sort of on purpose, right?

258
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,350
What do you mean, "this guy we have"?

259
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,158
- Nate's an undertaker.
- Funeral director.

260
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,718
Did you note the tone of mocking in that?

261
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,675
Don't tell me you're a couple
that likes to bicker in front of others...

262
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,354
until it gets uncomfortable
and I have to leave and you guys fuck?

263
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,548
No.

264
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,398
No, not us.

265
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,348
Okay, you want to know my agenda?

266
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,552
My agenda is to
take you to dinner tomorrow night.

267
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,798
You there?

268
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,874
If I say yes, what am I agreeing to?

269
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:00,834
You and me having dinner,
maybe a little conversation, that's all.

270
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,548
Dinner?

271
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,877
We could make a plan,
but it seems a little soon after...

272
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,109
Would you just shut up and say yes?

273
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:17,508
Yes, I would like to have dinner
with you tomorrow night.

274
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,087
- How you doing, baby?
- Good.

275
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,575
How are you?

276
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:46,045
Be careful, Snoopy has an ear infection.

277
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,532
I brought tomatoes from my garden.

278
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:53,326
But I'm making the sauce, right?
Do you have fresh pasta or do I make some?

279
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:56,125
The Napa contingent can't make it.

280
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:59,367
Fernando's doing community service, again.

281
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,369
Who are you?

282
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,655
This is Claire, Ruth's daughter.

283
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,532
I didn't know Ruth had a daughter.

284
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:13,733
If I remember correctly,
you certainly knew she had a son.

285
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:22,215
- How is Ruth?
- How is Nathaniel?

286
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:28,210
My mom's great.
My dad is not so great. He's dead.

287
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,485
Shame. Hell of a guy, your dad.

288
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:36,324
So funny, fucking wicked.

289
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:40,889
I can still see him sitting here
at this counter...

290
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:44,935
hunched over his little rolling machine.
He used a rolling machine.

291
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:55,491
I'm gonna have my cell phone on,
in case you need to call me or anything.

292
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,134
Okay, have a good one.

293
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,731
- You want another cup of coffee?
- Lf you make it, I'll drink it.

294
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,535
Be really careful
when you're taking down this plastic...

295
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,334
'cause of Julio's allergies.

296
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,374
- There's tons of dust all through here.
- Okay, I got it.

297
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:10,014
We know, honey.

298
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,846
I'm going to make some breakfast. Hungry?

299
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,574
That sounds good.

300
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,252
I moved your circular saw to the porch.

301
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,691
I know, man, I got it. It's cool.

302
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,685
Honey...

303
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,205
listen, if it gets too loud in here...

304
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:31,969
you can take the kids to the park.
You don't have to stay.

305
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,411
Okay, baby, I got it. Have a good day.

306
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:35,525
Okay.

307
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,047
Julio, turn that TV down.

308
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:55,488
There's a spray cleaner
that's much more earth friendly.

309
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,089
Maybe I'll order it.

310
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:59,212
Oh, god damn it!

311
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,852
Or we can keep using this.

312
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:04,086
I don't talking to you!

313
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:05,929
Are you mad at us?

314
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,052
Why the grumps, Mr. Cranky Pants?

315
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,769
Someone's in a real snoot.

316
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:15,087
- I don't think he's feeling well.
- I feeling fine.

317
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,885
I can't come to your house
for dinner tonight. I have other obligation.

318
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:23,732
We planned this three days ago.
I bought aubergines.

319
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,454
I can't. Stop with all the question, okay?

320
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:32,769
I'm not asking you questions.
I haven't asked you any questions.

321
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:34,495
So, tell...

322
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:37,248
what do you do with aubergines?

323
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,247
It's a Greek thing, it's like a...

324
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:51,248
It's like a lasagna.

325
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:03,013
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

326
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,889
Nothing would please me more, muffin.

327
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,768
Star sighting. I think I just saw
that Jewish "Friend" in there.

328
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,926
- What, Jennifer Aniston?
- The guy.

329
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,530
- Ross.
- Right. I'll be back in a couple hours.

330
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,005
- Hey, did you forget to shave?
- I was running late.

331
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,131
Really?

332
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:30,649
I'll thank you not to discuss
my facial hair any further.

333
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,806
Come here, let me check it out. Come on.

334
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:38,928
- What time's your date?
- Who said I have a date?

335
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,254
Tonight. Dinner.

336
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,654
It's a little soon.

337
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,615
The whole Oops-l-didn't-know-l-was-sexy
stubble look...

338
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:50,164
will peak at around noon tomorrow.

339
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,724
Believe me, I've perfected the art.

340
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:56,489
Can you make it drinks after dinner?
You'll have more time.

341
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:59,852
- I can't discuss this now. I'm going out.
- Clothes shopping?

342
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,893
- No.
- Stay out of Structure.

343
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:10,092
Augusto's got a little cold...

344
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,809
so I'm gonna head home
and give Vanessa a little break.

345
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,534
Okay, that's cool.

346
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:18,287
I'll be right here, then.

347
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,408
You may be seated.

348
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:33,645
We are here today to mourn the loss
of Jeffrey Marc Shapiro.

349
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,572
Talmud says, "Better is one day in this life...

350
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,374
"than all eternity in the world to come."

351
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,050
"And if they ask, you answer

352
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:51,172
"Damn the high-walled guard towers
of right and left

353
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,686
"Coast to coast, now, here upon a time

354
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:00,176
"where leaf shines, shimmers

355
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:02,887
"tokes to toasts

356
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:07,371
"Fear forever, nevermore"

357
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:12,415
And there you have it,
the crap of the moment!

358
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,255
It's not crap.

359
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:16,289
Look what just arrived.

360
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:17,525
Hi, Jill!

361
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:21,894
Hey, magic mushrooms, special delivery.

362
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,455
Throw them in the sauce.

363
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:27,290
No, no, sauté them first.
You guys, sauté them first!

364
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:31,455
Hey, do you have any of that THC butter
in the freezer from last year?

365
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:03,325
Hey!

366
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,405
Fuck!

367
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:11,895
What the fuck?

368
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,608
What the fuck is going on in here?

369
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:16,687
Just get out of here, man. Give me a sec.

370
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:18,095
Get out of here?

371
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:21,373
This is my fucking house,
you fucking homo!

372
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,651
It's nothing. Just chill, Rico. Damn!

373
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:28,093
Are you out of your fucking mind?
My kids could have seen that! Vanessa!

374
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,014
She took the kids to the park.

375
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,884
Are you fucking crazy?
Are you out of your fucking homo mind?

376
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:38,288
Get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck is wrong with you, Ramon?

377
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,332
Do you have anything to fucking say?

378
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:44,489
No, I'm just going to get out of here
until you calm the hell down, okay?

379
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,645
Damn!

380
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:48,815
What the fuck?

381
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,813
What the fucking fuck?

382
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:58,326
- Rabbi?
- You can call me Ari.

383
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:01,529
I need to ask you a few questions.

384
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:06,090
As a funeral director, I want to ask
about death from a Jewish point of view.

385
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:10,374
Sure. But I warn you, Jews tend
to answer questions with more questions.

386
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:13,050
- I'll give you my card.
- I mean now.

387
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,251
We're going straight to the cemetery.

388
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,687
You could drive with me.

389
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,849
I'm coming.

390
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:37,326
- Mother.
- Baby.

391
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:43,653
I got this for you. It doesn't need
watering or caring about in any way.

392
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:49,966
So, Brenda, I had this vision
of your wedding at the Hollyhock House.

393
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:53,972
They're wonderful
as long as you bring in your own caterer.

394
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:56,889
Loulou Smigel's daughter
had her wedding there.

395
00:31:56,976 --> 00:32:00,730
Well, actually, I was thinking of somewhere
more beautiful and natural.

396
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:03,249
Oh, God!

397
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:05,845
What?

398
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:10,692
You know, your father and I got married
on the beach...

399
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,930
and we ran in the surf afterwards.

400
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,806
Yeah, I know.
You were barefoot, he wore clogs.

401
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:27,135
I think you're going to have to leave.

402
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,606
I've just got so much coming up right now...

403
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,967
and I need to go in my room
and sob for an hour.

404
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:42,571
Look, I could stay.
I'll massage your shoulders.

405
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:45,768
No, that...

406
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,814
It doesn't help me right now
that you're here.

407
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,855
Sure I can't make you
a cup of tea or something?

408
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,973
I'm sure. And, Brenda...

409
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,774
please don't tell your father
that you saw me cry.

410
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:05,052
Mom, come on, let me help.

411
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:09,015
I'm not Billy.
If you want to help me, just leave.

412
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,370
Okay.

413
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:35,965
Every time I get a headache,
I'm thinking this could be it.

414
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:39,407
You must be really scared.

415
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,373
Yeah, I'm going to die.

416
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,289
Yeah, me, too.

417
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:46,730
- Really, what do you have?
- A body.

418
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:58,094
Okay. Yeah, we're all going to die...

419
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:03,566
and maybe I'm going to die
before everyone else, maybe not.

420
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:09,765
So what's the Jewish answer
to what I'm supposed to do now?

421
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:14,284
I don't know what the Jewish answer is.
I know what I try to do.

422
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:17,254
I try to live my life...

423
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:20,330
every day in a way that honors God.

424
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,964
I don't even know if I believe in God.

425
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:30,572
Maybe it's time to find Him.

426
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,244
- Maybe God's a woman.
- Maybe.

427
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:39,248
There he is now.

428
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,495
Jeffrey Shapiro.

429
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:50,412
I'll wait here by the car.

430
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,051
Come and watch him be buried.

431
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:57,895
Jeffrey can't repay you,
so it's considered a great mitzvah.

432
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,089
Kindness, love, for its own sake.

433
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:06,052
Some people call that God.

434
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:14,892
What I'm saying is, yes, definitely,
forgive your mother and father.

435
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:18,446
I mean, we've all heard that before,
but what's become clear...

436
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:23,132
is that my family of origin
never really lived in a house.

437
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:26,731
They lived in this tent city, psychologically.

438
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:31,766
It's no wonder that my own house never felt
remotely like it was built on solid ground...

439
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:34,086
<i>Shut up. Shut the mouth.</i>

440
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:38,567
It was built on this quicksand
of emotional incest...

441
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:40,806
- if there is such a thing...
<i>- Shutting it now.</i>

442
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:43,615
<i>Shutting it and stopping it.</i>

443
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:47,132
But The Plan would call that
"old blueprinting"...

444
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:50,606
<i>If you say another word,</i>
<i>I will stab you in the heart with a fork.</i>

445
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:52,015
...that's about the size of it.

446
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:55,805
<i>If there is a God in heaven,</i>
<i>He will surely shut your mouth.</i>

447
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:58,012
You never stop renovating.

448
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:02,049
Robbie, I have to tell you something now.

449
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:06,449
I do believe I've learned everything
I needed to learn from The Plan...

450
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:10,810
and I no longer feel the urge
to speak in building metaphors...

451
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:14,527
or talk about myself or my feelings
in this way...

452
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:17,169
any longer.

453
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:59,248
I don't know what kind of power trip
you're on, but it seems cruel, to be honest.

454
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,770
Oh, God, Keith, you poor thing.

455
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:11,534
- You mind checking on her one more time?
- Sure.

456
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,210
- Hi.
- Hey.

457
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:18,096
- How is she?
- She's in surgery right now.

458
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:22,135
I guess her appendix was huge,
but they got it before it burst...

459
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:26,573
and she's going to be fine. I'm just waiting.
It's been an hour and a half.

460
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:31,609
She kept telling me
her stomach was hurting...

461
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:34,130
and I thought it was some kind of game.

462
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:38,606
You can't be perfect all the time, Keith.

463
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:41,768
That's what life's about:
Striving for perfection.

464
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:45,528
And when that fails,
accepting ourselves for being imperfect.

465
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:47,129
Not in my book.

466
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:55,129
- God, you are so self-righteous sometimes.
- Yeah, and you are a doormat.

467
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,015
Do I really come off as being a doormat?

468
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,415
- How is she?
- Great.

469
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,135
It went very smoothly. She's in recovery.

470
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,847
Good. When can I see her?

471
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,528
You can wait for her in her room.

472
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:16,688
When she comes out of her anesthesia,
she might be a little weepy.

473
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:18,494
Don't let it concern you.

474
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,245
Thank you.

475
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,528
- Oh, God, don't let her come over here.
- No, it's too late.

476
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:56,767
Beat these gourds!

477
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,888
No spectators!

478
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,770
Oh, my God, is there a lock on this thing?

479
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,206
They use this place as a meditation hut...

480
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:41,005
but it's been my safe-house
more times than I care to remember.

481
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,008
What fucking freaks.

482
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,849
Yeah, at least two of them
aren't your parents.

483
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:53,254
I'm their designated driver... every year.

484
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:55,330
Sorry.

485
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:58,451
It's better than getting a call
from the sheriff...

486
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,528
saying your parents are laying in the bottom
of Topanga Canyon...

487
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,084
and would I like a ride in a helicopter.

488
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,967
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Why not?

489
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,372
Because, you know, like...

490
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:28,008
people are having, like,
end-of-the-world sex...

491
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:32,413
and just, I didn't bring condoms...

492
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,853
Like I would even anyway.

493
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,455
Yeah, right.

494
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:39,245
No.

495
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:44,085
No. I mean, you're quite the fox,
I'm happy to report...

496
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:47,725
but, like, I would never just
hook up with somebody I just met.

497
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:50,135
Like, ever.

498
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,895
Seriously?

499
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:54,175
Seriously.

500
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,894
I get it. You're just trying
to let me get my guard down...

501
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:02,171
and then, all of a sudden, we're hooking up.

502
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:03,405
Wrong.

503
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:08,494
I'm 19, okay, Claire?
I've had the major life experience to know...

504
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:14,286
it kind of sucks to enter the body of another
human being you're not in love with.

505
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,855
Okay, what are you, like, straight-edge,
or all Jesusy or just gay?

506
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,365
None of those things, okay? Forget it.

507
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:28,211
Just lay down here with me.

508
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:31,371
We won't have sex.
That's all you have to know.

509
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,209
Whatever. Who said I even wanted you to?

510
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,056
I promise you, you're gonna be fine.

511
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:44,365
This is all going to be over soon,
and we'll have you back at home.

512
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,893
I'm sorry I got sick.

513
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:50,808
Baby, it's not your fault.
You kept trying to tell me.

514
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:54,136
I just wasn't paying attention to you.

515
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:58,127
In the future,
we need to have a code word, okay?

516
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,765
Okay.

517
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:03,213
Secret words you can use to let me know
when the pain is real...

518
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:04,934
and you're not just playing.

519
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:07,527
But it was always real.

520
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:11,970
I know.

521
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:14,008
Baby, I'm sorry.

522
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:19,932
I don't know why you guys are depressed.
I haven't gotten laid since September 11...

523
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:21,564
1985.

524
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:26,890
You laughed at the wrong part.
I'm just telling you. What a crowd!

525
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:29,615
You drinking NyQuil, ladies?
Sit up, come on!

526
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:32,130
Blonde Jews, everybody! Hip crowd!

527
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,652
Good to see you back
in men's clothes, Senator. All right.

528
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:38,808
Cousin Stu, right out of rehab.
Good to see you.

529
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,412
- The landscaper's here, thank God!
- So what's shiva mean, standup?

530
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:45,215
Jeffrey represented a lot of comedians.

531
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,254
There's one part I haven't told you.
I'm engaged.

532
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:56,687
Well, we couldn't go out anyway.
You're not Jewish.

533
00:42:57,736 --> 00:43:01,365
No, I didn't mean...
You would go out with me?

534
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:03,734
No, I just said I wouldn't.

535
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:07,047
- But it crossed your mind.
- I said, I would not.

536
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:08,973
Well, then, why'd you say it?

537
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:11,411
You thought about it. Come on.

538
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:13,245
Maybe.

539
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:15,646
You know, with your whole illness thing...

540
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:19,445
I have a bit of a messiah complex...

541
00:43:19,536 --> 00:43:21,333
saving the men.

542
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,854
Yes, messiah complex.

543
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,973
You know, you can save me.

544
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:32,333
If that's what you need to do,
you can save me.

545
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:37,247
It's really good that you have someone.
If anything is going to save you, that will.

546
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:39,371
Yeah.

547
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:44,008
I haven't told her
about my whole head thing.

548
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:48,686
How could you not tell your soul mate
something like that?

549
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:53,215
I don't even know if she's my soul mate.

550
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:57,133
I get it. She's not your soul mate
but you're going to marry her...

551
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:58,615
I don't know what else to do.

552
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:02,166
...because you have nothing better to do.
Great. That sounds good.

553
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:05,813
Hey, I don't even know
what a soul mate is, do you?

554
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:10,534
The person who makes you be
the most "you" that you could possibly be.

555
00:44:13,256 --> 00:44:15,133
Maybe your soul mate...

556
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:17,849
is the person...

557
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:21,770
who forces your soul to grow the most.

558
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:26,972
Not all growth feels good.

559
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:34,014
Hey, Melissa, it's Brenda.
I've been driving around for hours.

560
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:38,846
You want to have a drink or something?
Call me if you get in tonight, okay? Bye.

561
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:40,689
Whatever.

562
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,053
- Like that?
- Oh, yeah.

563
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:21,608
Are you gonna fuck me?

564
00:45:24,776 --> 00:45:26,607
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck you.

565
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:28,766
- I'm gonna fuck you hard.
- Yeah?

566
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:34,008
- Harder than you ever been fucked.
- Oh, good!

567
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:38,448
What's your name?

568
00:45:50,696 --> 00:45:53,893
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Fisher.
- Glad to.

569
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,014
Did he want to die?

570
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:12,248
Did he want to leave us?

571
00:46:12,656 --> 00:46:15,568
- How could he have wanted that?
- I don't know.

572
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:23,529
What do you think?

573
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:27,972
I don't think he wanted to die.

574
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,605
<i>Nate, leave your clothes on.</i>

575
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:44,729
I'll get naked. You can go outside
and come back as a dangerous intruder.

576
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,133
Come on, I'm serious.

577
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:51,295
It'll be fun.

578
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:56,492
I'll pretend I'm asleep, and then you
can come in and have your way with me.

579
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:04,010
I don't really feel like it, all right?

580
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:07,566
Okay, you don't have to go outside.
Just do it from in here.

581
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,732
Hey, I've never seen you before.

582
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:22,253
- What's your name?
- Nate.

583
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:25,645
- My name is Nate.
- That's pretty funny.

584
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:28,572
My fiancé's name is Nate.

585
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:48,647
I love you so much.

586
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,214
You're so soft, baby.

587
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:56,931
I love you. I love you so much.

588
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:59,211
Harder!

589
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:03,564
Come on.

590
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:54,973
Did the music wake you up?

591
00:49:55,056 --> 00:49:58,844
No, I've been up for a while actually.
I took a walk in the canyon.

592
00:49:58,936 --> 00:50:02,087
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- My God, it's gorgeous!

593
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:09,450
We'll have a weekend soon,
just you and me, okay?

594
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:12,130
You come back
when there's not so much craziness.

595
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:15,492
The craziness was totally fine.
It was fun, actually.

596
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:16,925
Good.

597
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:22,336
I love this song. It's so pretty.

598
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:25,571
You want a waffle before you go?

599
00:50:26,536 --> 00:50:27,889
No, thanks.

600
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:34,694
Well, then, tell everyone
I love them and miss them...

601
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:38,209
and want them to get their butts here
super soon, okay?

602
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:40,446
Especially that mama of yours.

603
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:44,885
Yeah, right, like she would ever.

604
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:53,572
I think she hides inside of herself
because she's so afraid we'll reject her.

605
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:56,488
So let's don't, okay?

606
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:00,968
She's had enough heartache
for one lifetime.

607
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:09,964
- You can keep it, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

608
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:19,205
As soon as I figure out
which two are my parents...

609
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:22,333
I'm just gonna roll them up in a rug
and throw them in my trunk.

610
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,929
Let me know if I can help.

611
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:28,248
I think I'll start with some coffee. But
give me your number if you're taking off.

612
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,455
Seriously?

613
00:51:31,176 --> 00:51:33,371
I figured I'd never see you again.

614
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:36,728
Well, you were wrong. I'll come into the city.

615
00:51:37,776 --> 00:51:40,131
Okay, I'll write down my number.

616
00:51:44,816 --> 00:51:49,048
So, you get the 8 x 10
and the 24 wallet sizes for under $20.

617
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:53,008
- Pedro is the spitting image of Ramon.
- Right?

618
00:51:53,096 --> 00:51:56,611
And everybody said he looked just like me
for the longest time.

619
00:51:57,016 --> 00:51:58,574
Hey, morning, baby!

620
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:03,130
Hey! Hey, Graciela.

621
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:07,251
So, Rico, Ramon told me
why he's not finishing your house.

622
00:52:08,536 --> 00:52:09,764
He did?

623
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:13,565
Yeah, just because
he has different taste in tile than you do.

624
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:17,535
I mean, you could have returned
what he bought and got something else.

625
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:20,448
Yeah, I guess I could have.

626
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:24,245
I know, girl, it sounds crazy to me, too,
but you know how men are.

627
00:52:24,336 --> 00:52:26,531
<i>Se ponen locos</i> with that machismo stuff.

628
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:30,326
I guess I just really wanted
to do my own house myself.

629
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:32,291
My way.

630
00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:34,685
You know how to do construction?

631
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:37,888
You know, I want to learn.
I got some books and...

632
00:52:37,976 --> 00:52:40,729
That's cool,
but just don't hold a grudge, okay?

633
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,892
I gotta go. Ramon is watching the kids,
and he's going to kill me.

634
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:48,171
- Okay, girl. Bye.
- See you guys later.

635
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:55,370
Baby, you're such a weirdo sometimes.

636
00:52:57,296 --> 00:52:58,649
Whatever.

637
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:27,211
Are you even going to ask
about my weekend?

638
00:53:27,296 --> 00:53:29,207
I wasn't planning on it.

639
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:34,924
- I had fun.
- I'm glad.

640
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,645
I found some slugs in the garden.

641
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:45,051
Neat.

642
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:53,452
I'm gonna go take a nap.

643
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,249
English
