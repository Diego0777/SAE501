1
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:46,598
- Piece of shit's whacked.
- Try the celly again.

2
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:51,921
And it ain't no piece of shit. The
alternator's a little temperamental.

3
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:56,362
Well, maybe the battery's dead,
like this phone.

4
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:58,999
Look, it ain't the battery.
It's the alt...

5
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:07,875
Hey, this is like one of them
Scream movies, huh?

6
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,961
More like Boyz N the Hood.

7
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,599
I'm gonna jet to that phone.
One of my dogs'll hook us up.

8
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:16,724
I know you ain't leaving
me here all alone.

9
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:21,006
Hey, look, you'll be safer in here.
Be back in three, all right?

10
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:25,439
- All right.
- Give me some love.

11
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,607
Ain 't nobody home,
Leave a message,

12
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,043
Hey, Luis, pick up the phone, dog.
Hey, wake up, man.

13
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,125
Damn.

14
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:09,001
Fucking lazy-ass punk,
motherfucker man.

15
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,923
Paco! Oh, my God!

16
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:21,442
Who the fuck is it?

17
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,332
Hello?

18
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,646
Hello?

19
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,326
Hello!

20
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:36,607
- Where you from?
- Your mama's pussy, bitch.

21
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:39,449
Paco! Paco!

22
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:43,523
Paco, no! No!

23
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,333
- Let's go.
- No!

24
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:49,248
No! No!

25
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:08,408
Miss Chenowith gave us her account
of your activities at the crime scene.

26
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,614
Crime scene? So you're
saying it was arson?

27
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,888
What's your story, Mr. Fisher?

28
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,088
The house is empty. I wanted to show
Brenda where I hung out as a kid.

29
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,569
I don't know why he
wanted to show it to me.

30
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,049
Can you tell us what you did
while you were there?

31
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,694
Walked around, looked at things.

32
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,291
You really expect us to believe you
broke into an abandoned house...

33
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,094
...just to walk around?

34
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,179
Okay. We fucked.

35
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:43,219
- You were there for an hour or so?
- Tops.

36
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:47,335
Could you walk us through what the
two of you did for that hour?

37
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:51,057
We made love.

38
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:55,495
Could you please be as
specific as possible?

39
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:59,173
Just to establish a timeline.

40
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:05,376
Well, he went down on
me for a while.

41
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,063
He's really good at it.

42
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:11,183
I don't exactly remember
the specifics.

43
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,621
He was in a state, like he had
a lot of aggression to work out.

44
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,140
She said that I was aggressive?

45
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:20,385
- Man, she should talk.
- Then he fell asleep.

46
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:24,015
- What happened then?
- We were exhausted, so we left.

47
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:29,346
I left to meet somebody. He was just
waking up. I don't know what he did.

48
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:33,625
- Can I go?
- I think we have everything we need.

49
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:37,979
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- Peace out, guys.

50
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,542
Well, yeah, she left first,
I left right after that,

51
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:46,260
Are you aware that the property was
purchased by Kroehner Service?

52
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,137
Yes, Matt Gilardi said they were planning
to open a cheap cremation place...

53
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:51,747
...and put us out of business.

54
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,739
Was that the point where you called
him a "greedy Nazi fuck"?

55
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,942
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that is correct.

56
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,587
You think I set the fire?

57
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,508
Well, you have to admit...

58
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,907
...it does seem like a beneficial
turn of events for your business.

59
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,944
- So, what, do I need a lawyer?
- Not yet.

60
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,630
You're free to go.

61
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,951
Actually, one more thing.

62
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,905
Do you know where your sister
was on the night of the fire?

63
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,511
No, why?

64
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:33,150
I understand she had a run-in with
the law recently. A missing foot.

65
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:37,631
If she is developing a pattern of acting
out subsequent to her father's death...

66
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,148
Claire had nothing to
do with that fire.

67
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,503
How do you know?

68
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,989
I knew passing the health department
inspection was too good to be true.

69
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:50,867
It just meant something
else would go wrong.

70
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,465
Great, there goes a month's profit.

71
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,587
We can live without air conditioning.
Plenty of people do.

72
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,508
Yeah, people in the Third World.

73
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:03,149
We can't run a business
without air conditioning.

74
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,914
If we lose any more funerals...

75
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:08,506
...Kroehner won't have to take
us over. We'll be bankrupt.

76
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:13,664
- How much?
- Central air, three grand easy.

77
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:18,075
Guess what.
Gilardi tipped the cops off.

78
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:21,906
- Think I'm a suspect.
- That's ridiculous.

79
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:25,747
- Where's Claire?
- School. I hope.

80
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,994
Do you know where
she was before the fire?

81
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,077
Why, what is it? Oh, dear God,
they don't think...

82
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:34,634
Oh, she couldn't have.

83
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,632
Good news, bad news.

84
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,474
Compressor's fine. Bad news is, your
pneumatic actuator assembly is shot.

85
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,310
Normally, I could do it in a day, but
with this heat wave, give me five days.

86
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,795
- Five?
- What's it gonna set us back?

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,356
Shouldn't debt you more than
3700, parts and labor.

88
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,396
Our 10:00.

89
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,920
Tell them we'll have air conditioning.

90
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,751
Three days.

91
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,712
He would have been 21 next week.

92
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:14,074
We were gonna buy him a new bed.

93
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:19,158
- Now we're buying him a coffin.
- Three in the morning.

94
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:22,673
He shouldn't have been out with
that girl in that neighborhood.

95
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:27,162
It's the worst thing that can happen,
to lose a child.

96
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:29,878
We lost him years ago.

97
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:36,599
- We'll see to it that Paco...
- His name is Manny.

98
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:44,359
- His gang name was Paco.
- He goes by Paco.

99
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,763
And he wasn't lost,
he was assassinated.

100
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,595
We'll see to it that he
has a dignified service.

101
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,958
We've been to three funeral
homes. No one will take us.

102
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,880
We don't turn people away here.

103
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:03,400
But sometimes when families lack
the funds necessary or insurance...

104
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:06,162
- I got money.
- We don't want your money.

105
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:08,679
If your son is willing to finance...

106
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:13,724
- He's not our son!
- He's a gang leader. Alvarado Kings.

107
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,324
- Don't you read the papers?
- My name is Powerful.

108
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,408
Paco's gonna have a fat-ass
funeral whatever it costs.

109
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,922
We got mad cash, so long as
you all can do it up right.

110
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,079
Now, can you all do it up right
or should we move on?

111
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,449
If you'll excuse me.

112
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:44,521
Nate will show you flower arrangements,
which might be to your liking.

113
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:52,445
Lilies are always nice.

114
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,205
Federico, I need your help,
your expertise.

115
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:08,168
- I've got a really tough one upstairs.
- Decomp? Crispy critter?

116
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,842
Gunshots, no facial damage,
cut and dried.

117
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:15,014
The family wants a traditional
Mexican funeral.

118
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,571
Okay. What's a traditional
Mexican funeral?

119
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,655
But there's this other guy,
the deceased's gang leader.

120
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,373
And what does this have
to do with me?

121
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:31,852
I was hoping you would
talk to them for me. With me.

122
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:35,094
What, because I'm Latino,
I know about gangs?

123
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:37,253
Well, you probably
know more than I do.

124
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,294
And why's that?

125
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:44,209
Well, I just assumed that maybe
somebody in your family might...

126
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,886
No, no one in my family. Never.

127
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:50,210
I've worked here for years, and you
don't know a damn thing about me.

128
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,774
- That's not true.
- You own an atlas?

129
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,328
- An atlas?
- Yeah, because if you did...

130
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,094
...you'd know there's 2400 miles
between Puerto Rico and Mexico.

131
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,170
You're Puerto Rican?

132
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,888
Look, Federico, I'm
sorry. I just assumed...

133
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:20,056
We can't afford to lose this funeral.

134
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:24,141
And I'm afraid if Nate and I
are the point of contact, we will.

135
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:29,298
This is our blue opal, 20 gauge
aluminum and copper...

136
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,132
...with a light blue,
sovereign velvet interior.

137
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,937
- It's nicer than our car.
- It's beautiful.

138
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:38,698
It's not good enough.

139
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:49,012
Mrs. Bolin, if this is the casket you
want for your son, you should have it.

140
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,176
He is your son.

141
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:53,337
Hey.

142
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,741
Where you from, dog?

143
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,383
One moment, please.

144
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:19,820
"Where you from?" Like, where
my parents were born?

145
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:24,260
San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico.
"Where you from?"

146
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:29,144
As in, what gang I belong to? Yeah,
I'll tell you what gang I belong to.

147
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,739
The gang that's gonna help
you bury your friend.

148
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,417
The gang that's gonna be there
for you and your cholos...

149
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,747
...when every other home doesn't
wanna deal with your bullshit.

150
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,386
Your friend is dead, man.

151
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,060
Now, do you want me to help you
or you just wanna go heads-up?

152
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,264
It's good.

153
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:06,740
- I don't like it. It's dangerous.
- Not if we let Rico handle everything.

154
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,740
David, we are so white. If we
step in, we will totally fuck up.

155
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,312
Language.

156
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:14,743
I'm more worried whether
Claire started that fire.

157
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,063
Why would she? To help us out?
She hates us.

158
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:20,908
- Is Brenda a vegetarian?
- She'll eat anything.

159
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:30,148
Did you know the night dad died,
Claire was high on crystal meth?

160
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:33,188
Oh, my God,
isn't that a horse tranquilizer?

161
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,273
No, it's speed, really nasty speed
that makes you crazy.

162
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,625
If there are things
you don't want me to hear...

163
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,951
...go talk about them in another room.

164
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:46,308
- I assume she drinks.
- I can call and tell her to cancel.

165
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:48,512
No, I've been looking
forward to this.

166
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:52,107
I have some errands to run. I'll pick
up a nice chardonnay while I'm out.

167
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:55,787
- What errands?
- I can give you a list if you'd like.

168
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,751
You guys, this kid at school today
got busted for having a taser...

169
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,108
...because he showed it to
his friends at lunch.

170
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:08,630
What an idiot. There were like six
cops. It was absolutely hilarious.

171
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,790
What?

172
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,389
No, it's not really
a gang funeral. It's...

173
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,108
They needed a home,
we needed a body. Everyone wins.

174
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,118
Yeah, right. Who you gonna call
when the bullets start flying?

175
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,551
- Anyone but you.
- Oh, you damn straight.

176
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,070
Claire's gonna need a lawyer.
A good one.

177
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:35,956
Look, if she set that fire,
she'll do what's right. I'll see to it.

178
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:40,074
What's right is getting her top legal
counsel and having her plead the Fifth.

179
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't care what you do, just keep her
out of the system. She'll be eaten alive.

180
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:47,560
Any chance you can snoop around
and find out their game plan?

181
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,230
I don't know. I already
interfered once.

182
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:53,321
- Are you guys pulling out or what?
- Yeah, in a minute.

183
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:55,838
Well, let's go.

184
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,874
Fucking fags, man.

185
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:12,043
Keith.

186
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:15,724
Keith!

187
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,677
- Say it again.
- What?

188
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:22,123
I said, say it again. The next time
you call someone a fucking fag...

189
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,199
...you make sure that fag
isn't an L.A.P.D. Officer.

190
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,959
You got that?

191
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,996
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:34,324
Now, you got my badge,
file a complaint. I dare you.

193
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:39,642
You get your punk ass out of here,
fucking bitch.

194
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:48,485
- Tore his ass up.
- I don't think he meant anything by it.

195
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:51,123
Do you hate yourself that much?

196
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:14,320
This is some fucked up way to
make a living. You know that?

197
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:26,963
- How's your day, man?
- You don't wanna know.

198
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:31,003
You ever see sunlight?
Or you gotta avoid it?

199
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:38,448
- Hey, you checking out my dick.
- I was not.

200
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,208
I'm just fucking with you, man.

201
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,488
Hi.

202
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:56,170
A gift from my parents.
They'll freak when they find out.

203
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,607
- You're an hour early.
- Really?

204
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,090
Yeah.

205
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:11,288
Not quite as Addams Family
as I'd expected.

206
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,057
Dave and I used to play Addams
Family when we were kids.

207
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:17,533
I was usually Gomez.
He was always Lurch.

208
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,452
The kitsch factor is substantial.

209
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:25,492
Hence your well-developed
sense of irony, I suppose.

210
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,856
- It's hot in here.
- Do I hear voices?

211
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:33,257
- Look who's early.
- It's a pleasure to see you again.

212
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:36,337
I'm so glad you could make it, dear.

213
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,858
Champagne. How festive. Thank you.

214
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,931
Excuse me, I'm knee-deep
in marinara. I'll go chill this.

215
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,214
Nate, give Brenda a tour.

216
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,691
- She hates me.
- Why do you say that?

217
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,812
Because it's true.

218
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:03,499
What's the matter?
Afraid Mommy might see?

219
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:07,092
Okay, okay. Can we not turn
tonight into psych 101?

220
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:09,976
Because trust me, we'd never
make it through the evening.

221
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,777
Somebody's defensive.

222
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:16,976
Nate, it doesn't matter if your
mother likes me or not. I don't care.

223
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,135
What's that shit?

224
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,094
Oh, hell no. No.

225
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,783
Hey, how come you don't
call your bone daddy?

226
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:37,855
Still pissed at him, right?
Hey, I'm feeling you, man.

227
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,502
What gives him the right to get up
in your world? You know, be so...?

228
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:44,095
So fucking self-righteous?

229
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:51,341
That's what I'm saying. You don't call
him nothing, but he went off on you.

230
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,744
Yeah. I think he's got a problem with
that stress-management shit.

231
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:58,257
Hey, or maybe he's one of
them rage-aholics.

232
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:02,063
- I mean, that boy went off.
- Just because some kid calls him a fag.

233
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:07,063
- It's so unnecessary.
- Well, he called you a fag too.

234
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:10,067
- So?
- So, what'd you do?

235
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,867
Nothing.

236
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:18,940
And Simon Peter stood
and warmed himself.

237
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,222
They said therefore unto him,
"Art not thou one of his disciples?"

238
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:31,108
- He denied it and said, "I am not."
- John 18:25.

239
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:35,782
No wonder he went
off on you, man. You know?

240
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,431
Hey, bury me naked, please.

241
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,862
It's a shame Diane Arbus is dead.

242
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:49,112
She could take some fucking
great photographs in here.

243
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:57,863
- What's the matter with you today?
- Nothing. I just have a lot on my mind.

244
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,623
- I don't wanna bore you with it.
- Thank you.

245
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,111
Come here.

246
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,828
- Why?
- Just do it.

247
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,268
What's wrong?

248
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:28,627
I'm about to become an undertaker,
and I'm scared to death of it.

249
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:31,226
A huge corporation wants
to put us out of business...

250
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:35,510
...and I'm worried my sister's not
only a crackhead, she's an arsonist.

251
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:41,393
- There's a lot of sadness in this house.
- It's a funeral home.

252
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:47,435
No wonder you ran away. You channel
other people's pain, you know that?

253
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,313
My father called it a gift.

254
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,914
It is a gift.

255
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:37,192
Oh, God!

256
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:43,832
- Oh, God!
- Guess dinner's ready.

257
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:48,642
So, what's it like to be interrogated?
Did you flash your crotch...

258
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:51,234
...like Sharon Stone in that movie?
- Claire.

259
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:55,358
They just keep asking the same
question different ways to trip you up.

260
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,399
That's cool. Was it fun?
I bet it was kind of fun.

261
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:01,922
- Not really.
- Think they'll wanna interrogate me?

262
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,004
No.

263
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:09,604
Nate, will you say grace?

264
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,402
- Wouldn't David rather?
- Please.

265
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:20,206
Thank you, Lord, for our health and
bounty through Christ. Amen.

266
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:22,325
What, are you on crack?

267
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,277
Squash?

268
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:29,888
Mom, Nate and I have been
working on a business plan...

269
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,398
...to figure out how we're
gonna fend off Kroehner.

270
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:37,047
Business plan? Your father
never had a business plan.

271
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,608
- Yeah, that's part of the problem.
- We'd like to go over it with you.

272
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,282
I don't need to see it.
It's your business, not mine.

273
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:50,684
- Is there sauce for the pasta?
- I'll get it.

274
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,008
- Brenda, what do you do for a living?
- She gives massages.

275
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,851
- Shiatsu.
- Now, what exactly is that?

276
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:01,327
It's a Japanese
bodywork technique...

277
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:06,128
...that involves pressure to points
on the acupuncture meridians.

278
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:11,361
Well, how interesting, acupuncture.
That's the pins, right?

279
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:16,768
- Yes. The pins.
- So you stick pins in people.

280
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:21,567
I use my thumbs, wrists, elbows.

281
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,965
So you stick your thumbs in people?

282
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:29,248
No. At least not as part of my job.

283
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,767
- I hope you stay for dessert.
- It's peach cobbler.

284
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:44,609
Yum.

285
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:55,896
This is a nice box. That
Federico is a good salesman, huh?

286
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:58,612
I'll say. You know what the
markup is on one of these?

287
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:00,854
Thirty-two hundred.

288
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,335
Hey, can I get like a nightlight up
in here? I don't like the dark.

289
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,054
Well, then you shouldn't have gone
and gotten yourself shot.

290
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:13,135
Shit, that's cold, man.

291
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,137
Mr. Powerful and his
entourage are here.

292
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,810
- I'll be right there.
- Who were you talking to?

293
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,059
Myself.

294
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:34,619
David, why did you stop
going to church with me?

295
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,975
I've been going to a different church
with a friend of mine.

296
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:43,137
That cop? The black man?

297
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:46,332
Don't be a pussy.

298
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:50,335
Yes, Mom, that cop, the black man.

299
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:30,783
I love you, Paco. Oh, God.

300
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,707
You all right?

301
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:59,030
I look like a fucking Bible
salesman. I look like you.

302
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,621
Man, what's up with this
whack-ass music?

303
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:14,227
- I'm not sure about the music.
- Yeah, it blows.

304
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,309
What about the "Ave Maria"?

305
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,264
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

306
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:53,348
Honey?

307
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:57,907
God, no. No, please.

308
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,353
No, no, no.

309
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:09,710
No!

310
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:21,355
It's like a mad scientist lab in here.
How can you live here?

311
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,915
Better than a Turkish prison.
Most days.

312
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,034
- Jesus.
- Told you.

313
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,879
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- I don't know. Shot at a few.

314
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,318
Everybody thinks I burned down
this house across the street.

315
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,277
- Did you?
- What do you think?

316
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,112
What's it like to shoot a gun?

317
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,513
You wanna try some time?

318
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:08,081
- Come down to East Los, be down.
- Are you serious? Because I will.

319
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:13,120
You're some kind of
tough, little bitch, huh?

320
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:21,240
You didn't hear your road dog
calling for help on your machine.

321
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:23,560
You ain't gonna spend
the rest of your life...

322
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:27,155
...wondering why you didn't pick up
the phone the first time it rang.

323
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,196
You're hurting me.

324
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:33,518
You don't know shit, little girl.

325
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,322
Don't waste my time.

326
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:47,718
This one right here is my first one.
After that, man...

327
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:52,079
I mean, I got me this one right here
when I got jumped in. Check it out.

328
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:55,360
- That's very intricate.
- Yeah.

329
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,925
And this one. This one took me
three weeks to heal. Watch out.

330
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:03,438
That's the shit, huh?

331
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:12,719
- Can I help you?
- Hi, it's so good to see you again.

332
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:16,479
- How have you been?
- Fine.

333
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,559
So sad. I read about Manuel's death in
the Times. I had to pay my respects.

334
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,925
Oh, it's heartbreaking. The riots...
I mean, the uprising...

335
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:30,726
...was supposed to increase the peace
and all we have are more dead children.

336
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,205
Did you know him?

337
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:35,802
Oh, I feel I know all
these innocent victims.

338
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:40,680
This is not a good time. If you'd like
to forward a card to the family...

339
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,329
Well, maybe I could just
stay a few minutes.

340
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:49,807
A card. I'll do that.

341
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:10,455
You should have seen
my baby, so happy...

342
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:15,172
...such a smile that could
break your heart.

343
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:22,764
What kind of God lets a baby like
that get caught up in all that shit?

344
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:25,450
Drugs.

345
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,815
Guns.

346
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,770
Death.

347
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:41,537
Mrs. Bolin, I'm not gonna tell you
that it's all gonna be okay.

348
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,207
But it just takes time.

349
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,728
This is as bad as it gets.

350
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:51,172
I have nothing to live for.

351
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:56,617
You have your husband.
You have you.

352
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,535
You have the memory of that little
baby. You have to keep that alive.

353
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:07,014
My father died on Christmas Eve.

354
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:12,211
And there's so much I never said...

355
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:16,092
...never knew about him.

356
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,298
But he's a part of me.

357
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:24,021
And Manny will always
be a part of you.

358
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:29,698
Why didn't God take me
instead of my boy?

359
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,016
I don't know.

360
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:40,054
You gotta apologize to your boy Keith.
Otherwise, you're just a born bitch.

361
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:42,494
You're speaking like
this at your funeral?

362
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:47,017
Damn straight. I say
whatever I goddamn please.

363
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:53,382
I've been to a ton of funerals.
You seen one, you seen them all.

364
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:57,505
- Even mine.
- No gunfire, no fights.

365
00:31:57,706 --> 00:32:02,497
Nah. No Sharks, no Jets.

366
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,777
Just like any other funeral.

367
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,423
- You let down, huh?
- A little.

368
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:22,703
A Detective McBride just called. They
made a determination of the house fire.

369
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,982
- They termed it "cause unknown."
- So they ruled out arson.

370
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:31,740
No, they just can't tell.
Either way, the case is closed.

371
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,942
Which doesn't rule out the possibility
that Claire set that fire.

372
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,424
She didn't do that, Nate.

373
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,345
Well, what if she did, Mom? Pretending
it didn't happen is not gonna help.

374
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:50,699
I'm sorry about last night
with Brenda...

375
00:32:52,112 --> 00:32:55,343
...when you walked in on us.
- I know what you're talking about.

376
00:32:57,432 --> 00:33:00,868
- Where have you been?
- None of your business.

377
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:03,633
When did this become a police state?

378
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,387
I need an Altoid.

379
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:23,070
The original sin
wasn't eating the apple.

380
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:26,432
It wasn't questioning authority.

381
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:32,228
It was not giving God the chance
to give his side of the argument.

382
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:36,827
It was just taking the
serpent's word as gospel.

383
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:41,946
It was not going back to God
and saying, "Hey, what gives?

384
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:45,473
He said you are lying to us."

385
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:50,907
It was just assuming that God lies.

386
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,673
I'm sorry about the other day.

387
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,679
Aren't you gonna say,
"Hey, man, I'm sorry too...

388
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:06,191
...for revealing my dormant psycho
side and scaring the shit out of you"?

389
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:11,230
You really think I hate myself?

390
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,512
- Good to see you, David.
- Hi.

391
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,670
I know where you are. I was there.
I'll wait for you because I love you.

392
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:28,311
But I'm not moving
backwards for anybody.

393
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:32,515
I'm not asking you to move backwards.
I'm just asking you to be patient...

394
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:34,553
...and a little calmer.

395
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:37,913
Do you have any idea what I put up
with on my job every day?

396
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:41,235
How many times the word "fag"
has been written on my locker?

397
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:45,920
How many times I wonder going into a
dangerous situation if I'll get back up?

398
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,279
We were stepped on
yesterday, David.

399
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:51,914
And I did something about it
because I am tired of it.

400
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:56,003
When you get tired of it,
you let me know.

401
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:07,201
- Morning.
- Hi.

402
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,882
You think I should make a peace
offering to your mother?

403
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:16,395
No, that'll just make things worse.

404
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:19,200
I brought it up yesterday.
She nearly bit my head off.

405
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:24,401
Oh, Jesus. It's no accident you
guys are undertakers...

406
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:28,600
...because you take every fucking feeling
you have, put it in a box and bury it.

407
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:33,438
Better that than examine every fucking
moment until the joy is drained out of it.

408
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:49,406
- Come here.
- No.

409
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,561
Just do it.

410
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,285
Sex does not solve everything, Nate.

411
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,726
You wouldn 't have to
worry about us,,,

412
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,365
,,, while you're working
and we're out of school,

413
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:05,001
Right, The family that plays
together, stays together,

414
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:09,841
And it'd be a groovy way to find out
exactly what's wrong with this country,

415
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:12,652
I'd be able to see all
the injustices firsthand,

416
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,241
Look, kids, everything
you say makes sense,,,

417
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,364
,,, and it would be marvelous
if we could go, But there's one,,,,

418
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:21,690
Claire, are you okay?

419
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:31,092
- No.
- Well, do you wanna talk about it?

420
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:34,293
Sure.

421
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:38,643
My pimp's threatening to beat me up
because I can't turn enough tricks.

422
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:44,134
What's worse is, he's threatening to
take away my smack. It's hell.

423
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:53,695
- Why do you have to be such a bitch?
- Why do you assume I'm in trouble?

424
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:58,208
Like you guys are such
shining examples. Jesus.

425
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:03,416
She's right, Mom, Do you want
Chris to pump gas all his life?

426
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:06,973
And Tracy to wait on tables
in some sleazy strip joint?

427
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,410
Kroehner is going to keep
strong-arming our suppliers...

428
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,973
...undercutting us, stealing funerals.

429
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:17,734
We're never gonna be able to compete
in terms of size or market presence.

430
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:22,012
Where we can compete
is quality of service, integrity.

431
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:26,935
- We'll give them the human touch.
- It all sounds good to me.

432
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,857
Is this over?

433
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,735
But we have to get our message out.
We'll need to market and promote.

434
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,171
Replace outmoded equipment
and install computers.

435
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,611
Fine.

436
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,249
In order to make this all work, we'll
need a significant financial investment.

437
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,137
- How much?
- Ninety-three thousand.

438
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:54,132
You want me to give you $93,000
from your father's life insurance?

439
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,781
Nobody else is going to do it.

440
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,701
We're still paying off a bank
note Dad took out years ago.

441
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:02,731
We hate to ask, Mom,
but we're desperate.

442
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:07,574
- Of course, you're not obligated.
- I know that.

443
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,701
When do you need it?

444
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:17,572
- You sure, Mom?
- But it's not a loan.

445
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:21,775
I'm now an investor
in Fisher & Sons.

446
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:27,621
We'll establish a fair percentage
of equity and rate of return.

447
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:32,144
I can invest in either
my boys or tech stocks.

448
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:35,258
Anything's better than the track.

449
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:43,621
David, I'd like it if you'd come with
me to church every once in a while...

450
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:48,457
...now that your father's gone.
I shouldn't have to go alone.

451
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,581
Okay.

452
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:59,224
Well, that was weird.

453
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:02,747
It gets weirder. There was a message
on my machine from Gilardi.

454
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:05,861
He wants to meet with us today.

455
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,388
Hey, dog. Getting ready
to throw some blows?

456
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,983
If you were me, Paco, what would you
say to Gilardi? What would you do?

457
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,670
If I was you?

458
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:24,781
Shit, if I was you, I wouldn't
own a fucking funeral home.

459
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:26,829
But all right.

460
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:33,145
All right, say I'm doing my thing,
selling my shit.

461
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:37,504
Some punk ass tries to
clock me from my corner.

462
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,065
You know what I say?

463
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:48,191
I say, "Peep this, motherfucker! 5:00,
you near me, my corner or my shit...

464
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:51,704
...I'll cut your fucking stomach,
watch your guts spill out.

465
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:55,793
I'll let you live until
you slowly bleed to death...

466
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,873
...in front of your fucking kids."

467
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,273
Feel your heart racing?

468
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:14,546
Because when the other guy
feels like that, you won.

469
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,748
Come on, David.

470
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:21,188
You gotta stand up, man.
You gotta step up.

471
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:23,992
Yeah, you stepped up.
Look what happened to you.

472
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:29,596
That's right. For 20 years,
I lived my life like a man.

473
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:33,027
When are you gonna start?

474
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:44,079
- You lowered your offer.
- What can I say? The market fluctuates.

475
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:48,192
Thanks, but we don't see a need to
align ourselves with Kroehner right now.

476
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,358
Okay.

477
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,517
I'll make it simple.

478
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,310
You accept our offer
by the end of the day...

479
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,957
...or I'll make it my personal mission
to bury you by the end of the month.

480
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:04,358
David, you in on
this suicide mission?

481
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:09,555
David?

482
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,753
- You just threatened my family.
- Let's not be melodramatic.

483
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:18,313
What do you expect us
to do, run and hide?

484
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:21,993
- Sell and be grateful? Pack up and move?
- Lf you're smart.

485
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:28,794
You have the Kroehner organization
behind you. And what do we have?

486
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:32,043
You.

487
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:35,319
One day when your mind isn't
on Fisher & Sons...

488
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:38,562
...I will find you
or someone you love.

489
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,038
I'm not saying anyone
is going to die.

490
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,281
There are tragedies
far worse than death.

491
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:52,163
Things you couldn't even dream of, you
spineless, candy-ass, corporate fuck.

492
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:54,601
Just give me a reason.

493
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:05,199
It's your decision. Are we really
worth the trouble, Mr. Gilardi?

494
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:11,361
Lunch is over. Get lost.

495
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:15,519
Are you deaf?

496
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:27,446
- What the fuck was that?
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

497
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,882
Hi.

498
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,085
I hope you like fancy bath stuff. I went
a little crazy at the Beverly Center.

499
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:45,925
- Thank you. This wasn't necessary.
- Yes, it was.

500
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:50,370
I'm afraid you might not have seen
me in my best light the other night.

501
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:53,291
I saw more of you than I cared to.

502
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:55,964
Okay.

503
00:42:56,772 --> 00:43:01,324
Look. I'm not a very
traditional person.

504
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:08,530
And I don't really know what's
happening between me and Nate...

505
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:14,525
...but every once in a while
I get a glimpse...

506
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:18,853
...of things maybe working
out for us...

507
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:24,089
...and I'm really sorry
about what happened.

508
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:30,806
Be careful with him.

509
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,966
He's a lot more fragile
than he'd like to think.

510
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:37,453
Aren't we all?

511
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:44,530
- Well, thank you.
- My pleasure.

512
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,295
Are the Fishers around?

513
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:01,372
- You need David?
- All of them and you too.

514
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,331
Just tell me what
you're unhappy with.

515
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,530
Just get them, all right?

516
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:19,411
Will you join us?

517
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:38,741
Merciful Jesus...

518
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:45,018
...please bring rest and peace
to our fallen brother...

519
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:46,657
...son...

520
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:50,421
...friend...

521
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:54,181
...Manuel Paco Bolin.

522
00:44:56,344 --> 00:45:01,021
May he live with you
forever in your lightened truth.

523
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:06,614
- Almighty Father. Amen.
- Amen.

524
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:13,704
We also wanna thank the Fishers...

525
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,176
...who lost a father and husband.

526
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:23,817
Lord bring peace to
them in their grief...

527
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:27,938
...as you have in ours.

528
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:35,506
We'll miss you.

529
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:00,229
Hey, let go of me, you
fucking fag. I gots to go.

530
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,544
Jesus, you're just a kid.

531
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:06,983
So are you.

532
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,510
Hey, David.

533
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:27,904
Don't be a bitch.

534
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:46,151
Shit. Now, I know why you
wanted to go bowling...

535
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:48,586
...instead of a movie.
- I was state champion...

536
00:46:48,796 --> 00:46:51,515
...in the Youth For Christ Bowling
League when I was 17.

537
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:56,074
- You're gonna beat the pants off me.
- That's my intent.

538
00:46:56,797 --> 00:47:00,073
I got a college degree, and I still
cannot figure how this scoring works.

539
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,996
Hey, you fellows together?

540
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:06,952
Yeah, we are.

541
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:09,351
That's cool.

542
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:20,952
Hey, Bren, the door's unlocked.

543
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:26,708
- Brenda?
- In the bedroom.

544
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,276
I'm just here to deliver a pizza,
ma'am. I don't want any trouble.

545
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,517
I got your tip right here.

546
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:36,880
Whoa.

547
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:41,277
Where's my pizza?

548
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:54,991
Mom asked me to tell you that the
lavender bath scrub was delicious.

549
00:47:55,763 --> 00:47:58,436
She's not supposed to eat it.

550
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:05,274
- What's with all the candles?
- I'm burning up.

551
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:09,757
Burning up for your love.

552
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:20,804
What?

553
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,040
What?

554
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:30,678
You like some guy enough to have
his name burned in your flesh.

555
00:48:30,926 --> 00:48:33,042
I would have done a lot
more than that for him.

556
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:42,315
- What's up with you?
- I had a really weird day.

557
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,198
Poor baby.

558
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:32,361
- Mom, are you okay?
- Fine.

559
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:40,090
Can I ask you something? And
you promise to tell me the truth?

560
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:41,966
Maybe.

561
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:46,091
- Did you set that fire?
- No.

562
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:50,131
No, I would never
do anything like that.

563
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:54,449
I may have swiped that foot, though.

564
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:01,091
Dinner's almost ready.

565
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:25,058
