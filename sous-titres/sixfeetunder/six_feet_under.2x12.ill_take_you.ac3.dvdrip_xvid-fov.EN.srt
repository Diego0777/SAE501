1
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,686
Very beautiful.

2
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,810
The coronation time.

3
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:17,043
- Encyclopedia Brown, are you snooping?
- No, it was open.

4
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:22,488
"Fuck me harder, surfer boy,
with your fat little crooked cock...

5
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:26,722
"and your please-tell-me-you're-not-serious
shaved balls."

6
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,011
- This is pretty out there, Bren.
- Not really.

7
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,403
Have you had sex with two men
at the same time?

8
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,802
You ever had sex with two women?

9
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:38,044
And once again,
you refuse to answer my question.

10
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,762
- Have you?
- Yes.

11
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,208
- How was it?
- Which time?

12
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:48,887
"He puts on his yin-yang baseball cap
and asks for her number.

13
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,725
"'Why? ' she says. 'So we can date?"'

14
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,690
Well, she has a point.

15
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:57,162
"On his way out, he says, 'Late,'
in that stupid surfer way.

16
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,210
"She feels sad for about half a second...

17
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:03,410
"then the familiar relief
when she hears the door shut.

18
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,530
"Why does it always feel so good
when they leave?"

19
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:09,885
What? I love it. I think it's great.

20
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:13,249
Yeah. It's just really weird
hearing it out loud.

21
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,089
I don't care if you love it.
I didn't write it for you.

22
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,372
You know what I think?

23
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,728
You're angry with me
about sleeping with Lisa.

24
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:22,768
Yeah.

25
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:26,482
Maybe you're getting back at me by writing
about you being with someone else.

26
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:28,484
Nate, it's not that simple.

27
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:34,006
I started writing this long before
I found out about you and Lisa.

28
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:39,813
So tell me.

29
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,283
What else is in that computer?

30
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,611
Or this computer.

31
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,093
Taylor, someone very important
is coming over tomorrow.

32
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,970
A very important friend.

33
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,442
And we need you
to be on your best behavior.

34
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,570
You mean a social worker?
I've had them before.

35
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:09,805
Miss Pastorelli and Mr. Shipley.
He smelled like Fritos and coughed a lot.

36
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:14,369
Me and my mom, we used to call him
"Mr. Shit-for-Brains."

37
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:17,331
I am sick and tired of your mouth, all right?

38
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,723
When you speak like that,
you're not showing any respect for yourself.

39
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:25,170
There are people in this world who'll
not respect you, without you adding to it.

40
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,767
You know what I'm talking about?

41
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:32,205
You're gonna be late for school.
Go brush your teeth so we can leave.

42
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,166
- Keith, I don't think...
- I don't want to hear it.

43
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,448
Because I'm white,
I couldn't possibly understand?

44
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,412
Because you'll start spouting that child
psychology bullshit you've been reading.

45
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,291
It's not bullshit.
It's called the "whole-child theory"...

46
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:54,208
and it's only the collective thoughts of some
of the greatest educators around, okay?

47
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,891
Letting her know
that we love her for who she is builds trust.

48
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,682
Constantly scolding her
for behavior we don't like, doesn't.

49
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:10,286
- I don't know how we'll raise a child.
- We just are, okay?

50
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,603
The board still hasn't cleared me
on the shooting.

51
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:16,811
We're going to get the guardianship,
and we're going to be good parents.

52
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:22,201
Taylor, how long is it going to take you
to brush your teeth?

53
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,604
I would like to go on record as saying...

54
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,412
I am in full support of you
going to art school.

55
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,364
Consider it recorded.

56
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,172
But I'm just taking a tour.

57
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,244
Let's not get our panties in a wad over it.

58
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,927
That's such an unpleasant expression.

59
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,685
I never got to go to college.

60
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,491
- Did you even want to?
- I did.

61
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,122
- I wanted to study French feminist writers.
- You're a feminist, Mom?

62
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,171
Feminism means being accepted
for who you are.

63
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,524
I wanted to be a wife and a mother.

64
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,969
I never gave anything up to be a mother
or a wife. It was what I wanted.

65
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,964
I thought you said you gave up college.

66
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:05,887
- Why is every conversation with you a trap?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

67
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:08,732
Be a feminist. We can both be feminists.

68
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,488
Check it out, Cindy Sherman went here.

69
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,329
- And Billy Chenowith? I never knew that.
- Brenda's brother?

70
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:18,530
- The one in the mental institution?
- He's out.

71
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,203
- Is he cured?
- Who knows?

72
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:23,645
God, I hate my hair.

73
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:27,729
When I go to college,
I'm gonna cut it all off, like Felicity.

74
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,326
Have I met her?

75
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,962
Yeah, she was here for dinner once.

76
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:43,045
Federico? Are you all right?

77
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,570
Yeah, I'm fine, David.

78
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,091
You know her?

79
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,569
<i>Abuelita.</i> It means "grandma."

80
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:55,050
- Federico, I'm so sorry.
- No, she's not really my grandma.

81
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,964
She's sort of adopted.

82
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,484
She lived by herself, right across the street
from me and Vanessa, before we moved.

83
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,326
I used to clean the leaves
out of her gutters...

84
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:08,211
and bring her trashcans
back up the driveway.

85
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:11,012
I mean, nothing big,
just when I was doing mine.

86
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,653
We used to invite her
to all the kids' birthday parties.

87
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,452
She used to sit in this folding chair...

88
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,082
just happy to be there,
with a big smile on her face.

89
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:24,726
That's sweet.

90
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,123
- Is that the pre-need she and I did together?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,091
Is this a new rule? Wear pajamas to work?

92
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:39,212
Sorry. I live at Keith's now.
I don't know where half my stuff is.

93
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,122
What?

94
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:45,928
She wants the Our Lady of Guadalupe
casket. I love that one.

95
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:56,491
Listen, we heard back from the Use-of-Force
Review Board about your shooting.

96
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:59,531
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this...

97
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,173
but you're being brought up on charges.

98
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,926
Turns out all the perp had was a toy pistol.

99
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:08,326
There's evidence to suggest
that if the perp hadn't died...

100
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,644
he might have invented
a clean-burning alternative to fossil fuels...

101
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,486
reducing our dependence
on imported energy sources...

102
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,609
thus ending the conflict in the Middle East...

103
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:19,571
and deflecting the horror
of the impending world war.

104
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:20,927
It's good.

105
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,967
They decided it was a good shooting.

106
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,247
Thank you.

107
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:31,926
Congratulations.

108
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:47,521
Well, the board ruled. I'm off the hook.

109
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,326
Thank God.

110
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:52,412
- I'll talk to you later.
<i>- Love you. Bye.</i>

111
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,485
Claire Fisher?

112
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:05,168
- How'd you know?
- You don't look like a Mujadeep Siddiqui.

113
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,042
I'm Henry. I'll be your cruise director.

114
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,612
- Excellent.
- Let's go.

115
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:16,250
So let me guess. You were, like, the one
total weirdo outcast at your high school.

116
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:20,529
Not the only one.
But definitely one of the top ten.

117
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,290
I think that's what all of us are.

118
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,491
I think every last freak of every last
California high school winds up here.

119
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,883
We're kind of the Island of Misfit Toys
of colleges.

120
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:35,522
- Can anyone take welding?
- You have to. It's a requirement.

121
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:39,605
How cool that welding is a requirement,
not fucking calculus.

122
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:42,161
Nobody'll be looking at my math grades
to get in here.

123
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,971
Even though you don't need the grades...

124
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,328
you gotta make sure
you rock the application thing.

125
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,404
- Yeah, definitely.
- No, seriously.

126
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:52,532
A lot of people want to go to school here,
so it's not like a sleepwalk to get in.

127
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,810
Your essay, your portfolio,
all that stuff counts.

128
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,329
Letters of recommendation.

129
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:01,246
- Who do you know?
- Nobody.

130
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,969
- I sort of know Billy Chenowith.
- He's okay.

131
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:10,764
I think everything he does Gregory
Crewdson did better, except years ago.

132
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,050
But the alumni thing
should work in your favor.

133
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,042
- This one's called "The Jesus Balls."
- First year student.

134
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:51,772
No, that's fine.
We don't have to go out tonight.

135
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:52,842
Okay.

136
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,921
Although we did decide that we would
get together every other night.

137
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:01,082
But this is actually better,
because now we can go out Saturday...

138
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,290
then Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
of next week.

139
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,722
Wait.

140
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:09,167
Then we can't be together next Saturday.

141
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:14,447
So, truth be told,
every other day isn't a workable plan.

142
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,412
I think we should decide
on a number of days of a week.

143
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,927
Say, three days a week or four days a week.

144
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,481
- Three days a week.
- Right. Or four days a week.

145
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,768
And then choose those four days...

146
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,764
always making sure we include Saturdays...

147
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:31,243
because who wants to stay alone
on a Saturday, right?

148
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,285
Whatever you decide.

149
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,969
Nikolai, don't let me talk you into something
you don't want to do.

150
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,532
No. Is fine.

151
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,961
Good, let me go look at a calendar.

152
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,446
So, tell me everything.

153
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:53,006
What does the human Frymaster look like?

154
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,406
The crematory?

155
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,847
It's a big steel thing in a big room.

156
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,128
How does it work exactly?

157
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,326
The container is placed
on these chrome rollers.

158
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,252
Then a small door raises
and the body goes through.

159
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,564
Like how your tray disappears
through that thing in the cafeteria?

160
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:13,847
Yeah.

161
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,803
Actually, it's just like that.

162
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,412
And then?

163
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:26,243
And then, once the body is in there,
there's a button that's pressed.

164
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,408
Sounds good.

165
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:31,247
Even though the good rabbi said
I shouldn't, just burn me up.

166
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,525
- Who pushes the button?
- Whomever you specify.

167
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:38,371
Buddhists have a family member.
Some people choose no one...

168
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,728
in which case the person
at the crematory does it.

169
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:42,531
I'll take that guy.

170
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,771
I guess I'll be on my own
at that point, though.

171
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:51,606
What about family members? Your parents?

172
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,805
They just got to be total downers.
I told them to stop coming.

173
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:59,442
They'll find out I'm dead
when the rest of the world does.

174
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:02,292
- Got any other friends?
- Yeah, I had some.

175
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,884
A lot of work, you know?

176
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:09,729
A lot of people freak out when you get sick,
and a bunch of people betrayed me.

177
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:12,453
Some people just got too crazy to deal with.

178
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,285
- What about a girlfriend?
- No.

179
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,682
I mean, yeah, I had girlfriends.

180
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,286
Relationships.

181
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:23,124
But I'd be in something for whatever,
like two months, two years...

182
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,761
and then it would just get too...

183
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,127
Nothing. Just "too."

184
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:35,331
I'd start thinking, "I don't like this about her,
and I don't like this about her."

185
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,132
Then I'd start to feel this thing
on the back of my neck...

186
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:41,444
like one of those SuperBalls,
and it would throb with the word...

187
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:45,526
"Leave. Leave. Leave." And so I would.

188
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,692
And the second I got my life back,
the ball would disappear.

189
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,245
I suffer from that American thing big time.

190
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,121
You know, always looking around
for someone better. Shopping.

191
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:03,002
- I think a lot of people go through that.
- No, they don't, man.

192
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:06,642
Okay? They don't.
Most people just pick someone.

193
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:12,212
I never looked at someone
and just said, "Okay, I'll take you."

194
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,483
You can still connect with people.

195
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,449
No, I can't.

196
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:25,812
It's too late.

197
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,007
Listen...

198
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,004
I'm gonna make a commitment to you.

199
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:38,723
I am hereby committing
to come and see you every day, without fail.

200
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,883
You don't have to come
and see me every day.

201
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,486
No, I want to.

202
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:48,131
- Whatever.
- All right, until tomorrow, then.

203
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,404
You want me to bring you anything?
Magazines?

204
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,482
No.

205
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,446
May I help you?

206
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,967
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I'm David Fisher.

207
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:16,125
Andrew Perez. I understand
my mother's funeral is to be held here.

208
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,807
- Yes, of course. I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

209
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,202
- Could we go over the arrangements?
- Of course.

210
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:25,252
Let me just get my associate. He helped
your mother with her pre-need contract.

211
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,402
Fine.

212
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,563
I was a personal friend of your mother's.

213
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:33,929
My family and I lived across the street
from her for many, many years.

214
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,332
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,168
Hello?

216
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,362
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you...

217
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:47,805
I'm, say, about a 55-minute drive
from Mission Viejo.

218
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,124
Where's that course
you and Jim played last winter?

219
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:54,369
Hold on. You got a pen?

220
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,252
Yeah, got it.

221
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,331
Yeah, thank you so much.

222
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:09,122
It was her time. She lived a full life.
Okay, you take care.

223
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:15,046
I'm an orthopedic surgeon,
and every May, we do a tournament.

224
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,567
Your mother was very proud of you.

225
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,807
She always said,
"My Andresito's a surgeon."

226
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:22,963
She was a wonderful woman...

227
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,809
and I'd like to give her
a top-of-the-line funeral.

228
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,125
I like this one.

229
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,008
- Is it real mahogany?
- Yes, it is.

230
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,563
Your mother already chose a casket, sir.
It's in her pre-need.

231
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:37,086
She liked this one.

232
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:42,410
I'd like to give her something nicer.

233
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,643
Yes, well, she liked this one.

234
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:49,362
This looks like some kind of gangbanger,
low rider, I don't know what.

235
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:52,331
She chose this one
because she was living on a fixed income.

236
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,688
I have money, and I want to change it.

237
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,083
She liked this one,
and this is the one that she should have.

238
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,568
I'm offering your business more money.

239
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:09,646
Your associate has some kind of
conflict of interest that I don't understand.

240
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,406
I only want to give my mother the best.

241
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:15,564
I appreciate your concern, Mr. Perez...

242
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:18,850
and I'd be happy
to upgrade your mother's casket.

243
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:23,483
But legally,
we're required to fulfill her wishes.

244
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:31,609
I don't know what kind of
piece-of-shit operation you're running here.

245
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,206
I really don't.

246
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:36,171
I'm trying to do something nice
for my mother...

247
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:39,211
and you just won't get out
of my fucking way.

248
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,688
I'm going to go make a salad.

249
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,322
If you weren't legally bound to follow
Mrs. Perez's instructions, would you...

250
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:02,531
To be perfectly honest,
I'm not entirely sure we are legally bound.

251
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,967
All right, that should be everything.

252
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:19,809
Now, I will contact you as soon as I know
if we'll be able to do a viewing, okay?

253
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,851
No one should have to see him this way,
not even my mother.

254
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,447
My son is the one
who saw everything happen.

255
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,925
It was raining, and I had told my dad...

256
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:31,727
- that it was too slippery on the roof...
- Of the house.

257
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:34,327
My husband was fixing the roof himself.

258
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,529
But he went up there anyway.

259
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,806
You're gonna freak when you see him.
I saw him.

260
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,526
I'll be okay.

261
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,886
I turned him over, and I looked at him.

262
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:53,243
I know you're not supposed to touch them
because it might be a back injury and all.

263
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,642
And my mother started yelling
not to touch him.

264
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,928
I thought it might be a back injury.

265
00:19:58,053 --> 00:19:59,964
But I turned him over.

266
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:06,488
You see, he fell face first into the pile
of bricks on the side of the house...

267
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,371
so, I saw him.

268
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,572
It's okay.

269
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:34,491
- What are you looking for?
- Anything that seems too funny.

270
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:36,770
Funny ha-ha or funny gay?

271
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,526
What about this?
You think I should put this away?

272
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,728
What is it?

273
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,963
<i>Esquire's Things A Man Should Know</i>
<i>About Style.</i>

274
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:47,205
Please. A book about fashion has to be gay?
Stop being such a bigot.

275
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:50,526
<i>Spy Kids, Shadow, Shadow 2...</i>

276
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,728
Here, Taylor.

277
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,682
- Put this away.
<i>- The Wiz?</i> You're kidding.

278
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:59,048
- It's a gay video.
- It's a kid's video.

279
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:02,644
Diana Ross and Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson's a scarecrow.

280
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,803
It's not like they'll not know that we're gay.

281
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:08,044
- We're two men living together.
- I don't want to seem too gay.

282
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,725
Or like we're trying to make her gay.

283
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:13,169
Right. Watching <i>The Wiz</i>
will turn her into a lesbian.

284
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,052
Don't be so naive.
That's the way these people think.

285
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:19,364
You ought to worry about it
making her want to have plastic surgery.

286
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:20,932
Y'all are crazy.

287
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,765
- Okay, now what about this?
- Okay, that's pretty gay.

288
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:33,565
So, thank you for hooking me up
with LAC-Arts.

289
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:35,450
I finally went and visited.

290
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,928
And actually, it was amazing.

291
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,605
Not just the facilities, I mean,
which were unbelievable.

292
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,888
They had this whole giant, like, kiln wing.

293
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:45,486
- What wing?
- Kiln.

294
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:49,967
But there were these,
I don't know, not cool people...

295
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:52,283
because they're not like the posers here...

296
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:55,410
- but the people there...
- How large is the student body?

297
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:57,366
I don't know.

298
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:02,288
But I just did my whole application thing.

299
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:04,648
And I just...

300
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:09,281
You just what?

301
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:11,921
I want this.

302
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,729
I really want to go there.

303
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,649
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

304
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,329
Actually, I do need to get
three letters of recommendation.

305
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:30,167
I'll be happy to write you one.
It just may take me a couple days.

306
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:33,531
No, I mean, they have to be
from, like, successful artists...

307
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,366
so I was wondering
if maybe you knew anybody who...

308
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,522
No.

309
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,722
I don't know those kind of people.

310
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:48,605
Is it your birthday or something?

311
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:53,323
Just going-away gifts from some of the kids
I've worked with over the past few years.

312
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,168
- Where are you going?
- Cutbacks.

313
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:00,211
Just one counselor
is going to serve the district.

314
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,763
Not me. Some other guy
who's been in the system longer.

315
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,246
- I can't believe they...
- Wanna get rid of me?

316
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,693
I think it was time to move on anyway.

317
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:23,885
I'm sure we'll find each other
at graduation, right?

318
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:33,851
No, of course.
Thanks for getting back to me.

319
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,851
Yeah, I do. Okay.

320
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,047
No, sorry, I don't know where that is.

321
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,085
How do I get there?

322
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:54,725
"Last thing at night
before I fall asleep: Love.

323
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,965
"First thing after sunrise: Love.

324
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:02,768
"I was born searching for you.

325
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:06,768
"And when I go into the darkness
of my final goodbye...

326
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,563
"it will be with you, love."

327
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,444
Well, what do you think?

328
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,893
Shouldn't you and Dad
be writing your vows together?

329
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:20,692
No, we're going to surprise each other.

330
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,488
He's at Esalen doing some rituals
to cleanse his boy energy.

331
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:29,725
I know he's going to be naughty and get
Ram Dass to help him write his speech.

332
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:33,442
I still don't understand why you have
to have another commitment ceremony.

333
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:36,286
Can't you just go to Hawaii?
Leave the rest of us out of it?

334
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:41,003
It's about understanding that we have a lot
of work to do, but we need to do it together.

335
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,766
Honey, do you know what a soul twin is?

336
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:47,289
Soul mates aren't enough?
I have to have a "soul twin" now?

337
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:49,967
Great, more fucking propaganda.

338
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:54,690
Brenda, soul twin only means...

339
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,650
that your father and I made an agreement
in another world...

340
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:02,203
to meet again in this world
and walk through it together.

341
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,922
And so now, we have to stop walking
alongside one another...

342
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:10,245
and turn and face each other,
and move through the world face to face.

343
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,722
But how will you see where you're going?

344
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:17,329
You know, all this sarcasm
only impedes your <i>prana.</i>

345
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:21,372
What's with all the New Age shit?
You and Dad dropping acid again?

346
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,250
Not at all, darling.

347
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:25,882
Something wonderful has happened.

348
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:30,650
After a lifetime of being blocked,
I've finally discovered my spirituality.

349
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:34,164
Great. Someone
who's completely not in touch with herself...

350
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:38,405
now has a whole new vocabulary
to not be in touch with herself with.

351
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:42,413
I don't know why you have to be so cynical.

352
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,211
It's just fear.

353
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,246
You and Nate have that thing, don't you?

354
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,450
I call it "the magnet."

355
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:58,488
Baby?

356
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:04,521
Brenda, I want to give you
a little piece of advice.

357
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:08,606
If you don't have that feeling, get out.

358
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,530
- Now.
- Of course we have that.

359
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:14,162
You think you're the only ones to have that?
God, the ego.

360
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,881
$149,000.

361
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:28,643
- A what? A hundred what?
- $149,000.

362
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:31,930
- And she left it to us?
- Yes, she did.

363
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,971
Which I'm gathering
is somewhat of a surprise to you?

364
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:37,603
Yeah, somewhat.

365
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,969
I love when this happens.
It's the fun part of being a trust attorney.

366
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:45,126
I have a couple of forms for you to sign
before you can collect your inheritance.

367
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:47,010
I'll be just a moment.

368
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,931
Oh, my God.

369
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,443
$149,000, babe!

370
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:57,450
That's like $150,000.

371
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,967
Jeez, all I did
was clean her gutters sometimes.

372
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,602
And all I did was give you some <i>pasteles</i>
to bring to her.

373
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:07,129
- Why would she leave all of this to us?
- I don't know.

374
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:09,329
You know, you went and saw her.

375
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,529
She counted on you
more than you even thought.

376
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:14,081
No. You, too. Okay?

377
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:17,848
This money is for both of us.
You're the one who made her the <i>pasteles.</i>

378
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,049
If I only knew
she'd leave us all this money...

379
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,330
I would have made her some <i>alcapurrias</i>
or something.

380
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:06,483
I read about a bike trip
where you tour the countryside of Vietnam.

381
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:08,131
It's in 2003.

382
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:12,688
In 2003, how you know where
we're going to be? How you know this?

383
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:15,571
That's right. We very well might be dead.

384
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,529
We're all going to die sooner than we'd like.

385
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,968
Maybe we should do some nice things
before we die...

386
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:23,772
like bicycle through Vietnam.
We could save up for it.

387
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:26,765
It would give us something
to look forward to.

388
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,771
<i>- Two for</i> Murder by Numbers.
<i>- No, I don't like it.</i>

389
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,529
<i>- Is Sandra Bullock. Is a girl's movie.</i>
<i>- I thought we agreed.</i>

390
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:51,969
<i>I see</i> Blade II.
<i>You go ahead and see the girl's movie.</i>

391
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:53,611
<i>Why did we even come together if...</i>

392
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:57,129
<i>We go to two different movies.</i>
<i>We get together later to eat.</i>

393
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:00,842
<i>One for</i> Blade II <i>and one for</i>
Murdering by the Numbers.

394
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,811
- All right. Here's your tickets.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

395
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:05,842
Next in line.

396
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,049
I'll meet you right here at <i>7</i>:40.

397
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,772
- Then we'll have a nice supper.
- Okay.

398
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,126
<i>In your eyes, I see myself.</i>

399
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,763
My copious imperfections...

400
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:31,010
as well as the tattered shreds of my divinity.

401
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,768
All the joy I've brought you
and the pain I've caused...

402
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:41,044
and still you hold me in your gaze,
undaunted by what love demands of us.

403
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,291
You give me strength to see you...

404
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:49,489
only you, now and forever...

405
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,045
and I'm blessed.

406
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:56,121
And so, in the name of the four elements...

407
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,807
and of the God Lingam
and the Goddess Yoni...

408
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:02,442
I now pronounce you,
Margaret and Bern Chenowith...

409
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,206
newly wed.

410
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:25,364
So what's your favorite part
about fourth grade?

411
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,042
Math is fun.

412
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:29,088
Really?

413
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:32,808
And recess.

414
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:39,522
- She's good at so much.
- Yeah, she sure is.

415
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:45,243
So, would you say
you two have a parenting style?

416
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,970
We've been reading a lot
about the whole-child theory.

417
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:55,292
Although we definitely like
to mix in a little common sense.

418
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:56,808
How so?

419
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:02,282
We certainly believe in setting limits,
but we try not to be too rigid.

420
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,127
I think that should just about do it.

421
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:16,411
Thank you for coming, Mr. Sherman, sir.

422
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:21,011
I'll need to have a conversation with your
supervisors about your work and so forth.

423
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:24,244
I'm my own supervisor.
I'm a business owner.

424
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,404
And, as my supervisor, I'd like to say...

425
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,247
that David Fisher is a great person,
and great to work with.

426
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,209
My supervisor is Sgt. Potts,
Northeast Division.

427
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:39,249
I'll phone him tomorrow.

428
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,485
I'll let myself out.

429
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,766
- Where'd you get your coffee table?
- Restoration Hardware.

430
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:53,846
God, don't you just love that store?
I swear, I could live there.

431
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,052
Okay, bye.

432
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:04,004
That man was totally gay.

433
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,728
<i>That's an interesting theory.</i>

434
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,369
<i>I can't admit to something I didn't do.</i>

435
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,603
<i>Looks like you won't have to.</i>

436
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,369
<i>Justin's talking in there.</i>

437
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:19,526
<i>Justin's here?</i>

438
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,972
Nikolai?

439
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,491
Please excuse me.

440
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:34,567
Nikolai, you don't really love me.
I know that.

441
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,847
You're staying with me...

442
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:39,164
because you feel obligated to,
and that's not fair to either of us.

443
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:42,245
So I'm breaking up with you
right now, okay?

444
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:46,211
Well, okay.

445
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:01,007
- I'm so sorry, please excuse me.
- Christ, lady.

446
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,332
<i>Which Lisa?</i>

447
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,045
<i>So you really need to tell me</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

448
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:26,763
<i>Just think of it as a game.</i>

449
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,889
<i>Whoever talks first is the winner.</i>

450
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,525
So you're next?

451
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:38,444
Yeah, I guess so.

452
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:44,328
- So, wasn't that ceremony unbelievably...
- Pitiful? Pathetic?

453
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,847
Or maybe a word
that hasn't been invented yet.

454
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:50,403
- Vomitrocious. Is that a word?
- I was gonna say sweet.

455
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,723
- I thought it was sweet.
- You're joking.

456
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:55,485
I kind of bought it.

457
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,968
I mean, look at the two of them.

458
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,412
- Who else would have either one of them?
- Well, yeah.

459
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:03,211
And they recognize that.

460
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,251
For better or worse, they accept each other.

461
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:07,806
For better or for worse.

462
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:10,726
By worse, do you mean all the people
they randomly fucked...

463
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:11,882
Stop.

464
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,168
Please.

465
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:18,243
They're our parents, Bren.

466
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:22,923
It can't be good for us
to talk about Mom and Dad like that.

467
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:26,327
- I crossed the line?
- It's the way we've always been.

468
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,768
It's our family ethos.
I understand why you go there.

469
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:31,367
But I don't want to talk that way anymore.

470
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,013
I don't think
we have to perpetuate the negativity.

471
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,129
God, what happened to you?

472
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:43,762
Can't we just celebrate?
This is a celebration, right?

473
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,646
Yeah, whoopee.

474
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,450
Your vows were really, really moving.

475
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:55,650
I hope my ceremony with Brenda
can be that heartfelt.

476
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,685
What we have now...

477
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,407
is based on real honesty.

478
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,165
And forgiveness.

479
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:08,008
That woman sees me. Always has.

480
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:12,086
- She knew you were with another woman...
- Many, many other women.

481
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:15,004
- Past tense.
- Wow.

482
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,643
And she not only dealt with the jealousy...

483
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:22,009
- but she even renewed your vows with you.
- Her idea.

484
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:26,090
So I sold the house, moved in.

485
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:30,246
I say, if life offers you a new beginning,
take it.

486
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:36,205
Thank God, you know.

487
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:43,648
I can't believe
I fell into that mid-life crisis trap.

488
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:48,088
God, what a fool a man will make of himself
for some new pussy, huh?

489
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:52,572
To growing up.

490
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,165
She forgave me.

491
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:58,925
Thank God, you know.

492
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:15,405
Are we even moving?

493
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,728
You forgot to push the button.

494
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:43,204
"The manner in which she opens her heart
to a moment of visual truth inspires me.

495
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:45,450

00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:54,610
"it is with great pleasure that
I highly recommend her for your program."

499
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,486
Thank you.

500
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:01,050
- You made up a lot of really cool shit.
- All true.

501
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:04,729
I still need to get two more letters.

502
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:08,647
This guy who works in my Trader Joe's
had one of his collages in a show at MOCA.

503
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:12,169
- I could ask him to write a letter.
- Cool, that would be great.

504
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:16,804
When I went to visit my Aunt Sarah,
I met this painter, Fiona Kleinschmidt.

505
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:20,089
- You've heard of her?
- Sure, she's huge.

506
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:21,731
- Really?
- Yeah.

507
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,690
I think she had sex with my brother
when he was, like, 15.

508
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,646
- Devirginized him, even.
- Use it.

509
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,251
- This one is really hot.
- Yeah.

510
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,210
You're looking at me weird.

511
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:49,202
What?

512
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:52,806
You are so...

513
00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:57,810
That I just wanna reach over and...

514
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:03,208
But I also want to do nothing...

515
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:07,764
because I wanna make sure I know you
for as long as I can without fucking it up...

516
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:11,085
which is, like, my special superpower.

517
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:15,488
That's why I don't want to touch you.

518
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,324
That's verbatim, moment for moment...

519
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,962
what I was thinking when I was looking
at you with the weirdness.

520
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:28,043
I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.

521
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:37,092
You'll never be able to see yourself
the way other people see you.

522
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:40,046
The way I see you. Which is a shame.

523
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:42,811
Because you are...

524
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:47,209
I really think
you have no idea how beautiful you are.

525
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:57,403
You got a double of this one.
Mind if I snag it?

526
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:00,692
It's fine.

527
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,486
I should go.

528
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,648
He's ready.

529
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,492
Who the fuck are you...

530
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,292
and how did you convince my mother
to leave you her savings?

531
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:34,329
I didn't convince your mother of anything.

532
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:38,008
That was my money she left you.
I sent her $2,500 a month.

533
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:41,644
And my attorneys have counseled me
that this is highly suspect.

534
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,850
She left you everything,
and yet I have no idea who you are.

535
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,766
You don't know who I am
because you didn't speak to her often.

536
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:50,686
- I called her every other Sunday, my friend.
- Yeah, I know.

537
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:53,606
We invited her to a barbecue
and she said she couldn't come...

538
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:56,765
because there was a chance
her Andresito might call.

539
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,411
Yeah, a chance.

540
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,925
Listen. You know,
I'm as surprised as you are.

541
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:07,287
Okay, I am as surprised as you are.

542
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:14,365
- You're sure everything's okay, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

543
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:17,570
Thank you, you people can leave now.
We're fine.

544
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:19,886
You're sure?

545
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,725
They just came in!

546
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:32,333
You didn't walk into my house
without a search warrant.

547
00:41:32,413 --> 00:41:34,973
- No, I did.
- This is bullshit. You can't do this.

548
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:37,169
It's the law
that we can enter your residence...

549
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:39,972
to investigate a domestic abuse call, okay?
Calm down.

550
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:41,566
We want to talk to the both of you.

551
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:44,850
I know the law. I know you can't come here
without a search warrant.

552
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:48,289
- Is your name on the lease, sir?
- Is that any of your business?

553
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,489
- You need to back up.
- This is my fucking house.

554
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,245
I'm warning you. You need to back up.

555
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,882
You can warn me all the fuck you want
'cause I know what my rights are.

556
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,565
Stop it.

557
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,688
Let go of him! Oh, my God.

558
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,325
Calm down.

559
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,525
Keith, easy.

560
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,570
Let him go. Come on.

561
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,166
It's over, all right?

562
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:14,763
What did you do?

563
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:38,207
She gave them to me when I was a boy.

564
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,083
It's nice that you kept them.

565
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:49,171
I haven't been to Mass in over two years.

566
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,650
These are my two boys.

567
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,367
This is Augusto and this is Julio.

568
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,684
They called her <i>abuelita.</i>

569
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,082
- Need some help?
- Sure, kiddo.

570
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:07,447
Thank you.

571
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:09,292
Thank you...

572
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:13,768
- for how you fixed up my father.
- Glad I could do it.

573
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:18,489
I lost my father a few years back.

574
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,767
- Really?
- Yeah.

575
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:22,970
The worst thing is how it comes up on you.
From nothing.

576
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:26,602
When my dad died, I still had
baseball tickets I bought while he was alive.

577
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:29,253
And, you know, when we all thought:

578
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:31,802
"Of course he'll be around next Sunday."

579
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:35,567
Yeah, we never really went to games.

580
00:44:42,373 --> 00:44:46,525
Mr. Fisher, you know,
if you ever need any help around here...

581
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:50,208
like cutting the grass
or like a part-time job...

582
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:53,683
- I'd be more than happy.
- I'll keep that in mind.

583
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:01,083
- Bye, Mr. Fisher. Thanks.
- Okay.

584
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:19,648
There was a person at both ATMs,
so I started my own line in between them.

585
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:22,964
Then this woman comes and starts
her own line behind one of the ATMs.

586
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,931
I said, "I already started a line."
So, she goes...

587
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:28,683
- She goes what?
- She goes...

588
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:33,845
Bren, you know him?

589
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:38,884
- Oh, God, I think I've seen him around.
- What's up?

590
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:41,121
- Kyle.
- Nate.

591
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:44,485
Never caught your name.

592
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:46,325
- Brenda.
- Right.

593
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,571
This is the kind kind.

594
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:01,003
Both my connections totally dried up.

595
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,812
One of them got arrested,
and the other I had to blow off...

596
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:08,762
'cause he was an actor and made me go to
his one-man shows if I wanted to buy a bag.

597
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,889
Fucking beauteous day, huh?

598
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:14,488
Warm.

599
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:17,287
I'm actually getting burnt.
I'm gonna go inside.

600
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:18,692
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- All right.

601
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:21,526
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you, too, bro.

602
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:25,003
Good to see you again, Brenda.

603
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,002
What?

604
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:50,930
- Turn it on.
- Nate, please, come on.

605
00:46:51,013 --> 00:46:52,332
Turn it on!

606
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:57,765
Fiction, my ass. Everything you've written,
you've actually done?

607
00:46:57,853 --> 00:46:58,968
- No.
- All right, then.

608
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:01,044
Read this aloud, and tell me what's true.

609
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,169
- It's my writing, it's private.
- I don't care.

610
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,323
You can't be private anymore.
Tell me the truth.

611
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,608
Give it to me.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

612
00:47:07,693 --> 00:47:10,844
Who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you?

613
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:16,373
You know who I am, Nate.
I'm the woman that fucked you...

614
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:19,889
in the closet of an airport
a couple of hours after I met you.

615
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:22,248
That's who I was the day we met.

616
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:26,886
- You really fucked two guys?
- You had sex with two women once.

617
00:47:26,973 --> 00:47:28,531
Not when I was engaged to you.

618
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:31,332
You only had sex with one woman
when you were engaged to me.

619
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,448
Without a condom.

620
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:35,411
Where'd you fuck them?
Did you fuck them in our bed?

621
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,803
Why didn't you break up with me?
Jesus Christ.

622
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:40,453
I don't know. I don't know why I did it.

623
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:42,683
I fucking wish to God I did.

624
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:50,765
Did you fuck your brother?

625
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:52,809
- Right, go there.
- Why not go there? Did you?

626
00:47:52,893 --> 00:47:54,804
Did you fuck the rabbi?
I know you wanted to.

627
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:56,724
- No.
- I'll bet it was because she wouldn't.

628
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:59,122
Just for the record,
you did it in Seattle before...

629
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,522
I was scared to death.
I just had a fucking seizure!

630
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:04,525
You wouldn't have told me about it
if you weren't forced to.

631
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:06,251
You know what? I felt safe with her...

632
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,893
which, frankly, is something
I have never felt with you.

633
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,203
- You felt safe with her?
- Yeah.

634
00:48:11,493 --> 00:48:14,053
Yeah, because you were leaving
the next day.

635
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:17,366
- Oh, God.
- Nate, you created a human being.

636
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,762
There'll be another person
on this planet now...

637
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:23,004
a person who might have
a totally miserable fucking life...

638
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:24,924
and curse the fucking day she was born...

639
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:28,767
because you are walking out on her
the same way you'll walk out on me.

640
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:31,572
Life doesn't have to be miserable
just because you are.

641
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:35,407
I know, weird shit happened to you.
You know what? It happened to all of us.

642
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:37,688
I'm sick to death of you
using it as an excuse...

643
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:40,128
to act like some fucking cunt from hell.

644
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:48,362
- How long have you hated me like this?
- I don't need to hate you.

645
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:51,850
You do a pretty damn good job
of hating yourself.

646
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:54,644
You picked me, you know?

647
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,609
Yeah? Only because I had no idea
how fucked up you really are.

648
00:48:58,693 --> 00:48:59,728
That's bullshit.

649
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:02,964
You knew and loved it, because
it made you feel good about yourself.

650
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:05,123
Oh, God, you are so full of shit.

651
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:08,444
You just can't see it,
because you're so in love with the idea...

652
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,330
of Nate, the good guy, Nate, the hero...

653
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:13,610
Nate, the fucking saint
with the fucking great haircut.

654
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:16,605
The truth is, you'd run from real love
if it ever came at you...

655
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:19,810
Real love?
What the fuck do you know about real love?

656
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:23,363
...and the neediness and the ugliness
and the responsibility.

657
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:26,365
You would fucking run and you know it.

658
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:31,081
The only reason you stayed with me
is because I was never really here.

659
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,403
You know what?
Take your ugly fucking ring.

660
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:41,610
Don't you throw that ring at me.
That's such a fucking clich.

661
00:49:41,693 --> 00:49:43,046
I'll fucking barf.

662
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,252
There, barf.

663
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,124
- Hello?
<i>- Is Nate there?</i>

664
00:50:25,493 --> 00:50:26,687
I'm afraid he's not.

665
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:29,286
Is this Mrs. Fisher?

666
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:32,365
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Hi, this is Lisa.</i>

667
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:35,611
<i>- Lisa Kimmel, from Seattle.</i>
- Why, hello, dear.

668
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:39,812
I'm so sorry I didn't get a chance
to speak to you when Mr. Fisher died.

669
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:42,805
- You were very much in my thoughts.
<i>- Aren't you sweet.</i>

670
00:50:42,893 --> 00:50:47,125
What a surprise to hear from you.
How is everything in Seattle?

671
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,884
- Nate hasn't told you what's going on?
<i>- He hasn't told me anything.</i>

672
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:54,646
No one ever tells me anything.
It's part of being old.

673
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:58,170
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. Now,
and you're a grandmother.

674
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,972
- No, dear, I'm afraid I'm not.
<i>- You are.</i>

675
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:03,687
<i>I just had a baby. Nate's baby.</i>

676
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:05,728
<i>It's a girl.</i>

677
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,969
She was a couple of weeks early.

678
00:51:08,653 --> 00:51:10,291
I named her Maya.

679
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,652
Told you I'd be here every day, didn't I?

680
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:08,005
You'll never believe this.
I just got a phone call from Stan.

681
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:10,323
Kroehner is filing for Chapter 11.

682
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:13,805
<i>And there's</i>
<i>a federal investigation underway.</i>

683
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:16,885
<i>- Isn't that great?</i>
- Yeah, that's great.

684
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,723
<i>I guess the good guys</i>
<i>actually do win sometimes.</i>

685
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:24,411
<i>Hold on, I got another call coming in.</i>

686
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:29,892
Hey, baby.

687
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:33,082
Listen, I'm not gonna be home for a while.

688
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:37,246
- You want me to hold dinner?
<i>- No, you and Taylor go ahead and eat.</i>

689
00:52:37,973 --> 00:52:39,167
What's wrong?

690
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:45,610
I'll tell you about it later, when I get home.
