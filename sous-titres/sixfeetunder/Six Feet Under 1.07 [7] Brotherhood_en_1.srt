1
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:51,332
Hi, Mom. And Paul and Patricia.

2
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,652
Well, I'm here.

3
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,687
It's not exactly the Holiday Inn,
as you can see.

4
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:03,451
Mostly... Mostly we're filling sandbags
and cleaning vehicle filters.

5
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:06,454
In this war, it's important
to keep the mechanisms clean...

6
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:09,489
...because of all the sand,
which can be as much of a threat...

7
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:15,488
...as any missile that Saddam can send,
Capt. Sommers says.

8
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:19,407
I can't say much, but pretty soon
we're gonna get into the real action...

9
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,895
...and we're well-prepared, I'll tell you.

10
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,052
Guys, can you...? Do you mind?
I'm sending this home to my folks.

11
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,138
I'll be done in a minute! Just...
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,938
What else?

13
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,729
We're protecting your ass, folks!

14
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,296
I love you, America. Thank you!

15
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,254
Bailey, come on, I'm just...

16
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,580
- You want to say hello to Victor's folks?
- Hi, Mom!

17
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,818
Come on, you guys, damn it!

18
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:50,618
Sorry, Mom,

19
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:55,739
Some of these guys are kind of crazy,
They're good soldiers,

20
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,662
I'm getting a lot of responsibility here,

21
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:03,700
I think it's been very beneficial, in terms
of personal leadership skills,,,

22
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,819
,,, and getting a job,
A lot more than had I stayed at home,

23
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:10,225
Well, I've got a lot to do before
lights out, so until next time,,,

24
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:14,137
,,, this is Pvt, 1st Class
Victor Kovitch signing off,

25
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:17,819
Hey, buddy,
brought you the latest South Park,

26
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:44,424
Fuck, David.

27
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,547
Hey, sleepyhead.

28
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,514
You know, I had the weirdest dream.

29
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:57,509
This guy comes into my house
at, like, 4 a.m.

31
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:02,553
He climbs into my bed,
but instead of having his way with me...

32
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,271
...he just passes out!

33
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:08,028
And all night long, he keeps jerking.

34
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,068
That is weird.

35
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,989
- And he talked in his sleep.
- Yeah, what did he say?

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,989
It was completely unintelligible,
but angry.

37
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:22,717
- There was even teeth-grinding.
- Well, that explains the headaches.

38
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:26,915
I was thinking that exposure
to formaldehyde gives me a brain tumor.

39
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:29,114
Would you like some caffeine
with that tumor?

40
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:31,041
Okay.

41
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:37,078
- David, I can't.
- Why not?

42
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:41,676
Because last night, I drove Mr. Senopolis'
body to San Jose, then straight back.

43
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,036
I barely got four hours' sleep,
and frankly...

44
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,714
...I'm tired of getting the shitty jobs
you don't want.

45
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,317
- I'm half-owner of the business,
- You can't legally do intake without me.

46
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,404
You're not a licensed funeral director.

47
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,486
- I'm getting my license next month,
- lf you pass the test.

48
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,286
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

49
00:04:57,488 --> 00:05:00,208
How am I supposed to study
for that test on four hours' sleep?

50
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,047
Coffee and diet pills worked for me.

51
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,444
I can 't pick her up,
I've got a deacon 's meeting,,,

52
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,409
...and Rico's got Vanessa's ultrasound.
- Shit,

53
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,959
Last time I picked somebody up
at a nursing home...

54
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,810
...nobody told the roommate
she was dead. I had to.

55
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,047
Just be thankful we've got the business.

56
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,646
Just thankful I'm not you.

57
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:28,046
What?

58
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:33,009
Oh, it's Mr. Senopolis, sorry.

59
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,527
Fuck, I smell like a dead guy!

60
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,206
No, you smell fine. Your life stinks,
you complain all the time...

61
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,646
...and that's really dull.

62
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:46,847
- Didn't realize I was boring you.
- Nate, you need to take a break.

63
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:51,256
Some major stress release that's not me.
It's too much responsibility.

64
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,337
I thought you liked being
an undertaker's girlfriend.

65
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:00,172
Is that what I am to you?
Your girlfriend?

66
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,331
I like to think of you as my mistress.

67
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,932
Well, then, you better start
buying me a lot more shit, mister.

68
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,291
God, I love you.

69
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:14,258
Okay.

70
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:16,419
I said it. Let's just move on.

71
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:20,058
Let's go to Two Bunch Palms
this weekend.

72
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,492
- What?
- Fuck it, yes.

73
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,094
I'm gonna take the weekend off,
and David can bite me.

74
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,656
- This weekend?
- Yeah, we'll sit in hot mud...

75
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:30,302
...we'll get massages,
we'll eat like pigs, we'll drink a lot.

76
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,179
If we leave Friday night,
we can be naked for two whole days.

77
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:37,903
- I got three clients this Saturday.
- Well, postpone, cancel, lie.

78
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:42,499
Come on, we've never taken
a trip together. We need to do this.

79
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,585
Two whole days?

80
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,498
- What if we drive each other crazy?
- Well, we don't.

81
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:58,343
Hovering.

82
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:11,943
Claire, I've invited a friend of mine
over for dinner tonight.

83
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:15,942
- Okay.
- And I want you to be nice to him.

84
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,510
Is this the guy?

85
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,585
- The guy that...?
- Yes.

86
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,513
Okay.

87
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,350
Thanks for your patience, everybody.
I know we're running late.

88
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:41,518
By the way, I spoke to Father Clark
this morning. He's holding up well.

89
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,871
He says you folks are the most thorough
search committee...

90
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,719
...he has ever encountered.

91
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,521
David, I understand you're the last one
to meet with him.

92
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,439
- This afternoon.
- Good.

93
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:57,078
We've been interviewing
associate priests for three months.

94
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,001
It'll be nice to have an open mind.

95
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:04,517
Clark struck me as a player, man of God,
wants to listen, but there's ego there.

96
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,123
You didn't want Jack.

97
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,043
Connie, you say that so easily,
and you know it's not true.

98
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,758
I've never seen you so desperate.

99
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:14,037
Listen, you folks have to represent
the whole congregation.

100
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,202
And believe me, if Clark's not right...

101
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:19,523
...I'm ready to start from the beginning.
- Let's vote right now.

102
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:23,640
You know him, David. He's been
a visiting rector. You've got his r'esum'e.

103
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:27,363
All the deacons are here. You can vote
now. I'll be happy to leave the room.

104
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,838
No, I want to meet
with Father Clark myself...

105
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:32,284
...so I can make
the most informed decision.

106
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,487
This how it works? You bring in
the new-generation deacon...

107
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,204
...the new deacon brings in
the radical priest you want?

108
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,803
I can assure you there's
no agenda here, Mr. Kriegenthaler.

109
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,410
Except yours.

110
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:47,321
Don't worry, Dave. I had a parish
in Ohio where punches got thrown.

111
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:51,127
Steelworkers.
St. Bart's doesn't even come close.

112
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:55,452
Actually, David,
your father was against Jack here.

113
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:59,613
And as I said at the time,
your father was wrong.

114
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:02,089
Roll over,

115
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,327
Okay, okay.

116
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,289
There you go, there you go.

117
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,935
Shit! Fuck, Billy!

118
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:25,256
- Fuck you!
- I've seen pictures on the Internet, but...

119
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,497
The rule is, you call before
you come over, okay?

120
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,897
Sorry, I was biking down the boardwalk.
I didn't have my cell phone.

121
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,898
Good morning, Nate.

122
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:35,649
Bill.

123
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:39,930
I got some great shots of these hookers
on Sunset I want to show you.

124
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:43,817
Real human tragedy shit.
I think they're really good.

125
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,580
Well, your mom walked in on us once...

126
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:57,253
...so I guess we're even.

127
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,779
This chick has seen
the fucking worst life has to offer.

128
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,980
- Jesus, Billy, these are incredible.
- And what is that thing on her neck?

129
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,940
She's got, like, this big tumor,
and she's still turning tricks.

130
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:13,266
And you just know there is some freak
for whom that is a big turn-on.

131
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,029
I love the Bank of America
in the background.

132
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,778
- Well, I have to go to work.
- Bring out your dead!

133
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,503
They're great.

134
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,986
Don't forget,
cancel those appointments on Saturday.

135
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,584
See you later.

136
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:38,701
So, what's Saturday?

137
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,745
We're going to California Cactus World
out on Rosemead Boulevard.

138
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:45,866
I want to get something really weird
to plant out back.

139
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:52,194
- Yo, Dave!
- In here!

140
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:57,193
I'm sorry, there was an accident
on the 405. Both cars totaled.

141
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,910
I should've handed out cards.

142
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:05,236
This is Paul Kovitch.
His brother, Victor, just passed away.

143
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,912
- I'm sorry.
- This is my brother, Nate.

144
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,910
Paul Kovitch,
you went to Bonaventure High.

145
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:14,078
- Yeah.
- I was there when you pinned that guy...

146
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,794
...and won the wrestling championship.
You were the man!

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,596
Me and my friends were jealous
because we knew you were getting laid.

148
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,832
- You wrestle?
- No, played baseball, but we always lost.

149
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:28,631
- So, what are you doing now?
- I run Kovitch Trucking up in Camarillo.

150
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,959
Why, so you know how expensive
you can be?

151
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,320
- No...
- Paul and I were just going over...

152
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,401
...the options for his brother's funeral.

153
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,243
Okay, I run a business too.
Let's just cut right to it.

154
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,675
- Of course.
- I buried both my parents...

155
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:43,718
...and, no offense,
but I hate you guys. I hate what you do.

156
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:46,679
The whole thing of "let's gather
and look at this plastic...

157
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,605
...dead version of our loved one."
It's really twisted.

158
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:53,117
I want Victor cremated.
No coffin.

159
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:56,604
Put him in one of those cardboard boxes
you charge 100 bucks for.

160
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll take him up to where
our mother's buried up in Tehachapi...

161
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:02,525
...and let his ashes blow away.

162
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:06,404
I see Victor's a veteran. If you like, we
can research benefits he might be due.

163
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,844
No, Vic hated the Army. Me and him
been fighting the Army for seven years.

164
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:18,441
His unit cleaned up a place
called Bunker 73 in the Iraqi desert.

165
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:22,201
Chemicals all over,
Saddam's stuff we blew up.

166
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,210
As soon as he came back, he got sick.

167
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:27,804
Lung cancer at the age of 29,
never smoked a day in his life.

168
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,404
Still, no one will say the words
"Gulf War Syndrome."

169
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:34,931
He just wasted away
in and out of that hospital.

170
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:42,808
So fuck the Army.
Let them keep their fucking money.

171
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,850
I gotta fly up to Idaho Falls
to tell my stepfather.

172
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,368
He's got Alzheimer's.
I don't know if he'll hear me or not.

173
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,251
You're absolutely sure
you wouldn't like the opportunity...

174
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,889
...to say goodbye to Victor before...?
- I already said goodbye.

175
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,327
Just do it.

176
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,498
And as for a receptacle
for his cremains...?

177
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,612
A paper sack ought to do just fine.

178
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:08,741
Nine hundred bucks.

179
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,259
Well, he obviously doesn't
know about the Poseidon Society...

180
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,094
...or that's 900 we'd be out of.

181
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,857
That guy was the shit
when I was in high school.

182
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,860
You know,
I never knew he had a brother.

183
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:22,579
It's time you introduced yourself.
He's at the VA Hospital.

184
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,939
First, I just gotta talk to you
about something.

185
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,700
It's out of the question. I cannot spare
you. We have three bodies right now.

186
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:32,056
Mr. Jacobsen's going
into the ground tomorrow...

187
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,456
...and Vic Kovitch
will be toast by the weekend.

188
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,296
What if we get another body? Or two?
We cannot afford to turn down business.

189
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,941
- No, I'm sorry.
- I don't need your permission.

190
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,821
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had two days off?

191
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:47,226
See, here's the difference.
You're willing to live like that, I'm not.

192
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,546
I've invited my friend Hiram Gunderson
over to dinner tonight.

193
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:52,263
You're welcome to join us.

194
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,984
Wouldn't a restaurant be better?
This is our home.

195
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,548
This is my home.

196
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:01,630
Oh, the camping guy. Okay.
Can I bring Brenda?

197
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:05,788
Hiram will be cooking.

198
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,311
He spent 17 years
as a top chef in Chicago.

199
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:13,473
The critic of the Sun-Times called him
the "father of the new rustic cuisine."

200
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:17,030
And then, he gave it all up
to become a hairdresser.

201
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:20,068
And he has never been happier!

202
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:31,075
You're multiplying differing variables,
so you have to simplify.

203
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:34,395
Okay, and then finally,
oops, look at that.

204
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:38,830
Same variable, okay?
Four and four gives us what?

205
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:43,396
Eight! And finally, these two binomials...

206
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,471
...right here, are exactly the same...

207
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,671
...so we what?

208
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,679
Combine!

209
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:55,591
Two X to the third,
Y to the fourth.

210
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay?

211
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,036
Any questions?

212
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:10,075
Claire Fisher.

213
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,279
What?

214
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,840
Can you explain this formula
to the class?

215
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,919
Not really.

216
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,515
Maybe if you paid attention
instead of reading.

217
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:23,561
Maybe if you talked about something
that was gonna be useful to me, I would.

218
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,201
Oh, algebra is useless?

219
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,763
I know a lot of physicists
who'd beg to differ.

220
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,363
Well, I don't want to be a physicist.

221
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,481
Algebra forces your mind
to solve problems logically.

222
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:38,922
- It's one of the only perfect sciences...
- You think the world runs on logic?

223
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,044
- Come on, open your eyes.
- I'll see you after class, Miss Fisher.

224
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,523
What are you doing?

225
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:01,052
All right, now let's try another one,
and I'm gonna make this a little tougher.

226
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:08,168
Okay, X to the A power
times Y to the B power.

227
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,604
Okay, now we've got two...

228
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,895
Of course we have catalogs
for wedding package...

229
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:22,932
...but you have to come in and look.
I can't show you over the phone.

230
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:27,053
Website? What website?
We don't have website.

231
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,651
Mister, you have to come into my shop
and look at my work.

232
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,972
Website.

233
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,729
- The day just gets brighter.
- Hush.

234
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:43,139
So who's dead now,
and what do you need?

235
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,176
Nobody's dead.
I came to return these vases.

236
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,017
You should recycle them,
save a little money.

237
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:51,897
So thoughtful. I am touched.

238
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,140
Don't be silly. It's wasteful, that's all.

239
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,022
Here.

240
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,218
- You still have that sign in the window.
- Yes, you know somebody good?

241
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:05,055
- I do. Me.
- You?

242
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:08,626
I am interested. Let's talk.
Robbie, I going to lunch.

243
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,343
I'm not going to lunch with you, Nikolai.
I'm seeing someone.

244
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:14,977
- So what? This is business.
- I hope so.

245
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:19,819
- Because otherwise, I withdraw my offer.
- Tell me, why I should hire you?

246
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,909
I've been working with people for
30 years, and I treat them with respect.

247
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,338
I respect people too.

248
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,105
You're pompous and arrogant
and you're full of yourself.

249
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:31,508
- You act like the customer needs you.
- Of course the customer needs me.

250
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:34,784
- I have what he wants.
- You'll never build a business that way.

251
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:37,142
I'm better with people
and I know about flowers.

252
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,071
If you don't think so,
you can fire me.

253
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:42,265
Fire you? How I can fire you?
You don't even work yet.

254
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:50,633
My parish in New Mexico,
I think they were afraid of me.

255
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:55,034
- They recommend you highly.
- They always do after I'm gone.

256
00:17:55,956 --> 00:18:00,314
I won't lie to you, David,
I'll push for some change at St. Bart's.

257
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:03,793
This is one of those congregations
that thinks sitting through church...

258
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:08,549
...absolves them of moral responsibility
and they can ignore the plight of others.

259
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:12,354
Don't get me wrong,
they're good people.

260
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,637
They're just lazy.

261
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,674
I don't think that's entirely fair, Clark.
We have a homeless outreach...

262
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,156
You know you're the swing vote.

263
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,911
I've been a deacon three weeks. I'm still
getting used to how political this is.

264
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,682
Religion is politics, David.

265
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:33,796
Jesus was a revolutionary.

266
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:36,802
He threatened those in power,
and they had him assassinated.

267
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,995
They'd do the same thing
to him today.

268
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:42,834
I'm not sure how much luck you'll
have getting St. Bart's to stage a coup.

269
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:46,282
The last thing that God
wants from us is complacency.

270
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,319
- You should be in the Peace Corps.
- Already done it.

271
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,120
Three years in Nicaragua,
fresh out of divinity school.

272
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,124
That's where I lost my wife.

273
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,004
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:05,000
The hardest part about my work
is the fact...

275
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:08,839
...that most people don't want
a real relationship with God.

276
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,564
Sure, they'll pray
to a man nailed to a cross...

277
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,047
...but they'll ignore the gay kid
who gets strung up...

278
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:17,606
...or the black man
who gets dragged behind a car...

279
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,928
...or someone's mother living in a box.

280
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:23,408
Were you this forthcoming
with the other deacons?

281
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,327
Hardly.

282
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,562
What did you and Walter Kriegenthaler
talk about?

283
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:31,605
Golf.

284
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:36,686
So why did you decide
to be so honest with me?

285
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,805
Because I can tell that right and wrong
actually matter to you.

286
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,132
Fuck.

287
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,736
This is medieval. We gotta get it fixed
before somebody loses a finger.

288
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,454
You never cared until it was your finger.

289
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,379
- Rico, a little help?
- Why should I?

290
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,051
You know, it's because of you I'm gonna
work double shifts this weekend.

291
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:13,093
That's just David being dramatic.

292
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,379
We'd have to get at least two new
bodies for that to be necessary.

293
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,973
They come in bigger numbers than that.

294
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,780
Just forget it. I know the score.

295
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:26,579
It's never gonna be
Fisher & Sons & Diaz. I know that.

296
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,574
- Let's see what we got.
- This one's a cremation.

297
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:34,176
- Nothing for you.
- Oh, fuck, what is that?

298
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:37,503
Shouldn't just burn people
like they're garbage.

299
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,419
What the...?

300
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,144
Look, it came with fries.

301
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,338
Look at this.

302
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,859
Doesn't even look like the same guy,
does it?

303
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:03,789
This says he applied to be buried
at the National Cemetery.

304
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,421
He signed requests
for a flag fold, military escort.

305
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,145
Oh, man.

306
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,709
Then you can't burn him.

307
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,948
I can make him look like that again.

308
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,231
Well, almost.

309
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:20,234
You could ace algebra, Claire,
and we both know it.

310
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,630
"Power rests on the kind
of knowledge one holds."

311
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,791
What's the use of knowing
something useless?

312
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:29,029
- Don't quote Castaneda at me.
- Why not? You quote Bob Dylan at me.

313
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:32,593
- You need algebra for college.
- You're assuming I'm going to college.

314
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:36,108
You're taking the PSAT tomorrow.
That means you're thinking about it.

315
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:39,867
Is that the only option? Go to college,
get a job, be a good consumer...

316
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:42,798
...until you drop dead of exhaustion.
I don't want that!

317
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,876
So, what do you want?

318
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,831
I just want something to matter.

319
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:56,550
Maybe I should wander around the desert
and eat peyote and see God.

320
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:59,475
Yeah, be a homeless drug addict.

321
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:02,193
You'd get bored with that pretty fast.

322
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:07,679
Hey, have you heard
of the Sierra Crossroads program?

323
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:09,954
What's that, like,
bungee jumping for Jesus?

324
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:15,080
No, no, it's not affiliated with any
religion. It's actually a great program.

325
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,520
I spent a couple of years there
as an instructor.

326
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,796
- I think you might really like it.
- Why?

327
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,238
Because it would get you out of yourself,
get you out of your head.

328
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:26,803
Now, I'll warn you,
it's hard but exhilarating.

329
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,317
It might give you the challenge
you're looking for.

330
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,405
There's an expedition over spring break.

331
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,964
I could pull some strings,
see if I could get you in.

332
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,684
- Why do you care what happens to me?
- Because I like you.

333
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,919
And I want to see good things
happen for you, and I know they can.

334
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:47,680
We had to dig his service records
out of St. Louis.

335
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:51,483
Then there's the question of whether
his cancer was service related.

336
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:54,206
That means finding a doctor
who thinks it was.

337
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:57,610
It took me four months
to get all the approvals...

338
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:02,245
...but it means a burial allowance
of up to 1500 from the VA.

339
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:05,407
Might as well take that stuff too.
I packed it up for him.

340
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:08,044
That's too bad nobody
told his brother what he wanted.

341
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:09,483
I did.

342
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:13,655
Oh, yeah. I gave Paul the forms.
I found them later in the trash.

343
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,772
It's mostly somebody else's writing
on the forms.

344
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,013
It doesn't match Victor's signature at all.

345
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:20,411
I filled them out for him.

346
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:25,851
He tried to do it himself,
but those boxes are pretty small...

347
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:29,210
...and he shook a lot.

348
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,218
Gulf War Victory Parade?

349
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,255
Victor said marching in it
was the proudest moment of his life.

350
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:45,533
Why would he keep it and watch it
over and over if he hated the Army?

351
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:49,258
- Did Paul visit him much?
- Yeah, three or four times a week.

352
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:50,942
He was really good about it.

353
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:52,896
- So how come he...?
- He couldn't.

354
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,022
Paul would say,
"The fucking Army stole your life, Vic."

355
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,897
And Vic would keep his mouth shut.

356
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,057
I can tell you this.

357
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:05,384
Victor wanted to believe that what
he did in the Gulf meant something...

358
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:09,341
...that his life was not a waste.

359
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:13,820
I only counsel. I'm not supposed
to interfere with what the family wants.

360
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,987
So you taped his medals to him, fished
his files out and passed them to me.

361
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:20,066
Well, you can always blow it off.

362
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,579
I mean, you didn't
even know the guy, right?

363
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,702
What are you doing?

364
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:37,866
There was a form that said
he's getting a military funeral.

365
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:40,985
- Who authorized this? Nate?
- Yeah.

366
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,865
How many times have I told you...

367
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:45,383
...when Nate gives you instructions,
check with me?

368
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:46,743
Turn him off.

369
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,943
I'll drive him
to the crematorium right now.

370
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:53,585
Do I have to do it myself?

371
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:58,546
Fucking Nate. Paul Kovitch
is who our contract is with...

372
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:03,109
...and if he finds out about this,
he will either sue us or break our legs.

373
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:10,148
- Tomatoes right there.
- Okay.

374
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,154
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Mrs. Fisher.

375
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,915
Hello, dear.

376
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,190
- Hello, I'm Brenda.
- Hiram Gunderson.

377
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:28,917
I understand you like to camp.

378
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,197
Why, yes, I do.

379
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:36,714
I wish I could tell you where Nate is,
but I have no idea.

380
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:39,802
It's okay. I can exist without him.

381
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:47,081
- Toasted sesame seeds in the salad?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

382
00:25:56,727 --> 00:26:00,164
There's my little girl.
Claire, honey, this is Hiram Gunderson.

383
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:04,121
Pleasure to meet you, Claire.

384
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:06,804
Hi.

385
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,644
This is delicious, Mrs. Fisher.

386
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,045
Hiram is a chef.

387
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:28,642
I can't get enough of his cock!

388
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:37,685
Mom, I need $ 1200 so I can go
to Sierra Crossroads over spring break.

389
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:41,571
And I need you to sign this form,
like, in case I die or something.

390
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:43,494
Is this a school trip?

391
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:46,655
No, you go to the mountains
and confront fear...

392
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,247
...and get in touch
with your most basic self.

393
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,608
It looks good on your college application.

394
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,777
Sorry I'm late. There was an
accident on the Long Beach Freeway.

395
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,129
You always seem to hit
the bad traffic.

396
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:02,900
- Hi, I'm Nate.
- Hiram, I've heard a lot about you.

397
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,216
Well, don't believe a word of it.

398
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,456
Hey, I'm sorry.

399
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:10,095
Don't be. I'm having fun.

400
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:14,457
- So, what did I miss?
- I want to go to Sierra Crossroads.

401
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,732
We'll talk about it later, Claire.

402
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:19,093
Mom, you should let her go.
Crossroads is great.

403
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:20,531
- You went?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:23,895
We went kayaking down the Colorado
River the summer I was, what, 17?

405
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:27,062
- I don't think you were even born yet.
- I don't remember this.

406
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,775
That's because I lied to you and Dad.

407
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:36,903
Dad would never let me go, so I told you
I was going to Sacramento...

408
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:40,219
...to witness state government in action.

409
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:47,104
Oh, by the way, everyone, I got a job.

410
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:51,339
- Cool.
- I'll be working at Nikolai's flower shop.

411
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,062
I start tomorrow.

412
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,340
It's just part-time.

413
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,267
- You didn't tell me about that.
- Didn't I?

414
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,062
Need some help?

415
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,903
Incidentally, I dropped Victor Kovitch off
at the Oak Valley Crematory.

416
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:08,864
I need you to pick him up tomorrow.

417
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:12,702
Oh, fuck, David, he wanted
a military funeral. He filled out the forms.

418
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:14,904
Is he paying our bill?

419
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:18,504
You were with his brother. It was clear
he did not want the body embalmed.

420
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:20,909
He could sue us,
and we wouldn't have a case.

421
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,753
Okay, you know what?

422
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:26,391
When you talk to me like this,
it makes me want to not listen to you.

423
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:30,145
You and I could lose everything.
Mom could lose her home.

424
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:35,427
Vic is eligible for a bigger allowance
from the VA than we thought.

425
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:36,592
Really?

426
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:40,074
- I'm leaving.
- I'll walk you down.

427
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:44,319
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

428
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,476
Why don't you come over,
spend the night?

429
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,309
I've gotta be in Pasadena tomorrow.
It would add an extra hour to my trip.

430
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,240
Okay.

431
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:00,237
Give me five minutes. I'll follow you.

432
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:09,276
- Tonight wasn't so bad, was it?
- I suppose not.

433
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,474
I don't know why I was so nervous.

434
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:15,837
I mean, for heaven's sake,
I gave birth to those people.

435
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:26,959
You know what occurred to me tonight
that's really strange?

436
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,879
I wish you'd known my husband.

437
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:35,005
I think the two of you
would've liked each other.

438
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,208
Oh, Ruth.

439
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,403
Who would get me a gift basket?

440
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:49,286
It's probably some Hollywood bigwig
that secretly wants to sleep with you.

441
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:55,690
It's from my brother,
and it is addressed to both of us.

442
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,450
"Sorry about this morning.
Have fun at Cactus World."

443
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,203
Who knows.

444
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:07,452
This is nice. We can take it
with us this weekend.

445
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:11,409
I cannot wait to get out of here. I'm in
dire need of some serious relaxation.

446
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:16,492
- Oh, fabulous.
- Smoked oysters.

447
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:18,415
Really, is there any caviar?

448
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:22,496
No, but there are condoms.

449
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:27,812
- And, okay, edible underpants.
- That's a little scary.

450
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,853
- I'd say this whole thing's a little scary.
- No, it just means he likes you.

451
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:36,338
Believe me, there are guys Billy
didn't like. It's much better this way.

452
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,740
I've been meaning to ask you.

453
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,980
What's up with those matching tattoos
you and he have?

454
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:47,579
We were in Vegas,
we were very drunk, and...

455
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,451
Oh, dear.

456
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:52,541
These things always struck me
as kind of ridiculous.

457
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:54,621
Would you just stop that?

458
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:59,181
What does he think we're gonna do
with this? This is, like, hostile.

459
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:03,338
Look, Billy's bipolar. He's medicated.

460
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:07,983
His sense of what's appropriate
can be a little off at times.

461
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:12,463
Look, you have no idea
what he's been through.

462
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:15,145
Don't judge him, please.

463
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:17,941
All right.

464
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:21,546
All right.

465
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,341
Thank you.

466
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,426
You're never gonna get out of this one,

467
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:56,195
I was nowhere near the latrine, sir,
I promise,

468
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:59,985
- Give it up, private, Your ass is busted,
- Yeah, you're in big trouble,

469
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,187
But my father's
on the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

470
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:06,032
Well, maybe we can 't court-martial you,
but there is something else we can do,

471
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:12,792
Yeah, come on, private, yeah,

472
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,631
You love that, don 't you?

473
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,157
- Hello?
- David, Walter Kriegenthaler.

474
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,398
- Did you meet with Father Clark?
- Yes, today.

475
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:29,560
We'd like to meet at 9:30 tomorrow
and vote,

476
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,957
- Can you make it?
- Absolutely.

477
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,876
Let me ask you a question, David.

478
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:39,480
Do you think Clark is gay?

479
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:46,880
I don't think so. He mentioned something
about having a deceased wife.

480
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:52,240
I mean, I don 't care if he is, I just don 't
want him to push that agenda,

481
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:55,484
You know, marriage, that whole thing,

482
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:59,720
I have a cousin in D.C.
Whose church split because of that.

483
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,283
Literally half the congregation left.

484
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:07,922
I don 't want that to happen to St, Bart's,
I've been going there for 40 years,

485
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:13,206
Well, it's late, I'll see you
tomorrow morning, Good night,

486
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:35,048
Okay, I got Victor, but I called
the National Cemetery from the car...

487
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:37,131
...and you know what?
They can bury an urn.

488
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:39,565
They call it "inurnment."
We can do it today at 3.

489
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:42,494
Why are you so determined
to sabotage our business?

490
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:45,051
I don't think Paul knew
how his brother really felt.

491
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:49,170
- Nate, why do you even care?
- Because it's what Victor wanted.

492
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:51,413
And he deserves it.
He got a raw fucking deal.

493
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:55,577
Victor Kovitch did not hate the Army.
Watch these tapes he made in the Gulf.

494
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:01,329
Yes, sir, fuck me, sergeant,

495
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,532
- Fuck, yeah, Give it to me,
- Come on, private,

496
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,613
Oh, come on!
Come on, that was funny!

497
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,652
I have someplace I have to be.

498
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,978
Dave, Dave, it's okay!
I watch porn too!

499
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:43,704
So you guys taking the PSAT
this afternoon too?

500
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,221
Yeah.

501
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:55,987
So, what happens to you guys?

502
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,419
I go to UC Irvine
and Northwestern Law...

503
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,020
...meet a totally great guy,
he's a triathlete...

504
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,990
...we get married
and I practice law for eight years...

505
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:10,145
...and we get really rich,
and then I have two great kids.

506
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:14,068
- So you're, like, unbelievably happy?
- Kind of.

507
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:18,267
I get a master's in French
and then live in Paris for 6 months...

508
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:22,387
...and hate it, so I come back,
become a TV development executive...

509
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,426
...and I work out all the time.

510
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:28,470
I'm fairly miserable and have
a slight substance-abuse problem.

511
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,867
- But you look great.
- Thanks.

512
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:35,149
I start an interior-lighting design firm
with my college roommate...

513
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,029
...and it totally takes off...

514
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:39,991
...and then I die of ovarian cancer
before I'm 30.

515
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,389
- Oh, that sucks.
- Tell me about it.

516
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,793
Well, good luck.

517
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,759
What a freak.

518
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:11,082
- Father Jack?
- David. Come in, sit.

519
00:36:13,524 --> 00:36:16,119
And call me "Jack." We're beyond that.

520
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:20,077
- Meeting over already?
- Yes.

521
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,716
- Damn.
- We all admire Clark's energy...

522
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:29,203
...but there is some concern
that he may end up being divisive.

523
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:32,565
As you said yourself, if we have
to start over from the beginning...

524
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:36,967
And find some conservative lap dog,
who won't challenge anybody?

525
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:40,567
Yeah, that's what we need here.

526
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,289
Scotch?

527
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,647
No, thank you.

528
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:50,768
- Clark thought he came on too strong.
- I liked him, Jack.

529
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:53,526
The world would be better
if there were more like him.

530
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:56,644
I just don't think that he's a good fit
for St. Bart's.

531
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:59,447
Do you really think that Father Clark
would be happy here?

532
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:02,810
Why should he be happy?
How happy are you?

533
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:08,771
You're right, I'm not happy.

534
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:11,409
My life is very complicated
and confusing.

535
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:15,325
I've experienced a lot of loss
recently, my father and my...

536
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:20,570
And the thing that helps me deal with it
is having a place...

537
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:23,496
...that hasn't changed
like everything else in my life.

538
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:26,451
There's a reason they call it
a sanctuary.

539
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,497
I think the majority of our congregation
feels the same way...

540
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,169
...and my responsibility
is to them, not you.

541
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:47,374
Well, I've got a business to run.

542
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,297
Yo.

543
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,423
Speaking.

544
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,619
Yes.

545
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:13,739
What can I do for you, Mr. Gilardi?

546
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:19,421
- Here, this is good choice here.
- I don't like yellow.

547
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:22,021
The bridesmaids' dresses are lilac.

548
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:25,346
If the flowers are yellow,
it's gonna look like an Easter egg hunt.

549
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,179
How about white tulips? Very simple.

550
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,142
Just bunched together with a ribbon.

551
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,343
I was kind of thinking I would be
the only one with white flowers.

552
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:38,426
Or you could be the only one holding
a gorgeous bouquet of color...

553
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,782
...against your white dress.
- People do that?

554
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:43,712
It's your day.
You can do whatever you want.

555
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,383
Don't you think that would be pretty?

556
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,982
- I love the tulips thing.
- Tulips are one of my favorite flowers.

557
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:55,871
So graceful and classic,
like little ballerinas.

558
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:03,594
Only reason I even met Victor was I
jumped off a humvee and broke my feet.

559
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:08,829
Here I am in the hospital with this guy
who's dying, listening to me complain.

560
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,751
Playing cards, giving me his dessert.

561
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:15,874
I wish he didn't die. It sucks.

562
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,712
Thank you.

563
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,197
Have you heard from Paul yet?

564
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,074
Not since I told him his brother
was ready to be picked up.

565
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,069
Well, without his consent in writing,
I cannot allow this funeral to take place.

566
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,476
Fine.

567
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,400
At least we'll know
we made an effort.

568
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:35,280
When we were in the Gulf...

569
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:38,634
...Victor used to make these videotapes
to send home to his family.

570
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:41,239
We were always giving him a hard time...

571
00:39:41,444 --> 00:39:45,039
...messing him up.
He was a real good sport.

572
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,961
The perpetual optimist.

573
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:51,522
- So my brother ready?
- Yes, he's right in here.

574
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:55,323
- What is this?
- Victor's friends wanted to say goodbye.

575
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,279
The hospital referred them.
It's no problem for us.

576
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,284
And no charge to you.

577
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:03,079
- Excuse me, are you his brother?
- Yes, I'm Paul.

578
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,956
This man here, I don't know
if you people know it...

579
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,285
...was like a lion for Victor.

580
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:12,926
He made federal waves
over Victor's disability case.

581
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:21,761
I found a couple pictures of us
playing baseball.

582
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:25,248
Vic was a lousy batter
but a pretty good infielder.

583
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:30,091
He's grinning like such a fool in these.

584
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:34,083
I thought you might like them.

585
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:40,288
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,090
- You sick?
- No.

587
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:46,810
Never got sick. I don't know why.

588
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:49,086
A lot of guys I knew over there did.

589
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:52,766
Thanks.

590
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,090
Thank you for letting Victor
have his military burial.

591
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:58,607
Even though I know
you were against it.

592
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:01,528
I'm sure this means a lot to him.

593
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:06,214
What the fuck is this military burial shit?

594
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,810
It's an option that can
easily be canceled at no charge to you.

595
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,819
Vic didn't want a military funeral.
You think I'm lying?

596
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,974
I think he was afraid to tell you
what he wanted.

597
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,218
He filled out those forms,
he kept the videos.

598
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:21,699
They filled out those forms.
This is all fucking Army PR.

599
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,975
- I threw those forms in the trash.
- I'll call the service off.

600
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,459
He kept Saudi Arabian candy
for 10 years.

601
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:31,373
- You just want to jack up your price.
- No, it's paid for.

602
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:34,463
I want your brother to have
the funeral he wanted for himself...

603
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,936
...because that's his right.

604
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:41,298
Victor wanted to believe he died for
something. You wanna take that away?

605
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:46,699
Jesus.

606
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,222
He's the only family I had left.

607
00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:56,219
And he can't even tell me
what he wants when he's dead?

608
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,868
He thought
I would've talked him out of this.

609
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,347
And he's right, I would've.

610
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,542
Why don't you sit with his friends.

611
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:23,627
Glad to have you here, man.

612
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:59,193
- Where is Ruth?
- She's in the back.

613
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,598
Crying.

614
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:14,400
What is wrong?

615
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:17,041
It's the smell of the flowers.

616
00:43:17,285 --> 00:43:20,277
- You'll get used to it.
- I am used to it!

617
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:25,961
Today, I helped people choose flowers
for weddings...

618
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,637
...for anniversaries, for new babies.

619
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:34,357
I can't remember being surrounded
by so much happiness.

620
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:38,284
I'm used to the smell of flowers meaning
something completely different.

621
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,121
I'm used to people crying
and being exhausted.

622
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,321
People being shattered!

623
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,364
Do not worry. We get funerals too.

624
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:53,725
I'm so happy. I can't wait
to come back tomorrow.

625
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:02,326
You're not going to be like this
every day, though, right?

626
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,612
This flag is presented on behalf
of a grateful nation as a token...

627
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,575
...of our appreciation for honorable
and faithful services...

628
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:54,013
...rendered by your loved one.

629
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,656
Give it to one of his friends.

630
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:37,908
I love you, David.

631
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:39,949
I always will.

632
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:47,024
I could get hit by a bus on the way
to the desert tonight.

633
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,953
Just wanted to make sure
you knew that.

634
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,671
I love you too.

635
00:45:57,795 --> 00:46:02,551
- You did the right thing today.
- I know. Feels kind of good, doesn't it?

636
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,035
- Hello.
- She can't go.

637
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,239
Why not?

638
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:28,833
She has to help me pick prints.

639
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,151
- Does she have to do it tonight?
- Yes, she does.

640
00:46:31,361 --> 00:46:34,593
Billy's got a show coming up
at a gallery in Westwood.

641
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:40,877
Sometimes she gives me her eyes
because sometimes I go blind.

642
00:46:42,243 --> 00:46:44,917
Forty-six hours I've been looking
at these pictures...

643
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:47,314
...and sometimes I see amazing things...

644
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:51,074
...and sometimes I just see shapes,
and that's when I go blind.

645
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:56,763
Because what if I lost the ability
to tell the difference?

646
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,046
For real.

647
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:01,119
- For good.
- You won't.

648
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:02,919
You say that and give me your eyes.

649
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,688
But what if one day,
I can't give them back to you?

650
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:08,607
Well, that won't happen.
We won't let that happen.

651
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,440
God, this is crap!

652
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,925
This is pretentious, derivative crap!

653
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,568
Well, then that's one less
you have to consider. Right?

654
00:47:24,812 --> 00:47:26,245
Right.

655
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:33,204
Billy, I'm gonna talk to Nate
on the porch, okay?

656
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:35,769
All right. Then he's gonna go away.

657
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:38,125
We'll be right outside.

658
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:40,283
Pick out five you like...

659
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:42,133
...and show me when I come back.

660
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,532
- Only five?
- Or 10 or 20.

661
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:48,405
And I'll look at them,
and I'll tell you what I see.

662
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,254
Okay.

663
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:58,054
You can fuck her some other time.

664
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,254
Sorry. He's obviously off his meds.

665
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,539
- Intentionally?
- No, it happens occasionally.

666
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:19,221
It's been a while.

667
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:22,420
- Brenda, come on.
- Sorry, Nate, I can't.

668
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:25,853
I'm all he has when he's like this.

669
00:48:26,063 --> 00:48:29,374
- You are letting him manipulate you.
- You don't know him.

670
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:32,178
- You don't know what he's doing.
- I know he doesn't like me.

671
00:48:32,384 --> 00:48:35,502
I have a feeling he doesn't like
any man in your life. Am I right?

672
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:38,579
- Answer me!
- What, you think I fucked my brother?

673
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:43,418
- Jesus, I never said that!
- Nate, he's sick!

674
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,420
He's my brother, and he's sick
and he needs me!

675
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:49,904
This is who I am,
this is what you get.

676
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,105
Fuck you.

677
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:02,101
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go with you.

678
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:08,105
- Can I do anything to help?
- Yeah.

679
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:14,382
You can go to the desert and sit in mud
and relax and forget about everything...

680
00:49:15,513 --> 00:49:17,424
...including us.

681
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:22,471
Oh, shit.

682
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:25,548
Just go, okay? Goddamn it.

683
00:49:46,309 --> 00:50:00,964
