1
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:54,149
So I want you to meet this guy
I'm going out with tonight. Okay?

2
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,911
He's kind of a dork,
but in a sweet way.

3
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,677
He seems real, at least.

4
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:05,788
And he's kind of rich, I think.
Kind of.

5
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:11,309
Of course, so was Kadeem, and that was
a fucking waste of two years of my life.

6
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:19,427
And you know what?
I knew you never liked Kadeem.

7
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:22,669
So I'm gonna bring this guy
home to meet you.

8
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:24,466
And this time...

9
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:29,464
...I swear I will pay attention
to what you think.

10
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:33,590
Because I am
one fucking hot-shit bitch...

11
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:36,910
...and he'd be fucking lucky to have me.

12
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:00,103
Oh, does that feel good.

13
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,225
Hey, Tito!

14
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,307
Come hang with me. Okay?

15
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,867
Thank you.

16
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,617
Who's my lover?
Yes.

17
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:26,139
Yes. Aren't you glad I rescued you?

18
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:31,501
You better be fucking glad.
Cost me 800 bucks in vet bills...

19
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:36,980
...at a time when things were particularly
tight for Mommy, I might add.

20
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,656
One good thing about this guy tonight...

21
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:44,700
...is, he's got a big, fat dick,
and he fucks like a jackhammer.

22
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,133
Those never last.

23
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,451
David, I'm so glad to see you here.

24
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:07,693
It's always nice when someone
comes back.

25
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:11,929
Oh, I've been going to church.
I was just going to a different church.

26
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,411
- Really, which one?
- St. Stephen's.

27
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:19,286
- In the Palisades?
- No, St. Stephen's in West Hollywood.

28
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:25,132
Well, I hope you always feel
as welcome here as you did there.

29
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:27,451
- Thanks.
- Your father was a deacon here...

30
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,406
...and we still haven't replaced him.

31
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:32,845
I think it would be good for this church
to listen to a younger voice.

32
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:35,488
If you're at all interested,
I could submit your name.

33
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:38,083
Me? A deacon?

34
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:42,332
David, that's wonderful.
Your father would be so proud.

35
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,850
Well, sure, I'd be honored
to be considered.

36
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:49,965
- Ruth, how are you holding up?
- I'm doing okay, Father.

37
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:54,569
- Each day is just a little bit easier.
- That's what I love hearing.

38
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,808
Wow, what a small world!
Do you go to this church?

39
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:02,482
I just joined. I was raised Catholic,
so I like the whole ritual part of it.

40
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,727
You smell good. What is that?

41
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,410
Who are you?

42
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,727
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I never introduced myself.

43
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,969
It seems like we've known each other
forever. I'm Tracy Montrose Blair.

44
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,559
- Hi, I'm David...
- Fisher, I know. I know who you are.

45
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:18,758
Okay. Why?

46
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,365
Because my Uncle Walt
was buried at your funeral home.

47
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,596
Old guy? Cancer?

48
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:28,123
Had a tattoo of a roulette wheel
on his back?

49
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,477
Oh, yes.

50
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:33,444
I have a tattoo.
A butterfly.

51
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:36,999
I think that you should know
that I'm not really available.

52
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,681
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

53
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,120
- Serious?
- We're engaged.

54
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,762
Well, good for you.

55
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,964
Most men your age are so
commitment-phobic, it's pathetic.

56
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,323
- Yes, men are pigs.
- Or they're gay.

57
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:56,244
Well, I'm certainly glad
to find out you're not gay.

58
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:59,118
I have to go. My mother's waiting.

59
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,278
Bye-bye!

60
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:06,473
- She seems nice.
- She seems nuts.

61
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,561
Hello?

62
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,634
Out here!

63
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:25,157
Hey.

64
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,996
- This is the life, huh?
- Apparently.

65
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,278
So how often do Mommy and Daddy
go away?

66
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:33,473
Oh, constantly.
They're very important people...

67
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,030
...with very important places to go.

68
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,711
Lucky for them, I have
absolutely nowhere to go.

69
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,833
- How are you?
- I'm good.

70
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,833
- It's chilly today. Aren't you cold?
- Nope.

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,832
Jesus, it's like a hot tub in here.

72
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,072
Mommy and Daddy keep it
this hot all the time, even in summer.

73
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,429
They're very wasteful.

74
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,231
That's just wrong.

75
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,226
Oh, man, you are...

76
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,474
What?

77
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,828
You're unlike any woman
I've ever met.

78
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:15,914
Good.

79
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,426
- You scare me a little.
- Why?

80
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,793
I don't know.

81
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,190
It's just...

82
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:37,472
...so much I don't know about you.

83
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:40,112
Me?

84
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:45,023
I am an open book.

85
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,782
I'm so glad you're bringing
your friends home.

86
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:03,187
You know, you haven't
done that in years.

87
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,666
You said you'd be gone
through the weekend.

88
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,224
Yes, it's Sunday.
It's the end of the weekend.

89
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:14,946
Nate, these are my parents,
Margaret and Bernard Chenowith.

90
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:21,146
Margaret and Bernard, this is Nate Fisher,
the man I am having sex with.

91
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,822
Hello.

92
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,819
Brenda has told us absolutely nothing
about you.

93
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,465
You know what? I'm not surprised.
I'm not sure there's that much to tell.

94
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,465
Oh, don't be so modest.

95
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:36,466
Nate's studying for
his funeral director's license.

96
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,228
Well, Nate, you'll have to tell us
all about that.

97
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,782
- Will you stay for lunch?
- At least a drink or two?

98
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:45,497
I'd like to, but...

99
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,707
...I really have to study.

100
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:54,021
Well, then you'll have to join us
for dinner sometime.

101
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,496
That sounds great.

102
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,736
Great!

103
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:08,020
Okay, Mrs. Fisher.

104
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:14,572
I asked you here today so we could
talk about your relationship with Claire.

105
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:18,016
- I told her it wasn't my idea.
- No.

106
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,612
Claire feels that,
being the youngest child...

107
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:25,698
...perhaps she might have missed out
on a time when the family was happier.

108
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,575
No, you said that.

109
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:30,615
I don't think there was a time
this family was ever happy.

110
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,461
That is not true.
There was lots of happiness:

111
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:37,694
When the boys were young,
when you were young, Claire.

112
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,620
You were a very happy little girl,
and you know it.

113
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:43,779
That's because I was too young
to realize what freaks we were.

114
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,620
Why would you tell this man
we were never happy?

115
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:50,290
Because I grew up in a house that was
usually filled with total strangers...

116
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,219
...who were crying all the time?
- Oh, boo-hoo.

117
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,338
I grew up in a two-room apartment
over a barbershop...

118
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,178
...and I spent my teenage years
taking care of my grandmother...

119
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,688
...after her legs were amputated.
Life's hard!

120
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,011
You had a roof over your head.
You didn't go hungry.

121
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:08,250
She gets up on this cross,
and then there's just no talking to her.

122
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,495
You did not have to go begging
for food on the streets of Calcutta.

123
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:15,167
Because I wasn't dropped in a dumpster,
I shouldn't want things to be better?

124
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:19,131
This is good. This is good
for you two to talk like this.

125
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:23,296
These are obviously things
you need to say.

126
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:26,374
So we're just supposed to fight
and get on each other's nerves?

127
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,009
I prefer the not-talking thing.

128
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:31,726
I think you should try to
have more of a dialogue.

129
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:36,690
Make time for it. Schedule it.
Remember, any relationship is work.

130
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:42,334
Okay, excellent session.

131
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,773
- That's it?
- That's up to you, isn't it?

132
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:51,812
He does this for like
five different schools.

133
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:59,209
She should look spectacular.
That's the most important thing.

134
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,883
We'll make sure that she looks her best.

135
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:08,608
She was the real deal, you know?
She was a star.

136
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,883
And I can assure you
we will give her a funeral...

137
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,969
...that befits the star that she was
and always will be.

138
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,521
- You know who she was?
- Absolutely.

139
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,767
And I'm a big fan of hers.

140
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,606
Hey, Rico.

141
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,448
- Holy moly.
- Feel them.

142
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,004
- They're really hard.
- No, thanks.

143
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,128
Like a rock.
See how they're all cockeyed?

144
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:42,802
They got this low-cut thing they want
her in, and they said absolutely no bra.

145
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,522
Shit, I don't know what
the heck I'm gonna do.

146
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:48,083
Maybe I could, like,
tape them together somehow.

147
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:51,245
You know where this goes? I put it
in the wrong place, David will bitch.

148
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:53,836
Top left, above the purple stuff.

149
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:58,482
Well, boys, this just might be our
highest profit margin funeral this year.

150
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:01,246
- She's rich, huh?
- The guy who's paying for it is.

151
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:06,201
- She looks so familiar to me.
- She's an actress. Viveca St. John.

152
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:09,477
Oh, my God, you're right.
That's her!

153
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:13,804
- Apparently, she was quite talented.
- She was a porno star.

154
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:17,041
- What?
- She was huge in the mid to late '80s.

155
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:18,677
You never saw any of her videos?

156
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,802
- No, Nate, I missed those.
- This chick fucked a snake.

157
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:25,633
- This chick fucked 30 guys at one time.
- I saw that. I saw that!

158
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,834
My cousin Ramone showed me
when I was like 12.

159
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,120
On the diving board. Okay?
They were wrapped around the pool.

160
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,554
Did you see the one where the guy's
riding this motorcycle, so he's...

161
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,196
...fucking her while riding in circles?
- Oh, shit!

162
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,074
Nate.

163
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:41,591
Could I speak to you
outside for a minute?

164
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:54,153
Damn it, Nate! The woman on that table
is just as deserving of dignity...

165
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,992
...as anyone else we prepare.

166
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,272
And Federico is an employee.

167
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,472
It's up to you and me to set
an example for him, all right?

168
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,274
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Show some respect.

169
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,549
These are human lives
we're dealing with here.

170
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,398
These are not organic blackberries
or granola in bulk.

171
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,238
- I said, I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

172
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:14,998
I want you to remember
that what we do here is serious...

173
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,349
...because it really sucks for me
always having to be the spoilsport.

174
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,116
Okay.

175
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,433
Thank you.

176
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:32,275
- Hello?
- Nate, Bernard Chenowith,

177
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:33,431
Hi.

178
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:37,271
Margaret and I were wondering if you
would join us for dinner tomorrow night.

179
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,785
- We won't take no for an answer.
- You hear that?

180
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:43,945
Well, actually I have a lot of
studying to do for this exam...

181
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,508
Nate...

182
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:48,752
...we'd really love to be able
to get a sense of who you are...

183
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,707
...and I'm sure you're curious
about us as well, right?

184
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:54,986
Good. Shall we say 7-ish?

185
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,031
Can I bring anything?

186
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,026
Hello?

187
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:11,749
Suck on that, you ugly fuck!

188
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:20,740
Hi.

189
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:25,183
There's this thing called knocking. It's,
like, protected in the First Amendment.

190
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,506
I rented some videos.

191
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,429
I thought you and I could
watch them tonight.

192
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,947
Remember when you
were in middle school...

193
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,743
...you and I went to the movies
every Monday night?

194
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,701
Remember how much fun we had?

195
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,981
I remember seeing a lot
of really bad movies.

196
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,898
What'd you get?

197
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:53,343
Runaway Bride
and The Nutty Professor.

198
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,305
Cool.

199
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,743
Oz didn 't make you a bitch,

200
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,414
You were born one,

201
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:16,174
lt'd be good for business too.
Dad was a deacon there.

202
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,343
It's a big congregation. People die.

203
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,821
Their families don't know where to go,
and the church sends them our way.

204
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,140
They know you're gay?

205
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:29,178
I think Father Jack
has a pretty good idea.

206
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:32,739
- You think he likes you?
- Keith.

207
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,253
Does this mean you're not gonna be
going to church with me anymore?

208
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:42,773
Well, if they make me a deacon,
I'd have to go there all the time, yeah.

209
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:49,651
I'm sorry. I know.
Sundays have sort of been our day.

210
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:57,138
I think it's great. I really do.

211
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,252
One of the things I love about you...

212
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:03,015
...is the fact that your religion
means so much to you.

213
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,609
Besides, I think it could be
kind of hot, you know?

214
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,493
Dating a man of the cloth?

215
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,331
- But I need you to do something for me.
- What is it, my son?

216
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,928
You know the gay firemen
and police officers club I belong to?

217
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,413
Well, we're having a party
in Laguna this weekend.

218
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:27,531
- I want you to be my date.
- Your date? Will I get a corsage?

219
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,809
I want you to start meeting
some of my friends, David.

220
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,293
I'd like that.

221
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:39,932
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

222
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:58,526
This is an entire movie
about expelling gas.

223
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,612
I think that's why people like it.

224
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:07,725
- I don't want to watch this.
- Good, because neither do I.

225
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,004
Claire, look...

226
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:23,050
...I know you probably think
I'm old and stupid.

227
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,003
No, Mom, I don't.

228
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:27,327
But I love you just as much
as I ever did...

229
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,125
...and I'm worried about you,
and I don't know how to help.

230
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,168
I don't need help.

231
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,930
Why is everyone acting like
I'm in the Trenchcoat Mafia?

232
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,362
- You stole a foot. A human foot!
- Okay, you want to know why?

233
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,607
Because some guy who scammed me
into having sex with him...

234
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,967
...because I thought he cared about me,
told the entire school I sucked his toes.

235
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,281
And then when I confronted him,
he showed entirely no remorse.

236
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:54,447
I saw Nate drop the foot on the floor.
I grabbed it to get back at that asshole.

237
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:57,003
It wasn't premeditated.
I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer.

238
00:18:57,248 --> 00:19:01,560
- I don't get off on hacked-up body parts.
- You're having sex?

239
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:05,601
No. Jesus. No, I'm sorry. I cannot have
this conversation with you.

240
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,321
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
we're ever gonna have...

241
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:11,996
...a touchy-feely, mother-daughter
relationship like on TV and the movies...

242
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,766
...because you know what?
They don't exist!

243
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,644
Here's our guest...

244
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:28,474
...and he brought us a bottle
of Louis Jadot Pinot Noir.

245
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:34,193
- 1997, no less.
- Okay, a man who knows his wine.

246
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,474
I'm liking you more and more, Nate.

247
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:41,120
Well, I worked at a food co-op in Seattle
for a long time. Learned a little bit.

248
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:44,076
A co-op? So there's a little hippie
in there, huh?

249
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,673
That makes sense.
Brenda would find that attractive.

250
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:51,477
She likes to think of herself
as being wildly countercultural.

251
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,037
I think she's actually
just jealous of the fact...

252
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:57,200
...that Bern and I really were hippies,
briefly.

253
00:19:57,402 --> 00:20:00,837
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure, do you have any beer?

254
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,636
No, we have vodka, scotch, bourbon.

255
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:10,153
- I'll have a little bourbon.
- Manly, but not elitist. Just her type.

256
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,032
Down, girl.

257
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,319
So where is Brenda?

258
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,875
Brenda?
Oh, Brenda's not coming tonight.

259
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,913
- Really?
- She felt, and I have to agree with her...

260
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,350
...we'd have a better chance of getting
to know each other if she weren't here.

261
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:36,274
She does tend to take
center stage, so to speak.

262
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:45,155
- I wish somebody had thought to tell me.
- I'm sorry. I assumed she did.

263
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,071
There you are.

264
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,067
David was raised in this church.

265
00:20:57,275 --> 00:21:00,585
He was christened and confirmed here,
he served as an altar boy...

266
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:05,026
...and he was president
of the youth ministry in high school.

267
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:08,624
- How old are you, David?
- I'm 31.

268
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,185
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a funeral director.

269
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:18,421
His father served as a deacon for over
a decade. He just recently passed away.

270
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:22,910
So you see this
as a sort of passing the torch.

271
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:27,025
No, sir, I see it as a chance
to serve God.

272
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:32,180
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.
Because that's what it is.

273
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:37,340
Being a deacon is more than just having
access to the church mailing list...

274
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:41,065
...and passing out your business cards
after Mass.

275
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,942
Sir, I won't deny that I run a business...

276
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,618
...providing service to people
in times of need.

277
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,266
But I would never exploit my relationship
to the church for marketing purposes.

278
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,939
Frankly, I consider that to be
a pretty grave sin.

279
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,188
No pun intended.

280
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:03,539
St. Bartholomew is an old church...

281
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,500
...a conservative church...

282
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:08,223
...a church that doesn't need
to have its boat rocked.

283
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,987
Which is precisely why I feel
David is a good candidate.

284
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:14,179
How many men his age
have values as strong as his?

285
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:17,538
I think he would be
an excellent role model.

286
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:24,258
- Are you married?
- No, sir. I was engaged, briefly.

287
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,143
Is there anything else you'd like
to tell me about yourself...

288
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:34,222
...before I consider this?

289
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:36,541
No, sir.

290
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:41,254
Is there anything specific about me
that you'd like to ask?

291
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:43,420
No.

292
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:51,702
I'll let you know my decision
in a few days.

293
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:57,818
- You impressed him.
- You think?

294
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,341
Yes.

295
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:03,576
Oh, by the way, one of our parishioners
recently lost her father to liver cancer.

296
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,376
Sharon Murdoch. I gave her your name.
You may be getting a call.

297
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:09,139
Thank you.

298
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,696
- Again with the not knocking.
- Pack some things.

299
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,652
- We're going to San Bernardino.
- What?

300
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,658
We're spending the night
at my cousin Hannah's.

301
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,329
- Mom, I'm doing homework.
- Well, stop!

302
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:28,369
- I have school tomorrow.
- I'll write a note!

303
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,851
It's been a long time since Brenda's
wanted us to meet...

304
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,411
...any of the men in her life.

305
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:40,133
- What was that last one, chiropractor?
- He was a Rolfer.

306
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,976
He was an idiot.

307
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:44,737
Well, I'm not sure Brenda
ever meant for us to meet.

308
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:47,531
I don't think she expected you guys
to come home that day.

309
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:48,892
Oh, Nate.

310
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:52,566
Where Brenda's concerned,
there are no coincidences.

311
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:58,252
- You think she planned all this?
- Of course.

312
00:23:58,496 --> 00:23:59,975
She's a master manipulator.

313
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:04,208
I love her dearly, but you really ought
to know what you're getting into.

314
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:06,326
Would you like another bourbon?

315
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,765
No, thanks.

316
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:13,368
Can I ask you guys something?

317
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:16,367
As long as it doesn't involve
asking us for money.

318
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:20,485
No, it doesn't.

319
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,971
Does the name "Nathaniel"
have any significance to you?

320
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:32,970
Well, sure. Nathaniel and Isabel.

321
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,526
Brenda adored these books as a little girl.

322
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,007
She could read by the time she was 3.

323
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,723
- What are they about?
- Two orphans who had adventures.

324
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,921
They ran away from an orphanage.

325
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,167
There was a malevolent nurse
who was always hunting them down...

326
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,207
...but they always managed
to outsmart her.

327
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,766
Typical infantile wish fulfillment.

328
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:06,481
- I've never even heard of them.
- They're British, quite dark.

329
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:08,804
People die in them all the time.

330
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,487
When Brenda's brother was born...

331
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,925
...we expected serious displacement
anxiety from her, but there was none.

332
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,916
She would sit next to his crib
and read him these stories for hours.

333
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,520
- She was what then, Bern, 4?
- 5 at most.

334
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,003
It's all in the book.

335
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,718
This book?

336
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:34,914
You mean, she didn't tell
you about that either?

337
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,955
I feel terrible,

338
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,962
- I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma,
- Yeah, huh?

339
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:48,043
That was a pretty Freaky Friday moment
we had back there,

340
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,679
Ruthie, I am so glad you called.

341
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:56,996
Ginnie and I would never allow
ourselves this kind of food...

342
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:59,717
...unless it were a really
special occasion.

343
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:03,113
We are definitely gonna have to do
an extra spinning class this week.

344
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:04,641
Tomorrow morning?

345
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,753
- Who's teaching?
- Derek.

346
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:09,271
I'm so there.

347
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:14,149
Mom and I have the hugest crush
on this spinning instructor at the Y.

348
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,591
He is hot, hot, hot.

349
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,590
So, Claire, have you thought
about college?

350
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,079
Yeah.

351
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,716
I'd love to go to, like,
NYU or Columbia...

352
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,752
...but I don't know
if I could ever get in, so...

353
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,752
Well, there are some great schools
in L.A.

354
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,269
Why would you want to go to school
in the same town you grew up in?

355
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,709
I go to Cal State
right here in San Berdoo.

356
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:44,308
- Well, whatever rocks your boat.
- Claire.

357
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,630
Hey, I love it.

358
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,113
By living at home, I'm saving
a ton of money for grad school.

359
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,115
I'm not stuck in a crappy dorm
where everyone's smoking pot...

360
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:56,076
...and playing loud music all the time.

361
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:00,591
And I don't have to call campus police
every time I walk home from the library...

362
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:03,071
...so that I don't get raped.

363
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:07,309
- And I like to stay close to my mom.
- That translates to: I do her laundry.

364
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:10,234
Oh, that's not true.

365
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,551
I love my mom,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

366
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:15,508
Thank you, honey. I love you too.

367
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,107
Okay, anybody want more?

368
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,666
- So how was it?
- Oh, it was quite informative.

369
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,710
I know what Nathaniel means now.
I know you have an IQ of 185.

370
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:40,709
I know you had a book
written about you.

371
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,506
Here, I signed it for you.

372
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:47,342
Why didn't you just tell me about this?

373
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:51,544
People always change after they read it.
I was trying to make the fun part last.

374
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:56,187
Oh, God! So you're kind of
scarily brilliant, I can handle that.

375
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,984
What I can't handle is the way
you keep mind-fucking me...

376
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,466
...for your personal entertainment.
It's really starting to piss me off.

377
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,139
I'm sorry I'm not a well-behaved,
little nothing that never challenges you...

378
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,627
...but if that's what you're looking for,
you might as well just leave right now.

379
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,785
So, what, you're trying
to drive me away?

380
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:16,298
Yeah, Nate, I'm trying
to drive you away.

381
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:25,224
It was my mother's idea
that I not be there...

382
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:29,579
...which is fine by me.
I don't really enjoy their company.

383
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:32,376
She said it was your idea.

384
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,499
Yeah, she would. She probably
believes that. She's out of her mind.

385
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:39,584
You could've warned me
what I was walking into.

386
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,616
You wouldn't have gone.

387
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:46,899
I just wanted to get it all
out of the way.

388
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,697
Them, the book, everything.

389
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:51,299
Yeah, well, I felt like a fucking lab rat
over there!

390
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:54,302
Yeah, that's what they do!

391
00:28:55,264 --> 00:29:00,656
I'm 6 years old, I score through the roof
on some standardized, biased test...

392
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:03,377
...and it all becomes about them!

393
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,371
They hand me over to strangers,
experts, a bunch of academic fucks...

394
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:11,461
...who scrutinized everything I did
or said or thought even.

395
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:14,819
It is a fucking law of physics
that the very act of observation...

396
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:18,094
...changes that which is being observed.

397
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:27,571
And now you're gonna read that book
and think that you know me.

398
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,372
- Well, you know what? You don't.
- Yeah, because you won't let me.

399
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,777
Okay, fine.
What do you want to know?

400
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:47,255
Ask me anything.

401
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:52,289
Did you burn down that house
that we made love in?

402
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:56,535
You think I burned down the house?

403
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,615
Really? That is so weird!

404
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:01,415
Well, what am I supposed to think?

405
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:04,290
You put my brother and me
in the bus that killed our father.

406
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:07,488
You get weird phone calls from
screaming people you won't explain.

407
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:10,164
Now you wanna make me
feel stupid for being suspicious?

408
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,810
Give me a fucking reason not to be!

409
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:21,244
I just want to know what this is...

410
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,172
...for you.

411
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:31,883
Am I just another step along your way?

412
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:36,811
Okay, look...

413
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,931
...we obviously have
an intense sexual connection...

414
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,886
...and yes, I would like for there to be
something more than that.

415
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:51,203
But that can't ever happen until you
trust me, which apparently you don't.

416
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,845
Should I trust you?

417
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,928
Yes.

418
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,286
Come here.

419
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,558
R-A...

420
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:22,965
...K- E.

421
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:31,523
Triple letter score for K.
Good one, Mom.

422
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:39,884
H-E-L-L.

423
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:51,834
H-E-L-L...

424
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,444
...O.

425
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,715
Hello.

426
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,796
D...

427
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,157
...E...

428
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,716
...F...

429
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:11,280
...T.

430
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:15,039
Deft. What is deft?

431
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:18,757
Well, it's a laundry detergent
from when Ruth and I were kids.

432
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:22,796
No, it's a word.
It means skilled.

433
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,239
Really? Use it in a sentence.

434
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:30,552
He deftly juggled his responsibilities.

435
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,714
Deft.

436
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,512
Or "Deft, where ith thy sting?"

437
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,556
So how you both doing,
you know, with Nathaniel passing?

438
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,154
- Better every day.
- You know, shit happens.

439
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:58,669
You know, it's such an awful thing,
losing someone you love.

440
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:03,275
In terms of stress, it's right up there
with moving and getting fired.

441
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:06,230
I know when Ed and I split up,
I was devastated.

442
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:10,476
I didn't even want to get out of bed.
I just wanted to curl up and die.

443
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:16,950
And all I can say is, thank God
for my precious daughter.

444
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:20,705
Well, I just wouldn't let her mope.
Just wouldn't let her.

445
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:23,469
Dragged her ass,
pardon my French, out of bed...

446
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,552
...and took her to spinning class
with me.

447
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,390
And I hated her for it at the time,
but it really got me back on track.

448
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,666
You know, endorphins really are
nature's antidepressants.

449
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,990
Life goes on. It doesn't go on by itself.

450
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:37,185
Sometimes you just gotta
kick it in the butt.

451
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,828
But Ed didn't die.

452
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:43,105
He's still alive. You can still see him.

453
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,544
When Ginnie gets married,
you'll both be there.

454
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:51,466
When she has children,
they'll be able to know him.

455
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:57,020
He's not gone forever.

456
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:01,021
Yeah, well, sure, but...

457
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:05,947
...in terms of the impact
it had on both our lives...

458
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,106
...it's similar.

459
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,182
Okay, I have the greatest idea.

460
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:22,144
You guys are coming to spinning class
with us tomorrow, bright and early.

461
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,978
No offense, but I'd rather drive
a rusty railroad spike through my skull.

462
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:29,978
Oh, just try it once.

463
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:33,266
You might be surprised
how it changes the way you feel.

464
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:35,777
- I feel fine.
- You know what, Ginnie?

465
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,502
That is absolutely an inspired idea!

466
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:46,220
Okay, ladies, let's get to bed. Because
if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 a. M...

467
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,462
...Derek doesn't let you in.

468
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:56,616
So these tits do nothing for you, huh?

469
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:59,505
Well, I can appreciate
that they are beautiful...

470
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:02,777
...in their own completely artificial way.

471
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:07,057
Men loved them.
Well, real men.

472
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:11,376
You think God cares that you're gay?

473
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:15,618
You think God cares
that you fucked 30 guys at once?

474
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,661
Oh, so you equate being a fag
with being a whore?

475
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:21,377
- No.
- One's okay, but one isn't?

476
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:23,852
I think God appreciates it
when love's involved.

477
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:25,376
Oh, honey.

478
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:29,939
I loved every man I ever fucked
while I was fucking him.

479
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:15,646
- What are you doing?
- Watching you.

480
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:24,211
Claire, wake up. Get dressed.

481
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,010
- Why?
- We're leaving. Hurry.

482
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:29,683
Jesus, Mom, I'm starting to feel
like Anne Frank.

483
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:33,012
If we don't get out of here fast,
we'll have to go spinning.

484
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:34,933
Oh, my God.

485
00:36:45,054 --> 00:36:46,487
- Let's go.
- Wait.

486
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:50,766
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

487
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,331
Thanks for buying me breakfast.

488
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:01,602
Thank you for finding
my G-spot this morning.

489
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:03,484
Anytime.

490
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:09,480
Oh, I have something for you.

491
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,680
Wow.

492
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,644
- Oh, come on, it's just a key.
- No, this is great.

493
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,122
I'm a little surprised, that's all.

494
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,439
I'm too nervous to eat.

495
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,039
I'll just drink coffee
until I start twitching and sweating.

496
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:28,399
Why does being a deacon
mean so much to you now?

497
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:33,239
- It wasn't a consideration a week ago.
- I know you think it's naive...

498
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,757
...but I see it as a chance
to make a difference...

499
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,845
...make the world a little more tolerant.

500
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,841
David, we have our own church
in West Hollywood...

501
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:44,357
...which means the other churches
and dioceses don't have to tolerate us.

502
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:47,286
Frankly, I resent the notion
that I need to be tolerated.

503
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:50,644
So, what, we should just allow
ourselves to be ghettoized?

504
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:53,519
Why do you embrace an organization
that doesn't embrace you?

505
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:57,441
- The church embraces everyone.
- Right. Hate the sin, love the sinner.

506
00:37:57,646 --> 00:38:00,206
- The operative word being "hate."
- What is with you?

507
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:02,965
The other night you said
you liked the idea.

508
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,321
I had a chance to think.

509
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,594
Isn't that your brother?

510
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,715
Okay, look, can we just have breakfast...

511
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:21,041
...without me feeling like I'm George Will
and you're Cokie Roberts with PMS?

512
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:23,677
You probably like George Will.

513
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,236
Dave.

514
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:28,035
- Hi.
- Hey.

515
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,202
Keith, you remember my brother Nate,
don't you?

516
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:34,120
- How's it going?
- Hey.

517
00:38:34,322 --> 00:38:35,994
This is Brenda.

518
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:38,113
My...

519
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:43,600
- My girlfriend.
- I prefer the term "fuck puppet."

520
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:48,039
So, what are you guys doing here,
you just play racquetball?

521
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,438
- No. No, we just worked out.
- Oh, so you guys work out together?

522
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,997
Yeah.

523
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,710
Yeah, we do.

524
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,797
Oh, well, that's great.

525
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,274
Okay, great.

526
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,833
Okay, you guys have a great day.

527
00:39:13,038 --> 00:39:14,517
You too.

528
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,468
Bye, David.

529
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:25,148
Oh, my God, I think David is gay.

530
00:39:25,357 --> 00:39:28,905
I think David is lucky.
Did you get a look at that guy?

531
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,586
Claire.

532
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:43,670
I had an affair.

533
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:50,471
For the last two years
I was seeing someone.

534
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:56,425
Your father never knew about it.
At least, I hope he didn't.

535
00:39:57,713 --> 00:39:59,988
And I called it off after he died.

536
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:04,631
It's not something I'm proud of.

537
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:09,064
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it's the truth.

538
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:14,428
And whatever relationship
you and I have, I want it to be honest...

539
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:16,462
...even if you hate me.

540
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,786
Mom, I don't hate you.

541
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,419
I remember going to the movies
on Monday nights...

542
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,822
...but I'm 17 years old now,
and I have my own life.

543
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,700
And there's things I have
to figure out on my own.

544
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:37,138
And that's, like, normal.

545
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:43,388
And I know stealing a foot is weird...

546
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:47,740
...but hello, living in a house where
a foot is available to be stolen is weird.

547
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,177
I gotta get to school.

548
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:21,412
- Did you see his face?
- Oh, man.

549
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:24,297
I know I shouldn't be laughing,
but he looked so stupefied.

550
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:27,973
The way he was all,
"Great, great. I'm hip, I'm cool."

551
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:29,662
Proud of you, man.

552
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,093
So listen, this thing in Laguna
is Saturday night.

553
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,942
I got us a room at the Surf and Sand.
You ever been there?

554
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:37,337
- No.
- Man, it's gonna be great.

555
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,339
We got a fireplace
overlooking the ocean.

556
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,579
Keith, I don't think I can make it after all.

557
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:48,099
I shouldn't miss church, not while
they're considering me for a deaconship.

558
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:51,054
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

559
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,139
We'll come back Saturday night.

560
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,013
- That'll work.
- I can go to church with you on Sunday.

561
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,419
That's not a good idea.

562
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,180
This hasn't been a good idea
from the beginning, has it?

563
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,011
Fine, why don't we cut our losses...

564
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:07,096
...and call it quits right now?
- What?

565
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:10,655
Look, as long as you feel the need
to keep our relationship a secret...

566
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,646
David, you're ashamed of it!
I'm not having any of that, not anymore.

567
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:17,128
- I just came out to my brother.
- One step forward.

568
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,614
Now you want to take a giant leap
backwards into the arms of the enemy.

569
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,695
So now I'm a Nazi collaborator?

570
00:42:22,898 --> 00:42:25,775
A lot of African-Americans might say
the same thing about you...

571
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,286
...being a member of the L.A.P.D.

572
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:31,568
You fucking coward!

573
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:34,968
Keith, please don't...

574
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,050
It works.

575
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:03,528
I must have left the stereo on again.

576
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,292
So you are not too freaked out?

577
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,444
A little, maybe.

578
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:12,965
It makes David more interesting.

579
00:43:13,212 --> 00:43:16,887
No, I mean about me giving you
a key to my apartment.

580
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:21,567
What do you think I am, an aging
Peter Pan who's gonna disappear...

581
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,530
...at the sign of something permanent?
- Well, yeah.

582
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:29,043
You're one to talk. You couldn't even
allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend.

583
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,521
Don't mind me.

584
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,357
I thought we agreed that you would call
before you came over.

585
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:45,801
I did. The hot water's out in my building.
I needed to take a shower.

586
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:48,164
Don't be mad at me.

587
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:50,518
You know I hate it
when you're mad at me.

588
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,516
Hey, it's me,
I need to use your shower, okay?

589
00:43:54,728 --> 00:43:58,083
Besides, I haven 't seen you in a while,
and it's a fucking gorgeous day,

590
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:02,117
- Satisfied?
- I'm going to make a cup of tea.

591
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:03,880
Hey...

592
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:08,204
...I'll take one of those.
- Hey, you behave yourself.

593
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:14,164
Hi. What's your name?

594
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:18,715
- Nate.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Billy.

595
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:22,564
Hi.

596
00:44:23,485 --> 00:44:25,759
So how long you known Brenda?

597
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:29,033
A few months.

598
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,756
So...

599
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:38,635
Who am I and why am I in your
girlfriend's house practically naked?

600
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:42,872
- Yeah.
- She's my sister.

601
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:45,842
She's my mother. Sister. My mother.

602
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:52,271
Sorry. Nobody's ever laughed at that.
I should know better.

603
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,551
It's nice to meet you.

604
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,601
- So you met the parents yet?
- Yes, last night.

605
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,120
Wow.

606
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:01,996
You've made it pretty far.

607
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,835
So why haven't I heard about you?

608
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,950
No idea.

609
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,707
Well, I guess I better go
put some clothes on.

610
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:46,147
How'd you get her breasts synchronized?
Some sort of industrial epoxy?

611
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:51,989
Would you ask Colonel Sanders
for his secret recipe?

612
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:55,028
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna tell.

613
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:02,709
I stuck a can of cat food
under each one.

614
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:06,432
My sister-in-law did
a cat food commercial.

615
00:46:06,634 --> 00:46:08,749
We've got like 10 cases.

616
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:14,543
Hey. I'm Larry Wadd.

617
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:18,668
You know...

618
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:23,388
...I met Viveca St. John
before she even did her first video.

619
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:26,586
Yeah, she was...

620
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:32,149
She was the fluffer
on the set of Dirty Larry 3.

621
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:34,546
She was...

622
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:38,342
...friendly. She was eager.

623
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,779
I can honestly say I've never received
a better blowjob in my life.

624
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,264
And nobody was even filming it.

625
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:54,704
When I first met Viveca,
I met her on Deep Diving.

626
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:57,305
Thank you.

627
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:02,383
And I had never gone down on a girl
before. So naturally, I was nervous...

628
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:05,420
...but Viveca was so warm
and relaxed about it.

629
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:08,505
She really put me at ease.

630
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:13,139
Well, her and the two Xanax
she gave me.

631
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:16,020
And when I first had to do
a double penetration...

632
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,496
...I was, like, a total wreck.

633
00:47:18,706 --> 00:47:24,940
But Viveca came through
like such the pro she is.

634
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:27,383
I mean was.

635
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:38,613
- Nate, what the hell is going on in there?
- A funeral.

636
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:41,980
For whom? A prostitute?

637
00:47:43,783 --> 00:47:48,857
A woman who was a star
of adult videos.

638
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,658
Mom, we're gonna clear
8 grand from this.

639
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:54,695
We can finally pay for all that
air conditioning work.

640
00:47:58,382 --> 00:48:01,498
I'm just glad your sister is at school.

641
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:05,575
It was awful.
They're like best friends.

642
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:09,896
They're both like cheerleaders
with this totally plastic way of life...

643
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,819
...like spinning class solves everything...

644
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,332
...and they're both hot
for the same guy. It was creepy.

645
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:26,258
My mom's...

646
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:30,417
My mom is just so fucking sad.

647
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:34,733
And I wish I could help her.

648
00:48:37,777 --> 00:48:39,893
So help her.

649
00:48:41,537 --> 00:48:45,496
Now, Mrs. Murdoch, some people
prefer the solemnity of a church...

650
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:48,256
...and St. Bartholomew
is a beautiful setting.

651
00:48:48,456 --> 00:48:52,369
Here, however, one is more free
to customize the service.

652
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:56,614
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just had to tell somebody.

653
00:48:57,455 --> 00:49:03,530
Viveca looks so great.
Her tits have never looked better.

654
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:07,848
She was like a sister to me.

655
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:19,161
I'm so glad that you're pleased.

656
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,843
We want to remember her
at her very best, don't we?

657
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:27,125
Now, I'm sorry, but I'm helping
some other people right now.

658
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:30,244
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you after the service?

659
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:32,249
Okay.

660
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:40,689
I think we'll have Dad's service
at the church.

661
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:41,846
Fine.

662
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:46,760
I'm not a religious man,
but I do believe in God.

663
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,926
If I were to make a list of the things
I thank God for the most...

664
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:58,524
...fucking Viv would be
at the top of that list.

665
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,765
She was a goddamn force of nature.

666
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:06,325
And I loved her.
And I know God loved her too.

667
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:10,197
I know he knew
just what he was doing...

668
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:13,156
...and how much joy...

669
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:16,439
...she would bring to the world.

670
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:31,640
For David James Fisher,
chosen deacon in your church...

671
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:35,281
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

672
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,635
That he may faithfully fulfill
the duties of this ministry...

673
00:50:38,844 --> 00:50:41,483
...build up your church
and glorify your name...

674
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:45,199
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

675
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:49,436
That by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
he may be sustained and encouraged...

676
00:50:49,643 --> 00:50:50,962
...to persevere to the end...

677
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:54,952
...we pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

678
00:50:55,203 --> 00:50:58,751
For all who fear God
and believe in you, Lord Christ...

679
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:02,511
...that our divisions may cease
and that all may be as one...

680
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:05,481
...as you and the Father are one.

681
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:09,913
- We pray to you, O Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

682
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,633
Way to go, Dave.

683
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:28,830
All I have to do is join the Kiwanis club...

684
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,270
...and Fisher & Sons will have
all our bases covered.

685
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,949
Where's Keith?

686
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,877
He's just a friend, Nate.

687
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:44,512
- Very good to see you.
- Hello.

688
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,752
So, Mom, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

689
00:51:51,957 --> 00:51:55,153
Nothing as far as I know. Why?

690
00:51:55,356 --> 00:52:00,032
I thought maybe you'd want to go see
a movie or rent a movie or something.

691
00:52:00,756 --> 00:52:03,986
Okay, but if you cry,
the whole thing is off.

692
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,468
Thanks for coming today.

693
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:11,905
- I know you must've found this a little...
- Are you kidding? I loved it.

694
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:15,504
All that pageantry, it's so trippy.
It's like a Fellini movie.

695
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:20,265
Well, it was kind of cool being with you
here in front of God and everybody.

696
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:28,030
- You don't really believe in God, do you?
- Well, yeah.

697
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:32,467
I mean, I don't believe in some bearded,
old, white man up in a cloud...

698
00:52:32,672 --> 00:52:34,344
...but I believe in something.

699
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:37,749
Some sort of undefinable creative force.

700
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:40,943
I think it's just all totally random.

701
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:42,470
Really?

702
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,230
Yeah.

703
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,062
We live, we die.
Ultimately, nothing means anything.

704
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,022
How can you live like that?

705
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,585
I don't know. Sometimes
I wake up so fucking empty...

706
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:58,499
...I wish I'd never been born,
but what choice do I have?

707
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:11,078
