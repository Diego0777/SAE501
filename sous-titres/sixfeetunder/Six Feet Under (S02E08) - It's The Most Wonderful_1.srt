1
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,266
<i>That one's gonna be for the highlight reel</i>
<i>this weekend.</i>

2
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,828
<i>As we take another look...</i>

3
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,663
If you don't get your fat ass in gear
you're gonna be late for work.

4
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,143
I just sat down.

5
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,062
Come on.
You only got this job two weeks a year.

6
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,823
All right.

7
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,708
You know, this goddamn suit
itches like hell.

8
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:18,780
You could lose a little padding here.

9
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:21,781
Careful. Only good little girls get presents.

10
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:24,344
No flirting with the faggoty elves.

11
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,019
Can I help it if the elves think I'm a stud?

12
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:29,623
You are a stud. But you're my stud.

13
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,180
- Careful.
- Yeah, like hell.

14
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,347
You're a loser.

15
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,588
Is that Santa?

16
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:55,543
It is. It's Santa.

17
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,223
Hi, Santa!

18
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,743
You told me Donald Green was Jewish.

19
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,747
I don't know.
His shop was closed on Yom Kippur.

20
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,548
He sent us a Christmas card
with a baby Jesus on it.

21
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,142
So he's not Jewish.

22
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,978
- We sent him one with a dreidel on it.
- Now he thinks we're Jewish.

23
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,422
Is Brenda Jewish?

24
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,181
Yeah, sort of.

25
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,424
Her dad's Jewish,
and her mom was raised Catholic, I think.

26
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:47,342
But now they're atheists. I think.

27
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,222
How would your children be raised?

28
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,583
We haven't gotten that far yet, Mom.

29
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,143
Is she coming to Christmas dinner?
I'm making my list.

30
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:58,298
That's the plan.

31
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,779
Christmas Eve at her mother's place,
and then Christmas dinner here.

32
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,258
- So I'll write you down for two.
- Great.

33
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,986
- David?
- You can put me down for one.

34
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,061
But what about Keith?
Aren't the two of you...

35
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,701
Yes, we're having healthy,
affection-based sex on a regular basis.

36
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,381
Twice a day sometimes.

37
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,781
Why won't you bring him here
for Christmas? Are you ashamed of us?

38
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,858
Of course not.

39
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,941
Taylor's living with him now.
They're having their own Christmas.

40
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,862
Invite them both. I'm cooking a goose.
Don't they like goose?

41
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,668
You really want them,
or are you being politically correct?

42
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,944
Of course I want them to be here.

43
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,941
If he's someone you care about,
then he should be here.

44
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,782
I am sick and tired
of this chip on your shoulder, David!

45
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:43,384
How am I supposed to accept you
if you resent every single attempt I make?

46
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,868
All right, fine.

47
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,226
We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night.
I'll ask him then.

48
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,262
If you both have plans for Christmas Eve...

49
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,068
who's going to midnight service with me?

50
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:04,060
I'd like for you
to go to church with me tomorrow night.

51
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:08,258
And I need to know if you're bringing
anyone to Christmas dinner.

52
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:13,345
- I was thinking about maybe asking Toby.
- Toby? I don't know any Toby.

53
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,578
I met him at Aunt Sarah's,
and we've been out a couple of times.

54
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,065
Doesn't Toby have a family of his own
to spend Christmas with?

55
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,265
His parents are pagans.

56
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:26,468
It's not his fault.

57
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:30,299
When are you going to invite him?
I need to know how many yams to buy.

58
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,904
Look, if he's coming,
I'll tell him to bring his own yam.

59
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,298
And when are we going
to decorate the tree?

60
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:38,458
You need to calm down.

61
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,109
Christmas is the day after tomorrow.
What about tonight?

62
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,986
I can't. I made plans.

63
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,502
Me, too.

64
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:47,259
I'm already doing the church thing.

65
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:51,818
I wish I knew what I did
to deserve such morose, surly children.

66
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,059
I'll be so glad
when these fucking holidays are over.

67
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,825
Baby, you're making it worse.

68
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:07,107
How come you can make
a squashed face look like new...

69
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,941
but you can't even fix a stupid wall?

70
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,497
It's the Sheetrock. It's all crumbled.

71
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:14,979
- I know. I'm still picking it out of the couch.
- Okay, Vanessa.

72
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,789
Why don't you tell me
what else I've done wrong lately?

73
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:22,067
I don't understand why you fired Ramon.
He was doing good work. He was cheap.

74
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:24,417
I had my reasons.

75
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,899
You're jealous 'cause he knows how
to fix things and makes you look bad.

76
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,298
I don't want him around here anymore.

77
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,505
Look at you, Rico, you're jealous.

78
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,821
All right, you wanna know
why I fired him? Yeah?

79
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,740
When I came home that afternoon,
he was screwing someone.

80
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,741
A man. Right here against this wall.

81
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,548
- Rico, that's disgusting. Stop lying.
- I'm not lying.

82
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:47,540
He was screwing a frigging man!

83
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,985
Right here, right in my fucking house,
he was screwing a man!

84
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,623
Oh, my God.

85
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,503
And that's why I fired him. Okay?

86
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,182
Oh, my God!

87
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:06,782
Okay, if you were a gay mortician,
what would you want for Christmas?

88
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,102
A new life?

89
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,428
- I hate Christmas.
- I hear you.

90
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:18,946
It's such pressure
to live up to these images.

91
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,944
The whole family
sitting around the dinner table...

92
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,623
as Mom, dressed in
her special Christmas apron...

93
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,825
serves a meal
that she spent three days making.

94
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,706
I mean, who has that?

95
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,538
I do.

96
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:32,788
You're kidding.

97
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,588
Just add the smell of death
and people crying downstairs...

98
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,580
you've got my life exactly.

99
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,787
- It doesn't sound half bad, actually.
- It's awful.

100
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,459
No, awful is when you celebrate
the winter solstice...

101
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,540
by watching your father play the recorder...

102
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,506
while your mother
dances around a bonfire...

103
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,023
chanting hymns to Gaea, the earth goddess.

104
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,981
Sure, it's funny to you.

105
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:03,141
So do you want to have Christmas dinner
with my creepy family?

106
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:06,386
Are you kidding? I would love it.
Do you really want me to?

107
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,380
It was my mother's idea.

108
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,377
Ever since my last boyfriend
tried to kill himself...

109
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:14,425
robbed a store, and shot at a guy...

110
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,866
before disappearing off the face of the earth,
she wants to meet everyone I date.

111
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,339
- A biker funeral?
- I know what you're thinking...

112
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:23,657
but they seem pretty cool.

113
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,786
Are you kidding? I love biker funerals.
These guys have big money.

114
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,064
They all have Harley dealerships
or repair shops...

115
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,663
And methamphetamine labs
in their basements.

116
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,144
Whatever. Money is money.

117
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,540
Mrs. Johnson, I'm David Fisher.
I've very sorry about your loss.

118
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,857
Thank you.

119
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,862
This is Pete, a close friend of the deceased.
This is my brother, David.

120
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,345
And this is Marilyn's brother, Bitsy.

121
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,021
As in Itsy.

122
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:56,744
So, is there a casket that appeals to you?

123
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,308
It's gotta be steel.

124
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:01,741
The Camry here is 20 gauge stainless steel.

125
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,428
That sounds foreign.

126
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,422
No, I assure you, it's built right here
in the United States of America.

127
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,859
All right. As long as it's the best.

128
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,267
Jesse never liked
to have a fuss made over him.

129
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,857
He always said that when his time comes...

130
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,457
just set him out by the curb on trash day.

131
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,063
But...

132
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,426
I want to do right by him.
He was a good man.

133
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,340
He was the fucking best!

134
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:34,137
Now, we want the casket airbrushed
the same as his gas tank.

135
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:38,068
It's midnight-purple with orange flames.

136
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,788
- I'm not sure...
- I'll give you the number of the guy...

137
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:43,508
that's restoring Jesse's hog.
He can do it all at once.

138
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,102
That is a hell of a bike.

139
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:49,023
And on the inside of the casket lid,
we want a picture of Marilyn here.

140
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:52,820
You know, so she's looking down on him
for all eternity.

141
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,303
That was Jesse's favorite picture of me.

142
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,787
It was <i>Hustler's</i> Beaver Hunt, April of '86.

143
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,028
It's a very nice picture of you.

144
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,987
Isn't it? I usually hate pictures of myself.

145
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,504
We're gonna need a couple of kegs of Bud...

146
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,739
and a case of Jack for the service.

147
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,986
I want this done right.

148
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,307
It's gonna be
one big-ass Christmas Day funeral.

149
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,709
Sorry. Christmas is the one day
we don't hold services.

150
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,859
We'd pay whatever it takes.

151
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:30,464
A big-ass Christmas Day funeral it is.

152
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,109
So we're gonna be working
on Christmas Day.

153
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,944
We've had worse Christmases.

154
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,662
Yeah, we have.

155
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,388
Do you remember
the last time you saw him?

156
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:51,978
No.

157
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:57,619
<i>I can't believe it's Thanksgiving already.</i>

158
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,547
What happened to this year?

159
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,940
I know. You can't even go anywhere
that isn't all decked out...

160
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,463
with candy canes and Santa heads and shit.

161
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,187
It's all so phony.

162
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,223
I think in Hell it's always Christmas.

163
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:14,623
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,423
Hey, buddy-boy.

165
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,341
What are you doing out here?

166
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,738
I had to take a break.
It was just too much food.

167
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,297
I know. Your mother's been baking all week.

168
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,860
She outdid herself this year.

169
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,500
So, how's Seattle treating you?

170
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,422
It's all right, I guess. I got no complaints.

171
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:41,863
Me, neither.

172
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,062
Not many people can say that,
you know, and mean it.

173
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,309
I guess we've got a lot to be thankful for.

174
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,028
Either that, or we've
lowered our expectations so much...

175
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:56,669
we've given up on anything better than this.

176
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,222
Oh, boy.

177
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,698
Listen, I gotta pick up a body...

178
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,504
so I'm not gonna be able
to drive you to the airport.

179
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,581
- That's okay. I can take him.
- Thank you, kitten.

180
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,180
You coming down for Christmas?

181
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,268
Yeah, I think so.
I gotta see how my schedule works out.

182
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,907
It's good to see you, son.

183
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,377
You, too, Dad.

184
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,661
Take care of yourself.

185
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,460
Anything I can help you with?

186
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,865
Yes, I'm looking for clothes so expensive...

187
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,747
only an idiot would buy them.
Oh, there they are.

188
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:13,305
- Excuse me.
- Be my guest.

189
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,103
Excuse me.

190
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,422
Your wife would like you to see
how she looks in her Jil Sanders sweater.

191
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:22,141
And I think you should leave,
or I'll have to call security.

192
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,422
Do you validate?

193
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:29,983
You smell good.

194
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,262
It's the flowers.

195
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,741
You are so beautiful.

196
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,468
I am not.

197
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:40,021
Did you not wear panties today like I asked?

198
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:43,626
I most certainly did not
not wear panties today.

199
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,586
- Why not?
- It's unhygienic.

200
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,344
What kind of panties did you wear?

201
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,347
Something sexy?

202
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,547
No, they're not sexy.

203
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,099
They are Fruit of the Loom
control top briefs...

204
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,908
and they come three to a pack
for $15 at Target.

205
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,787
I want you to go into the bathroom
and take them off...

206
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,941
- and then hide them someplace in my office.
- I will not.

207
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:16,627
And I wish you'd
stop talking to me that way.

208
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,904
You don't like when I talk dirty?

209
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,701
I didn't say that.

210
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:22,939
I don't like it here at work.

211
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:35,498
When I was shopping today,
this total stranger felt me up.

212
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,741
- That's irritating.
- No, it was really hot.

213
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,741
He was giving me the eye...

214
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,138
so I went over
and stood right next to him, like:

215
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,265
"What are you gonna do about it, pal?"

216
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:50,228
And he puts his hand on my ass
very tentatively.

217
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,700
I know, it was so polite.

218
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:58,947
So I took his hand
and I just put it inside me.

219
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,789
I mean, if you're gonna do it, do it.

220
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:07,178
Wow!

221
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,180
Does this mean you have...

222
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,821
maybe some mixed feelings
about marrying Nate?

223
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,178
No.

224
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,583
Seriously, that's not it at all.

225
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:26,298
I think it's just natural biological drive
at work.

226
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,497
The need to sample as diverse
a selection of people as possible...

227
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,978
before settling down with one mate.

228
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:35,948
It's normal.

229
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,138
Anyway, I got another chapter out of it.

230
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,780
Do you know
where the jaundice solution is?

231
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,461
Mrs. Doyle's looking very yellow.

232
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:16,700
It's back-ordered.
Use the ColorGuard. 10 ounces a gallon.

233
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,382
Take a little break.

234
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,258
Here, have some eggnog.

235
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:25,423
This isn't eggnog. It's whiskey.

236
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,660
Whiskey? It's rum, my boy.
The drink of holidays.

237
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,148
You know, when you were little,
you always wanted to...

238
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,699
leave milk and cookies out on the tray
for Santa Claus. Remember?

239
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:37,778
Yeah.

240
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,988
And you used to laugh and say,
"What Santa really needs is a shot."

241
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,617
And I was right.

242
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:47,065
I always thought you meant a shot,
like a shot of penicillin.

243
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:57,228
- I should...
- David, it's Christmas. Come on.

244
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,819
Spend a little time among the living.

245
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,379
Sit down with your pop
and tell me what you want for Christmas.

246
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,505
Mrs. Doyle's viewing's at 4:00.

247
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,819
Mom said she might have
a special guest for dinner.

248
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:36,823
All right.

249
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,744
If he's anything like
her past special guests...

250
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,583
he's a 24-year-old Venezuelan pool boy
who makes up for his lack in English...

251
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,978
by being fluent
in the language of power-fucking.

252
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,867
I'll try not to get into a conversation
with him.

253
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:54,584
Hey, Bren, hold on just a sec.

254
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,268
Do you remember what happened
a year ago today?

255
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,267
Oh, God, I'm sorry, your father...

256
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,624
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

257
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:09,782
It's our anniversary.

258
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,382
Oh, my God!

259
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,223
Of course.

260
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,462
It's hard to believe it's only a year ago
that we met.

261
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,540
Yeah, it feels like 20 years.

262
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,541
If you don't want to be with me,
then don't, all right?

263
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,745
Nate, I'm kidding. Come on.

264
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,305
Of course I want to be with you. I love you.

265
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,539
Then why do you treat me like shit
all the time?

266
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,779
Because I had a really fucked-up life...

267
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:36,942
and I use sarcasm to hide
how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.

268
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,940
Come on. Jesus, you know that.

269
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,667
Happy anniversary.

270
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,987
I know I already got you another ring, but...

271
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,348
I can't believe you...

272
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,547
It was my grandmother's.
It didn't cost me anything.

273
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:01,741
Merry Christmas.

274
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,062
It's okay.

275
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,104
I love you.

276
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,266
Well, it's about time.

277
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:25,059
- Hey, Mom, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

278
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,501
Nate, Merry Christmas.

279
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,777
I know there's some mistletoe
around here some place, God damn it!

280
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,542
What's wrong, honey? You look like shit.

281
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,427
- Enjoying a Scotch, Mom?
- Not nearly enough.

282
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,217
Sweetheart, would you freshen up my drink?

283
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,744
Come on, give your sister a big kiss.

284
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,223
I told you we were having a special guest.

285
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,338
Yes.

286
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:10,108
- I just didn't expect...
- To see your crazy brother. Sure.

287
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:11,938
Don't worry...

288
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:16,386
they pumped enough electricity through me
to light up the Eastern Seaboard.

289
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,539
Kidding. I'm sorry, Bren.

290
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,178
Come on, lighten up. It's Christmas.

291
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,228
- Come on, go get me another drink.
- Okay.

292
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,622
Mom, what the hell is he doing here?

293
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,700
I busted him out for Christmas.

294
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,181
- You could've warned me.
- Warned you?

295
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:41,142
You need to be warned
about seeing your own brother?

296
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,743
Ever since he came at me
with a knife? Yeah.

297
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,379
Okay, so how long is he out for?

298
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,221
For good. He's living with me now.

299
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,899
So I guess you're happy to be home.

300
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:09,543
Happy is a concept I try not to buy into.

301
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,700
It just gets me into trouble.

302
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,462
Listen, Nate...

303
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,147
I'm really sorry
about everything that happened.

304
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,937
I know I have to take responsibility
for what I did...

305
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:30,418
but I was sick.

306
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,385
And now you're not?

307
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,142
I'm still sick.

308
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,148
I'll always be sick.

309
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,700
Just the cards I was dealt.

310
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:52,300
I can manage it through medication,
for the most part...

311
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:57,298
but it's something I'll have to live with
for the rest of my life.

312
00:23:58,589 --> 00:23:59,988
It's not up to me.

313
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:04,858
Merry Christmas!

314
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:07,747
We can't stay long
because my mother's watching the kids.

315
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,468
Ramon, you shaved. You look so young.

316
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:13,820
- We brought some presents for the boys.
- Thank you. You're so sweet.

317
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,706
Just little things. Where are they?

318
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,542
Augusto's asleep. Julio's in the den
watching <i>The Grinch...</i>

319
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,540
for about the thousandth time.

320
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:23,499
I'll just put these under the tree.

321
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:28,467
Oh, please!
You haven't gotten that wall fixed yet?

322
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,268
Ramon would have had it finished by now.

323
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,664
What possessed you to make fig pudding?

324
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:36,821
It sounded Christmassy.

325
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:39,106
Well, it looks like throw up.

326
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:41,387
None of it was very good.

327
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,540
Be nice.

328
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,187
Make better stuff.

329
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,587
How about
if we sing some Christmas carols?

330
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,619
Come on, I got a CD.
We can all sing along to it.

331
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,665
You've gotta be kidding me.

332
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:56,740
Come on, we'll scare the neighbors.

333
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,865
Okay, you two sing songs.

334
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,827
I'm gonna go get a Ding Dong
and watch <i>The Simpsons.</i>

335
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:06,461
- Motherfuck!
- Keith, relax.

336
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:09,983
I just wanted her to have a good Christmas,
you know?

337
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:12,788
After everything that she's been through.

338
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:17,859
You've been through a lot yourself lately.
You can afford to cut yourself some slack.

339
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,503
It doesn't mean you're a doormat.

340
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,382
- Are you sleeping any better?
- Not really.

341
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,744
I was reading an article
on post-traumatic stress...

342
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,138
I'm not suffering from anything, David.

343
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:44,187
What happened, happened.
It's a part of my job.

344
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,941
Let's just move on.

345
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:01,379
Why don't you and Taylor come to my house
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?

346
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:04,347
- Why?
- Because I'd like for you to be there.

347
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,497
Then why'd you wait until the night before
to ask me?

348
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:10,422
Because my mom didn't bring it up
until yesterday.

349
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,828
Your mother.

350
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:15,942
Jesus, Keith, all I did was invite you over
for Christmas dinner.

351
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,268
I don't think Taylor's quite ready
for something like this yet.

352
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,781
Are you sure Taylor's the one
who's not ready?

353
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:33,740
Just help me pick out a few poinsettias,
and we can be on our way to church.

354
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,183
Dear God!

355
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,342
What happened?

356
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,461
Oh, my goodness!

357
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:48,824
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Were you robbed?

358
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:52,341
- Did they hurt you?
- I am hurt, yes.

359
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:53,908
Where are you hurt?

360
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,981
There was fight. They break my legs.

361
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,506
We have to get you to the hospital.
Claire, back the car up to the door.

362
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,778
Mom?

363
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,305
You should take that down.

364
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,425
No. I love it.

365
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,941
- You look so mysterious.
- It's kind of ghoulish.

366
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:29,629
I don't like to think of myself
in that way anymore.

367
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:32,098
Then you'll just have to take
a new picture for me...

368
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,907
of how you feel now.

369
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,262
I know!

370
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,746
You should take Brenda
and Nate's wedding photos.

371
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:47,502
We're engaged.

372
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,221
Congratulations.

373
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:58,821
That is so great.

374
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,538
Thank you.

375
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:04,099
I love it when people
who really should get married do.

376
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,182
It doesn't happen that often, you know.

377
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,386
Now, you just hush.

378
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,582
It's true.

379
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,699
I can't believe she got Billy
out of the hospital...

380
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:25,257
so she would not have
to spend Christmas alone.

381
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:27,067
Fucking evil bitch.

382
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,107
He's not ready.

383
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,148
Really? I thought
he actually seemed pretty okay.

384
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:38,188
He's not okay. He's sick,
and nobody wants to deal with it.

385
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,659
Which is the way it's always fucking been!
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

386
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:45,708
I've been a fucking nursemaid
more than enough for one lifetime.

387
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,627
Merry Christmas.

388
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:07,904
You're bashful.
Don't worry. I don't see nothing.

389
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:10,187
Good morning, dear.

390
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,863
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

391
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:15,864
You haven't taken your painkillers.

392
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:19,544
- I hate pills. They make me crazy.
- Shut up and take them.

393
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:21,381
Shouldn't he be in the hospital?

394
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:25,018
We were there half the night
waiting for a doctor after you left.

395
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,021
- This is so hot!
- Merry Christmas, everybody.

396
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:35,419
He's gonna be here eight weeks?
You've gotta be kidding me.

397
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,898
That's how long he has to stay off his legs.

398
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,900
Mom, surely there's a better arrangement.

399
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:43,265
He has two broken legs.
What was I supposed to do with him?

400
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,624
He doesn't even have insurance.

401
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,142
- Then who's paying for all...
- I am.

402
00:29:55,989 --> 00:30:00,585
David, later this afternoon,
I want you to lift Nikolai into his wheelchair.

403
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:11,262
<i>There was that time we was coming down</i>
<i>the big hill at Lone Pine.</i>

404
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,137
I hit a patch of ice and went down.

405
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,061
Jesse comes barreling around that hairpin.

406
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,741
He seen me there in the middle of the road.

407
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,498
And instead of running me over...

408
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,067
he laid his bike down
and slid it into a bunch of trees.

409
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:30,140
He busted out his teeth.

410
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:34,946
'Cause that's just the kind of man
that he was.

411
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:37,708
A-fucking-men.

412
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:43,502
He was a fine friend and a good husband.

413
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,988
"From Jay Leno."

414
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:47,981
Sure, he always sends flowers.
Never comes.

415
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:51,347
This world's a lot worse off without him.

416
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:56,219
The In-N-Out truck's out back.

417
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:00,627
We're gonna put on Jesse's favorite song...

418
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:03,269
and folks can help themselves
to some grub.

419
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,583
My brother lives up there,
which I've always been jealous of.

420
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,386
Once, when I was in junior high...

421
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:20,267
my dad was embalming someone
in the basement.

422
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:24,547
And the plumbing got backed up
and blood started squirting out of this hose.

423
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:29,141
- It was like a scene from <i>The Shining.</i>
- Nasty.

424
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,821
It was the first time I really thought about
what they did down there.

425
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,623
- Hello.
- Mom, this is Toby.

426
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:42,223
- Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
- You, too, Toby.

427
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:45,381
- Thank you for joining us today.
- Thank you for having me.

428
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:50,065
Claire, surely that's not what you're
planning to wear for Christmas dinner?

429
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:54,745
No, I've got my Laura Bush pantsuit
on underneath. I didn't want to get it dirty.

430
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,381
Please, come in.

431
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,743
So, what did you get me for Christmas?

432
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:17,578
- Who the fuck lives in Reseda?
- So, what did you get me for Christmas?

433
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,979
Why are you even asking me?
You've barely ever spoken to me.

434
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:22,903
Who else is gonna be there?

435
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:25,423
I always wanted a silk smoking jacket.

436
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:27,784
- Dad, I'm on the phone.
- Something really garish...

437
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,064
with big embroidered peacocks.

438
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,508
Look, I've gotta go.
Just e-mail me directions.

439
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:36,183
Maybe I'll show up and maybe I won't.

440
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,422
God, can't a person
have a phone conversation around here?

441
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:43,943
Somebody special, huh? What's his name?

442
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:48,462
- Gabriel. Trust me, he's not that special.
- Don't waste your time with him, kitten.

443
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,825
- Because you deserve somebody special.
- Right.

444
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:56,107
You wanna go with me later to the airport
and pick up your big brother?

445
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,544
I can't. I've got last-minute shopping to do...

446
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,984
Could you try to be home for dinner?

447
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:05,142
Because we hardly ever have
the whole family together, and it's...

448
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:13,747
Merry Christmas.

449
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:18,662
- What's going on in here?
- Biker funeral.

450
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,663
- Can't we stay down here?
- Very funny.

451
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,497
Hey, Pete.

452
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,545
We're about to head upstairs
and have our Christmas dinner.

453
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,618
So?

454
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,543
- You've been here all day...
- Probably gonna be here all night.

455
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:35,103
You go on and eat. We don't need you.

456
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:45,467
It'll be fun.
Nikolai's out of his mind on Percodan.

457
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:49,098
Well, I think that's everything.

458
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:00,423
- Dinner looks amazing, Mrs. Fisher.
- Thank you, Toby.

459
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:05,423
Probably one of the bikers
looking for the bathroom.

460
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,624
Look who's here.

461
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,983
- Hello.
- Hey, Keith.

462
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:10,629
- You made it!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

463
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,581
I hope it's okay that we came by.

464
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:16,105
Of course it's okay.
We're so happy you could join us.

465
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:17,457
Does everyone know Taylor?

466
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,063
Your mom hasn't looked at me
since she saw the ring.

467
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,867
Have some more wine.

468
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:24,060
Hey, Keith. Hey, Taylor.

469
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,266
- That's a skinny turkey.
- It's a goose.

470
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:33,542
This is lovely. We're all here together.

471
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:39,257
Keith, would you say grace for us?

472
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,623
Yeah, sure.

473
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:50,225
Lord, for food in a world
where many walk in hunger...

474
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,426
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear...

475
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,740
and for friends in a world
where many walk alone...

476
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,140
we give you thanks, O Lord,
on this Christmas Day.

477
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:02,024
Amen.

478
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:08,223
- That was lovely, Keith.
- Thank you.

479
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:12,308
Here you go, Nikolai.

480
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:22,104
Your mom will always hate me.

481
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:26,697
That's because you're a woman trying
to steal her baby.

482
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,143
Whatever.

483
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,507
Toby seems nice.

484
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,786
Yes, Toby's very nice.

485
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,422
Not your type, huh?

486
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:46,301
A deranged psychopath?
No, I guess he isn't.

487
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,859
Billy told me once that...

488
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:54,585
he got so used to living with crazy people...

489
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:58,457
that when he was sharing a room
with a guy who thought he was Pinocchio...

490
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:03,225
the only thing that seemed weird about it
was that the guy pronounced it "Pino-chio."

491
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,738
So you've been talking to Billy?

492
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:10,099
Yeah, mostly through e-mail.

493
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:13,587
- He's really funny.
- Isn't he?

494
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,901
I've got a huge headache.
Can we go home now?

495
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,941
Bren, I'm working.

496
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:49,143
I'm leaving.
Come home when you can, okay?

497
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,503
I promise.

498
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:58,223
Where do you keep your toilet plunger?

499
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,388
Morning, Mr. F.

500
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:41,824
Rico, what are you doing here?
It's Christmas Eve.

501
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,104
Yeah, I have to do Mrs. Doyle.

502
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,181
- Her viewing is this afternoon.
- Let David take care of it.

503
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:50,864
- No, she's pretty simple.
- That's why I want David to do her.

504
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,703
I like to feed him the slow pitches,
if you know what I mean.

505
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:56,858
Sure.

506
00:37:57,189 --> 00:37:59,783
I'm serious, kiddo.
Get the hell out of here. Go home.

507
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:02,178
Spend the day with the little one.

508
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:06,057
They grow up so fast,
you gotta enjoy it while it lasts. Go on.

509
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,468
Thanks, Mr. F.

510
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,387
- You have a merry Christmas.
- I intend to.

511
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:33,147
- She took my kids back to her mothers'.
- What?

512
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,027
You couldn't keep your fucking mouth shut.

513
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,347
Stop it!

514
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:43,148
- Merry fucking Christmas, Rico.
- Are you okay?

515
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:46,062
- Baby?
- You fucking told her?

516
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:49,900
I had to. I couldn't even look her in the eye.

517
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:53,186
She was so happy yesterday.
She told me she got him a Rolex watch.

518
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,181
- She has a right to know.
- I told you not to fucking tell her!

519
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:58,021
I'm sorry. I had to!

520
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:01,141
Fucking homo!

521
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,147
Fucking fuck!

522
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,827
They must not like that dead man too much.

523
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:27,946
Why do you say that?

524
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,622
Because they're all so happy he's dead.

525
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:38,341
I think it's about time we get you home.

526
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,058
No, but it's Christmas,
and I want to watch the funeral.

527
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:43,697
Too bad.

528
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,505
I'm really glad you came.

529
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:51,222
Why don't you come back with us?
I could make some hot chocolate.

530
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,946
I got a present or two that I didn't want you
to open in mixed company.

531
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:02,379
Let me talk to Nate.
I'll see if we can wrap this up.

532
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,862
- I think we should start moving them out.
- No, it's Christmas.

533
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:19,427
- Keith asked if I wanted to go with him.
- Go.

534
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:22,907
- I've got everything under control.
- Okay.

535
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:24,943
Thanks.

536
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:30,738
- Merry Christmas, Nate.
- You, too.

537
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:53,506
- What do you say we get out of here?
- You're not having fun?

538
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:57,628
No. This is like every party my parents have,
only with better music.

539
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:01,139
Where do you want to go?

540
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,979
We could drive around Hancock Park
and look at the Christmas lights.

541
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:09,822
Yeah, right. Not without a carton of eggs.

542
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,420
Why are you so hostile?

543
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,545
- I'm not hostile.
- Yes, you are.

544
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:22,861
You act like you're incredibly put out by,
I don't know, being alive.

545
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,382
Maybe you think that's cool, but really...

546
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:28,500
it's just irritating.

547
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:35,144
Okay, thanks for the input,
which is totally irrelevant, but...

548
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,502
Apparently you need to feel all superior
or something.

549
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:41,661
I mean, if you just take a look at your life...

550
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:44,789
you really don't have that much
to be angry about.

551
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,101
- You don't know anything about my life.
- Yeah, and I'm not really sure I want to...

552
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:52,499
considering how you like
to shit all over everything.

553
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:55,424
You know what?

554
00:41:55,509 --> 00:42:00,105
I fully support your little desire
to have a life you'd see on Nickelodeon...

555
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:03,541
but I don't support
you being a judgmental dick.

556
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,060
Maybe I should just go.

557
00:42:10,669 --> 00:42:11,818
Maybe.

558
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,025
Okay. Merry Christmas.

559
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:16,857
Whatever.

560
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,379
I'm glad I could spend one last Christmas
with Jesse.

561
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:32,905
He was a crazy son of a bitch,
but I sure loved him.

562
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:35,142
I can tell.

563
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:40,428
God, did he know how to live!
It was full throttle all the way.

564
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:45,985
We met in Sturgis, back in '<i>7</i>8.

565
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:51,267
I was sitting at The Broken Spoke
with the biggest badass in town.

566
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:53,028
But Jesse...

567
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,505
he had some balls on him.

568
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:00,905
He walked right up to me, I'll never forget it,
and he said:

569
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:06,539
"If I don't ask you to take a ride with me
I'll regret it the rest of my life."

570
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:09,864
And that ride lasted 23 years.

571
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:17,019
He always said his two favorite things
were riding his hog and riding me.

572
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:21,024
And he treated us both like queens.

573
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:25,623
You're probably wishing
he treated himself as carefully.

574
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:29,065
Honey, it just wasn't in his blood.

575
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:34,739
If he were a careful man,
he might have lived longer...

576
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:39,987
but would he have enjoyed his life as much?

577
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:44,708
Would I have enjoyed his life as much?

578
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,384
I had a bike in high school.

579
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,302
Had it for about a week before I wiped out.

580
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,425
Just fucked it up royally.

581
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:00,619
I still have a pin in my foot.

582
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:06,700
- I never got back on a bike after that.
- I could never give it up. No way.

583
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:11,065
Closest thing to flying
without leaving the ground.

584
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:18,308
Sometimes I fool myself into thinking
I've lived my life to the fullest.

585
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:21,620
But compared to you and Jesse
I think I've got a lot to learn.

586
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:26,066
Honey, if I were a few years younger
I'd be willing to teach you.

587
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,059
I just might let you.

588
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:37,626
Jesse always said you gotta live every day
like you might die tomorrow.

589
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:40,661
- 'Cause you know what?
- You just might.

590
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:40,185
Here's a glass of water.

591
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:41,943
I couldn't find a bell.

592
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,748
So if you need me during the night,
just yell very loudly.

593
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,342
I will be fine.

594
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:49,901
Did you call the police yet to file a report?

595
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,380
No, I will do that later.

596
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,305
I'll put this where you can reach it.

597
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,586
- I don't like for you to do this.
- Don't be silly.

598
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:06,628
You have two broken legs,
and you need someone to take care of you.

599
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:09,701
And I'm happy to do it,
so stop making a fuss.

600
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,138
What?

601
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,383
Nothing.

602
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,140
What I told you before.

603
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:22,386
That you are beautiful.

604
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,577
Stop it.

605
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:07,498
- I had the swirl in the dip just right.
- Just one for the road.

606
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:10,626
- Airport traffic's gonna be murder.
- Then you should get going.

607
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:12,062
All right.

608
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,220
I want to stay up and play
with what Santa Claus brought me.

609
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:48,742
Give it up, Taylor.

610
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:51,548
I could make you guys a cupcake
with my Easy-Bake oven.

611
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:54,063
He's a cop. He doesn't take bribes.

612
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:59,908
- Merry Christmas, baby.
- Mama!

613
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:06,184
I drove all day long just so I could be here.
That's how much your mama loves you.

614
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,342
I love you, too, Mama. I knew you'd come.

615
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:15,222
Billy didn't call or e-mail me all day.

616
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:17,263
So?

617
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,064
So, you know, it's Christmas.

618
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,782
You didn't exactly give him
a warm greeting last night.

619
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:28,066
That's what I'm saying.
If he'd written me, told me he'd be there...

620
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:31,141
I wouldn't have been so freaked out
by the whole thing.

621
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:33,789
Do you ever call or e-mail him?

622
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:37,666
Yeah, I e-mailed him in the hospital
last summer...

623
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:39,785
but he never wrote back.

624
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:45,624
He e-mails Claire all the time.

625
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:47,218
What?

626
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:51,668
Yeah, even while we were there,
she was running off to check her mail.

627
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,059
Wait, when did this start?

628
00:48:58,149 --> 00:49:01,744
- Did you bring any of that reindeer cake?
- I asked you a question.

629
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:03,820
I don't know. She just told me tonight.

630
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:07,663
I don't want Billy having anything
to do with Claire, you understand that?

631
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:10,582
Why not? You said that he was okay.

632
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:14,222
He's okay enough
to walk down the street without a leash...

633
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:16,823
but he's not okay enough
to be near my sister...

634
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:20,265
who we both know
has this fucked-up attraction to sociopaths.

635
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:23,227
- Don't tell me...
- I am telling you. He is your brother!

636
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:26,267
You keep him away.
And if you don't, I swear to God, I will!

637
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:27,907
What are you gonna do, Nate?

638
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:32,107
- Challenge him to a duel?
- Brenda, would you knock it the fuck off?

639
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:35,340
- Why don't you wear a cowboy cap...
- Would you fucking listen to me?

640
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:37,465
Will you shut the fuck up?

641
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:39,578
Fuck.

642
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:50,425
- It's okay.
- It's not my fault.

643
00:49:50,669 --> 00:49:52,580
It's okay. It's all right.

644
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:25,907
- Shit.
- Yeah?

645
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:28,539
I think I'm gonna have... Shit.

646
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:36,747
Nate, look at me!

647
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:42,148
Get off! Get the fuck off! I'm fine!

648
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:53,021
Nate, it's okay.

649
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:00,508
What was that?

650
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:10,659
So what are you taking for it?

651
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:12,748
Dilantin.

652
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:17,537
It's an anti-epileptic.
It's supposed to control the seizures.

653
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:21,619
- I thought it did, until tonight.
- We'll talk to your doctor.

654
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:24,701
Maybe we can switch you
to something stronger.

655
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:29,061
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

656
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,903
Why didn't you tell me about this?

657
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:42,424
I didn't want to be a burden.

658
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,225
You'll never be a burden.

659
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:59,618
- Good morning.
- Hi.

660
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,864
Marilyn Johnson left that for you.

661
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:10,901
She had a belt buckle with a big skull on it.

662
00:52:11,749 --> 00:52:13,626
I thought that was odd.
