1
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:50,874
Hi, Mom. And Paul and Patricia.

2
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,194
Well, I'm here.

3
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:56,229
It's not exactly the Holiday Inn,
as you can see.

4
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:02,993
Mostly... Mostly we're filling sandbags
and cleaning vehicle filters.

5
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:05,996
In this war, it's important
to keep the mechanisms clean...

6
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:09,031
...because of all the sand,
which can be as much of a threat...

7
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:15,030
...as any missile that Saddam can send,
Capt. Sommers says.

8
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,949
I can't say much, but pretty soon
we're gonna get into the real action...

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,437
...and we're well-prepared, I'll tell you.

10
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,594
Guys, can you...? Do you mind?
I'm sending this home to my folks.

11
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,680
I'll be done in a minute! Just...
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,480
What else?

13
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:35,271
We're protecting your ass, folks!

14
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,838
I love you, America. Thank you!

15
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:40,796
Bailey, come on, I'm just...

16
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:44,122
- You want to say hello to Victor's folks?
- Hi, Mom!

17
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,360
Come on, you guys, damn it!

18
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,160
Sorry, Mom,

19
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:55,281
Some of these guys are kind of crazy,
They're good soldiers,

20
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,204
I'm getting a lot of responsibility here,

21
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:03,242
I think it's been very beneficial, in terms
of personal leadership skills,,,

22
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,361
,,, and getting a job,
A lot more than had I stayed at home,

23
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,767
Well, I've got a lot to do before
lights out, so until next time,,,

24
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,679
,,, this is Pvt, 1st Class
Victor Kovitch signing off,

25
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,361
Hey, buddy,
brought you the latest South Park,

26
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:43,966
Fuck, David.

27
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,089
Hey, sleepyhead.

28
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:49,056
You know, I had the weirdest dream.

29
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:51,374
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:57,051
This guy comes into my house
at, like, 4 a.m.

31
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,095
He climbs into my bed,
but instead of having his way with me...

32
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,813
...he just passes out!

33
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,570
And all night long, he keeps jerking.

34
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,610
That is weird.

35
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,531
- And he talked in his sleep.
- Yeah, what did he say?

36
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:17,531
It was completely unintelligible,
but angry.

37
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:22,259
- There was even teeth-grinding.
- Well, that explains the headaches.

38
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:26,457
I was thinking that exposure
to formaldehyde gives me a brain tumor.

39
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,656
Would you like some caffeine
with that tumor?

40
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,583
Okay.

41
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,620
- David, I can't.
- Why not?

42
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:41,218
Because last night, I drove Mr. Senopolis'
body to San Jose, then straight back.

43
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:43,578
I barely got four hours' sleep,
and frankly...

44
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,256
...I'm tired of getting the shitty jobs
you don't want.

45
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:49,859
- I'm half-owner of the business,
- You can't legally do intake without me.

46
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,946
You're not a licensed funeral director.

47
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,028
- I'm getting my license next month,
- lf you pass the test.

48
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,828
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

49
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,750
How am I supposed to study
for that test on four hours' sleep?

50
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,589
Coffee and diet pills worked for me.

51
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,986
I can 't pick her up,
I've got a deacon 's meeting,,,

52
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,951
...and Rico's got Vanessa's ultrasound.
- Shit,

53
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,501
Last time I picked somebody up
at a nursing home...

54
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,352
...nobody told the roommate
she was dead. I had to.

55
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:14,589
Just be thankful we've got the business.

56
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,188
Just thankful I'm not you.

57
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,588
What?

58
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:32,551
Oh, it's Mr. Senopolis, sorry.

59
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,069
Fuck, I smell like a dead guy!

60
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:38,748
No, you smell fine. Your life stinks,
you complain all the time...

61
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,188
...and that's really dull.

62
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,389
- Didn't realize I was boring you.
- Nate, you need to take a break.

63
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:50,798
Some major stress release that's not me.
It's too much responsibility.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,879
I thought you liked being
an undertaker's girlfriend.

65
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:59,714
Is that what I am to you?
Your girlfriend?

66
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,873
I like to think of you as my mistress.

67
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:06,474
Well, then, you better start
buying me a lot more shit, mister.

68
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:07,833
God, I love you.

69
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay.

70
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,961
I said it. Let's just move on.

71
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,600
Let's go to Two Bunch Palms
this weekend.

72
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,034
- What?
- Fuck it, yes.

73
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,636
I'm gonna take the weekend off,
and David can bite me.

74
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,198
- This weekend?
- Yeah, we'll sit in hot mud...

75
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,844
...we'll get massages,
we'll eat like pigs, we'll drink a lot.

76
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,721
If we leave Friday night,
we can be naked for two whole days.

77
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:37,445
- I got three clients this Saturday.
- Well, postpone, cancel, lie.

78
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,041
Come on, we've never taken
a trip together. We need to do this.

79
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,127
Two whole days?

80
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,040
- What if we drive each other crazy?
- Well, we don't.

81
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:57,885
Hovering.

82
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:11,485
Claire, I've invited a friend of mine
over for dinner tonight.

83
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:15,484
- Okay.
- And I want you to be nice to him.

84
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:20,052
Is this the guy?

85
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,127
- The guy that...?
- Yes.

86
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,055
Okay.

87
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,892
Thanks for your patience, everybody.
I know we're running late.

88
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,060
By the way, I spoke to Father Clark
this morning. He's holding up well.

89
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,413
He says you folks are the most thorough
search committee...

90
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:47,261
...he has ever encountered.

91
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:51,063
David, I understand you're the last one
to meet with him.

92
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,981
- This afternoon.
- Good.

93
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:56,620
We've been interviewing
associate priests for three months.

94
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,543
It'll be nice to have an open mind.

95
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:04,059
Clark struck me as a player, man of God,
wants to listen, but there's ego there.

96
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,665
You didn't want Jack.

97
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,585
Connie, you say that so easily,
and you know it's not true.

98
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,300
I've never seen you so desperate.

99
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,579
Listen, you folks have to represent
the whole congregation.

100
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,744
And believe me, if Clark's not right...

101
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:19,065
...I'm ready to start from the beginning.
- Let's vote right now.

102
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:23,182
You know him, David. He's been
a visiting rector. You've got his r'esum'e.

103
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,905
All the deacons are here. You can vote
now. I'll be happy to leave the room.

104
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,380
No, I want to meet
with Father Clark myself...

105
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,826
...so I can make
the most informed decision.

106
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,029
This how it works? You bring in
the new-generation deacon...

107
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,746
...the new deacon brings in
the radical priest you want?

108
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,345
I can assure you there's
no agenda here, Mr. Kriegenthaler.

109
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,952
Except yours.

110
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:46,863
Don't worry, Dave. I had a parish
in Ohio where punches got thrown.

111
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,669
Steelworkers.
St. Bart's doesn't even come close.

112
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:54,994
Actually, David,
your father was against Jack here.

113
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,155
And as I said at the time,
your father was wrong.

114
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,631
Roll over,

115
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,869
Okay, okay.

116
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,831
There you go, there you go.

117
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,477
Shit! Fuck, Billy!

118
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,798
- Fuck you!
- I've seen pictures on the Internet, but...

119
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,039
The rule is, you call before
you come over, okay?

120
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,439
Sorry, I was biking down the boardwalk.
I didn't have my cell phone.

121
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:33,440
Good morning, Nate.

122
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,191
Bill.

123
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:39,472
I got some great shots of these hookers
on Sunset I want to show you.

124
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:43,359
Real human tragedy shit.
I think they're really good.

125
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:54,122
Well, your mom walked in on us once...

126
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,795
...so I guess we're even.

127
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:01,321
This chick has seen
the fucking worst life has to offer.

128
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:05,522
- Jesus, Billy, these are incredible.
- And what is that thing on her neck?

129
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,482
She's got, like, this big tumor,
and she's still turning tricks.

130
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:12,808
And you just know there is some freak
for whom that is a big turn-on.

131
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,571
I love the Bank of America
in the background.

132
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,320
- Well, I have to go to work.
- Bring out your dead!

133
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,045
They're great.

134
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:24,528
Don't forget,
cancel those appointments on Saturday.

135
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:35,126
See you later.

136
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,243
So, what's Saturday?

137
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:42,287
We're going to California Cactus World
out on Rosemead Boulevard.

138
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:45,408
I want to get something really weird
to plant out back.

139
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,736
- Yo, Dave!
- In here!

140
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:56,735
I'm sorry, there was an accident
on the 405. Both cars totaled.

141
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,452
I should've handed out cards.

142
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,778
This is Paul Kovitch.
His brother, Victor, just passed away.

143
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,454
- I'm sorry.
- This is my brother, Nate.

144
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,452
Paul Kovitch,
you went to Bonaventure High.

145
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,620
- Yeah.
- I was there when you pinned that guy...

146
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:16,336
...and won the wrestling championship.
You were the man!

147
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,138
Me and my friends were jealous
because we knew you were getting laid.

148
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:24,374
- You wrestle?
- No, played baseball, but we always lost.

149
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:28,173
- So, what are you doing now?
- I run Kovitch Trucking up in Camarillo.

150
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,501
Why, so you know how expensive
you can be?

151
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,862
- No...
- Paul and I were just going over...

152
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,943
...the options for his brother's funeral.

153
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,785
Okay, I run a business too.
Let's just cut right to it.

154
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,217
- Of course.
- I buried both my parents...

155
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,260
...and, no offense,
but I hate you guys. I hate what you do.

156
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,221
The whole thing of "let's gather
and look at this plastic...

157
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:49,147
...dead version of our loved one."
It's really twisted.

158
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:52,659
I want Victor cremated.
No coffin.

159
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,146
Put him in one of those cardboard boxes
you charge 100 bucks for.

160
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,822
I'll take him up to where
our mother's buried up in Tehachapi...

161
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,067
...and let his ashes blow away.

162
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:05,946
I see Victor's a veteran. If you like, we
can research benefits he might be due.

163
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:11,386
No, Vic hated the Army. Me and him
been fighting the Army for seven years.

164
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:17,983
His unit cleaned up a place
called Bunker 73 in the Iraqi desert.

165
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:21,743
Chemicals all over,
Saddam's stuff we blew up.

166
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,752
As soon as he came back, he got sick.

167
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:27,346
Lung cancer at the age of 29,
never smoked a day in his life.

168
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:30,946
Still, no one will say the words
"Gulf War Syndrome."

169
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:34,473
He just wasted away
in and out of that hospital.

170
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:42,350
So fuck the Army.
Let them keep their fucking money.

171
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:45,392
I gotta fly up to Idaho Falls
to tell my stepfather.

172
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,910
He's got Alzheimer's.
I don't know if he'll hear me or not.

173
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,793
You're absolutely sure
you wouldn't like the opportunity...

174
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,431
...to say goodbye to Victor before...?
- I already said goodbye.

175
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,869
Just do it.

176
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,040
And as for a receptacle
for his cremains...?

177
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:03,154
A paper sack ought to do just fine.

178
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:08,283
Nine hundred bucks.

179
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,801
Well, he obviously doesn't
know about the Poseidon Society...

180
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:13,636
...or that's 900 we'd be out of.

181
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,399
That guy was the shit
when I was in high school.

182
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,402
You know,
I never knew he had a brother.

183
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:22,121
It's time you introduced yourself.
He's at the VA Hospital.

184
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:25,481
First, I just gotta talk to you
about something.

185
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:29,242
It's out of the question. I cannot spare
you. We have three bodies right now.

186
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,598
Mr. Jacobsen's going
into the ground tomorrow...

187
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:33,998
...and Vic Kovitch
will be toast by the weekend.

188
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,838
What if we get another body? Or two?
We cannot afford to turn down business.

189
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,483
- No, I'm sorry.
- I don't need your permission.

190
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,363
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had two days off?

191
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,768
See, here's the difference.
You're willing to live like that, I'm not.

192
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,088
I've invited my friend Hiram Gunderson
over to dinner tonight.

193
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,805
You're welcome to join us.

194
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,526
Wouldn't a restaurant be better?
This is our home.

195
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,090
This is my home.

196
00:13:57,293 --> 00:14:01,172
Oh, the camping guy. Okay.
Can I bring Brenda?

197
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,330
Hiram will be cooking.

198
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,853
He spent 17 years
as a top chef in Chicago.

199
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:13,015
The critic of the Sun-Times called him
the "father of the new rustic cuisine."

200
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:16,572
And then, he gave it all up
to become a hairdresser.

201
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:19,610
And he has never been happier!

202
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:30,617
You're multiplying differing variables,
so you have to simplify.

203
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,937
Okay, and then finally,
oops, look at that.

204
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,372
Same variable, okay?
Four and four gives us what?

205
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,938
Eight! And finally, these two binomials...

206
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,013
...right here, are exactly the same...

207
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:47,213
...so we what?

208
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,221
Combine!

209
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,133
Two X to the third,
Y to the fourth.

210
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:00,862
Okay?

211
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,578
Any questions?

212
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,617
Claire Fisher.

213
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:11,821
What?

214
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,382
Can you explain this formula
to the class?

215
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,461
Not really.

216
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,057
Maybe if you paid attention
instead of reading.

217
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:23,103
Maybe if you talked about something
that was gonna be useful to me, I would.

218
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,743
Oh, algebra is useless?

219
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,305
I know a lot of physicists
who'd beg to differ.

220
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,905
Well, I don't want to be a physicist.

221
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,023
Algebra forces your mind
to solve problems logically.

222
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:38,464
- It's one of the only perfect sciences...
- You think the world runs on logic?

223
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,586
- Come on, open your eyes.
- I'll see you after class, Miss Fisher.

224
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,065
What are you doing?

225
00:15:56,395 --> 00:16:00,594
All right, now let's try another one,
and I'm gonna make this a little tougher.

226
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:07,710
Okay, X to the A power
times Y to the B power.

227
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,146
Okay, now we've got two...

228
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,437
Of course we have catalogs
for wedding package...

229
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,474
...but you have to come in and look.
I can't show you over the phone.

230
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,595
Website? What website?
We don't have website.

231
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:32,193
Mister, you have to come into my shop
and look at my work.

232
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,514
Website.

233
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:39,271
- The day just gets brighter.
- Hush.

234
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:42,681
So who's dead now,
and what do you need?

235
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,718
Nobody's dead.
I came to return these vases.

236
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:48,559
You should recycle them,
save a little money.

237
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,439
So thoughtful. I am touched.

238
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,682
Don't be silly. It's wasteful, that's all.

239
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,564
Here.

240
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,760
- You still have that sign in the window.
- Yes, you know somebody good?

241
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:04,597
- I do. Me.
- You?

242
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,168
I am interested. Let's talk.
Robbie, I going to lunch.

243
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,885
I'm not going to lunch with you, Nikolai.
I'm seeing someone.

244
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,519
- So what? This is business.
- I hope so.

245
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,361
- Because otherwise, I withdraw my offer.
- Tell me, why I should hire you?

246
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:23,451
I've been working with people for
30 years, and I treat them with respect.

247
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:24,880
I respect people too.

248
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,647
You're pompous and arrogant
and you're full of yourself.

249
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:31,050
- You act like the customer needs you.
- Of course the customer needs me.

250
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,326
- I have what he wants.
- You'll never build a business that way.

251
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,684
I'm better with people
and I know about flowers.

252
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,613
If you don't think so,
you can fire me.

253
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,807
Fire you? How I can fire you?
You don't even work yet.

254
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:50,175
My parish in New Mexico,
I think they were afraid of me.

255
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:54,576
- They recommend you highly.
- They always do after I'm gone.

256
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:59,856
I won't lie to you, David,
I'll push for some change at St. Bart's.

257
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,335
This is one of those congregations
that thinks sitting through church...

258
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,091
...absolves them of moral responsibility
and they can ignore the plight of others.

259
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,896
Don't get me wrong,
they're good people.

260
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,179
They're just lazy.

261
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:18,216
I don't think that's entirely fair, Clark.
We have a homeless outreach...

262
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,698
You know you're the swing vote.

263
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,453
I've been a deacon three weeks. I'm still
getting used to how political this is.

264
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:28,224
Religion is politics, David.

265
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:33,338
Jesus was a revolutionary.

266
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,344
He threatened those in power,
and they had him assassinated.

267
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:38,537
They'd do the same thing
to him today.

268
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:42,376
I'm not sure how much luck you'll
have getting St. Bart's to stage a coup.

269
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:45,824
The last thing that God
wants from us is complacency.

270
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,861
- You should be in the Peace Corps.
- Already done it.

271
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,662
Three years in Nicaragua,
fresh out of divinity school.

272
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,666
That's where I lost my wife.

273
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,546
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,542
The hardest part about my work
is the fact...

275
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:08,381
...that most people don't want
a real relationship with God.

276
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:11,106
Sure, they'll pray
to a man nailed to a cross...

277
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,589
...but they'll ignore the gay kid
who gets strung up...

278
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:17,148
...or the black man
who gets dragged behind a car...

279
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:19,470
...or someone's mother living in a box.

280
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:22,950
Were you this forthcoming
with the other deacons?

281
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,869
Hardly.

282
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:29,104
What did you and Walter Kriegenthaler
talk about?

283
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,147
Golf.

284
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:36,228
So why did you decide
to be so honest with me?

285
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:43,347
Because I can tell that right and wrong
actually matter to you.

286
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,674
Fuck.

287
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,278
This is medieval. We gotta get it fixed
before somebody loses a finger.

288
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,996
You never cared until it was your finger.

289
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:06,921
- Rico, a little help?
- Why should I?

290
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,593
You know, it's because of you I'm gonna
work double shifts this weekend.

291
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:12,635
That's just David being dramatic.

292
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:15,921
We'd have to get at least two new
bodies for that to be necessary.

293
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:19,515
They come in bigger numbers than that.

294
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,322
Just forget it. I know the score.

295
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:26,121
It's never gonna be
Fisher & Sons & Diaz. I know that.

296
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,116
- Let's see what we got.
- This one's a cremation.

297
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:33,718
- Nothing for you.
- Oh, fuck, what is that?

298
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:37,045
Shouldn't just burn people
like they're garbage.

299
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,961
What the...?

300
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,686
Look, it came with fries.

301
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,880
Look at this.

302
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:57,401
Doesn't even look like the same guy,
does it?

303
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,331
This says he applied to be buried
at the National Cemetery.

304
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:05,963
He signed requests
for a flag fold, military escort.

305
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,687
Oh, man.

306
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,251
Then you can't burn him.

307
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,490
I can make him look like that again.

308
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,773
Well, almost.

309
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:19,776
You could ace algebra, Claire,
and we both know it.

310
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,172
"Power rests on the kind
of knowledge one holds."

311
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,333
What's the use of knowing
something useless?

312
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:28,571
- Don't quote Castaneda at me.
- Why not? You quote Bob Dylan at me.

313
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:32,135
- You need algebra for college.
- You're assuming I'm going to college.

314
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,650
You're taking the PSAT tomorrow.
That means you're thinking about it.

315
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,409
Is that the only option? Go to college,
get a job, be a good consumer...

316
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,340
...until you drop dead of exhaustion.
I don't want that!

317
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,418
So, what do you want?

318
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,373
I just want something to matter.

319
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:56,092
Maybe I should wander around the desert
and eat peyote and see God.

320
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,017
Yeah, be a homeless drug addict.

321
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:01,735
You'd get bored with that pretty fast.

322
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:07,221
Hey, have you heard
of the Sierra Crossroads program?

323
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,496
What's that, like,
bungee jumping for Jesus?

324
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:14,622
No, no, it's not affiliated with any
religion. It's actually a great program.

325
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,062
I spent a couple of years there
as an instructor.

326
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,338
- I think you might really like it.
- Why?

327
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,780
Because it would get you out of yourself,
get you out of your head.

328
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:26,345
Now, I'll warn you,
it's hard but exhilarating.

329
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,859
It might give you the challenge
you're looking for.

330
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,947
There's an expedition over spring break.

331
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,506
I could pull some strings,
see if I could get you in.

332
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:37,226
- Why do you care what happens to me?
- Because I like you.

333
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:41,461
And I want to see good things
happen for you, and I know they can.

334
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:47,222
We had to dig his service records
out of St. Louis.

335
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:51,025
Then there's the question of whether
his cancer was service related.

336
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,748
That means finding a doctor
who thinks it was.

337
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,152
It took me four months
to get all the approvals...

338
00:22:57,395 --> 00:23:01,787
...but it means a burial allowance
of up to 1500 from the VA.

339
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,949
Might as well take that stuff too.
I packed it up for him.

340
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,586
That's too bad nobody
told his brother what he wanted.

341
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:09,025
I did.

342
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:13,197
Oh, yeah. I gave Paul the forms.
I found them later in the trash.

343
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,314
It's mostly somebody else's writing
on the forms.

344
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,555
It doesn't match Victor's signature at all.

345
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,953
I filled them out for him.

346
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,393
He tried to do it himself,
but those boxes are pretty small...

347
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,752
...and he shook a lot.

348
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,760
Gulf War Victory Parade?

349
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:38,797
Victor said marching in it
was the proudest moment of his life.

350
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:45,075
Why would he keep it and watch it
over and over if he hated the Army?

351
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:48,800
- Did Paul visit him much?
- Yeah, three or four times a week.

352
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,484
He was really good about it.

353
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:52,438
- So how come he...?
- He couldn't.

354
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,564
Paul would say,
"The fucking Army stole your life, Vic."

355
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,439
And Vic would keep his mouth shut.

356
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,599
I can tell you this.

357
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,926
Victor wanted to believe that what
he did in the Gulf meant something...

358
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:08,883
...that his life was not a waste.

359
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,362
I only counsel. I'm not supposed
to interfere with what the family wants.

360
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,529
So you taped his medals to him, fished
his files out and passed them to me.

361
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,608
Well, you can always blow it off.

362
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:23,121
I mean, you didn't
even know the guy, right?

363
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:34,244
What are you doing?

364
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:37,408
There was a form that said
he's getting a military funeral.

365
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:40,527
- Who authorized this? Nate?
- Yeah.

366
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:42,407
How many times have I told you...

367
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,925
...when Nate gives you instructions,
check with me?

368
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:46,285
Turn him off.

369
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,485
I'll drive him
to the crematorium right now.

370
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,127
Do I have to do it myself?

371
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:58,088
Fucking Nate. Paul Kovitch
is who our contract is with...

372
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:02,651
...and if he finds out about this,
he will either sue us or break our legs.

373
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,690
- Tomatoes right there.
- Okay.

374
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,696
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Mrs. Fisher.

375
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:20,457
Hello, dear.

376
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:25,732
- Hello, I'm Brenda.
- Hiram Gunderson.

377
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,459
I understand you like to camp.

378
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:31,739
Why, yes, I do.

379
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:36,256
I wish I could tell you where Nate is,
but I have no idea.

380
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:39,344
It's okay. I can exist without him.

381
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:46,623
- Toasted sesame seeds in the salad?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

382
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:59,706
There's my little girl.
Claire, honey, this is Hiram Gunderson.

383
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,663
Pleasure to meet you, Claire.

384
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,346
Hi.

385
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,186
This is delicious, Mrs. Fisher.

386
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,587
Hiram is a chef.

387
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:28,184
I can't get enough of his cock!

388
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:37,227
Mom, I need $ 1200 so I can go
to Sierra Crossroads over spring break.

389
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:41,113
And I need you to sign this form,
like, in case I die or something.

390
00:26:41,318 --> 00:26:43,036
Is this a school trip?

391
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,197
No, you go to the mountains
and confront fear...

392
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:49,789
...and get in touch
with your most basic self.

393
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,150
It looks good on your college application.

394
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,319
Sorry I'm late. There was an
accident on the Long Beach Freeway.

395
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:59,671
You always seem to hit
the bad traffic.

396
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,442
- Hi, I'm Nate.
- Hiram, I've heard a lot about you.

397
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:04,758
Well, don't believe a word of it.

398
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:06,998
Hey, I'm sorry.

399
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:09,637
Don't be. I'm having fun.

400
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:13,999
- So, what did I miss?
- I want to go to Sierra Crossroads.

401
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:16,274
We'll talk about it later, Claire.

402
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:18,635
Mom, you should let her go.
Crossroads is great.

403
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,073
- You went?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:23,437
We went kayaking down the Colorado
River the summer I was, what, 17?

405
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:26,604
- I don't think you were even born yet.
- I don't remember this.

406
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,317
That's because I lied to you and Dad.

407
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,445
Dad would never let me go, so I told you
I was going to Sacramento...

408
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,761
...to witness state government in action.

409
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:46,646
Oh, by the way, everyone, I got a job.

410
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,881
- Cool.
- I'll be working at Nikolai's flower shop.

411
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:52,604
I start tomorrow.

412
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,882
It's just part-time.

413
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:58,809
- You didn't tell me about that.
- Didn't I?

414
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,604
Need some help?

415
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:06,445
Incidentally, I dropped Victor Kovitch off
at the Oak Valley Crematory.

416
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,406
I need you to pick him up tomorrow.

417
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:12,244
Oh, fuck, David, he wanted
a military funeral. He filled out the forms.

418
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,446
Is he paying our bill?

419
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:18,046
You were with his brother. It was clear
he did not want the body embalmed.

420
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,451
He could sue us,
and we wouldn't have a case.

421
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,295
Okay, you know what?

422
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,933
When you talk to me like this,
it makes me want to not listen to you.

423
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,687
You and I could lose everything.
Mom could lose her home.

424
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:34,969
Vic is eligible for a bigger allowance
from the VA than we thought.

425
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,134
Really?

426
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,616
- I'm leaving.
- I'll walk you down.

427
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,861
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

428
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:48,018
Why don't you come over,
spend the night?

429
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:51,851
I've gotta be in Pasadena tomorrow.
It would add an extra hour to my trip.

430
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,782
Okay.

431
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,779
Give me five minutes. I'll follow you.

432
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:08,818
- Tonight wasn't so bad, was it?
- I suppose not.

433
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,016
I don't know why I was so nervous.

434
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,379
I mean, for heaven's sake,
I gave birth to those people.

435
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,501
You know what occurred to me tonight
that's really strange?

436
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,421
I wish you'd known my husband.

437
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,547
I think the two of you
would've liked each other.

438
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:41,750
Oh, Ruth.

439
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,945
Who would get me a gift basket?

440
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:48,828
It's probably some Hollywood bigwig
that secretly wants to sleep with you.

441
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:55,232
It's from my brother,
and it is addressed to both of us.

442
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,992
"Sorry about this morning.
Have fun at Cactus World."

443
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:03,745
Who knows.

444
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:06,994
This is nice. We can take it
with us this weekend.

445
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:10,951
I cannot wait to get out of here. I'm in
dire need of some serious relaxation.

446
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:16,034
- Oh, fabulous.
- Smoked oysters.

447
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:17,957
Really, is there any caviar?

448
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,038
No, but there are condoms.

449
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,354
- And, okay, edible underpants.
- That's a little scary.

450
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:31,395
- I'd say this whole thing's a little scary.
- No, it just means he likes you.

451
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:35,880
Believe me, there are guys Billy
didn't like. It's much better this way.

452
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:39,282
I've been meaning to ask you.

453
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:42,522
What's up with those matching tattoos
you and he have?

454
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:47,121
We were in Vegas,
we were very drunk, and...

455
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:48,993
Oh, dear.

456
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:52,083
These things always struck me
as kind of ridiculous.

457
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,163
Would you just stop that?

458
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,723
What does he think we're gonna do
with this? This is, like, hostile.

459
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:02,880
Look, Billy's bipolar. He's medicated.

460
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:07,525
His sense of what's appropriate
can be a little off at times.

461
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:12,005
Look, you have no idea
what he's been through.

462
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:14,687
Don't judge him, please.

463
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,483
All right.

464
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,088
All right.

465
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,883
Thank you.

466
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,968
You're never gonna get out of this one,

467
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,737
I was nowhere near the latrine, sir,
I promise,

468
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:59,527
- Give it up, private, Your ass is busted,
- Yeah, you're in big trouble,

469
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:01,729
But my father's
on the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

470
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:05,574
Well, maybe we can 't court-martial you,
but there is something else we can do,

471
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,334
Yeah, come on, private, yeah,

472
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:16,173
You love that, don 't you?

473
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,699
- Hello?
- David, Walter Kriegenthaler.

474
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,940
- Did you meet with Father Clark?
- Yes, today.

475
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:29,102
We'd like to meet at 9:30 tomorrow
and vote,

476
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:31,499
- Can you make it?
- Absolutely.

477
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,418
Let me ask you a question, David.

478
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:39,022
Do you think Clark is gay?

479
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:46,422
I don't think so. He mentioned something
about having a deceased wife.

480
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:51,782
I mean, I don 't care if he is, I just don 't
want him to push that agenda,

481
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:55,026
You know, marriage, that whole thing,

482
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:59,262
I have a cousin in D.C.
Whose church split because of that.

483
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:01,825
Literally half the congregation left.

484
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:07,464
I don 't want that to happen to St, Bart's,
I've been going there for 40 years,

485
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:12,748
Well, it's late, I'll see you
tomorrow morning, Good night,

486
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:34,590
Okay, I got Victor, but I called
the National Cemetery from the car...

487
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:36,673
...and you know what?
They can bury an urn.

488
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,107
They call it "inurnment."
We can do it today at 3.

489
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,036
Why are you so determined
to sabotage our business?

490
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:44,593
I don't think Paul knew
how his brother really felt.

491
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,712
- Nate, why do you even care?
- Because it's what Victor wanted.

492
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,955
And he deserves it.
He got a raw fucking deal.

493
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,119
Victor Kovitch did not hate the Army.
Watch these tapes he made in the Gulf.

494
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,871
Yes, sir, fuck me, sergeant,

495
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,074
- Fuck, yeah, Give it to me,
- Come on, private,

496
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:07,155
Oh, come on!
Come on, that was funny!

497
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:09,194
I have someplace I have to be.

498
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:12,520
Dave, Dave, it's okay!
I watch porn too!

499
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:43,246
So you guys taking the PSAT
this afternoon too?

500
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,763
Yeah.

501
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:55,529
So, what happens to you guys?

502
00:34:57,652 --> 00:34:59,961
I go to UC Irvine
and Northwestern Law...

503
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:02,562
...meet a totally great guy,
he's a triathlete...

504
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:05,532
...we get married
and I practice law for eight years...

505
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:09,687
...and we get really rich,
and then I have two great kids.

506
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:13,610
- So you're, like, unbelievably happy?
- Kind of.

507
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:17,809
I get a master's in French
and then live in Paris for 6 months...

508
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:21,929
...and hate it, so I come back,
become a TV development executive...

509
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:23,968
...and I work out all the time.

510
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:28,012
I'm fairly miserable and have
a slight substance-abuse problem.

511
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:31,409
- But you look great.
- Thanks.

512
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:34,691
I start an interior-lighting design firm
with my college roommate...

513
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,571
...and it totally takes off...

514
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:39,533
...and then I die of ovarian cancer
before I'm 30.

515
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,931
- Oh, that sucks.
- Tell me about it.

516
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,335
Well, good luck.

517
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,301
What a freak.

518
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:10,624
- Father Jack?
- David. Come in, sit.

519
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:15,661
And call me "Jack." We're beyond that.

520
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:19,619
- Meeting over already?
- Yes.

521
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:25,258
- Damn.
- We all admire Clark's energy...

522
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,745
...but there is some concern
that he may end up being divisive.

523
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,107
As you said yourself, if we have
to start over from the beginning...

524
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,509
And find some conservative lap dog,
who won't challenge anybody?

525
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:40,109
Yeah, that's what we need here.

526
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,831
Scotch?

527
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:46,189
No, thank you.

528
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:50,310
- Clark thought he came on too strong.
- I liked him, Jack.

529
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,068
The world would be better
if there were more like him.

530
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:56,186
I just don't think that he's a good fit
for St. Bart's.

531
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,989
Do you really think that Father Clark
would be happy here?

532
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:02,352
Why should he be happy?
How happy are you?

533
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,313
You're right, I'm not happy.

534
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,951
My life is very complicated
and confusing.

535
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:14,867
I've experienced a lot of loss
recently, my father and my...

536
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,112
And the thing that helps me deal with it
is having a place...

537
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,038
...that hasn't changed
like everything else in my life.

538
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,993
There's a reason they call it
a sanctuary.

539
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:39,039
I think the majority of our congregation
feels the same way...

540
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:41,711
...and my responsibility
is to them, not you.

541
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:46,916
Well, I've got a business to run.

542
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:01,839
Yo.

543
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,965
Speaking.

544
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:10,161
Yes.

545
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:13,281
What can I do for you, Mr. Gilardi?

546
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:18,963
- Here, this is good choice here.
- I don't like yellow.

547
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,563
The bridesmaids' dresses are lilac.

548
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:24,888
If the flowers are yellow,
it's gonna look like an Easter egg hunt.

549
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:28,721
How about white tulips? Very simple.

550
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,684
Just bunched together with a ribbon.

551
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,885
I was kind of thinking I would be
the only one with white flowers.

552
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:37,968
Or you could be the only one holding
a gorgeous bouquet of color...

553
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:40,324
...against your white dress.
- People do that?

554
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:43,254
It's your day.
You can do whatever you want.

555
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,925
Don't you think that would be pretty?

556
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:50,524
- I love the tulips thing.
- Tulips are one of my favorite flowers.

557
00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:55,413
So graceful and classic,
like little ballerinas.

558
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:03,136
Only reason I even met Victor was I
jumped off a humvee and broke my feet.

559
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,371
Here I am in the hospital with this guy
who's dying, listening to me complain.

560
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,293
Playing cards, giving me his dessert.

561
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,416
I wish he didn't die. It sucks.

562
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,254
Thank you.

563
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,739
Have you heard from Paul yet?

564
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,616
Not since I told him his brother
was ready to be picked up.

565
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:29,611
Well, without his consent in writing,
I cannot allow this funeral to take place.

566
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:31,018
Fine.

567
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:32,942
At least we'll know
we made an effort.

568
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:34,822
When we were in the Gulf...

569
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:38,176
...Victor used to make these videotapes
to send home to his family.

570
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:40,781
We were always giving him a hard time...

571
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:44,581
...messing him up.
He was a real good sport.

572
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:47,503
The perpetual optimist.

573
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:51,064
- So my brother ready?
- Yes, he's right in here.

574
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:54,865
- What is this?
- Victor's friends wanted to say goodbye.

575
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:56,821
The hospital referred them.
It's no problem for us.

576
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:58,826
And no charge to you.

577
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:02,621
- Excuse me, are you his brother?
- Yes, I'm Paul.

578
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,498
This man here, I don't know
if you people know it...

579
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,827
...was like a lion for Victor.

580
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,468
He made federal waves
over Victor's disability case.

581
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:21,303
I found a couple pictures of us
playing baseball.

582
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:24,790
Vic was a lousy batter
but a pretty good infielder.

583
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:29,633
He's grinning like such a fool in these.

584
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:33,625
I thought you might like them.

585
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:39,830
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,632
- You sick?
- No.

587
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:46,352
Never got sick. I don't know why.

588
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:48,628
A lot of guys I knew over there did.

589
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:52,308
Thanks.

590
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,632
Thank you for letting Victor
have his military burial.

591
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,149
Even though I know
you were against it.

592
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,070
I'm sure this means a lot to him.

593
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,756
What the fuck is this military burial shit?

594
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:09,352
It's an option that can
easily be canceled at no charge to you.

595
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:12,361
Vic didn't want a military funeral.
You think I'm lying?

596
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,516
I think he was afraid to tell you
what he wanted.

597
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,760
He filled out those forms,
he kept the videos.

598
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:21,241
They filled out those forms.
This is all fucking Army PR.

599
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,517
- I threw those forms in the trash.
- I'll call the service off.

600
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:27,001
He kept Saudi Arabian candy
for 10 years.

601
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:30,915
- You just want to jack up your price.
- No, it's paid for.

602
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:34,005
I want your brother to have
the funeral he wanted for himself...

603
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:36,478
...because that's his right.

604
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:40,840
Victor wanted to believe he died for
something. You wanna take that away?

605
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,241
Jesus.

606
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,764
He's the only family I had left.

607
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:55,761
And he can't even tell me
what he wants when he's dead?

608
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:03,410
He thought
I would've talked him out of this.

609
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,889
And he's right, I would've.

610
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:11,084
Why don't you sit with his friends.

611
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:23,169
Glad to have you here, man.

612
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,735
- Where is Ruth?
- She's in the back.

613
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:01,140
Crying.

614
00:43:11,986 --> 00:43:13,942
What is wrong?

615
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:16,583
It's the smell of the flowers.

616
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,819
- You'll get used to it.
- I am used to it!

617
00:43:21,828 --> 00:43:25,503
Today, I helped people choose flowers
for weddings...

618
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:29,179
...for anniversaries, for new babies.

619
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,899
I can't remember being surrounded
by so much happiness.

620
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,826
I'm used to the smell of flowers meaning
something completely different.

621
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:41,663
I'm used to people crying
and being exhausted.

622
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:43,863
People being shattered!

623
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:47,906
Do not worry. We get funerals too.

624
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:53,267
I'm so happy. I can't wait
to come back tomorrow.

625
00:43:57,794 --> 00:44:01,868
You're not going to be like this
every day, though, right?

626
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:48,154
This flag is presented on behalf
of a grateful nation as a token...

627
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:51,117
...of our appreciation for honorable
and faithful services...

628
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:53,555
...rendered by your loved one.

629
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:11,198
Give it to one of his friends.

630
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:37,450
I love you, David.

631
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,491
I always will.

632
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:46,566
I could get hit by a bus on the way
to the desert tonight.

633
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:49,495
Just wanted to make sure
you knew that.

634
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:54,213
I love you too.

635
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:02,093
- You did the right thing today.
- I know. Feels kind of good, doesn't it?

636
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:22,577
- Hello.
- She can't go.

637
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:25,781
Why not?

638
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,375
She has to help me pick prints.

639
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:30,693
- Does she have to do it tonight?
- Yes, she does.

640
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:34,135
Billy's got a show coming up
at a gallery in Westwood.

641
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:40,419
Sometimes she gives me her eyes
because sometimes I go blind.

642
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:44,459
Forty-six hours I've been looking
at these pictures...

643
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:46,856
...and sometimes I see amazing things...

644
00:46:47,066 --> 00:46:50,616
...and sometimes I just see shapes,
and that's when I go blind.

645
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:56,305
Because what if I lost the ability
to tell the difference?

646
00:46:57,108 --> 00:46:58,588
For real.

647
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:00,661
- For good.
- You won't.

648
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:02,461
You say that and give me your eyes.

649
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,230
But what if one day,
I can't give them back to you?

650
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,149
Well, that won't happen.
We won't let that happen.

651
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,982
God, this is crap!

652
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:18,467
This is pretentious, derivative crap!

653
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:23,110
Well, then that's one less
you have to consider. Right?

654
00:47:24,354 --> 00:47:25,787
Right.

655
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:32,746
Billy, I'm gonna talk to Nate
on the porch, okay?

656
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,311
All right. Then he's gonna go away.

657
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:37,667
We'll be right outside.

658
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:39,825
Pick out five you like...

659
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:41,675
...and show me when I come back.

660
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:45,074
- Only five?
- Or 10 or 20.

661
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:47,947
And I'll look at them,
and I'll tell you what I see.

662
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:49,796
Okay.

663
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,596
You can fuck her some other time.

664
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:13,796
Sorry. He's obviously off his meds.

665
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:17,081
- Intentionally?
- No, it happens occasionally.

666
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:18,763
It's been a while.

667
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:21,962
- Brenda, come on.
- Sorry, Nate, I can't.

668
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:25,395
I'm all he has when he's like this.

669
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:28,916
- You are letting him manipulate you.
- You don't know him.

670
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:31,720
- You don't know what he's doing.
- I know he doesn't like me.

671
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:35,044
I have a feeling he doesn't like
any man in your life. Am I right?

672
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,121
- Answer me!
- What, you think I fucked my brother?

673
00:48:39,888 --> 00:48:42,960
- Jesus, I never said that!
- Nate, he's sick!

674
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:45,962
He's my brother, and he's sick
and he needs me!

675
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:49,446
This is who I am,
this is what you get.

676
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,647
Fuck you.

677
00:48:58,491 --> 00:49:01,643
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go with you.

678
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:07,647
- Can I do anything to help?
- Yeah.

679
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:13,924
You can go to the desert and sit in mud
and relax and forget about everything...

680
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,966
...including us.

681
00:49:20,136 --> 00:49:22,013
Oh, shit.

682
00:49:22,656 --> 00:49:25,090
Just go, okay? Goddamn it.

683
00:49:45,851 --> 00:50:00,506
