1
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,078
You can have anything you want.

2
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,482
It's yours for the taking.

3
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:57,079
But we've been conditioned to think
that this isn't fair somehow.

4
00:01:57,288 --> 00:02:00,280
That that's taking something away
from someone else, right?

5
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,443
- Right.
- Right.

6
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,367
Wrong.

7
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:07,285
The bounty of the universe
is without limits.

8
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:10,209
What exactly is Beauty Vision anyway?

9
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,801
Oh, it's a personalized
life-management system.

10
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,126
It sounds kind of culty.

11
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:19,249
Everybody wants a better life.

12
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,966
Shit, two years ago,
I was living out of my fucking car.

13
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,887
He told me the first time we went out
he was going to marry me.

14
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:31,292
It was unbelievably romantic,
and now I have this beautiful baby.

15
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:33,085
And that's what Beauty Vision is.

16
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:38,369
It's a way of seeing the world
without fear.

17
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:44,332
Now, these new territories are gonna
go so fast. The franchise fee is $45,000.

18
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,004
Sign me up.

19
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,850
Are you really ready for this?

20
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,650
Fuck, yeah.

21
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:59,013
Well, welcome to Beauty Vision.

22
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,490
- Your husband is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,571
He spends an hour on
the StairMaster every day.

24
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,058
Jesus.

25
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:22,774
Is that blood? Shit!

26
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,213
He must've hit his head
on the bottom of the pool.

27
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:28,418
Chandler!

28
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,137
Oh, my God.

29
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:40,498
Wake your tired ass up, sleepyhead.

30
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:44,664
- What's for breakfast?
- Me, stupid.

31
00:03:56,707 --> 00:04:00,382
Now, which one of you is the wife?

32
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:05,787
No, no, keep going. Keep going.
I'm kind of curious as to how this works.

33
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,469
No breakfast?

34
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,709
- Why'd you let me sleep late?
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.

35
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,745
You looked so relaxed,
which I don't see that often.

36
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:34,429
Today's the reading of Dad's will.
You know about that.

37
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:37,670
It'll all be over real soon.

38
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:42,471
- Thank you for sleeping over.
- You snore.

39
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,230
Don't forget about the meeting
tomorrow night.

40
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,871
You think I'd miss a meeting
of gay police and firemen?

41
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,225
You'll like these guys. They're cool.

42
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,996
I'll pick you up around 7.
We'll grab a bite to eat.

43
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:58,395
- Call me before you head over.
- So you can weasel your way out of it?

44
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:02,556
I never know when I'm gonna have to
work, Keith. This is a busy time for us.

45
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:07,832
A lot of people hold on
for one last Christmas, and then bye-bye.

46
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:12,148
I always thought shiatsu
was more intense than this.

47
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,157
Oh, it'll get there.

48
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,238
I'm just trying to find out
where you're wounded.

49
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,158
Wounded?

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,269
I got stabbed in the thigh
with a BIC pen once.

51
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:27,554
I wasn't speaking literally.

52
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,192
Oh, here's a good one.

53
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:38,113
Old, but recently reopened.

54
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:41,838
- You're so full of shit.
- Well, we're all wounded.

55
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,112
We carry our wounds
around with us throughout life...

56
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:48,122
...and eventually, they kill us.

57
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:53,763
Things happen that leave
a mark in space, in time, in us.

58
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:00,756
I'm sure this is all
very deep and profound...

59
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,243
...but you know,
I get enough depth at home.

60
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,118
You're supposed to be
my haven away from all that.

61
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,678
I'm not supposed to be anything.

62
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:37,006
Morning, Dave.

63
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,203
Aren't those the same clothes
you had on yesterday?

64
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:42,687
Everything I own looks alike.

65
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,607
I sense you're not being completely
honest with me, Dave.

66
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:49,130
Have you changed any
since you were 14?

67
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,884
Hey, I'm all for you
getting laid, believe me.

68
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,409
Morning.

69
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:10,289
You gotta try these. They're hydroponic.
Grown in water.

70
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:13,410
I know the guy who grows them.
He's a big supplier to the co-op.

71
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:16,770
- So my peaches are no good?
- What?

72
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,413
No, they're fine.

73
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,418
Mr. Hickey wants us there on time
for the reading of the will.

74
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,418
We should all go in the same car.

75
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,501
Great, I have to miss
another day of school?

76
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:38,092
What am I, some poor Victorian waif,
who has to stay hidden from view?

77
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:40,418
Fine, go to school...

78
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:45,293
...stay out all night,
live in the streets. See if I care.

79
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,258
Was she like this growing up?

80
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:56,704
No, not really,
but she was well on her way.

81
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,216
Morning.

82
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,737
You're looking spiffy
in that suit, Dave.

83
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,864
That's so clever. You're talking
like the computer in the movie.

84
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,739
Wow, you're funny.

85
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:09,780
Have a hydroponic raspberry
grown by a guy named Gunther...

86
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,946
...who once slept with Stevie Nicks.

87
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,423
So, Dave, are you gonna
tell us about her?

88
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,426
- Who?
- Oh, he's got a friend.

89
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,462
- Are you and Jennifer back together?
- No.

90
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:25,458
- Have you met someone else, Dave?
- Leave him alone.

91
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,019
- Someone from outside your pod?
- Shut up, asshole.

92
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,985
Thank you, Claire.

93
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,229
Why are you still here anyway?
Why don't you go back to Seattle?

94
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:44,221
Because I would miss
the joyful sense of belonging I get here.

95
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:59,306
I have no idea what kind
of service he'd want.

96
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:03,350
Well, at this scale,
it depends on who he was...

97
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:09,189
...and how he saw himself.
The statement that he made with his life.

98
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:13,715
He was, like, so dynamic.

99
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,747
He had his own business. Beauty Vision?

100
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,429
- From the infomercial?
- Chandler invented it.

101
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,595
Large scale.

102
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,188
I'll arrange viewings
for tomorrow and the next day...

103
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,756
...interment at Cedar Hill,
service for 200.

104
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,636
Now, we should choose
an appropriate resting vessel...

105
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:39,274
...one that befits a man of his stature.

106
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:54,996
May I ask what kind of car
your husband preferred?

107
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,440
He drives a BMW.

108
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,920
Do you know which model?

109
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,514
The biggest, fastest one.

110
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,957
I recommend the Titan Series.

111
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,999
Solid mahogany, pan-finished
with burwood accents...

112
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,966
...the same wood used in luxury
automobile interiors.

113
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:15,955
- It looks expensive.
- Nine thousand.

114
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:20,401
It's more than just a casket. It's a...

115
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:23,247
...tribute, really.

116
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,485
Okay.

117
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:30,566
- Are we finished?
- A major credit card to get us started.

118
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,125
Hi.

119
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:40,604
"I, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, a resident
of Los Angeles County, California...

120
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:44,600
...declare this to be my last will
and revoke all former wills and codicils.

121
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,651
First, to my wife, Ruth...

122
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,890
...I leave all bank accounts,
stocks and bonds that are in my name.

123
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,170
That's in addition to the life insurance.

124
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,127
Second, I bequeath the company,
Fisher & Sons Funeral Home...

125
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,849
...and all real property and business
interest attached as follows:

126
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,009
Fifty percent to my son
David James Fisher...

127
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:07,174
...and fifty percent to my son
Nathaniel Samuel Fisher Jr."

128
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,173
What?

129
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,206
What, was he high?
Why would he do that?

130
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,291
David.

131
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:25,096
- Wow, I guess I don't even rate.
- No, he set up a trust for you.

132
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:26,897
David.

133
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,578
Hey, wait, David.

134
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,213
David, David, David, I don't want it.

135
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,777
Well, excuse me while I go contemplate
the irony of that.

136
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,133
- What's my recourse here?
- Recourse?

137
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,491
Your entire college education
is provided for.

138
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:46,257
- So I don't get anything.
- You get education, Claire.

139
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,851
A privilege that not everyone gets.

140
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:51,530
- What if I don't wanna go?
- You need it these days...

141
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,695
...not just to succeed,
but to survive.

142
00:11:54,903 --> 00:12:00,297
Okay, spare me the tough-love
rationalization, just bottom-line it, please.

143
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:03,655
Should you decide not to go, the money
will become available to you...

144
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:05,901
...when you're 25.

145
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:10,053
So this is like blackmail
from beyond the grave.

146
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,620
What in the hell was Dad thinking?
Is this some sick joke?

147
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,301
It's Fisher and Sons.
You're the sons.

148
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,498
Mom gets half a million
in life insurance...

149
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,743
...which is fair, but I
have strings attached?

150
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:24,303
- Let's not talk about what's fair.
- Have my half.

151
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,618
No, your father knew exactly
what he was doing.

152
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,137
He wanted everybody happy,
and we will be happy.

153
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,658
I guess what I want is totally irrelevant.

154
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:35,499
Dave, listen, this is all wrong.
It should be yours, or yours and Mom's.

155
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,349
I really don't wanna discuss it now.

156
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,744
Maybe I'll move to Florida.

157
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,346
That's ridiculous, Mom,
and it's not helping.

158
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,906
You're adults, and Claire
will be leaving next year.

159
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:47,864
Yeah, to join the Marines.
I wanna learn to kill, kill, kill.

160
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:59,744
- Is that Mr. Swanson? How does he look?
- Easy.

161
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,422
Head split open, some scalp work.

162
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,387
Hair extensions to cover
the stitches, maybe.

163
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,873
You guys are in my way.

164
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,830
Mrs. F.

165
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:15,231
Vanessa called.
We got a fresh one at Bay Breeze.

166
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:18,985
- Pick it up. I'll get Swanson.
- No, I still gotta finish Mrs. Huffington.

167
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,513
- Federico, her viewing is at 3:00.
- Yeah, well, she's majorly jaundiced.

168
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:26,836
- Crank up the pink spots over her casket.
- David, the woman looks like a banana.

169
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,074
I don't airbrush her,
the family will freak.

170
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,636
You wanna put her out like that,
then take my name off the certificate.

171
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,068
Nate, I need you to pick up a body
at Bay Breeze Nursing Home.

172
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,876
- I don't know how.
- Put him on a gurney...

173
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,514
...put the gurney in the car...

174
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,757
...take the elevator,
put him in the freezer.

175
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,917
You think you can handle that?

176
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,791
You own half the business now.
Start pulling your weight.

177
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:58,441
News flash, other people exist!

178
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,758
Hey, give me 20 minutes.
I'll go with you.

179
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:10,043
Thanks.

180
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,605
So did Dad ever say anything to you
that might explain why he would do this?

181
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:23,881
Like, "By the way, Federico,
I've lost my fucking mind."

182
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:28,366
It's a good business. Steady.

183
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,283
He was still pissed at me
for not going into it...

184
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,242
...but what does he think,
he can force me?

185
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,206
Maybe he was pissed at Dave.

186
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,771
Hey.

187
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:11,967
You wanna go to a thing tonight?

188
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,286
I'm not in the mood
for a thing, Gabriel.

189
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,127
Come on,
don't go through this alone.

190
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,486
Fat chance, it's like I got
a sign on my head...

191
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:21,369
...that says, "Freak with the dead dad."

192
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:24,330
And like all these people,
who are so tragic, even knew him.

193
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,016
I met your dad once.

194
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:29,090
Remember, he buried
my grandmother Alice.

195
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,858
Why are you talking to me?

196
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,777
- What, you think I'm a jerk?
- Yes.

197
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,808
You know you're different now.

198
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,338
I can see through walls.

199
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,656
Don't your skanks need to be walked?

200
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,215
I wanna see you.

201
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,859
Mrs. Fisher?

202
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm Matthew Gilardi.
Do you have a moment?

203
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,580
- Did David mention me, by any chance?
- I don't think he did.

204
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,856
Well, I thought I'd drop off the details...

205
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,660
...of our buyout offer
so you could look it over.

206
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,017
The terms are quite generous.

207
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:32,421
Especially the stock options.

208
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,384
Who are you to buy us out?

209
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,864
I never saw you before in my life.

210
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,025
I represent Kroehner
Service International.

211
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,105
A chain?

212
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,985
Kroehner is a family of quality
death-care facilities, Mrs. Fisher.

213
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,181
We have a 157 units
in Southern California...

214
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,945
...and we're inviting you to be 158.

215
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:56,711
You should discuss
the situation with your son David.

216
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:01,590
- I have two sons.
- Really? I was only aware of one.

217
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:04,791
I know how many sons
I have, Mr. Gilardi.

218
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,943
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:13,312
Just look at the numbers.
I'll let myself out.

220
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,187
Morning.

221
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,470
How are you folks today?

222
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:28,072
Don't expect to be popular.

223
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:32,270
- Hey, baby. Nate, look at you.
- Look at you.

224
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,752
Four-and-a-half months,
this one wants out already.

225
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:38,155
- Mr. Suarez all ready to go?
- Yeah, but, honey, we got a problem.

226
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,235
My sister can't pick up
Julio from school.

227
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,953
She got another callback
from that cat-food commercial.

228
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,593
- What about my career, huh?
- Come on.

229
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,267
I can't do it, not today.
David's head would explode.

230
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:51,995
Nate, you ought to remind your brother
how many clients I have referred...

231
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,392
...to you guys from here
and tell him to cut Rico some slack.

232
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,161
No, no, no.

233
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,317
You won't.

234
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:07,192
Rico, go.

235
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,678
I'm the new boss, right?

236
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay, but I'm telling Dave
you said I could.

237
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,953
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:20,723
I can do this. I just need some help
getting him onto the gurney.

239
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,196
You can touch him if you wear
one of these. Believe me, he won't mind.

240
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,083
All right, pull the bed back.
Line it up with the gurney.

241
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,199
All right.

242
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,368
- Okay.
- That good?

243
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:50,608
Yeah, take this off for a second. Okay.

244
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:56,282
All right, grab his shoulders.
On three. Ready?

245
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,370
One, two, three.

246
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,526
Angel lust.

247
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:10,486
- Does that happen a lot?
- A fair amount.

248
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:14,652
You can be dead,
but you're never really dead.

249
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,687
- Hello.
- So I've been thinking.

250
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,649
We skipped way too many steps.
We need to have a first date.

251
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:33,931
Okay.

252
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:36,446
I'm at Pinot Hollywood,
Know where that is?

253
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,376
- You mean right now?
- Yeah,

254
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,217
I'd love to, but I've got
a dead body in the car with me.

255
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:45,808
I can certainly understand why you
wouldn't want to get away from that.

256
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:50,897
Come on, just a glass of wine,
15 minutes. The dead guy won't mind.

257
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,371
- Do me a favor, keep it out of the sun.
- Yeah, sure.

258
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,935
I had forgotten. They make these noises.

259
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:03,139
The air comes out. It's like:

260
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,459
No.

261
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:09,291
Dad knew that I hated
this whole fucked-up business.

262
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:10,776
He should respect that.

263
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,175
Well, poor Dave, I'd be pissed too.

264
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:17,462
Although, he does seem to take it
to this extra, Old Testament level.

265
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:20,736
So does this mean you're not
going back to Seattle on Sunday?

266
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,343
Fuck.

267
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:26,663
Okay, don't think about it.
Tell me about yourself.

268
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:30,734
Like this is our first date and we never
had sex before you knew my name.

269
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,740
You mean the recap
of major life events...

270
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,141
...told in a humorous
and self-deprecating way...

271
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,781
...which almost always
gets me laid?

272
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,457
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,866
- I'm not that guy with you.
- Who are you?

274
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,665
I don't know, somebody new.

275
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:54,868
It's because of your father.

276
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:57,265
You're with me
at your most vulnerable.

277
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,509
You felt comfortable.
You felt really accepted.

278
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:06,388
You always analyze guys
on the first date?

279
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,510
- Only if they're interesting.
- Oh, so you think I'm interesting.

280
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:12,465
Yeah. I don't meet that many
men with dead guys...

281
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,665
...with hard-ons in their car.

282
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,147
When Mrs. Swanson's credit card
didn't go through, I ran a check...

283
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,391
...and they were in debt
up to their ears.

284
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:36,668
We have a $3200 Titan casket
being delivered tomorrow.

285
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:40,232
Why didn't you tell me
there's an offer to buy us out?

286
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:43,429
I knew what you and Dad thought
of Kroehner Service International.

287
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,356
You don't know what I think.

288
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:49,471
Not that it matters to you.

289
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,907
And Nate is not your enemy.
He'll do whatever you want.

290
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,869
Why do you say that? He spent
his entire life doing what he wants.

291
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,319
- Dad must've really hated me.
- Hush.

292
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:12,595
It's Fisher & Sons. That's gotta continue,
and you're never gonna have kids.

293
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:21,312
Well, it's about time.
What took you so long?

294
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:25,039
- I stopped to eat.
- I wish you'd called.

295
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:28,634
I think Mr. Suarez kind of shit himself.
Is that normal?

296
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:31,479
Stopped to eat? Do you have
any respect for human life?

297
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,995
I have a huge respect for human life.
I didn't know they can take a dump!

298
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,879
- Well, they can. Make a note.
- I don't like this bickering.

299
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,562
Yeah, well, I don't like you
sleeping with hairdressers.

300
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:59,325
Look, don't take this out on Mom.
What is it you wanna say to me?

301
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,683
Well, there's a body that spent
over two hours in a van...

302
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,769
...unrefridgerated, decomposing at a rate
much faster than you could ever imagine.

303
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,565
Thanks for making my life
just that much more difficult.

304
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,410
Thanks for undermining
my authority with our employees...

305
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:16,163
...and thanks for making it clear
that my choice to dedicate myself...

306
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:19,284
...to this business and to this family
was really stupid.

307
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:22,803
Apparently, I would have been rewarded
just the same for wasting my life.

308
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:26,967
Oh, my life is a waste? Fuck you!
At least I enjoy it.

309
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,493
Yeah, well, lucky you.

310
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:34,887
- Dave, at least let me help.
- You've helped enough!

311
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:51,375
It's just not fair that my life
is being decided by other people.

312
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:55,088
Hey, college is paid for.

313
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,732
They have great parties.
No student loans to pay off.

314
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,090
I'm not exactly a party person.

315
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,857
By the way,
that shit you gave me...

316
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,415
...the night my dad died,
it really fucked me up.

317
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,975
I'm sorry about that.

318
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,296
You should be.

319
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:17,935
Just, why is college the only option?
I don't even know what I wanna do.

320
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:21,692
I just feel like there's
something inside me.

321
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:25,418
I'd just like to figure out what it is
before I get completely reprogrammed.

322
00:24:25,623 --> 00:24:28,296
Hey, nobody could reprogram you.

323
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:31,377
You're the most original girl
in the school.

324
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:34,098
Come on, look at this car
that you drive.

325
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:38,223
This face that you drive.

326
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,821
- Thanks a lot. Liar.
- I'm serious.

327
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,615
You know how much guts it takes
to be somebody like you?

328
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,985
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

329
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:05,704
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

330
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,508
Who do you got there, David?

331
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:18,146
Who is that? It's him?
That's Mr. Bloomberg?

332
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:21,271
Put him right down next to him there.

333
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:22,985
Oh, my goodness.

334
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:26,744
Yeah, you're okay, David.

335
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,349
Mom wants to see us.

336
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:57,351
I'm going on a hike with someone.

337
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,310
Okay.

338
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,271
- Okay?
- I am not asking your permission, David.

339
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,551
I am your mother, how dare you!

340
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:12,317
You both have private lives,
and I know it.

341
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,558
- Why shouldn't I?
- You should.

342
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,476
Go.

343
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:23,277
Excuse me, I need her to meet
with Mrs. Swanson.

344
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:26,594
It's Fisher & Sons.

345
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,922
Well, this sucks.

346
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:32,921
I have to fight for a hole in the ground
at Rosemont Cemetery...

347
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,955
...or the Suarezes
won't be buried together.

348
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:40,232
They'll be on opposite sides
of the goddamn freeway.

349
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,037
Dave...

350
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,164
...listen.

351
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:51,919
Can I do anything to help?

352
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:58,877
Can you tell Adele Swanson we know
she's broke and can't afford the funeral?

353
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:02,080
- Can you do that?
- I guess.

354
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,762
Yes.

355
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:09,245
The Swansons are con artists.
They ran a franchise pyramid scheme.

356
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,804
They have no money,
and they're not gonna con us too.

357
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,447
I made some notes, in case
you're not familiar with credit reports.

358
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,723
You know, I work with vendors,
big ones, national ones.

359
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,525
I'm not a idiot. I can do this.

360
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:28,963
Thank you.

361
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,604
Shit.

362
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,085
What?

363
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:53,447
Do you have to be anywhere tonight?

364
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:57,686
Not really.

365
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:10,691
The other Mr. Fisher recommended
the $9000 coffin. I didn't ask for it.

366
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,538
I think cremation is much more dignified.

367
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,937
And it's within range,
given the financial situation.

368
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,455
Chandler created Beauty Vision.

369
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,256
We have franchises in 13 states
and the nation of Uruguay.

370
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,618
How much did you know
about your husband?

371
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:28,770
Because he's been running up
bad debts for some time.

372
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:30,859
We were always moving.
I thought it was...

373
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,973
...because he was making
so much money.

374
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:36,971
Each place was nicer than the last.

375
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,178
Former partners are suing him.

376
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,023
He had several credit cards maxed out...

377
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,535
...run-ins with the IRS,
dating to 1996...

378
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:52,057
...and Yale University would like him
to quit telling people he went there.

379
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:54,985
This can't be happening.

380
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:59,385
I have a baby.
I can't go back to waitressing.

381
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,784
And now you're telling me
that we can't even afford a coffin?

382
00:29:02,987 --> 00:29:06,060
What will people think?

383
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:10,947
Mrs. Swanson, I'm sitting here thinking,
"Why don't you rent it?"

384
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:13,947
- How much would that be?
- How much do you have?

385
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:17,340
I don't know. My ATM card's
not working.

386
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,108
We'll work something out.

387
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,659
And afterwards, we'll give you
his ashes in an urn.

388
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:45,313
- You really loved him, didn't you?
- Yes.

389
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,794
Okay, it's okay.

390
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:52,269
It's all right. Let it out.

391
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:05,035
I think it's good
you told your boys about me.

392
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,514
Are you kidding? It was insane.

393
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:11,755
I certainly didn't choose to do it.
It just happened.

394
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,516
It was brave.

395
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:16,313
It was guilt.

396
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,519
I loved my husband.

397
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,275
I know you did.

398
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,675
Hiram, when I think of us now...

399
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:38,639
...I feel like I'm watching the whole thing
on some sex channel on cable TV.

400
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:43,042
- Is that right?
- Yes.

401
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:47,718
And that my husband
might be watching it too.

402
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:51,118
I want some changes made,
I'll tell you that.

403
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:54,755
I'm not answering dead calls
all night long anymore.

404
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,684
Let them hire somebody...

405
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:00,446
...or sell the business or whatever.

406
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:05,441
I wanna take you somewhere,
away from all this.

407
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,558
- No.
- They're adults.

408
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:11,164
They can take care of themselves.

409
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:15,040
I have two plane tickets to Costa Rica
a week from Monday.

410
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:17,883
Separate rooms.

411
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,124
I was 19 when I got married.

412
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,365
I've never been on my own.

413
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,561
I wouldn't even know how.

414
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:34,844
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:41,049
You're a very kind person,
and you've been good to me.

416
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,767
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:51,443
Goodbye.

418
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,453
Good choice of music.

419
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:20,052
It's from his car.
It's the last CD he ever heard.

420
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:27,657
Adele Swanson, your husband
owes me $45,000.

421
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,213
He kept it all from her.

422
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,736
She's broke with a baby.
You'll leave her alone.

423
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:33,937
- Who the fuck are you?!
- I own this place.

424
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:38,135
- Get out before I call the cops.
- You people suck.

425
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:43,658
- What was that?
- Some freak Swanson owed money to.

426
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:52,019
Nate, I notice Mr. Swanson
is in the Titan casket.

427
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,022
Yeah, but she's giving it back.
I made the deal for cremation.

428
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,058
They can't give it back.
By law, it has to be burned with him.

429
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:00,904
You just cost us $9000,
you fucking moron.

430
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,697
What?

431
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:05,578
How was I supposed to know that?

432
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:15,499
- I'm so sorry about your father.
- Jennifer.

433
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:22,619
I was in Boca Raton.
My mom had to have her hip replaced.

434
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,657
- Oh, dear, how is she?
- She's better, thanks.

435
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:30,624
So I didn't find out
about Mr. Fisher till yesterday.

436
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,902
I'm just heartbroken about it.
I'll miss him.

437
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,989
Well, he adored you.

438
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:45,426
Oh, David, I won't be answering
the phones anymore.

439
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,544
Okay.

440
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:03,994
Now every part of your body
has a new meaning to me.

441
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:09,105
- We should go.
- Like your nose.

442
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:13,105
- Come on.
- And your little hands.

443
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,228
Hands I get.

444
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:20,228
- And your toes.
- It's ticklish.

445
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:24,431
Here, try these.
You can play with mine.

446
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,268
- You're right. Now I don't feel anything.
- See, it's perfect.

447
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,829
Would you...?

448
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:39,431
- No, I'm embarrassed.
- What?

449
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:47,116
Would you rub it?

450
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,521
Okay.

451
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:55,401
You're making my toe hard.

452
00:34:59,684 --> 00:35:02,722
- Do you want to kiss it?
- Your toe? No.

453
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:06,002
Come on, I'll do something for you.
Anything.

454
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:14,282
Aren't you forgetting something?

455
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,396
Please.

456
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,398
You filthy, dead fuck.

457
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:43,810
Hey, Nate. Keith.
I met you at your dad's viewing.

458
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,446
Oh, yeah, David's racquetball partner.

459
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,732
Is David inside?

460
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:52,652
No, he went out for dinner
with his ex-fianc'ee.

461
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:56,641
She missed Dad's funeral,
and they were pretty close, so...

462
00:35:56,853 --> 00:36:00,324
- That's cool, I understand completely.
- I have his number if you wanna call.

463
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,526
I already gave it a shot.
He didn't answer.

464
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,374
Hey, is David any good...

465
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,930
...at racquetball?
We used to play in high school...

466
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,206
...and he was pathetic,
running into walls...

467
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,772
Yeah, I think you'd be pretty surprised
just how good he's gotten.

468
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:19,129
- Well, I'll tell him you came by.
- Thanks.

469
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,853
Dear God.

470
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,850
I need to get his watch.
I need to sell it for the money.

471
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:51,896
- My life is over.
- This is a hard time, the hardest.

472
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:57,939
It was all a lie! He left us with nothing,
because there never was anything.

473
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:03,494
Bastard.

474
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:26,459
I almost died when I saw our
engagement pictures still on your mantle.

475
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:32,305
Why? My family loved you,
my father especially.

476
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:34,704
He loved you.

477
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:37,469
Yeah, he had a funny way of showing it.

478
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,778
I'm drunk.

479
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,346
Then I can ask.

480
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,866
Are you happy?

481
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,186
I'm still me.

482
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:57,592
Your father knew.

483
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,831
We had coffee once, and he told me...

484
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,912
...he understood why we
couldn't be together.

485
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:07,427
He said you spent so much time
trying to make people happy...

486
00:38:07,634 --> 00:38:10,274
...you never thought about yourself.

487
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,943
He worried about that.

488
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:20,632
So do you have anyone now?

489
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:26,387
Can you tell me about him?

490
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:30,432
You're wrong about my father.
You didn't know him at all, nobody did.

491
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,997
Let's get a room at the Haverford Inn
and fuck our brains out. How about it?

492
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,430
Jesus, David.

493
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,638
Hi. I got your message.
Sorry I didn't call you back.

494
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:59,640
I had to go out to County Hospital.

495
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:03,313
The body's still in Long Beach.
The autopsy's not even finished yet.

496
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:05,878
It's unbelievable.

497
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,552
How was the meeting?

498
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:10,880
Everyone asked about you.

499
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:13,474
- They wanna meet you.
- I wanna meet them.

500
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:20,955
I'm a little drunk. You might have
to undress me.

501
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:22,724
Okay.

502
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:26,244
Right after you stop lying to me.

503
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:34,094
- Brenda?
- Yes, Nate.

504
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:39,611
- Why is my name tattooed on your ass?
- It's not your name.

505
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:43,052
Yes, it is.

506
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:46,809
You're not the only
person named that.

507
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,890
Nate, it's a coincidence.
It's not you or anyone you know.

508
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,616
Come on. What, you think
I'm so enamored with you...

509
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:06,779
...I had your name
burned into my flesh?

510
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:09,743
Then how come I never saw it before?

511
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:12,777
We've had sex twice.

512
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:15,896
Once with our clothes on
and once in the dark...

513
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:17,657
...after three martinis apiece.

514
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:22,302
You obviously liked some guy enough
to have his name burned into your flesh.

515
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:28,060
I would have done
a lot more than that for him.

516
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,228
It's about time, you fucking moron.

517
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:17,710
- What are you doing in there?
- Help me out, you fucking moron.

518
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:21,023
- Why can't you just climb out?
- I think we both know...

519
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:23,669
...the answer to that, you fucking moron.

520
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:38,512
You really should do
something about this.

521
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:41,312
It's really deep.

522
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:44,311
It might as well be bleeding.

523
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,756
- Could you be a little more dramatic?
- Oh, I could be a lot more dramatic.

524
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,554
What are you doing today?

525
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,477
Dave and I have to go get the registration
out of the wrecked hearse.

526
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:04,190
Insurance won't replace without it.

527
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:06,393
What time?

528
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:11,439
- 2:30, I think.
- Take your cell phone.

529
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:14,999
- Okay.
- Promise me you will.

530
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,315
All right.

531
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:29,876
Oh, I don't feel like carbs this morning.

532
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:32,482
Do we have any more
Stevie Nicks raspberries?

533
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:34,324
Claire.

534
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:40,965
- Do you have an eating disorder?
- What? No, Mom. I wish, but...

535
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:57,839
- Are you being helped?
- Yeah, my pop's here. Suarez.

536
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,642
Of course.

537
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,606
That's the Titan Series.
It's quite beautiful.

538
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,919
- Give me a number.
- Nine thousand.

539
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,249
You guys ought to get your act together.

540
00:44:09,452 --> 00:44:11,841
Your brother said
that this was on special, 4500.

541
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:15,125
And then he came down to 4000,
so why don't we start there?

542
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:22,688
That's not legal, reselling a coffin.
There are fluids that seep.

543
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:26,854
- Okay? And Mr. Swanson, he seeped.
- What did you tell Mr. Suarez?

544
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:29,290
He wants a quality coffin.
We happen to have one.

545
00:44:29,495 --> 00:44:32,215
I don't agree with this at all.
It's against my beliefs.

546
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,293
- Thank you, Federico.
- And it's unsanitary.

547
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:37,331
They're dead. What disease
can they possibly catch?

548
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:40,335
It's too late, Nate.
It's a $9000 retail item...

549
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:43,768
...our cost is 3200. We eat that,
and plus we lose the profit.

550
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:47,527
Wait, there's a $6000 markup?

551
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:55,333
Mr. Suarez, we cannot
let you have that casket.

552
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:57,974
- Sorry to hear that.
- We can't legally sell it...

553
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,899
...because very briefly,
it was occupied by another person.

554
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,534
- 3500.
- Sold!

555
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,813
- Absolutely not.
- David, don't be a fucking moron.

556
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:10,334
Fellas, let's split the difference because
I gotta get a haircut before the service.

557
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,894
- My brother has no authorization...
- Mr. Suarez, it's a $9000 product.

558
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:17,173
It's used one night.
You're getting it at cost.

559
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:20,455
Would you stipulate that you
understand the condition of the coffin?

560
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:24,015
Sure, whatever.
May I make a suggestion?

561
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:28,616
You've closed, okay? Don't overclose.
It kills the word of mouth.

562
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:59,699
Is that the best they could come up with?
"Father, husband, caregiver"?

563
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,062
How would you prefer?
"Introvert, sadist, mind-fucker"?

564
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,550
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher. Matt Gilardi
of Kroehner Service International.

565
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:13,427
I understand you're now
part-owner of the business.

566
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:18,789
You are aware we've made a very rich
buyout offer for your unit.

567
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:20,506
Okay.

568
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:23,593
- This a one-time offer.
- I don't know about that.

569
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,825
You think you can hold out?

570
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:29,990
We control suppliers now. Where are
you gonna get your chemicals?

571
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:32,993
How about your caskets and liners?
What about this Diaz kid?

572
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:36,790
I mean, this guy is a topnotch
restorative artist.

573
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,873
You threatening to put us
out of business?

574
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:40,794
We look at it as a partnership.

575
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:45,115
In the death-care industry now,
it's consolidate or die.

576
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:48,195
Decide which, Nate, and give me a ring...

577
00:46:48,397 --> 00:46:51,947
...because we will put things in motion
either way.

578
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,838
"We'll put things in motion either way"?
Tough guy.

579
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:01,348
Shut up.

580
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,351
Right in here.

581
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,835
Sign this right here.

582
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:26,475
Well, it's totaled. The insurance company
was right about that.

583
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,801
Fuck.

584
00:47:40,846 --> 00:47:43,440
There's still blood on the wheel.

585
00:47:55,648 --> 00:48:00,086
- Okay, let's go.
- Jesus, don't you feel anything?

586
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:02,962
Yeah, I feel betrayed.

587
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,444
Hello.

588
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:16,123
Meet me at the corner of Sunset
and Gordon, Now, It's important,

589
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,129
- What?
- Bring your brother,

590
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:21,529
Trust me, you need to do this,

591
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:30,530
I spoke to Gilardi.

592
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:32,008
And?

593
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:35,729
He says we sell
or they put us out of business.

594
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:37,687
Fuck.

595
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:42,572
I think we should sell.

596
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:46,371
And erase everything this family
has meant for 50 years?

597
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:49,649
That might not be a bad thing.

598
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:02,216
- Hey.
- Brenda.

599
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:06,412
- This is my brother, Dave.
- Come on.

600
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:10,452
Come on. Let's do this.

601
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,858
This is the bus.

602
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,132
What bus?

603
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:27,573
The bus.

604
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:33,342
Brenda, this isn't funny.

605
00:49:33,544 --> 00:49:37,662
This is fucked up. What gives you
the right to do something like this?

606
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,545
He's...

607
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:56,777
I never...

608
00:50:53,765 --> 00:51:06,720
