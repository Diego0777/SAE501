1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,473
So I say to this guy, "I can't do anything
unless you give me an order number.

2
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,878
And I don't appreciate your taking that
tone of voice with me."

3
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:48,834
He says he doesn't have
an order number.

4
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,114
And I say, "Well, you should always
write down the order number."

5
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:53,836
Then he gets all pissy.

6
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:58,082
Says he wants to speak to the person
he ordered the Astoria floor lamp from.

7
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:02,562
And I say, "Well, do you
remember his or her..."

8
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:05,153
Right, you know? "...name?"

9
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:07,196
And he says, "Of course not."

10
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:11,194
And I say, "Then I'm sorry,
I can't help you."

11
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:14,518
He says this isn't the first time
he had a problem ordering from us.

12
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,878
Last Christmas he bought a CD holder,
and it arrived all broken.

13
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,759
When we told him, "Send it back"...

14
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:24,644
...he couldn't because he'd thrown
away the box it came in.

15
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:29,525
So I say... I say, "Boo-hoo, mister.
Ain't you got it bad."

16
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,084
And he says, "I wanna talk
to your supervisor."

17
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,645
And I say, "Of course
you can talk to him...

18
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,843
...but unfortunately, his hours
are only 8:30..."

19
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:07,686
So now the wife's in jail, according
to the cousin who arranged the funeral.

20
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:12,492
I bet he was abusing her. Maybe he had
some sick sexual thing he made her do.

21
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:14,766
Please, stop.

22
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:20,051
And you're wrong. All she told
the police was that he was boring.

23
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,451
That's it? That's all she said?

24
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:29,049
- The sick part is, I understand it.
- I do too.

25
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,049
- Sometimes I'm boring.
- I am too.

26
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,370
I should be at both intakes
with you this morning...

27
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,617
...but you'll have to do
the casket meeting...

28
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,778
...because I'm really backed up
down here.

29
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:49,692
David, maybe we need to think about
finding a replacement for Rico.

30
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:55,017
Why? We're doing just fine without him.
It's saving money, thank you very much.

31
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:58,698
Is there something you'd like to say
about my work?

32
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,701
Look, you do a great job...

33
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,373
...when it comes to people
who had peaceful farewells.

34
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:06,179
But the big reconstructions,
you're out of your league.

35
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,337
I see, so those who can't do, criticize?

36
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:10,582
We've got a body
that's a page-one rewrite.

37
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,620
We got two more coming in
from that nightclub fire in Valencia.

38
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,825
- How bad was that fire?
- Well, this is where they ended up.

39
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,301
Maybe the families want...

40
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:21,659
Open caskets. They already
put in the requests.

41
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,382
- I'll put an ad in the paper today.
- It's taken care of.

42
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:27,740
I've scheduled some interviews
for this afternoon.

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,022
As you can see from my r'esum'e,
I've had the good fortune to study...

44
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,904
...under a variety
of gifted restorative artists.

45
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,348
Oh, you worked over at Hope Valley.
I've known P.T. For years.

46
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,780
Look, that lawsuit about
the unembalmed arm was not my fault.

47
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:52,511
I took the fall for some bitch that was
supposed to cover me for leaving early.

48
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:55,148
Sometimes I wake up
with a feeling of panic...

49
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,709
...like my heart's gonna beat
right out of my chest.

50
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:01,669
You know what I'm talking about. But
after I spend a few extra hours in bed...

51
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,108
...and do my chanting,
the dark time usually passes.

52
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,991
I know it sounds funny,
but the first time I embalmed someone...

53
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:12,506
...it felt like I was coming home.

54
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:15,948
I just knew that this is
what I was meant to do.

55
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:17,916
That doesn't sound funny at all.

56
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,712
There's something very intimate about it.

57
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,470
I'm the last person on earth
who gets to know these people.

58
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,990
Anyway, I guess I take
what I do very seriously.

59
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,798
Well, I have no further questions.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,277
Me neither. Thanks for coming in,
Angela. We'll be in touch.

61
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,076
Great.

62
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,319
It was very nice to meet you.

63
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,076
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,075
Okay.

65
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,722
I'll wait an hour before I call her.

66
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,994
We don't wanna look desperate.

67
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,117
Just find out if she can start tomorrow.

68
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,608
David,

69
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,644
David!

70
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,882
David!

71
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,084
Why are you standing there like that?

72
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:46,088
I was thinking.

73
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,767
Isn't a person allowed to think?

74
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,412
You're gonna wish you'd
gotten high with me.

75
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:11,006
I told you, I'm never getting high again.

76
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,935
Oh, doesn't Billy look great?

77
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,886
So handsome and confident.

78
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:18,454
Yo, Billy!

79
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,014
Would you excuse me for one moment?
Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it.

80
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,008
Thank God you're here. My mouth
is really dry, and is my breath bad?

81
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,335
No, it's fine.

82
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,453
So truth. Is this show good,
or is it just pretentious bullshit?

83
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,129
There're so many people,
it's hard to see the pictures.

84
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:37,140
This is Billy's best work ever,
very disturbing.

85
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:42,292
- Really?
- I'm so proud of you, God!

86
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,732
Why is my mother here?

87
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,423
Oh, God.

88
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:52,253
I invited her as part of my ongoing
campaign to get her to like me.

89
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,939
I didn't think she'd actually turn up.

90
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,934
You know that some stranger
just rubbed my ass?

91
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:05,857
Isn't this fabulous?
Oh, Billy, darling.

92
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,178
Thanks, Mom.

93
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:16,497
You can't keep him to yourself
all the time.

94
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,340
Okay, no offense, but your family
is fucked up beyond comprehension.

95
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,620
She's completely tanked.

96
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,025
I brought someone.
I hope that's okay.

97
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,540
- Hey, Nikolai.
- Hello, Nate, how are you?

98
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:33,424
- This is Brenda.
- Good evening.

99
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,942
- Hello, dear.
- It's good to see you, Mrs. Fisher.

100
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:41,146
- Where's Hiram?
- He's visiting his son in Portland.

101
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:46,229
I'm serious, darling,
this new stuff is really visceral.

102
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,232
Not at all left-brained like your father.

103
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,948
Yeah. Hey, so where is Dad?

104
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:56,626
Oh, honey, Bern sends his regrets.
He's just heartsick.

105
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,145
Unfortunately, he's treating
one of his patients...

106
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:04,112
...who's undergoing a complete
psychotic break at the moment.

107
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,147
That always seems to happen whenever
there's something important in my life.

108
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,953
I guess that's just typical Bernard...
I'm sorry, Bernard Chenowith behavior.

109
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:13,830
Pretentious dick.

110
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,997
Now, you just hush.

111
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,955
I thought this would be paintings.

112
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,832
I could take photographs.

113
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,838
That doesn't mean they'd be any good.

114
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,193
Mrs. Fisher, I've never seen you
having this much fun.

115
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,033
Oh, no, no, no, it's great.

116
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,631
I am having fun just watching you.

117
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:40,802
Hey, Mr. Seattle co-op hippie boy.

118
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,358
Oh, Margaret Chenowith. Who are you?

119
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,437
- Ruth Fisher.
- Nate's mother.

120
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,476
That explains why
you're looking at me...

121
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:52,721
...like I just took a giant dump
on your lawn.

122
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,115
If I knew you were
putting on a show tonight...

123
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,516
...I would've bought tickets
for all my friends.

124
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,559
Goody, there's Dr. Feinberg.

125
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,286
- Hi.
- What is he doing here?

126
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,801
I invited him.

127
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,963
Gareth Feinberg, the guy
who wrote the book?

128
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,365
Yeah, he wrote
Charlotte-fucking-Light and Dark,

129
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,958
He's a fucking evil dead fish
of a fucking Nazi fuck.

130
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:16,605
Darling, try not to act so adolescent.
It only makes you look bad.

131
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,768
As opposed to being drunk
and slobbering all over my boyfriend...

132
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,564
...who, by the way,
is completely not interested.

133
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,726
Isn't this fun?

134
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,565
Billy, Billy, Billy.

135
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:31,447
It's quite powerful stuff.
It's... It's potent.

136
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,566
That's a word Dr. Feinberg
likes to use a lot.

137
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:39,971
Brenda, I see a lot of you
in these photographs.

138
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,929
Hello, Gareth.

139
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,529
Margaret.

140
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,968
Does this have a theme?

141
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,131
I know you like your things
to have a theme.

142
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:54,965
Mother, nothing is more tedious than
when you look for meaning in my work.

143
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,815
I don't need your fucking approval.

144
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,527
Excuse me.

145
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:09,132
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Yeah, it is.

146
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,175
He's good.

147
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,939
Yeah, he is really good.

148
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:17,533
I only wish he'd believe that.

149
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,218
This one's got real attitude.

150
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,376
- Oh, my God.
- The light's spectacular.

151
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:36,978
Brenda, that is a picture
of me urinating on a wall.

152
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:39,139
- I realize that.
- Hey, what do you think?

153
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:40,897
So now you're stalking me?

154
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,783
No, I just saw you one day
when I was taking pictures...

155
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,658
...so I followed you.
- You were just out taking pictures?

156
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:50,540
You live in Venice! There's no reason
for you to be in my neighborhood.

157
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,543
You think the world revolves around you.

158
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:56,222
Bren, would you tell him, please,
this isn't about him?

159
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,256
It's what Billy does.

160
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,857
He takes pictures of people
when they're off guard.

161
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:08,617
- He's got a talent. It's art.
- No, it's fucked!

162
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,745
Thanks a lot.

163
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:29,542
Look. That's your son
pissing against a wall.

164
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:35,061
So I should let him humiliate me
whenever he wants?

165
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,463
Oh, God, Nate, don't make this
about you.

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,269
Why the fuck not? This is about me.
You make enough stuff all about you.

167
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,988
So what? There's a picture
of you pissing on a wall.

168
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:47,312
Who got hurt? Who died?

169
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,870
You don't think I have a right
to not be spied upon?

170
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:54,193
You're talking to someone
who was spied on her whole life.

171
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:59,107
God, Billy is severely fucked up, Bren.
I don't like being stalked by a psycho.

172
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:04,187
Billy is not psychotic. He has a disease.
He's fine when he takes his meds.

173
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,866
Yeah, well, when the fuck is that?

174
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:14,596
Look, has he ever done anything weird?

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, he's bipolar.
His whole life he's been weird.

176
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,355
Has he ever done anything dangerous?

177
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,840
Oh, God. Nate, no.

178
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:35,957
The only person Billy would ever
be a threat to is himself.

179
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,842
- Has he ever tried to...?
- Yes.

180
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:43,153
When I was 18.

181
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,683
I went to Europe for three months.

182
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:53,164
It was this big reward for me
winning a scholarship to Yale.

183
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,602
When I got back to L.A.,
my mother was at the airport.

184
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:00,686
She told me that Billy
had committed suicide.

185
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:07,044
My whole life just collapsed
in on itself in that moment.

186
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,728
Of course, she meant to say that Billy
had tried to commit suicide.

187
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,648
She was drunk,
or else it was a Freudian slip.

188
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,404
You never went to Yale.

189
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,967
Billy was in a hospital in Pasadena.

190
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:31,206
I took some classes at UCLA
in the spring.

191
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:35,164
Then in the fall, he was diagnosed
manic-depressive...

192
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,126
...which kicks in in adolescence...

193
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,406
...so it probably had nothing to do
with me getting the scholarship.

194
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:44,210
I can't believe they pressured you into
sacrificing your life for your brother.

195
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:46,976
Nobody pressured me.

196
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,605
I wanted to stay.

197
00:14:57,217 --> 00:15:01,006
- Morning.
- Morning. Pee on any walls lately?

198
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:03,448
Shut up.

199
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,891
So, Mom, what's with you and Nikolai?

200
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,773
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,492
And Dave, what'd you do last night?

202
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,100
Nothing.

203
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,815
Saturday night, what happened to that...?

204
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,974
Person you're seeing?

205
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,417
That person is no longer in the picture.

206
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,818
Sorry to hear it.

207
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,378
What about you?

208
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,980
- You dating anybody?
- No.

209
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,620
If you are, you don't need
to hide him from us like we're lepers.

210
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:42,615
I'm not dating anyone. I've just been
hanging out a lot with somebody.

211
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,386
Who is this person?

212
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,538
Nobody.

213
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:54,497
David, I'm ready to go to church.

214
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:01,058
Thanks, guys.

215
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,183
- Hey, Joey, the kid's ready,
- So am I,

216
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,185
This is the most terrifying
shower scene since Psycho.

217
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,826
That football game used to make
this obnoxious noise...

218
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:24,307
...when you scored a touchdown.

219
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,393
Do you wanna show me how to play it?

220
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,184
No.

221
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:38,629
You know, there's this...
There's this little kid next door...

222
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,393
...and the only toy he's got...

223
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:44,475
...is this stupid Mousetrap game
from when his mom was a kid.

224
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,787
Maybe, you know, he'd want
some of these.

225
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:03,917
It's a beautiful day. Why would you
waste your Sunday in here watching TV?

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,195
What are you doing?

227
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:17,674
I thought that Tony Rechner next door
might want some of these.

228
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:23,075
Just keep your hands off them.

229
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:32,475
She doesn't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

230
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:45,603
Come on, I wanna show you
something funny. Come on.

231
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,003
Come on.

232
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:55,403
We're going on a field trip?

233
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:59,049
This is like the first day of school.

234
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,717
I am so excited.

235
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,047
Oh, and I just wanna apologize
in advance...

236
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,718
...because I had calamari
last night for dinner.

237
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,525
- What do you mean?
- Let's just say this is one time...

238
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:14,804
...where the strong smell of
formaldehyde really comes in handy.

239
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,489
So then I said, "I don't care
if you have a low sperm count.

240
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:24,605
I mean, I'll just shove a turkey baster
up there if I have to."

241
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:29,332
I mean, I wanna have a child
before I turn 40. That's fair, right?

242
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:30,933
Hello, everyone.

243
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:35,526
Hi. How was church?
Nate told me you're a deacon.

244
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,295
That's adorable.

245
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,328
I see you've made yourself at home.

246
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,455
Angela doesn't like to feel constrained.

247
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:52,649
Well, you know, my glands
go double-time.

248
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:57,250
I find if I wear too much while I work,
I get all pitted.

249
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,577
Angela, we're sort of used to a more
professional appearance around here.

250
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:13,294
Give me a break, David,
they're just nipples.

251
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,857
I mean, we've all seen them.
We've all touched them.

252
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:19,658
We've all sucked on them. It's not like
this guy will be lying in the casket...

253
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:23,333
...and people will be saying, "Oh, my
God, the embalmer's nipples were hard."

254
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:26,456
They'll be saying, "How did they put
his face back together...

255
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,736
...after he went through
the goddamn windshield?"

256
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,743
I told Father Jack I'd help
with the food distribution downtown.

257
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,858
I just wanted to make sure
that your first day was going okay.

258
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:41,297
Well, thanks. I'm all gassy,
but that's not your fault.

259
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:45,098
Angela had calamari last night.

260
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,140
Boy, he's a barrel of laughs.

261
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:54,108
It's hard when a new person
comes into a situation,

262
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,341
It throws everything off balance.

263
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,142
Bren, I am not threatened
by your boyfriend.

264
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,821
Oh, yeah? Your behavior consistently
communicates otherwise.

265
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,260
You want the picture
out of the show, fine.

266
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,788
But don't spout psychobabble at me
like fucking Margaret and Bernard.

267
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,148
- You're, like, becoming them.
- Fuck you!

268
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:19,584
You know what you did was wrong.
That's why you didn't show it to me.

269
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,747
- Why are you making it such a big deal?
- Because I love him!

270
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:31,954
You're fucking with my life, Billy,
and it's not fair.

271
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,584
You have to stop.

272
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,665
- Or what?
- Goddamn it, Billy, what is it with you?

273
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:41,028
You like fucking with my brain
like Feinberg?

274
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,473
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

275
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,357
Can I get you anything else?

276
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,637
I can always use a good blowjob.

277
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:11,995
Hey, do I get my fucking lunch or not?

278
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,634
- I'm going to get a drink of water.
- Yeah, sure.

279
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:23,839
Melinda Daner, Mark Whitman...

280
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:27,882
...Darryl Heinz, Keith Charles.

281
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:32,556
Okay, well, just tell them we'll meet them
at the usual corner on Tuesday. Okay.

282
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:35,917
- Hi, Tracy.
- Oh, hi, David.

283
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:39,156
- How have you been?
- Fine.

284
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,005
I love your new hair.

285
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,242
What are you working on?

286
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:49,478
St. Stephen's is sending over
some volunteers to help out next week.

287
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:52,078
Someone told me that you
used to go to St. Stephen's.

288
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,486
Not that I've been asking around
about you. It just came up naturally.

289
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,204
So did you? Go there, I mean.

290
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,047
- Yeah, just for a few months last year.
- They're a very progressive church.

291
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,202
Yes, they are.

292
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:13,044
The guy who took these
is a total psycho.

293
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,444
It's good.

294
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:25,444
Well, we should probably get going
if we wanna see that movie.

295
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:29,973
I should probably get home
and check on my mom.

296
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:32,736
I'm sure she's doing fine.

297
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,049
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,293
It's not like I was dying
to see a movie.

299
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:43,137
That's not what I'm talking about.

300
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,253
I'm sorry...

301
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,176
...about what happened between us.

302
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,538
I never meant for those assholes
to write shit on your car.

303
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,894
I shouldn't have told Andy about us.

304
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,215
I was just being stupid. That was me
being really, really, really stupid...

305
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,654
...and I'm sorry.

306
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,494
Well, thank you.

307
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:36,184
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this.

308
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,776
All I'm saying is,
I sat around last week...

309
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:41,183
...in that stupid getup
you wanted me to wear...

310
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:45,779
...and had to say all this, you know,
"Daddy this" and "Daddy that" bullshit.

311
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:49,868
When I tell you I keep reading articles
about having this one-hour orgasm...

312
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:53,739
...well, the least you could do
is try to help me have one.

313
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,343
I'm sorry men can't have it.

314
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,859
Since you guys get everything else
on the planet...

315
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,107
...it seems like a fair tradeoff.

316
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:01,710
Fine.

317
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,267
Goodbye.

318
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:10,306
You know, Angela, my brother
likes a certain decorum...

319
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:13,027
...when you're working
with someone's loved one.

320
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:15,304
Yeah?

321
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:18,074
Well, the personal calls are
probably a little uncool.

322
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:20,111
Oh, right, got it.

323
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,068
I won't do it when he's around.

324
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,752
Hello.

325
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,434
Hey.

326
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,314
Really?

327
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,985
Why don't you want me to come over?

328
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:39,190
Damn it, Brenda, you always do this.
You're shutting me out.

329
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:42,196
Look, the pissing thing is
no longer an issue, I swear.

330
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,197
Look, maybe you'd feel better
if I came over.

331
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:48,869
All right, fine, whatever. Fine.

332
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,034
- Girlfriend trouble?
- Not really trouble.

333
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,717
Tell me what the fight was about,
and I'll tell you what to say to fix it.

334
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:00,639
I mean, trust me, this is my thing.

335
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,315
We didn't have a fight.

336
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:06,913
She just pulls away from me
at the weirdest times.

337
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:11,918
Well, maybe she senses that
you're pulling away...

338
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,274
...so she just does it first.

339
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:16,361
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

340
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:19,961
Shoot. I guess this means
I can't ask about the pissing?

341
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:24,403
Because I had an ex who wanted to pee
on me, and I wasn't grossed out.

342
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:28,525
I mean, I just thought it was
kind of silly. But that's me.

343
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,081
Thank you for taking me to
the art gallery last night.

344
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,247
I thought you hated those pictures.

345
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:59,524
No, no, it's just that I don't
like them, that's all.

346
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:03,049
But it was nice to be
spending time with you.

347
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,683
I mean, outside of working together.

348
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,410
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?

349
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:14,203
- Is that like a date?
- Of course not.

350
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:18,488
Good, I pick you up
tomorrow night, 8:00.

351
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,807
I don't wanna go, okay?
Just stop asking me.

352
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,928
Okay, fine. I was only inviting you
to be nice.

353
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:32,413
Nobody even wants you there because
you've been acting so weird lately.

354
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:34,209
Gabe?

355
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:38,450
- We have to be someplace.
- Get lost, Morticia.

356
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:41,088
Shut up, peanut-testicle.

357
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:45,417
Fuck off, the both of you.

358
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,817
What's his problem?

359
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,299
Nothing. He wants me to go to this party
tomorrow. I'm just not in the mood.

360
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,933
We can do something if you want.

361
00:26:56,141 --> 00:27:00,693
Actually, I gotta go to Barstow tomorrow
and spend the night at my dad's.

362
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:05,694
I gotta ask him for money for my mom.
Not that he's gonna give it to me, but...

363
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,542
Well, do you want company?

364
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:12,053
Claire, you don't have
to keep taking care of me.

365
00:27:12,304 --> 00:27:14,215
I'm not.

366
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,985
I just like hanging out.

367
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:20,258
We could just go for the drive.
Then you go see your dad...

368
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,784
...and I'll stay in some, like, creepy motel
and read a Stephen King book.

369
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,497
Okay.

370
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,903
Meet me after fifth period
tomorrow by the gym.

371
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:16,751
Oh, this is just what I need today.

372
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:19,549
I see this is payback time
for my missing your opening.

373
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:21,707
Just shut up!

374
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:25,314
Both of you, for once,
just shut your fucking mouths.

375
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:28,151
All that comes out of you
is garbage, garbage, garbage!

376
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,029
Okay.

377
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:33,548
Good, we have a dialogue.

378
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:39,032
- Where did you get this?
- From his office.

379
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:42,232
It's all the data Feinberg has
on Brenda. It's all destroyed.

380
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:45,034
He can go to where he came from
before he fucked her up.

381
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,632
You're off the hook. Obviously, this has
nothing to do with you missing his show.

382
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:52,674
Don't fucking talk about me
like I'm not here!

383
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,277
Even though I'm not
and never have been.

384
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,234
Son, what's wrong? Just tell us.

385
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:59,000
There's nothing wrong with me.

386
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:02,275
I didn't sell my daughter to some smug,
star-fucking psychiatrist...

387
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:04,951
...so he could pick her apart
like a goddamn cadaver...

388
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:08,401
...and turn her into shit and garbage
just like everything you touch!

389
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:10,555
- Billy, sweetheart...
- You bitch!

390
00:29:10,804 --> 00:29:14,593
You're the fucking nurse. You wanna tie
us up, lock us in a room, leave us to die.

391
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,234
Well, you're the one that should die,
you and him!

392
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:19,317
You don't get to touch the children.

393
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,960
I refuse to be an audience for this.

394
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:37,126
Oh, boy. You can juice her, but you
better let me take care of that skin.

395
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,238
This guy has a really sinewy neck.

396
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,323
Sinewy. I love saying that word,
don't you?

397
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,246
- I don't know.
- I went out with this guy once...

398
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:50,648
...he had a really sinewy neck.
He was a total animal in bed.

399
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,969
I mean, the things he could do
with his tongue.

400
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:57,966
He thought he was God's gift to women.
I guess in that one respect he was.

401
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:02,172
- So do you like sinewy necks, David?
- I never really thought about it.

402
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:04,444
Hey, I'm just trying to figure out
your type.

403
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:06,565
Believe me, I can tell you're single.

404
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:09,846
And I know about a million people
I can set you up with.

405
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,774
So, what kind of guys do you like?

406
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,727
What makes you think that I like men?

407
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:18,013
Oh, please, let's not play that game.

408
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:21,050
- I think we should fire her.
- I'm thinking the same thing.

409
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:23,851
- Has she made a lot of mistakes?
- No.

410
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,934
She's a little hard to take.

411
00:30:26,137 --> 00:30:28,368
She's a lot hard to take.

412
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,092
Sometimes people are hard to take...

413
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,496
...but only because the first side they
present is annoying or aggressive...

414
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,338
...because they're nervous.

415
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,332
After you spend some time
with them...

416
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,010
...you realize maybe there's another side
to them that's worth knowing.

417
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:49,817
Or not. I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

418
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,254
Sorry I'm late.

419
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:58,456
By the way, I won't be here for dinner
tomorrow, so everyone's on their own.

420
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:02,452
Actually, I'm going to be volunteering
with the food distribution.

421
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:06,179
Well, that leaves you and me, Claire.
You wanna go to the Apple Pan?

422
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:11,095
Can't. I have to do
this astronomy overnight thing...

423
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,139
...at the observatory for school.
- I didn't hear about this.

424
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:17,065
I told you.
You probably weren't listening.

425
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:20,304
That's the type of thing I would listen to.

426
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:24,418
David and Nate did it
when they went to Bonaventure.

427
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:27,779
David, you did this?

428
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,264
- Yeah, I had to.
- You too, Nate?

429
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:34,581
Back then we thought
Pluto was a planet.

430
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,146
- When did Pluto stop being a planet?
- A few months ago.

431
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,746
Well, I suppose it's okay for you to go.

432
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:48,186
Luckily, Gareth isn't going
to press charges.

433
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:52,988
But I did promise him that steps
would be taken to remedy the situation.

434
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,071
I wish I'd been there to see
the look on Feinberg's face.

435
00:31:56,273 --> 00:31:58,582
I'm sure he started with
his whole blinking thing.

436
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,672
Brenda, we have a serious problem.

437
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:08,352
Okay, I'll talk to Billy's doctor, see if
he needs to be on different medication.

438
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,268
We were thinking of something
a little more involved.

439
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:14,946
Your mother and I feel that he needs
to go away for intensive therapy.

440
00:32:15,196 --> 00:32:18,473
There's a very good facility in Colorado.

441
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:20,633
You wanna put Billy in an institution?

442
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:24,109
Oh, please, let's not turn this
into a 1950s B-movie.

443
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,395
This place is run
by excellent psychiatric specialists...

444
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:32,548
...who may have some creative solution
to help Billy.

445
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,191
You wanna give him shock treatment.

446
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,995
Darling, really, this dramatic streak,
aren't you a little old for it?

447
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,830
And just for the record, electroconvulsive
therapy's had a real resurgence...

448
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,396
...in the last 10 years
with very impressive results.

449
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:47,598
- You can't do this.
- We think it's best.

450
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,520
It certainly makes your lives easier.

451
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:53,642
God forbid Billy should embarrass you in
front of your stupid celebrity friends.

452
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:56,351
Unfortunately, he's an adult
which means you can't...

453
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:59,482
...have him committed
unless he does something dangerous.

454
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:02,039
Darling?

455
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:06,721
We were thinking if you talked to him,
explained how it would help him...

456
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:10,561
Fuck you both.
You're out of your minds.

457
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,245
Hi, I'm Angela. You must be Ruth.

458
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,838
Yes.

459
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:32,478
I spilled some beet salad
on someone's wig...

460
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:35,045
...so David said I should eat up here.

461
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,643
I got the stains out.

462
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,488
Everyone in my family gets cancer,
so I know tons about taking care of wigs.

463
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:48,801
Is that yours? The hair, I mean.

464
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:50,684
As far as I know.

465
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,485
It's beautiful.

466
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:54,729
Thank you.

467
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,608
I don't wanna be one
of those menopausal women...

468
00:33:57,814 --> 00:34:01,966
...that goes all dykey
with the butch haircut.

469
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:09,009
So Nate says that
you're dating a hairdresser.

470
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,252
That is so lucky.

471
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:14,648
If he's good, I'd love to know
if he can do anything with this mop.

472
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,816
Does your boyfriend come around?

473
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,896
He's not exactly my boyfriend.

474
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,896
Oh, come on, you're blushing.

475
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:27,011
Must be pretty serious. Is it?

476
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,892
Is it serious, or is it just hot sex?

477
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,057
I'm really not in the mood
to discuss my personal life.

478
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,705
You have one new message,

479
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:03,304
Hey, it's me,

480
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:06,304
Look, it's better if I just go by myself,

481
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:09,782
You should probably just
not worry about it, okay?

482
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:14,620
Thank you for trying to... To,,,,

483
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:17,900
Look, just... Thank you,

484
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:21,896
So that's... That's it, I guess,

485
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,859
Goodbye, Claire,

486
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,384
This is disgusting.
You have crap in here from the '80s.

487
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,584
Billy, I'll get a plumber, somebody
who actually knows what they're doing.

488
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:42,861
Would you look at me?
I'd really like to talk to you.

489
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:48,071
I take it you spoke to Mom and Dad.

490
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,622
Look, I don't know what
happened that day.

491
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,223
You know, I was on new meds.
They weren't working.

492
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:57,709
It wasn't my fault.

493
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:03,831
But don't worry. I've already been
to my doctor and changed my dosage.

494
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,311
And I already feel more even.

495
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:10,305
Billy, I need to know if I should be
worried about you.

496
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,267
You shouldn't.

497
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:19,034
I swear.

498
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:21,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

499
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:51,598
My God, you could eat off this skin.

500
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,841
Angela does her job perfectly.

501
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:59,515
What about the hairs in her mole?
Rico would've never left those there.

502
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,239
Angela had a long philosophical debate
about it...

503
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:07,042
...and decided the nieces would wanna
remember her exactly how she was.

504
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:10,000
I'd like to know the meaning of this.

505
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,797
Nikolai is picking me up
to go to dinner...

506
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,522
...and I was planning to serve him
sherry beforehand.

507
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:19,084
I wanted to use the goblets I got
from my cousin Hannah's trip to Dresden.

508
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:22,440
Now I can't because someone broke this
and hoped I wouldn't notice it.

509
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,924
- Which one of you did this?
- It wasn't me.

510
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:27,200
Well, it wasn't me.

511
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,844
- It was Angela.
- Oh, it was definitely Angela.

512
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:43,251
Hi.

513
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:45,409
David. What are you doing here?

514
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,928
I volunteer with these guys
a couple times a week.

515
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,206
Oh, I just started.

516
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,368
- You need some help?
- Yeah, sure.

517
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:10,687
David. David!

518
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:13,135
- David.
- I'm dying.

519
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:18,618
No, you can't, not before we
make love one last time.

520
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,252
Okay.

521
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,735
I thought you were gonna help.

522
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,738
- So how've you been?
- Good. You?

523
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,091
I'm okay.

524
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:37,138
I've driven by hundreds of times,
but I never knew this place existed.

525
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:41,814
Is best restaurant in all of Los Angeles,
and not outrageous prices too.

526
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:49,262
- Lotte, Irina.
- What a surprise this is.

527
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:52,262
You usually do not come in
on Tuesday night.

528
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,296
- Well, l...
- Can we join you?

529
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,735
Please.

530
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,458
Maybe another time.

531
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,260
No, no, she says it's okay.

532
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:07,016
So you must be Nicky's special friend
we all keep hearing about.

533
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:09,104
You must be thinking of someone else.

534
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,546
No. You lost your husband.
You work for Nicky.

535
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,739
You used to fix dead people.

536
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:18,747
Oh, I suppose that is me.

537
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,624
This is Ruth.

538
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,508
So that guy I saw you with
at the club, is that a serious thing?

539
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,622
Eddie?

540
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:32,946
Not really. Not yet.

541
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,064
Those drugs I saw you taking,
is that a serious thing?

542
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:42,064
No, no. I just tried them once.
I don't think I'll be trying them again.

543
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,752
I'm glad to hear you say that.

544
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:46,149
You know what that shit
has done to my sister.

545
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:49,710
It can seriously fuck up your life, David.

546
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,950
I'd hate to see that happen.

547
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:56,147
It was stupid, I know. I was just...

548
00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:01,470
You know, Rico left.
It was just Nate and me.

549
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:04,316
Not that it's an excuse.

550
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:08,266
What's up with that kid
I saw you with at the club?

551
00:40:08,478 --> 00:40:10,753
Let's just say it was
a learning experience.

552
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:14,952
Everyone else has gone home. I don't
know what you two are waiting for.

553
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,673
David, this isn't one
of your regular shifts.

554
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:22,158
Is there any special reason
you showed up here tonight?

555
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,430
No.

556
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,636
Oh, well...

557
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:32,359
Well, good night, you two.

558
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,632
Good night.

559
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,474
You hungry?

560
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,878
I'm always hungry.

561
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,764
You fucking bitch!

562
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:22,760
I would like to tear your heart out
like you have torn out mine.

563
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:27,325
There's supposed to be a picture
of Nate peeing on a wall.

564
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,405
- I see it.
- I don't.

565
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:33,088
Four from the left.

566
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,089
Oh, my God.

567
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,170
What'd your mom say
when she saw that?

568
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:40,888
She was kind of horrified, I think.

569
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:42,891
How is your mom?

570
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:47,771
She's dating. It's weird.

571
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:49,772
- Why?
- Because she's my mother.

572
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,443
She's not supposed to date.

573
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:57,647
People should be with people.

574
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:02,926
Yeah, sometimes people are
just too stupid to know it.

575
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:11,729
How's your taco?

576
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,333
Disgusting.

577
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,497
I had no idea about you and Nikolai.

578
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,775
For six years, every Saturday night,
I cook for him dinner.

579
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:30,861
And then he take me
to a $2.50 movie on Fairfax.

580
00:42:31,102 --> 00:42:33,570
Then you come along,
and he stop calling.

581
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:39,495
I have to see every goddamn film
this Freddie Prinze Jr. Does...

582
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:42,172
...and what do I have to show for it?

583
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:45,063
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,177
Do you want to marry Nicky or not?

585
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:53,783
Marriage is the last thing
I would ever want again.

586
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:57,781
Maybe I have an amusing flirtation
with Nikolai...

587
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:00,461
...but he scares me.

588
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:03,103
Best of all, I have this job...

589
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:06,698
...something I never would have
predicted for myself.

590
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:08,501
And I love it...

591
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:11,018
...because it's mine.

592
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,788
And I would never do anything
to jeopardize that...

593
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,101
...which means I should probably just
finish dinner with Nikolai...

594
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,145
...and go home.

595
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,784
Thank you. I've had the best time
coming to this funny restaurant...

596
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:40,952
...and having you yell at me
in the bathroom.

597
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:49,391
Do you realize the whole time
we were going out...

598
00:43:49,596 --> 00:43:52,554
...I was never in your bedroom at night?
- Well...

599
00:43:54,516 --> 00:43:57,077
...you're here now, aren't you?

600
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,396
Whoa, this is not the David I know.

601
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,352
Maybe this is the real me.

602
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,991
- I'm not sure we should...
- Why not?

603
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,317
Well, I'm kind of seeing somebody
right now.

604
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,671
- I don't care.
- Well, I do.

605
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:25,277
Come on, David!

606
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:28,720
Why'd you come up here,
if you weren't into something happening?

607
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:32,711
To talk to you, to see how you
were doing, to be friends.

608
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:37,281
- I don't wanna be friends. I wanna fuck.
- Well, I'm not into that.

609
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:42,677
Can't we just have sex?
It doesn't have to mean anything.

610
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:44,997
It's getting late.

611
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:47,481
I should just go.

612
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,279
You take care of yourself.

613
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:10,320
Claire, what are you doing here?

614
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,966
I thought David and I covered for you,
so you could be out having fun.

615
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,681
What's wrong?

616
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,919
Shit, there's this really big hole
in my sock.

617
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:29,887
- Maybe Gabe just wanted to be alone.
- I know.

618
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:33,606
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

619
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,084
It's just...

620
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:40,483
...he needs me.

621
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:45,930
For the first time in my life, I felt
important, like someone needed me...

622
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:48,934
...you know, like, not just like some
annoying extra person...

623
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:52,095
...just lumped in with everyone else.

624
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:55,132
No one's ever needed me.

625
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,135
I need you.

626
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,294
Right.

627
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:07,451
I felt this really intense connection.

628
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,379
Now it's just gone.

629
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,896
And I want it back.

630
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:19,930
I want him back.

631
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:23,019
Is there something wrong with me?

632
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:26,533
Is there something about me that makes
me deserve something like this?

633
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,142
Deserve what?

634
00:46:28,343 --> 00:46:32,940
Just feeling really close to someone
then having them just disappear...

635
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:35,897
...like I mean nothing.

636
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:40,982
Claire, Gabe just went to visit
his father for a day.

637
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:46,379
I think you're talking about Dad.

638
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:51,141
Look, we never talk about him.

639
00:46:51,347 --> 00:46:53,815
And that's okay, if that's what you want.

640
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:57,498
But at some point you're gonna
have to deal with how you feel.

641
00:46:58,628 --> 00:47:00,938
Oh, God, can't I just get upset...

642
00:47:01,149 --> 00:47:04,983
...without having to focus on
what's really making me upset?

643
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:09,028
Well, it worked for me for 34 years.

644
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,386
Hey.

645
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:19,222
Hey, who 's this?

646
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:21,150
Jim. Who's this?

647
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:24,550
Steve, So, what do you look like?

648
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:28,951
I'm 6'2", 190 pounds.
I'm a professional boxer.

649
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:33,227
- Yeah? What's your dick like?
- Nine and a half inches, uncut.

650
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,950
- So, what are you looking for?
- A nasty top to fuck my brains out,

651
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:40,431
Found him. Now, get on your knees
and suck my cock, boy.

652
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:44,470
Oh, fuck, Yes, sir, Oh, yes,

653
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:47,270
I don 't care what time it is,
I need to be with someone,

654
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:50,236
Someone, that's comforting.

655
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:53,111
Okay, I wanna talk to you.

656
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,150
If this is about Billy, I can't.

657
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,637
I've done nothing but talk about Billy
for two days.

658
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,113
Well, what's happening with him?

659
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:14,717
Look...

660
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:20,993
...I know this is really hard for you.

661
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:24,837
I've had some time to calm down
about the picture...

662
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:29,083
...so you can just spill your guts
to me, okay?

663
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:34,323
I promise not to make it about me.

664
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:38,918
I'm too tired.

665
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:42,796
You know what?

666
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:48,118
I love you, and I need you.

667
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:52,727
And it's okay for you to need me too.
I want you to need me.

668
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:02,525
I'm doing the best I can.

669
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:27,528
Rough night, stud?

670
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,934
You're fired.

671
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:38,336
Fuck.

672
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:42,646
Yoo-hoo, Brenda!

673
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,690
Brenda, I know you're home.
Your car's out front.

674
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:50,335
I don't know what's so strange about
a spontaneous brunch. I think it's fun.

675
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:53,008
It's weird.

676
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,848
You don't do things like this.

677
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,857
You pay people to do things like this.

678
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,051
- Oh, hello, Nate.
- Hey.

679
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,899
Now I see why you're so upset
that I'm here.

680
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,451
My mother's come over to see
if I talked Billy into committing himself.

681
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:13,854
She just loves saying that. It makes her
father and I sound more like monsters.

682
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:16,212
Well, I didn't do it, and I'm not going to.

683
00:50:16,462 --> 00:50:18,738
Goddamn it!

684
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:24,022
I asked for chives,
and they give me this veggie crap.

685
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:32,535
Brenda...

686
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,221
...there's something
you don't know about Billy.

687
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,661
Oh, here we go.

688
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:45,460
You know when you were
in Europe that summer?

689
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:49,946
Billy didn't try to kill himself.

690
00:50:50,988 --> 00:50:52,660
What?

691
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:56,748
Your father and I had gotten back from
a conference to find our house on fire.

692
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,945
It started right below the family room.

693
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,220
Remember, we had it redone
when you were away?

694
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,990
Yeah, but Billy was...

695
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,944
I went to visit him in the hospital.
He was there all summer.

696
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:10,622
Your father and I put him there.
We had no choice.

697
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:14,069
That fire wasn't accidental, Brenda.
He was making a bomb.

698
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:18,186
This is getting really fucking desperate.
What, now Billy's the Unabomber?

699
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:23,269
He had written things. Ugly, violent
things about your father and me...

700
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:26,989
...about you. He was dangerous.

701
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:32,547
You let me believe for all these years
that Billy tried to kill himself.

702
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:36,710
We were only trying
to protect you, honey.

703
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:41,357
Get out of my house.

704
00:51:41,877 --> 00:51:44,994
Get out of my house,
you fucking lunatic!

705
00:51:48,998 --> 00:51:52,275
- It's a wonder I'm even alive.
- Hello?

706
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:56,392
- You're like fucking Medea!
- Dave, this is a really bad time.

707
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,558
You know what the really
sick thing is, Mother?

708
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,599
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

709
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,399
Brenda.

710
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:08,877
- Brenda, hang on.
- I'll call you later, Nate...

711
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:10,800
...when that asshole's out of my house.

712
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,232
Dave, I gotta go.

713
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:17,001
What, you fired her already?

714
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,273
Oh, for chrissake.

715
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,598
You should've lined up somebody.
Why are you whispering?

716
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:26,075
I'm hiding up here
until she finishes Mrs. Sarno.

717
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:28,885
So which of those other people
did you like best?

718
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:31,235
Look, let's not make
any quick decisions.

719
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,796
I guess I could probably live
with the panic-attack guy.

720
00:52:35,006 --> 00:52:36,803
I've got a better idea,

721
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,879
Hey, Rico.

722
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,041
Bad time?

723
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,125
No, everyone's at lunch
except me and Pam.

724
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:49,161
You're one of the Fishers, aren't you?

725
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,081
Cigarette break.
But I gotta be back in 10...

726
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,566
...because I told Gilardi I'd have
this one done when he got back.

727
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:05,760
The subscriber you've called
is outside the service...

728
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:46,252
Oh, great. Fucking hell.

729
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:51,813
Here, let me help you.

730
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,258
Shit.

731
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:02,893
I don't know why I brought
so much stuff here.

732
00:54:03,101 --> 00:54:05,900
I guess I'm just a nester.

733
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:12,655
I should've told you
that I broke the goblet.

734
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:17,978
- It was a gift from my cousin.
- Yeah, trip to Dresden. I heard.

735
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,260
I don't know why I didn't just tell you.

736
00:54:22,505 --> 00:54:25,702
It's totally unlike me.
I usually just say whatever I'm thinking.

737
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:27,736
I noticed.

738
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:32,898
But I saw that broken glass...

739
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:37,225
...and I just was overcome
with this feeling that it was...

740
00:54:37,427 --> 00:54:40,704
...better to just ignore it...

741
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:45,903
...just pretend that it didn't happen.
I get that feeling...

742
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:48,339
...from all of you here.

743
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:51,627
Everyone is so fragile...

744
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,106
...and can't bear to hear anything.

745
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,983
Is that everything?

746
00:54:57,191 --> 00:55:01,469
I mean, all I did was try
to fix David up with this guy...

747
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,385
...and I thought he was gonna kill me.
I never met anyone...

748
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,823
...who was so uptight about being gay.

749
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:13,589
Thanks.

750
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,864
You know something?

751
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:25,309
I never worked in a funeral home
that was this depressing.

752
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:35,832
Tell me you're happier here, and I'll go.

753
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:40,634
It's not perfect. These body farms
are a fucking assembly line.

754
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,432
And I've got like 12 idiots
breathing down my neck.

755
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,279
At Fisher & Sons you only get
two of those at the most.

756
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:48,231
And Gilardi lied to me.

757
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:51,238
My hours are nothing
like he said they'd be.

758
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,390
And the work here is not even
as challenging, you know?

759
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,118
Nate...

760
00:56:00,521 --> 00:56:04,800
...it was Kroehner who burned down
the house across the street.

761
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:09,322
Gilardi's told people that he's not done
trying to drive you guys out of business.

762
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:12,236
Does that mean it doesn't make sense
for you to come back?

763
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:15,163
No, but if I do, you have to match
what I'm making here...

764
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:18,077
...plus guarantee me flexible hours
for picking up Julio...

765
00:56:18,284 --> 00:56:20,241
...and helping when the baby comes.
- Done.

766
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:22,874
And if I do decide to come back...

767
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:25,838
...it's not for good.

768
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:31,043
I'm never gonna become a partner, am I?

769
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:35,087
I can't offer you that...

770
00:56:36,448 --> 00:56:39,281
...unless you wanna marry Claire.

771
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:43,085
No, thank you.

772
00:56:44,649 --> 00:56:46,640
Okay, I can start in a couple of days.

773
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:51,008
Thank you. That makes me very happy,
and it will make David very happy.

774
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:56,644
Yeah. Hey, I heard there's some picture
of you in a gallery peeing.

775
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:58,887
Is that true?

776
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:03,607
I just wanted to get Gabe's father's
number, so I could talk to him.

777
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:07,323
Well, why would Gabe's stepfather
know where Gabe was?

778
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:10,610
No, his father, the one
who lives in Barstow.

779
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:15,246
Yeah, Gabe's father died
when he was 4.

780
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:20,611
Yeah.

781
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:22,654
Oh, if you should run into Gabe...

782
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,213
...would you tell him I really don't
appreciate his staying out all night?

783
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:36,328
So that's... That's it, I guess,

784
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:40,056
Goodbye, Claire,

785
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,295
Mrs. Dimas?

786
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,016
Mrs. Dimas? Mrs. Dimas?

787
00:57:49,309 --> 00:58:23,264
