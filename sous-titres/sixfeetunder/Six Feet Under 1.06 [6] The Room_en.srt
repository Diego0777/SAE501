1
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,869
Damn, this house is cold.

2
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,346
Shit, Hattie,
it's like a goddamn icebox.

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:21,111
Well, no wonder.
Girl, are you crazy?

4
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,358
We live in the desert.
It gets cold at night.

5
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,438
You plan on sleeping all day?

6
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,193
I was planning to get me some
breakfast before nightfall.

7
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:36,313
Come on, bitch.
Get your lazy ass up.

8
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,481
Come on, now,
this ain't the old folks' home.

9
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:45,116
Hattie.

10
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,916
Hattie?

11
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,436
I hate this client.

12
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,684
Every time she gets dumped by a guy,
she gets a puppy.

13
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:16,118
So now she's got, like, 15 dogs.

14
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,479
They're all male, they're all huge
and they sit there and watch...

15
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:22,248
...with their tongues hanging out
while I work on her.

16
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:28,160
It's like being in some live sex show
for Asian businessmen and frat boys.

17
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,210
Which I actually did for a while,
back in the '80s, to make some money.

18
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,485
I got this great thing going
with Ping-Pong balls you'd really like.

19
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:42,206
I'm gonna
show it to you sometime.

20
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:47,283
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I got some
hedge clippers and cut off your dick?

21
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,406
- What?
- Do me a favor, okay?

22
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:52,173
- Don't read that shit in front of me.
- You gave it to me.

23
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:56,367
- Yeah, come on, I'm late.
- I'm at the part with the doll.

24
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:58,485
Why is your doll angry?

25
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,093
Because she got raped.

26
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:03,970
- Really? By who?
- By you.

27
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:07,288
Brenda, do you know
what "raped" means?

28
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:11,045
It means she was forced
into sexual intercourse against her will.

29
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:16,253
It's so cool. You're doing it to scare
them into leaving you alone, right?

30
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:19,091
- What do you want from me? I was 8.
- Did it work?

31
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:22,529
No, it didn't work.
I just got a whole new level of scrutiny...

32
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,252
...by a different set of vultures,
only they were women.

33
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,973
I'm leaving.
You still want a ride?

34
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,456
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

35
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,452
What are you doing today?

36
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:54,093
Well, the cabinets.
I'm gonna try to organize the cabinets.

37
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,702
Good.

38
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:04,540
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

39
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:07,664
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah.

40
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,379
Bring the Lincoln Town Car
around front.

41
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,658
So you're the other Fisher boy, huh?
The one from where, Oregon?

42
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,585
- Seattle.
- Right, with the health-food thing.

43
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,699
- Yep.
- I remember your dad talking about you.

44
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:23,821
I'm sorry to hear about him, man.
He was a funny guy.

45
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,899
Yeah?

46
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:29,986
- No, you don't pay.
- Don't pay?

47
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,381
Yeah. Your dad buried my brother
a few years back. It's in trade.

48
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,982
My father traded a funeral
for oil changes?

49
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,751
Yeah, guess so.

50
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:54,102
Bye, Mom.
Have a good day.

51
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:06,588
So would you like us to take care of
finding you a cemetery plot, Mr. Jones?

52
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:10,026
- Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
- Would you like a double plot?

53
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,628
What for?

54
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:17,665
Well, one for your wife, and one for you.
Next to each other.

55
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:21,187
It this what you do all the time?
Sell people their own graves?

56
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:25,746
- Yes, sir. This is my job.
- Don't try to pull that shit with me, boy.

57
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:28,267
I want a simple box, no frills.

58
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,471
You can't take advantage of me
because I'm old. I'll kick your ass!

59
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:36,107
Just a single plot, then.

60
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,037
No. Double plot.
Shit.

61
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,951
Will you want Mrs. Jones
prepared for viewing?

62
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,631
Yes, I wanna see her, but I don't
want you messing with her none.

63
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:55,233
I don't want you to cut her
or stick her or pickle her like an egg.

64
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,040
If you want a viewing,
I recommend...

65
00:06:57,242 --> 00:07:00,360
That's my wife, boy!
I don't want you to touch her!

66
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:05,559
Mr. Jones, I can guarantee
that you will not want to see her...

67
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,562
...nor will anyone else,
unless she's been embalmed.

68
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,602
I would beg you to consider
what your wife would want.

69
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,841
She's dead, fool.
Don't matter what she wants.

70
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,240
Well, yes, sir, but...

71
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:21,636
After death, the body immediately
begins to decompose.

72
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:24,804
Much quicker than you might think.
The skin begins to separate.

73
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,639
There's quite an unpleasant odor.

74
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:30,641
Should you choose to forgo embalming,
my recommendation would be cremation.

75
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,925
As soon as possible.

76
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:37,963
That's just the way it is,
Mr. Jones.

77
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,206
I don't wanna burn her up.
I wanna see her.

78
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,362
Fine. You do understand, however,
that means she'll need to be embalmed.

79
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:55,490
- I ain't paying for that.
- Sir, the cost is minimal.

80
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:03,602
I will waive the embalming fee,
Mr. Jones. All right?

81
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,733
That was a good sermon,
I thought.

82
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,375
- Did you?
- You didn't?

83
00:08:57,581 --> 00:09:01,541
- I didn't really listen to it.
- Hello!

84
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,016
Hello, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm Tracy Blair, David's friend.

86
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,622
Tracy.

87
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,291
I keep asking him
when we're gonna meet his fianc'ee.

88
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,653
- Does she go to another church?
- Yes.

89
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,582
What fianc'ee?

90
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,696
Tracy, I told you, Jennifer and I
had broken it off years ago.

91
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:21,659
You did?
So there's no fianc'ee now?

92
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,856
Excuse us.

93
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:28,255
- It's really a sore subject for us all.
- You're hurting my arm.

94
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,694
Ruth.

95
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,902
- Hiram.
- How are you?

96
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:36,106
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you been coming to church?

97
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,908
- I haven't seen you.
- I wanted to give us some space.

98
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,582
Please don't sacrifice anything
on my account.

99
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,258
Little late for that.

100
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:48,745
- I miss you. Can I see you?
- No.

101
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,942
Ruth, haven't you
punished yourself enough?

102
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,345
Shall we go?

103
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,859
- Hi, I'm David Fisher.
- Hiram Gunderson.

104
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,107
Nice to meet you.

105
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,265
- You're the hairdresser.
- It's nice to meet you, son.

106
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:06,946
- Don't call me that.
- David!

107
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:08,824
What?

108
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:15,187
- I'll go get the car.
- No, I'm coming with you.

109
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:19,429
It's good to see you.
You look well.

110
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,235
Okay, I hear you.
Jesus!

111
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,471
Who are you?

112
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:42,436
- I live here. Who are you?
- I wanna see my wife.

113
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:47,234
Oh, I'm sorry. We're not open yet.
Everyone who knows anything is gone.

114
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,878
I wanna see my wife.

115
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,431
Sir, I don't deal with the dead people,
so you're just gonna have to come back.

116
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,710
Bitch, I don't need
your permission.

117
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,076
Sir, you're just gonna
have to come back later.

118
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,599
- My foot.
- What?

119
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,716
Help! Help! There's a white girl
trying to cripple an old black man.

120
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:06,991
Honestly.

121
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:10,275
Look, sir, you can't go in there.

122
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,200
Hello?

123
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,840
Hello, is anyone home?

124
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:23,955
Yes, in here.

125
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,683
- Who's your friend?
- Hell if I know.

126
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:35,401
His wife died, and he wanted to see her.
I guess she isn't ready yet.

127
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:38,404
He was about to keel over,
so I helped him sit down.

128
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:41,878
Then I had to listen to him bitch
about public transportation forever...

129
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,078
...then he just, like, passed out.

130
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,518
Now I can't get his fucking hand
to let go.

131
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:48,360
- Maybe he died.
- Very funny.

132
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,480
No, he's still breathing and farting.

133
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,686
- Can you help me pry his hand loose?
- Sure.

134
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,164
Is Nate around?

135
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,362
I just bought this fabulous antique chest,
weighs a ton.

136
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,405
- I'm gonna need a hand getting it home.
- No, I haven't seen him.

137
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:10,570
- I can help you move it, though.
- No. Thanks.

138
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,409
So I'm no good because the cabinet
moving thing's just foreplay for you...

139
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,490
...to fuck my brother?

140
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:23,810
No. I'm just not into babysitting
high-school girls.

141
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,522
- No offense.
- Let go of me!

142
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:30,283
Damn, what you all doing?
Trying to steal my watch?

143
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,565
Ought to call the goddamn cops.

144
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:36,404
Why? You're the one who's
breaking and entering.

145
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,050
Look. We've gotta go
move a chest.

146
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:42,493
Someone should be back soon
to let you see your wife.

147
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,336
- Hey, little girl.
- What?

148
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,287
You ain't fooling nobody.

149
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:53,849
Great. Thanks. I'll work on that.
I'll be, like, one minute to change, okay?

150
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,656
Are you gonna be okay here alone?

151
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,335
Everybody's alone.

152
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,811
You born alone,
you die alone, goddamn it.

153
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,658
I'm sorry about your wife.

154
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,495
You didn't know her.

155
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:41,334
Jessica Wilcox?

156
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:44,424
I'm Nate Fisher.
Nathaniel's son.

157
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:50,099
I wondered why I hadn't heard
from Nathaniel in quite a while.

158
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:55,860
I hate this. I hate that I'll never
see him again. He was such a kook.

159
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:58,338
A kook? Dad?

160
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:01,347
I don't think anybody
ever made me laugh like that.

161
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,585
He had such a sense of humor.

162
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,221
- So I hear.
- He was really proud of you.

163
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,862
- I'm Nate, not David.
- I know who you are.

164
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,700
You're the one who took off.
Your father really respected you for that.

165
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,791
Said he wished he'd had the guts
to do that when he was a kid.

166
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:27,232
Ms. Wilcox, did you have some kind
of arrangement with my father?

167
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:30,783
- Arrangement?
- In our ledgers, some of the funerals...

168
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:34,384
...were marked differently,
and your mother's was one.

169
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:38,634
It seems my father sometimes traded his
services for payments other than cash.

170
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:45,506
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but can I see some kind of identification?

171
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:50,312
- Driver's license would do.
- Sure.

172
00:14:55,797 --> 00:15:00,269
Libra, huh?
I would've taken you for a Capricorn.

173
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,028
- You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,392
Better be careful.
Give you kidney stones.

175
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:26,880
Come on. Surely you wouldn't begrudge
your father such a minor indulgence.

176
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:32,482
- My father never smoked pot.
- Not in front of you, he didn't.

177
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:37,314
It's the finest organic.
Grown up in San Francisco by my son.

178
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:42,284
Take it.
It's your father's monthly supply.

179
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,604
How is your mother doing
with the grieving, David?

180
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:55,961
She's fine. As far as I can tell. You know
her, she likes to suffer in silence.

181
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,125
That seems to be a family trait.

182
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:02,525
You know, it's God's will
for us to live our lives fully.

183
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,846
Breathing in the joy around us,
not just shouldering the pain.

184
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,768
God wants you to be happy.

185
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,847
I call them "energy buns."
They're my own recipe.

186
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,042
Well, not really. Adding the peppers,
I picked up on my honeymoon.

187
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,808
- Have you ever been to Brazil?
- No.

188
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,481
Oh, my God, Brazilians
are the most beautiful people alive!

189
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,921
They're like these fabulous mongrels...

190
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,249
...who've incorporated all the very best
attributes from every race.

191
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:30,250
I mean, all that
crossbreeding. Hello!

192
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,727
I had a half-breed mutt
who lived to be almost 20.

193
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:37,370
Then I got this purebred corgi, and its
hips disintegrated before it was even 2.

194
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:44,805
- Here you go.
- Fuck you, church freaks.

195
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,210
Well, enjoy.

196
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:51,294
Do you cook?
I hate cooking just for myself.

197
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,056
That's the worst part
about being divorced.

198
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:57,566
That and the whole
no-regular-sex thing.

199
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:01,531
David? Could I talk to you
for a moment?

200
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,727
- Alone?
- Excuse us.

201
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,455
- What do you want?
- Ruth won't talk to me.

202
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,729
I'm worried about her.
I was hoping you could...

203
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,578
You were fucking my mother
while my father was still alive...

204
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,294
...and now you want me to...?
- I understand if you're upset...

205
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,289
Understand this. Whatever you have with
my mother is between you and her...

206
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,334
...but I have no interest in helping you.

207
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:38,774
Table for one?

208
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,573
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

209
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:45,140
Did you know my father,
Nathaniel Fisher?

210
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,143
This used to be our storeroom...

211
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:53,294
...but when I finally got a loan from the
bank, I put an extension out the kitchen.

212
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,655
Your father buried my wife
seven years ago.

213
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,777
I had very little money
for the funeral.

214
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:00,295
He asked if he could have
this room as his own...

215
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,266
...and that would
be my settlement.

216
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:08,262
What did he do here?

217
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,466
I don't know.

218
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,938
- Stay as long as you like.
- How often did he come here?

219
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:19,424
Sometimes, we wouldn't see him
for months.

220
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,905
Sometimes, he was here every day.

221
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:10,928
Mrs. Fisher.

222
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,252
Good afternoon, Nikolai.

223
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:16,017
I don't believe I've had a chance
to thank you yet.

224
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:18,777
When Kroehner started pressuring
everyone to cut us off...

225
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:22,374
...most of our suppliers
just abandoned Fisher & Sons.

226
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:25,530
- You stuck with us.
- Of course I stick with you.

227
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,457
Here.

228
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,091
Thank you.

229
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,695
These flowers are not going
to plant themselves.

230
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,450
Such delicate skin.
You have Russian color.

231
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,657
I do?

232
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,462
You don't like the beauty you have?

233
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:54,333
The front door is open.
You can leave the flowers inside.

234
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,142
Okay.

235
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:04,141
Okay. That is where
that is going to have to stay.

236
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:08,577
- God, that shit was heavy.
- You wanted to help.

237
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:14,141
Oh, my God.
Is this yours?

238
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:17,702
No. That's Nate's, but he keeps
leaving it in my car.

239
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:20,626
- I love this book.
- You've read it?

240
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:23,661
Yeah. My friends and I were
all over it three summers ago...

241
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:27,139
...before they all turned into pretentious
drama nerds and abandoned me.

242
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,578
Thank God.

243
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:34,021
- What's your favorite part?
- Oh, they're too numerous to mention.

244
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,068
Where's that part where she, like,
stops speaking for a month...

245
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,862
...and just barks at them?

246
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,219
Brenda...

247
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,740
Brenda, I know you're angry.

248
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,828
Can you talk to me?

249
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:07,987
You know they put me in therapy
because I stole that foot?

250
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:10,265
Yeah. Nate told me.

251
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:13,945
God, I would love to go into one of those
sessions and just bark.

252
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,269
Just to see the look on his face.

253
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:24,265
So do you totally identify
with this book too?

254
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,550
Of course she does.
It's about her.

255
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,627
What?

256
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:33,274
She's Charlotte.

257
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,270
You're shitting me.

258
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,640
Is he for real?

259
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,194
Completely.

260
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,078
Oh, my God.

261
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,515
Oh, my God.

262
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,837
This is like meeting Gandhi or Jesus.

263
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,954
Don't tell me.
The book spoke to you.

264
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:55,471
Like it was written specifically for you.

265
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,397
Well, yeah, in a way.

266
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,275
Have you been to the website?

267
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,713
- There's a website?
- Oh, yes.

268
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:05,595
There's a fan club.

269
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,962
Yeah. Those lonely little girls
desperate for something to emulate.

270
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:13,561
Apparently, they're not original enough
to come up with anything on their own.

271
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,439
Well, that's what I like to see,
drinking before sundown.

272
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,322
Hi, I'm Billy.

273
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:35,165
- I'm Claire.
- How do you know my sister?

274
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:38,839
Through my brother Nate.
They're dating.

275
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,567
Oh, yeah? Dating?
Like what, going steady?

276
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,965
He give her his ID bracelet?

277
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,162
She carve his initials in her arms
so they'd be there forever?

278
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,041
Yo, Bren.

279
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,287
You should've seen me
out on the ocean today.

280
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:59,450
All those Venice dicks
taking themselves so seriously.

281
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:06,526
- You surf?
- Me? Do I look like I surf?

282
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,049
Do I?

283
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:13,324
You'll freeze your ass off
at this time of year, wearing that thing.

284
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,684
So? It's my ass.

285
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:19,810
Oh, fine. You wanna get pneumonia
again, go right ahead.

286
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:23,892
Claire, I should take you home.
I got stuff to do.

287
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,775
- That's all right, I'll take her.
- Great.

288
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:30,652
Oh, no, I've got time.
We just need to go right now.

289
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:32,848
If you have stuff to do,
don't worry about it.

290
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,288
Yeah, do your stuff.

291
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:37,375
I just have to take a shower.

292
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,412
So I'm walking along one day, and this
asshole stops me and asks if I'm all right.

293
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,612
He says I got a look.

294
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:04,896
He'd seen a man with that same
look once and had ignored it.

295
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:09,813
And that man had jumped out
a nine-story window.

296
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:16,577
Do you know the reconstruction
involved in a death like that?

297
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:23,817
This business gets under your skin.
It's like a fucking virus.

298
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:26,415
You can even see it on your face.

299
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,418
Smell it on you.

300
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:31,618
What the hell is this place?
This music?

301
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:35,623
Since when do you listen
to the Classics IV?

302
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:39,378
What did you do here?
Who the hell are you?

303
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:43,820
So many questions. Why couldn't you
ask them when I was still alive?

304
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,143
It's okay. I couldn't have answered
most of them anyway.

305
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,023
Unlike now.
Now I'm a fucking prophet.

306
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,663
Right.

307
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,259
You think I'm kidding, buddy boy?

308
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:04,824
That's one of the perks of being dead.
You know what happens after you die...

309
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:08,741
...and you know the meaning of life.

310
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:14,543
- That seems fairly useless.
- Yeah, I know.

311
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:17,348
Life is wasted on the living.

312
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:26,705
- Could've told me you were proud of me.
- You were never around for me to tell.

313
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:30,028
Which is exactly
what I was proud of you for.

314
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:34,995
Therein lies your Catch-22.

315
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:46,867
- So, what's the meaning of life?
- You really wanna know?

316
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,634
I don't know.

317
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,114
Will it fuck me up if I do?

318
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,761
Oh, David, you make
such a handsome deacon.

319
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:49,280
All those old stiffs.
Finally, a dose of Viagra to the place.

320
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:52,640
Oh, I don't mean that literally.
Not like you'd need it.

321
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:54,965
Thank you, Tracy.

322
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,161
So... No fianc'ee, huh?

323
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,043
No, no. That's over.

324
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,367
But she broke my heart,
and I'm just not ready...

325
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,085
...or interested in any sort
of relationship now.

326
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,647
- Come on, any relationship?
- I'm just not ready.

327
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,412
And I doubt that I will be
for quite some time.

328
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:17,890
Well, what if Cindy Crawford
were to walk up to you and say:

329
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:19,970
"Just use me for sex"?

330
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:24,929
- I would say no.
- Liar.

331
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:36,088
Is it so wrong
to want a little human contact?

332
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,773
You're lonely too.
I can tell.

333
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,932
For chrissake, Tracy.

334
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,615
What does it take?
No.

335
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:50,093
Well, you don't have to be
so mean about it.

336
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:52,732
Apparently, I do.
I come here to feed these people...

337
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,577
...because I don't want
to talk to anybody.

338
00:29:55,778 --> 00:30:00,011
Do us both a favor. Go to a bar.
Pick somebody up.

339
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:13,694
- No. We just met.
- I know. I'm sorry.

340
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:15,853
I'm just so turned on by you.

341
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:18,578
Shut up.

342
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,778
- I have to go home.
- Hey...

343
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:30,374
- I wanna see you again.
- Good.

344
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:34,901
But I'm not some skank
for you to fuck.

345
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:38,143
If that's what you're into,
go and find that somewhere else.

346
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:40,620
That's not what I'm into, Claire.

347
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:44,296
I swear.

348
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:51,899
If you're lying, I swear to God,
I will kill you.

349
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,899
I will kick your ass.

350
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,541
You do not want to mess with me.

351
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,504
- That ain't her.
- Excuse me?

352
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:52,753
That ain't my wife. That ain't my Hattie.
What did you do with my Hattie?

353
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,310
Mr. Jones, with all due respect...

354
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,590
I don't want your respect.
I want my wife.

355
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,834
Sir, that is your wife.

356
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:07,188
- You married?
- Yes, sir.

357
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,716
She all young and pretty,
know how to treat you right?

358
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,672
Yes, sir.

359
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:20,112
You can't believe how lucky
you are.

360
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:23,354
How life can be so good
to you, right?

361
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,836
She gonna turn to that.

362
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:32,712
We all do.

363
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:35,278
Well, don't that piss you off, boy?

364
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:38,877
Not yet.

365
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:44,238
- He used this how long?
- Seven years.

366
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,760
It's weird how you keep showing me
rooms people used to live in.

367
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:54,882
I think it's fucking weird. He'd sit in this
sad little room, doing God knows what.

368
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,683
Why does it have to be sad?

369
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:00,959
Look around.

370
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:06,398
- I think it's fascinating.
- Really? Why?

371
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,002
It's such a mystery, you know?

372
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:14,283
- You'll never know what went on here.
- That's exactly what's driving me crazy.

373
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,127
So, what if you did know?
Had it all explained to you.

374
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,243
I bet it wouldn't be nearly
as interesting or fun.

375
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:25,245
Your father would be a lot more boring.
You enjoy this.

376
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:28,091
Come on, don't you pick up
on something?

377
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:32,080
I thought things left marks in people,
in places, in time.

378
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,329
What, you think I'm a witch?

379
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:39,849
You really don't get any kind of vibe
from this place at all?

380
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:46,371
You wanna know what I think?

381
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:52,086
I think your father...

382
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,926
...wanted someplace
that was just his and nobody else's.

383
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:06,170
Nate, if you didn't know him
when he was alive, you never will.

384
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:11,449
I don't want to be somebody who,
when I die, nobody knows who I was.

385
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,530
So don't be.

386
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,940
How are you doing, Mr. Jones?

387
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,895
I'm sitting here, holding my dead wife's
hand. How do you think I'm doing?

388
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,890
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

389
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:36,459
- Oh, hello.
- For Jones.

390
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:41,421
Mr. Jones, see the beautiful flowers
for your wife's viewing tomorrow?

391
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:46,140
I don't know why you so excited.
They're just gonna shrivel up and die.

392
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,821
Well, thank you.

393
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:56,502
I'll see you out.

394
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:08,024
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but I'll have my sons...

395
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:11,186
...order flowers from another florist
if this behavior continues.

396
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:12,622
Which behavior?

397
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:15,707
This is our place of business.
There are grieving people here.

398
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,385
I can't have you skulking around
with that look in your eye.

399
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:21,421
What look?

400
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,185
That sex look.

401
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,626
Maybe you like it.

402
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:47,544
Lady wear red, she mean business.

403
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,712
This is just what was clean.

404
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:56,113
Lady, I can see it from here.
And I'm blind and deaf.

405
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:59,068
You need to get yourself laid.

406
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,194
Whoa. Time warp.

407
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,356
I told you.

408
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,037
It's pretty cozy.
For a morgue.

409
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,919
- It must be weird.
- You get used to it.

410
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,272
You ever done it with anyone here?

411
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,833
Yeah, right, and have
my mother walk in? No.

412
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,999
Wow, you look great!

413
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:51,002
- Shut up.
- Come on, seduce me.

414
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,684
There you go.
Oh, yeah. There you go.

415
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:59,240
Don't pretend
like you haven't done this before.

416
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:03,598
You are a natural. Look at you.
No, no, don't hide.

417
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,159
Wait.

418
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,924
Is this what you do?
You, like, shoot models and stuff?

419
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,800
Hardly.

420
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,921
Hurry, it's on a timer.

421
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:25,721
Just something to remember me by.

422
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,842
Hey, what do you think about Brenda and
your brother? Think they have a chance?

423
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:38,801
I hope so.
She's pretty amazing.

424
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:40,603
He'd be a real idiot to let her go.

425
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:43,167
Then again, he's capable
of being an idiot sometimes.

426
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:45,886
Yeah, so why is she into him?
Just hot sex?

427
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:49,369
I think he's really in love with her.

428
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:55,006
- How could he not be?
- Shit, I'm thirsty.

429
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:57,006
You got any beer?

430
00:37:57,214 --> 00:37:59,011
- No, sorry.
- It's all right.

431
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:02,810
- I should be heading out anyway.
- Oh, okay.

432
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,334
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

433
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,329
- Let's do this again.
- Okay.

434
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:22,651
Okay. Mr. Boelson is all juiced up.

435
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:26,816
I'll be in around 7 tomorrow
to airbrush him...

436
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:29,089
...get him ready for the viewing.

437
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:34,655
Unless, you know,
you want me to do him now.

438
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,170
I was kind of hoping to get home
before Vanessa put Julio down.

439
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,054
That's fine. Good night.

440
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:47,901
Need any help?

441
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:51,371
No, Federico.
Go home to your family.

442
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,294
Don't work too hard.

443
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,105
Mr. Jones.

444
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:32,702
Time to go home.

445
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,062
Who the hell are you?

446
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,904
I'm Nate. I work here.

447
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:46,822
- That's my wife in that box.
- I know.

448
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,984
- I'm very sorry.
- Fifty-six years I spent...

449
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:53,548
...sleeping in the same bed
with that woman.

450
00:39:55,553 --> 00:40:00,627
Fifty-six years of listening to her
talk about the same shit.

451
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,632
Day in, day out.

452
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,712
- It's late. Maybe I should drive you home.
- Shut the fuck up, boy.

453
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:10,590
- Let an old man speak.
- Okay.

454
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:15,428
She...

455
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:21,109
...chased me across the front yard with
a steak knife once. Tried to cut my ass.

456
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:24,508
We spent close to a year apart.

457
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:27,551
That time like a hole in me now.

458
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:35,917
She the only one who really knew me.

459
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:42,509
Your wife will always be with you
in your memories.

460
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,478
You love someone that much,
they never...

461
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,640
You sell that shit to somebody
who buying it, because I ain't.

462
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,916
You don't know nothing about love.

463
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:57,796
Some pretty little thing catches your eye,
next thing you know, it's been 56 years.

464
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,392
And you done shit all over yourself
in a movie theater...

465
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:03,242
...and she the only one
to help you clean it up.

466
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:05,514
That's love.

467
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,999
You don't know nothing.

468
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,005
I won't argue that.

469
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:28,156
Can I get you anything to drink?
I have beer, red wine, a little vodka.

470
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:31,678
No, just water, thanks.

471
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:36,245
I don't usually go out on a school night,
but you know how it is sometimes.

472
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:38,121
Yeah.

473
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:44,599
Here you go.
My ex.

474
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,120
We were together nearly two years,
then he dumped me for a 22-year-old...

475
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,720
...stand-in he met on location.

476
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:54,685
I think that's the only picture
I had of him I didn't tear up.

477
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:58,202
It's funny, you think
you know somebody, and...

478
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:00,890
I hear he's in AA now.

479
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:06,129
So are you in the business?

480
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:11,605
No. No, I'm a lawyer.
I'm from Boston.

481
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:14,688
God, how refreshing.

482
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:17,204
You tend to forget sometimes,
living in L. A...

483
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:21,209
...that there's this world
outside the entertainment industry...

484
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,611
...and that's the real world.

485
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:28,250
So, what do you do?

486
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:32,809
- Production accounting. I told you that.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,496
It's okay.

488
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,890
So, Jim...

489
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,335
...what do you like to do?

490
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,177
- Can we sit down?
- Sure.

491
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,978
Had a little too much
to drink there, Jim?

492
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:07,261
- You okay?
- Yeah.

493
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:47,379
I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

494
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:48,738
It's okay.

495
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:51,510
I should never have lashed out
at you like that. It's...

496
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,826
I don't know
what's wrong with me. L...

497
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,420
I was holding a saucepan
the other day...

498
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:04,823
...and all of a sudden, I remembered
making creamed corn in that pan.

499
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,781
Some night
when it was raining outside...

500
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:11,224
...and both the boys had colds and my
husband was on a call...

501
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:12,991
...picking up a body.

502
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,105
And then yesterday,
I was cleaning out the cabinets...

503
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:18,703
...and I found a jar of baby food
in the very back.

504
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:22,344
Strained carrots
from when Claire was a baby.

505
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:26,548
That jar had been sitting there
for over 15 years.

506
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:30,712
I am surrounded by these...

507
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:35,786
These relics
of a life that no longer exists.

508
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,116
We're here for the Jones viewing.

509
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,156
Right this way, please.

510
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,476
- Yeah?
- Oh, shit, Billy, did I wake you?

511
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:11,152
- I'm sorry. Fuck.
- Who is this?

512
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:13,398
It's Claire.

513
00:45:14,763 --> 00:45:19,632
- Who?
- It's Claire. Nate's sister.

514
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:25,997
I just wanted to see if maybe you wanted
to hang out after school again today.

515
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,116
Not really,

516
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,119
Come on, Claire,
you're what, 16?

517
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:36,514
What do you think I am, a pedophile?

518
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,363
Well?

519
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,891
I don't know
what you want me to say.

520
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:12,050
I don't want you to say anything.
I just thought you should see it.

521
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,968
Well, I've seen it.

522
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:20,803
So Dad traded a room for a funeral.
No wonder we never had any money.

523
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:23,049
Didn't Dad ever say anything
about this place?

524
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:27,133
Dad and I never talked
about anything but work.

525
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:29,842
That's exactly the relationship
you and I have.

526
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:34,371
Nate, people are allowed
to have private lives.

527
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:36,167
So what if Dad had a secret room?

528
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,412
I don't care if he brought
women here to fuck.

529
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:41,733
I don't care if he brought men
back here to fuck.

530
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:46,250
You think we should tell Mom
about it?

531
00:46:46,457 --> 00:46:49,734
Sure, why not? You won't be happy
until this whole family is in therapy.

532
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,488
That's kind of a leap.

533
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:58,335
I know you're pissed off
about a lot of shit.

534
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:01,531
But I didn't make any of that shit
happen. Right, I abandoned you.

535
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:04,300
Well, you know what?
I'm not your father. I'm not the one...

536
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,776
...whose responsibility it was not
to abandon you, so get over it, please.

537
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,251
Life is just too fucking short.

538
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:16,138
Thank you, Nate.
I appreciate your honesty.

539
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:19,254
Wrapped, as it was,
in such a bouquet of condescension.

540
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:26,137
If I were you, I'd pack this place up
before they start charging us rent.

541
00:48:22,472 --> 00:48:24,702
Quite a hottie, huh?

542
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:26,585
This is Mom.

543
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:31,266
You have no idea how beautiful
she was, buddy boy.

544
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:34,588
I have no idea who you were.

545
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:38,273
I really wasn't that interesting.

546
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,833
No, I think you probably were.

547
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:47,790
I think you were this great guy,
who was funny and weird and high.

548
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:54,069
I was just always so afraid
of everything you did.

549
00:48:54,277 --> 00:48:55,756
Death.

550
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,468
I made the decision to become a fucking
undertaker because I thought it was...

551
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,476
...something you believed in.
Now I find out...

552
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,034
...you think running away
is the best thing I ever did?

553
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,995
- Maybe.
- I kept us from selling to Kroehner.

554
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,559
And I'm taking the funeral director's
license test next month.

555
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:24,359
Maybe I was just covering up for how
embarrassed I was when you left.

556
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:28,676
Is that why you left half
the business to me?

557
00:49:30,923 --> 00:49:33,232
- To get back at me?
- Maybe.

558
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:36,157
Maybe I wanted to see if you
had the balls to go against me.

559
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,913
Or maybe I really wanted you to have it.
You'll never know.

560
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:44,277
Goddamn it! When are you gonna stop
fucking with me?

561
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:46,840
When are you gonna stop caring
what I thought?

562
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,998
"I never knew my father."

563
00:49:51,646 --> 00:49:54,764
Get over it, please.

564
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:58,205
Life is just too fucking short.

565
00:50:08,649 --> 00:50:12,608
My brother is a very complicated man.

566
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,085
And very high-maintenance.

567
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,640
Don't get me wrong,
I love him dearly.

568
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,127
But I pity the woman
he ends up with.

569
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:24,726
See, that's the same thing
I'd say about my brother.

570
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:27,730
Nate is not even
in the same league.

571
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:30,526
Was I crazy?

572
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:33,531
I mean,
Billy was really acting like...

573
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,804
Did you fuck him?

574
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:39,328
No.

575
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:42,289
Well, you dodged a bullet there.

576
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:45,173
Is every man alive a total asshole?

577
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:49,846
At some point or another.
Then again, so are we.

578
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:53,451
Come on, we gotta go.

579
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:58,407
I still cannot get over the fact
that you are Charlotte, Light and Dark,

580
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:01,006
You have to,
because it's very irritating.

581
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:12,098
- Mr. Jones is still downstairs.
- I know.

582
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:18,530
This silver has been in
your father's family for three generations.

583
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,340
I don't believe I've ever used it.

584
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,331
I'm going to put an ad in the paper
and see if I can sell them.

585
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:29,332
Mom, I found something
you probably should have.

586
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:49,581
- Where did you find these?
- In the office, among Dad's things.

587
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,662
Look at what a child I was.

588
00:51:57,266 --> 00:52:00,383
Your father was leaving for Vietnam.

589
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:03,340
He'd volunteered as a medic.

590
00:52:03,547 --> 00:52:05,902
Your grandfather was furious.

591
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,666
You don't remember
your grandfather, do you?

592
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:12,096
No.

593
00:52:12,668 --> 00:52:15,866
He was a very unhappy man...

594
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,785
...and he wanted everyone else
to be unhappy too.

595
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,824
We were all living in this house.

596
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,747
You were a baby,
and there was no privacy, so...

597
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:34,150
Nathaniel and I got a room
at a motel.

598
00:52:36,232 --> 00:52:38,871
Some seedy place in the valley.

599
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:49,872
And we made love like maniacs.

600
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:55,115
Like it was the last time.

601
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:01,948
Your father took these pictures...

602
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,515
...in that dank little room.

603
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:13,954
Told me he kept them in his pocket
in Vietnam to protect him.

604
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:24,470
It's frightening
how much we change.

605
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,316
Are you staying for dinner, dear?

606
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,394
Yeah.

607
00:53:43,362 --> 00:53:46,321
Mr. Jones. Probably should think
about heading home.

608
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,118
You've got a long day ahead of you
tomorrow with the funeral and...

609
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:52,963
Mr. Jones?

610
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,961
Mr. Jones.

611
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:02,956
Mr. Jones?

612
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:08,003
Oh, shit.

613
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:43,308
