1
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,783
Tad? Is that you?

2
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,262
You're early.

3
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:54,201
<i>Time to kiss</i>
<i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

4
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:17,089
Seriously, several people told me
that my scene...

5
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:20,654
is really the only one
that's even remotely scary.

6
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,900
Becky, you make a major impact
in this movie.

7
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:29,533
Somebody even said that Angelica's scene,
it wasn't even scary at all.

8
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:33,339
Like, it was funny, and not in a good way.

9
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:36,837
We have to make sure
you don't get pigeon-holed now...

10
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:40,248
which is why I think
you shouldn't show your tits anymore.

11
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:44,887
What a piece of shit!

12
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:48,688
I know, it makes fucking <i>Blair Witch 2</i>
look like <i>Titanic.</i>

13
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,493
It's just so fucking gratuitous!

14
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,925
I think that
what makes this movie different...

15
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,833
is that the violence isn't so gratuitous.

16
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,934
It's more like the whole movie is about...

17
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:04,305
the whole psychological nature of fear.

18
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,239
I totally maxed out his Visa card
paying for it.

19
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:11,805
Then somebody in Joe Roth's office saw it
and said it was genius.

20
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:14,113
And now we have three meetings.

21
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,847
Seriously, you could write it.
I've read your poetry and it's really good.

22
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,059
I think I should direct it, too.

23
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:25,256
Yeah, and we should have
this really hot sex scene, all gritty and real.

24
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,698
You know, like, European.

25
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:32,329
I'm not showing my ass. My manager says
I need to stop showing my ass.

26
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:57,153
You have a piece of toilet paper
stuck to your shoe.

27
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,753
Shut up! Where?

28
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,960
- Honey, it's not working.
- What?

29
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:33,429
No, no. It's not gonna happen for me.

30
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:49,212
It's not. It's not gonna happen for me.

31
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,476
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:57,082
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Don't take it personally.

33
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,721
Don't make this about me.

34
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,089
What? Am I not allowed
to not have sex for once?

35
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,594
Is that what our relationship is now?

36
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:09,295
Wait a minute. You woke me up
by going down on me.

37
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,609
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,570
Maybe that car accident we had...

39
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:26,378
gave me some weird,
Oliver-Sacks-blow-to-the-head disease.

40
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,118
Sorry. My whole life seems like a bad dream.

41
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,629
It's like somebody else's life.

42
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:46,993
Like, if my life were a movie,
I'd fall asleep or I'd walk out.

43
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:54,338
- You still not seeing any clients?
- I can't.

44
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,673
I can't face it.

45
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:01,912
You know...

46
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,991
sometimes you just got to force yourself
to be active.

47
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,192
- When you're, you know...
- Like what?

48
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,289
When you're what?

49
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,067
You think I'm depressed?

50
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,864
- Are you?
- Yeah.

51
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,100
Doesn't mean I wanna talk about it.

52
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,239
Okay.

53
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,320
This is my sister-in-law, Angie.

54
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,756
- Angelica.
- It's nice to meet you.

55
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,827
Likewise. And this is Brody Farrell.

56
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,264
- Are you the next of kin?
- No.

57
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,562
Becky's parents died when she was two.

58
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,206
She was raised by her grandmother,
who also died.

59
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:00,778
She didn't really have anybody, except us.

60
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:05,879
- I see. Can I ask who will be...
- The cast of the movie.

61
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,576
We're all pitching in to pay for it.

62
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:15,221
We're going to need one person
to be designated as the...

63
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,158
- Brody will do that.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,992
She was sort of my girlfriend.

65
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:25,159
Do you know
what kind of service you'd like?

66
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,363
Cheap.

67
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,737
We provide a variety of services
for the more budget-conscious client.

68
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,708
- Sorry. Just let me turn this off.
- Take it.

69
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,710
I can handle it.

70
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,082
Please excuse me.

71
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,691
- David Fisher.
<i>- Hi, David. It's Kevin Miller.</i>

72
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:54,289
<i>You answered my personal ad</i>
<i>in the</i> LA Weekly. <i>I'm the fireman.</i>

73
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,100
Yes, hi. Of course.

74
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:01,333
We can start with
the most simple of traditional funerals...

75
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,337
which would include
our American Eagle casket here.

76
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,502
I don't think we should bury her.

77
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:10,210
Becky was totally terrified of the dark.

78
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,379
We can still have a viewing...

79
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:22,354
during which the casket will never
be closed, followed by a cremation.

80
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,831
That's good. And then we could scatter
her ashes some place she really liked.

81
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,992
Like Griffith Park,
or the Lava Lounge on La Brea.

82
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,366
I mean, I think we can skip the casket.

83
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,104
You sound like a really nice guy, too.

84
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,241
<i>I am a really nice guy. So, do you want</i>
<i>to meet for coffee later this afternoon?</i>

85
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:50,482
This afternoon? Sure. I have something
at 3:00, but I can meet you after that.

86
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,888
<i>Great, let's say at 4.00,</i>
<i>at the Up All Night Coffee House.</i>

87
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,790
<i>I'll be wearing a red baseball cap.</i>

88
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,795
Great, I love red.
It's one of my favorite colors...

89
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:02,195
- of which I have several.
<i>- Okay, see you then.</i>

90
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,004
This is a beautiful
and unusual cremains vessel.

91
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,837
The ashes actually fill these dolphins,
which are carved out inside.

92
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,606
She wasn't really into dolphins.

93
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,780
I remember somebody suggesting
she boycott tuna...

94
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:22,816
because of the whole
dolphins-getting-caught-in-the-net thing.

95
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,354
And she said:

96
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,450
"Fuck dolphins. I want a Nicoise salad."

97
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,961
- What are these?
- Those are keepsake miniature urns.

98
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,861
Sort of like lockets, if you will.

99
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,468
So everybody can get a piece of her.

100
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:44,942
Yes, it's an old custom from Thailand.

101
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:49,841
- Becky loved Thai food.
- So what did I miss?

102
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,595
I'm sorry I'm late.

103
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,963
Why weren't you at school today?

104
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:14,699
I was in school today.
I just wasn't in American History.

105
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,706
I mean, who needs to know
that shit anyways, right?

106
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,811
Somebody who wants to have a concept
of how the world works...

107
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,509
so they can have a fucking chance in life.

108
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,550
What crawled up your ass?

109
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,679
It's all lies anyways.

110
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,558
Where were you?

111
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:38,687
Andy and I skipped out after lunch.
We went to the car museum.

112
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,128
Did you get high?

113
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,732
I'm 18 years old, living in fucking California.
I'm not allowed to get high?

114
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,635
I'm worried about you, Gabe.

115
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,074
In case you don't remember,
I have good reason to be.

116
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,646
I'm sorry, okay?

117
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,619
But you don't have to worry about me,
I swear.

118
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,823
Just please don't lie to me.

119
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,128
I'm not.

120
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,503
I'm okay...

121
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,566
and I'm gonna stay okay...

122
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,509
as long as I have you.

123
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,299
<i>Let's take a look at your test results.</i>

124
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:57,805
Well, I have some very good news.
You tested negative for the HIV antibody.

125
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,241
Thank God.

126
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,844
You need to be tested again in six months,
just to be safe.

127
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:07,145
Let's see, negative for chlamydia,
all hepatitises, syphilis.

128
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,287
Positive for gonorrhea.

129
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,047
- What?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:15,257
Have you had any pain
or difficulty urinating?

131
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,760
- No.
- Any penile or anal discharge?

132
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,691
No.

133
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,731
Gonorrhea can be
completely asymptomatic...

134
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,464
but if it's left untreated, it can
lead to severe problems down the line.

135
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:30,065
I'm gonna give you some Cipro.
It usually knocks it right out.

136
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,567
Well, this is certainly embarrassing.

137
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,771
Did you engage in unprotected sex?

138
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,307
Yes.

139
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,581
Bad boy.

140
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,496
- How was school?
- Dull and depressing.

141
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,530
What are you reading?

142
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,434
<i>Now That You Know.</i>

143
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,842
Now that you know what?

144
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,370
That David is gay.

145
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,776
I take it you knew already.

146
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,355
How do you feel about it?

147
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,520
Are you hurt? Angry?

148
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,497
- Do you wish he wasn't gay?
- No.

149
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,063
Those are all valid feelings, you know.

150
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:36,339
I don't care if he's gay,
just as long as he's happy.

151
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,006
According to this book...

152
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,938
we should all be very open to how we feel...

153
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,614
and we should
try to express those feelings...

154
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,446
because the foundation of intimacy is truth.

155
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:49,675
Okay.

156
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,086
Have you ever had any feelings
of same-sex attraction?

157
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,586
What? No, Mom.

158
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,689
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know.

159
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,432
When I was your age...

160
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,331
I actually had a little crush on Jane Fonda.

161
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,146
She's single again, so now's your chance.

162
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:27,046
I just never got into
that whole promiscuous thing, you know.

163
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,556
First guy I had sex with...

164
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:32,562
I ended up in a relationship with
for four years.

165
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,894
One-man kind of guy. Always have been.
What about you?

166
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,000
Definitely.

167
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:43,104
Sex just for the sake of having sex,
what is that?

168
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:47,042
Don't get me wrong. I love sex.
I'm a very sexual being.

169
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:52,182
I just think it's better when there's
something emotional going on behind it.

170
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,810
I credit my parents for that.

171
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,617
My mom and dad have been together
for almost 40 years.

172
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,521
They're still hot for each other.

173
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,856
And they've never been anything
but 100% supportive of me.

174
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:05,787
Wow.

175
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:22,971
I gotta get to work.
Listen, it's been great meeting you.

176
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:26,783
This was fun. Would you like to do it again?

177
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,612
I don't think so.

178
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,253
You seem like a really nice guy,
but I gotta be honest.

179
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,484
I didn't feel much of a spark.

180
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,462
Can't make it happen if it's not there, right?

181
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,838
It definitely looks like AVM.

182
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,107
Fuck.

183
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,514
So now what?

184
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:07,589
Well, that depends.
Remind me what your symptoms have been.

185
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,850
- Headaches.
- All the time?

186
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:14,128
No, just occasionally.
Mostly on the left side of my head.

187
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,292
Any seizures? Impairment of vision?
Sense of smell?

188
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:23,801
Once I had a flutter,
just on the edge of my vision.

189
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,673
I'm as blind as a bat.

190
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:29,008
Once I woke up,
I could see perfectly out of my left eye.

191
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,210
Lasted for a day and then it went away.
Who knows what the hell that was?

192
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,179
So what next?

193
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,217
Well, let's see.

194
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,389
It's in a not overly-eloquent brain area.

195
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,265
- You left-handed?
- No.

196
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,968
- That's not good.
- Why not?

197
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,701
And it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

198
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,744
Yeah, it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

199
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:02,637
Okay.

200
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:06,347
You want options, I'll give you the big three:

201
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,611
Cranial surgery. Not a picnic.

202
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:11,454
Embolization.

203
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,889
Closing off the blood vessels
by injecting glue into them.

204
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,952
Sometimes we use platinum coils instead.

205
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:23,125
And finally, radial surgery.

206
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:26,263
Focused radiation.

207
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,197
Die, you little motherfucker!

208
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,716
If I'd never been in a car accident
and gotten a routine x-ray of my skull...

209
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,412
this would've never even come up, right?

210
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,253
Until something happened.

211
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:51,785
It's possible that I could go my entire life
without it ever creating a problem.

212
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:55,762
- Anything's possible.
- Do you think I need surgery?

213
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,334
I can't really say, without more tests.

214
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,996
I think you might benefit from embolization.

215
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:05,405
However, anytime you close off
the large arteries going into an AVM...

216
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,377
the smaller blood vessels feeding it
tend to increase in size.

217
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,215
Okay, so it doesn't really work.

218
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:19,921
- There's only so much we can do.
- Oh, God!

219
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:23,152
Fuck! Fine. You know what?
Just don't do anything, okay?

220
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:27,891
I'm going to put this all out of my head,
no pun intended, and just get on with life.

221
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm not sure...

222
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,931
I don't give a fuck what you think,
you arrogant piece of shit.

223
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:37,040
Okay, even if we decide not to do anything
at this juncture...

224
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,905
There's no "we." I decide.

225
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,638
I'd still like to get another MRI on you
in 12 months.

226
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:44,510
And I'd like
a fucking straight answer, asshole.

227
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,616
<i>It's kind of ironic.</i>

228
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:51,549
You don't smoke, you run every day,
eat all that healthy crap.

229
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:52,917
Shut up!

230
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,291
Now me, I smoked, I drank,
I ate any old thing I wanted.

231
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:02,122
And I inhaled embalming fluid
for God knows how long. You know what?

232
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,363
If it wasn't for that bus,
I'd have lived to be 93.

233
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:11,473
It's the first time I've driven since then.
You may want to fasten your seatbelt.

234
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:15,445
Well, who's the dead man in this car?
It's not me!

235
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,111
Fuck you!

236
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,887
<i>We thank you, Heavenly Father...</i>

237
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,720
for this and all thy blessings
in Christ's name. Amen.

238
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,918
Amen.

239
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:42,724
I've invited Nikolai to dinner Sunday night.
I'd like you all to be there.

240
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,234
Nikolai the flower guy?

241
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,936
Yes, he and I are having
a sexual relationship now.

242
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,076
I'm not sure if it's something
that's going to last, but there it is.

243
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:59,879
We're all adults. We're all sexual beings.
We should acknowledge that.

244
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:05,915
Okay.

245
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:12,020
Nate, I'd like you to invite Brenda.
Claire, I'd like you to invite Gabriel Dimas.

246
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:17,134
And, David, if you have a special friend,
I'd like for him to come, as well.

247
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,304
Why is my friend special?

248
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:25,308
All right. If you're having sex with anyone,
I'd like to meet him. Is that better?

249
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,741
Not really.

250
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:30,605
Stop acting like children!

251
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,711
- Where are you going?
- I'm just getting an aspirin.

252
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,415
Do you have a headache?

253
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,948
No, I read you should take an aspirin a day.
It keeps the blood thin.

254
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:45,894
Please, if our blood were any thinner,
we'd evaporate.

255
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:50,161
What's that supposed to mean? Is that
some sort of insult? We're thin-blooded?

256
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:54,227
Mom, no, it was a joke. I'm more
thin-blooded than any of us, probably.

257
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,139
Are you seeing anyone?

258
00:22:58,876 --> 00:22:59,900
No.

259
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,573
Why not?

260
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,914
Sex is an important and healthy part of life.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

261
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:10,613
Yes, I know that.
Unfortunately, I'm not having any right now.

262
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:13,415
What happened to that cop...

263
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:15,514
the black man?

264
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,457
He met someone else.

265
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,071
Thank you.

266
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,840
You don't have any free time tomorrow?

267
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,978
<i>- I don't think so.</i>
- I'd really like to see you.

268
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:39,481
<i>I have three shiatsu appointments.</i>

269
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,612
You're the one that wanted me
to get on with my life.

270
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,853
<i>You can still come Sunday night</i>
<i>for dinner, right?</i>

271
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,622
Even if just for the entertainment value.
It's bound to be a freak fest.

272
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,623
<i>I think so. Maybe.</i>

273
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,692
- I miss you.
- You just saw me.

274
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,867
<i>I know, I just...</i>

275
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:06,399
would really like to be with you
at this moment in time.

276
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:09,379
- Right now.
<i>- I'll see you soon.</i>

277
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,915
Sunday, okay?

278
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,316
I love you.

279
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:17,343
I love you, too.

280
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,911
- Hey, Rico.
- Hey, boss man. I've got a favor to ask you.

281
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:49,044
Okay.

282
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,953
Could you please drop her off
at the crematorium for me tonight?

283
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,691
Come on, man.
Vanessa's just a bit overwhelmed at home.

284
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,821
Julio's got a cold and Augusto
hasn't slept through the night for a month.

285
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:06,902
No, I can't.

286
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,334
I'm sorry, Rico, but I can't.

287
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,172
Okay.

288
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:21,742
Can you at least help me
put her inside the box?

289
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:24,913
Sure.

290
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:33,595
So, cardboard box? Classy.

291
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:38,662
She obviously didn't think her life was
worth anything, so it makes sense to me.

292
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,437
On three. One, two, three.

293
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,535
It's kind of sad.

294
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,610
It's not.

295
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:54,181
She threw her fucking life away.
It's not sad. It's pathetic.

296
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:13,336
We tend to forget how many gifts
God has given each and every one of us...

297
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:17,136
because our lives
are so filled with distractions...

298
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:20,741
crowded with messages
competing for our attention...

299
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:23,745
encouraging us to be unhappy
with our lives.

300
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,642
If only we looked younger...

301
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:28,880
had perfect skin...

302
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,511
zero body fat.

303
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:37,223
The truth of the matter is
God loves us just the way we are.

304
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,794
Some people said, "Congratulations.
You've really shaken things up." Whatever.

305
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:47,303
Most people in the congregation wouldn't
even make eye contact with me after that.

306
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,071
So now I'm back at St. Stephen's.

307
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,311
So, how are you guys?

308
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:03,417
- Good. We're good.
- Just got back from a weekend in San Diego.

309
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,988
- Spectacular.
- We went parasailing.

310
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,882
Keith won't admit it,
but he was scared to death.

311
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:12,354
I was not scared.
Might have had a little rush of adrenaline...

312
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,556
but that's the point, right?

313
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:17,958
I'll have him hang-gliding
by the end of the year, if it kills me.

314
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:22,870
In your dreams, fool! I am not breaking
every bone in my body just to impress you.

315
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:26,372
Seven years I've been hang-gliding.
I never broke anything.

316
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:29,173
- You're just lucky.
- Don't I know it?

317
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:36,718
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>only one of these men will be crowned...</i>

318
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:40,085
<i>Mr. Gay Black America!</i>

319
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,690
Did I tell you I'm moving?

320
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:53,197
- Where?
- Same building. A bigger place opened up.

321
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,637
We've been wanting to get a dog.

322
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,804
Great.

323
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,749
Do I seem more tense than usual?

324
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:12,819
You're not supposed to talk, remember?
It takes us both out of it.

325
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:18,218
The only conversation is between your body
and my hands.

326
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:23,963
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but we're on my dime here.

327
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:30,840
I discovered one of the worst things
about selling 3 million books...

328
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:35,472
is constantly feeling
like I have to apologize for it, you know?

329
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,544
It's like, "I make a ton of money,
so I must be part of the problem."

330
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:43,748
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

331
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:46,182
You do seem more tense than usual.

332
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:50,488
I'm not responsible for cancer.
I'm not responsible for world hunger.

333
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:54,893
What if I'm just happy,
and that's my contribution to the world?

334
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:00,364
I'm thinking of pitching a book
to my publisher.

335
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:05,101
Bit of a cultural history,
tracing the how, and the why, and when...

336
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:08,438
- it became such a sin to be happy.
- Drop.

337
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:11,776
Who knows, it might help
some of those poor sad fucks...

338
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:14,477
who are incapable of experiencing joy.

339
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,822
- Get out of my house.
- Excuse me?

340
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:23,423
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- What is wrong with you?

341
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,860
You don't have any respect for me
or what I do.

342
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,057
I'm just another servant
who has to listen to your bullshit...

343
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:33,297
and pretend like I don't think you're
the stupid asshole windbag that you are.

344
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,564
You crazy bitch.

345
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:39,436
I'm paying you for a shiatsu,
and I intend to get a shiatsu.

346
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,477
I don't need your fucking money.

347
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:51,879
I do not allow people to treat me like this.

348
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:56,220
Yeah? Well, if you don't
get out of my fucking house right now...

349
00:29:56,293 --> 00:30:00,491
I'll call the <i>LA Times</i> and I'll tell them
about the lipo scars on your ass.

350
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,232
Right now.

351
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:07,731
Get out!

352
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:28,484
<i>So this is where the magic happens.</i>

353
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,719
Yeah, this is it.

354
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:35,965
What's that smell? It's like...

355
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,626
Disinfectant, burnt coffee, embalming fluid.

356
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:50,445
"For the velvety look and feel
of actual living tissue."

357
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:55,547
- No fucking way!
- You do not even want to know.

358
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:59,520
They have these plastic screws,
only bigger...

359
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:03,349
that they stick into people's orifices,
so stuff won't spill out.

360
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:06,692
- That's some kind of fucked up.
- Welcome to my world.

361
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:18,772
So this is where my brother was?

362
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:23,501
Jesus, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
brought you down here.

363
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:28,515
I'm the one who asked to see it.

364
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:42,224
What?

365
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:46,162
You're the first guy I've ever brought home
to meet my family...

366
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,667
and I feel weird, you know? I feel nervous.

367
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:56,040
Don't worry. I will be on my best behavior.

368
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,104
Okay? Come on.

369
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,859
Your mother is a good woman.

370
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:21,903
- Yes, we're aware of that.
- David, give him a break.

371
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:24,469
Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother.

372
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,874
He's been majorly cranky
ever since he stopped getting laid.

373
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,117
- How old you are?
- Thirty-one.

374
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:41,613
Good.

375
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:45,761
I had a son.

376
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:49,090
He would be a little bit older than you.

377
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,395
He was a student of medicine.

378
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,810
- Look who's here.
- Hello.

379
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:27,596
I've got major cotton mouth.

380
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,074
- Who wants to say grace?
- I will say grace.

381
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:38,806
"The poor shall eat, and be filled.

382
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:43,109
"And those that seek the Lord
shall praise him.

383
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:47,782
"Their hearts will live forever and ever.

384
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:54,061
"Glory be to the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

385
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:57,459
"both now and forever...

386
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:01,602
"and unto the ages of ages.

387
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:03,399
"Amen.

388
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:10,006
"Lord have mercy.

389
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,484
"Lord, bless.

390
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,952
"O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God...

391
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:26,219
"for the sake of the prayers
of thy most pure mother and all the saints...

392
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,491
"have mercy on us.

393
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:30,992
"Amen."

394
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,871
Nikolai, you are so beautiful.

395
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,274
Thank you.

396
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,911
You're such a beautiful person.
There is this total light coming out of you.

397
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,617
That's a very unusual compliment, Nate.

398
00:34:57,294 --> 00:35:00,923
- Your brother is high.
- I know, look at his eyes.

399
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:10,094
- Are you all right?
- I am more than all right.

400
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,141
I haven't felt this good in...
I don't even know how long it's been.

401
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,474
Yes.

402
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,282
You know how long it's been
since I've heard you do that?

403
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:29,917
Remember when we were first going out,
you used to laugh all the time.

404
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:32,518
I miss that. Your laughter's like music.

405
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,097
- Nate.
- What?

406
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,258
You're high.

407
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:42,635
No, I'm not.

408
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:45,167
Am I?

409
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,672
Look at the light.

410
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,244
Oh, my God, I am high.

411
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:59,451
I love the little...

412
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,619
They're like halos.

413
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:08,059
What is he high on?

414
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,357
I wouldn't know.

415
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:15,131
I am so not hungry.

416
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:21,569
I think this went pretty good tonight.

417
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,077
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,911
- It was awkward and embarrassing.
- What?

419
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,850
I mean, my son is high on drugs!

420
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:35,788
What am I supposed to do about that?
Should I intervene? Join a support group?

421
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,617
He just seems happy.

422
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,731
We're going to the movies.

423
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:47,063
Good night, Mrs. Fisher.
Thank you for dinner.

424
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,502
What movie?

425
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:51,507
We haven't decided yet,
but we'll be back late.

426
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,737
Mom, you said yourself, we're all adults.

427
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,738
We'll be back late.

428
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:00,247
Good night.

429
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,189
It's all about flowing.

430
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:13,929
It flows up, it flows down.

431
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:17,125
And then, sometimes,
things stop it from flowing. You stay.

432
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,159
It's like you just move in a little pool.

433
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,330
You're like a little eddy.

434
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:28,408
And that's what it all comes down to.

435
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:34,681
Everything in my life, every thing...

436
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:37,549
You know, this thing in my head...

437
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,112
it's all about flow.

438
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,586
Flow?

439
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:55,696
Oh, my God!

440
00:37:56,673 --> 00:38:00,404
That was so totally you!
That was just so totally David!

441
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,145
I love you.

442
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:08,206
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- No, you have to take him with you.

443
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:10,947
Hope I did nothing to fuck you up
when we were kids.

444
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,784
Not when he's like this.

445
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:15,685
Did you know I taught David
how to masturbate?

446
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,895
No, I didn't, and you know what, Nate?
That's fascinating, but I have to go.

447
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,694
No, just wait a second.
I just want to say goodbye. Come here.

448
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,124
Oh, God!

449
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:31,906
- I love you so fucking much.
- You're so fucking high.

450
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:36,042
But how'd I get that way?
You can't just get high out of nowhere.

451
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:39,445
- You have to take drugs. I didn't take any.
- Did you take any aspirin?

452
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,742
Yeah.

453
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,878
There may have been
a stray tab of Ecstasy...

454
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,615
in the aspirin bottle in the kitchen cabinet.

455
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:54,489
Oh, dear. You call me when you crash.

456
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:58,832
No, call me after you crash.
You know what? Call me next week.

457
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,275
I hope you like her.

458
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:15,375
- It's important to me that you like her.
- I do like her.

459
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:19,214
'Cause you're the only brother I have.

460
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:24,885
<i>Time to kiss</i>
<i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

461
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:26,856
Yeah, slice her up!

462
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,259
That was hostile.

463
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:34,564
Isn't that the girl that you guys are burying?

464
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:38,101
- She's hot.
- She's hot and dead.

465
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,078
<i>This calls for someone with experience.</i>

466
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:45,341
<i>Someone who knows her way</i>
<i>around Griffith Park.</i>

467
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,815
<i>- That's me.</i>
<i>- In the daytime.</i>

468
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,813
<i>You gotta love her.</i>

469
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:54,653
<i>In fact, if God gave me the ingredients</i>
<i>and told me to make a woman...</i>

470
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,388
<i>I'd make her just like my wife.</i>

471
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:05,998
<i>They lost no time in tucking into</i>
<i>the wonderful meal Boris had prepared.</i>

472
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,662
<i>And then there was a dessert.</i>

473
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:13,038
<i>I guess Boris knows I always like to have</i>
<i>lettuce for dessert, don't you, Boris?</i>

474
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:16,942
<i>I hope the meal was satisfactory.</i>

475
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,448
<i>It was delightful, Boris!</i>
<i>You're a wonderful cook.</i>

476
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:25,718
<i>It was nothing, Martha.</i>
<i>Straight out of the cookbook.</i>

477
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,754
<i>It's yummy, Boris.</i>
<i>I couldn't eat another thing.</i>

478
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,717
<i>Yeah, it's not bad for a first effort.</i>

479
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:36,690
Fuck.

480
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,277
Buddy boy!

481
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:36,252
Come on, saved a place for you.

482
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:43,425
Chinese checkers.

483
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:48,767
- I always hated this game.
- That's because you never played for money.

484
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,837
Nate, I want you to meet
a couple of friends of mine.

485
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,112
Well, honey, this is the man.

486
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:02,544
Death.

487
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,012
The Grim Reaper.

488
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:07,917
Cigar?

489
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:12,693
- No, thanks.
- Good for you, baby. That stuff is nasty.

490
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,922
- And this is...
- My partner.

491
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,397
That sounds so professional. I love it.

492
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,364
- Life.
- Shut up.

493
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:26,703
Oh, yeah, it's a whole yin-yang thing.

494
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:29,574
You telling me
you two are in business together?

495
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:32,877
Honey, me and him
are in all kinds of shit together!

496
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:37,045
Let's just say
it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.

497
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:39,711
It's your turn.

498
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:44,319
Shouldn't I wait for you
to start a new game?

499
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:46,726
This game ain't never gonna end.

500
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,932
You're either in the game, or you're out of it.

501
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:54,136
"On or off the bus," if you prefer.

502
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:56,861
All right, I'm in.

503
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,872
You gotta put something in the kitty, son.

504
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,677
- What are you betting?
- Everything.

505
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:09,045
All right, I'll bet everything. Whatever.

506
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,929
- I'm shaking.
- Hey, buddy boy, no.

507
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:25,467
You don't wanna get this guy mad,
believe me.

508
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:28,629
I don't get mad.
I have people who do it for me.

509
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:39,106
Showoff!

510
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:43,018
But that always gets me going.

511
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:47,286
You wanna fuck me, puppet head?

512
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,060
Momma!

513
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:04,531
Yeah, baby! That's it.

514
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:08,001
Go to town, big daddy!

515
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:19,287
Big cosmic mystery.
Right here, right in front of you.

516
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:23,854
You can't say your old man
never took you any place interesting.

517
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:26,254
Yeah, but I'm high.

518
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,196
I know I'm high.

519
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,995
"All that lives, lives forever.

520
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,075
"Only the shell,
the perishable passes away."

521
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,303
Fuck, yeah.

522
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:45,574
"The spirit is without end. Eternal.

523
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,849
"Deathless."

524
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,618
<i>Now take this over here and...</i>

525
00:44:56,793 --> 00:44:59,887
<i>Look at that, folks.</i>
<i>Look at that for a holiday dinner.</i>

526
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:05,495
<i>If we had some mint jelly,</i>
<i>that would be fabulous.</i>

527
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:07,263
<i>- Unbelievable!</i>
<i>- Smell that.</i>

528
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:10,128
<i>So all I get to do is smell it?</i>

529
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,075
<i>- Show them.</i>
<i>- Smell this.</i>

530
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,843
<i>- Isn't that wonderful?</i>
<i>- Oh, boy!</i>

531
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,959
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, no, did I wake you?

532
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,658
Yeah, you did. What's up?

533
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:42,003
I just wanted to thank you
for inviting me out...

534
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:45,438
- with you and Eddie yesterday after church.
- Okay.

535
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,172
<i>And to tell you that...</i>

536
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:51,574
it's really important to me
that we've remained friends.

537
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,150
If you'd ever like to do something,
just the two of us, I'd really like that.

538
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:02,624
Look, David, I'm happy that we're friends...

539
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,188
but I'm in a relationship. A good one.

540
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:11,656
- I know.
- You and me, it ain't happening.

541
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:17,338
Yeah, I know that. It's just kind of hard
for me to be around you and Eddie together.

542
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,370
You need to get over that.

543
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:23,170
Jesus, Keith, could you be
a little more self-righteous?

544
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,483
- Good morning, Mom.
- You're up early.

545
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:42,227
I've been having trouble sleeping recently.
Not sure why.

546
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,400
Where's Nikolai?

547
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:56,475
- Home.
- He didn't stay over?

548
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,004
Of course not.

549
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,775
You know, Mom...

550
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:07,848
if you did want for him to stay over,
that would be your right.

551
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:12,658
- I know that. I don't need your permission.
- No, you don't. Nor do I need yours.

552
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:16,755
Of course not.

553
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:23,205
You had a terrible time last night,
didn't you?

554
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,271
Kind of.

555
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,805
I did it for you. Arranged the whole evening.

556
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,575
- Why?
- Some stupid book told me to.

557
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:39,143
- Throw that book away.
- I intend to.

558
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:46,358
Does Nate have a problem with drugs now?
Is this something I need to know about?

559
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:48,653
I think he took it by accident.

560
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:51,666
How can something like that
be an accident?

561
00:47:56,973 --> 00:48:01,000
Rebecca Milford's star shone all too briefly.

562
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,870
But, oh, how brightly it shone.

563
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:06,679
This is really boring.

564
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:10,081
How very, very brightly indeed.

565
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,454
No, it's hilarious, is what it is.

566
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,418
Gabe, a girl died.

567
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,154
So what? Everybody dies.

568
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:32,573
How did Ecstasy get in the aspirin bottle?
Is that Claire's idea of a joke?

569
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:35,737
I think I might have left it in there.

570
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:42,245
- Where did you get it?
- You remember the square-dancing guy?

571
00:48:47,323 --> 00:48:49,917
Do you think you could get some more?

572
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:59,599
I wrote something about Becky...

573
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,202
that I'd like to share with everyone here.

574
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:14,341
<i>Tiny Venus</i>

575
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:20,854

576
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:26,421

Right on. That's my man.

584
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:09,231
What are you doing down here?

585
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:15,299
It was a stupid idea
of me to go to a funeral for fun.

586
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,246
Yeah, I tried to tell you that.

587
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,175
- Okay, so you were right.
- Are you okay?

588
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,483
I'm fine. Why do you have to...

589
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:30,517
- I'm not a pet! I'm not your pet!
- I'm sorry.

590
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,884
I'm going home.

591
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,293
You said you guys were
all pitching in together to pay for this.

592
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:43,304
Yeah, I paid my $600,
and I'm not paying a penny more.

593
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:45,431
Do you know how rude that girl was to me?

594
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:47,635
You know how this is gonna make me look?

595
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,976
So? Go talk to Brody. He's the one who
supposedly can't come up with his share.

596
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,446
- You brought this funeral here.
- So?

597
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:57,714
So maybe you need to come up
with the difference.

598
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,148
Maybe you need to get off my case...

599
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:05,250
considering I just gave your wife $500
so she can pay for fucking diapers!

600
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,729
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me.

601
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,862
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- She asked me for it.

602
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:35,351
What are you doing?

603
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,828
This way, she'll always be a part of us.

604
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:47,631
You fucking moron.
You're all fucking morons.

605
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:52,735
You are all such incredibly stupid losers!

606
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:55,410
- Chill.
- You people are fucking disgusting!

607
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:57,708
- Who the hell are you?
- Fucking bunch of junkies!

608
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,544
- This is not cool.
- Did you see what these people are doing?

609
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:03,278
I know, but this is our business,
these are our clients.

610
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:04,751
They can do whatever they want.

611
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,813
We'll see you back here real soon, okay?
And we'll be snorting you next time!

612
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:14,026
"All that lives, lives forever.

613
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,598

It's the Bhagavad-Gita.

00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:32,174
Really?

618
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:38,419
- I never read it.
- You read it at my house.

619
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:42,651
- I don't think so.
- Don't you remember? I went on and on...

620
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:46,320
about the Peter Brook production
of <i>The Mahabharata</i> in London?

621
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:55,804
But it felt so profound. Are you telling me
it's just recycled crap from my brain?

622
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:58,032
>From your drug-addled brain.

623
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,009
Hello?

624
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:12,350
<i>So were you just not going to tell me</i>
<i>or did you just forget?</i>

625
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:13,887
Forget what?

626
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,783
A certain test you took recently.

627
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:23,024
They posted the results today.
Congratulations, Mr. Funeral Director.

628
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,194
You gotta be shitting me.

629
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:33,805
<i>I'm looking at your name, plain as day.</i>
<i>"Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, Jr."</i>

630
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:37,510
You know, I had totally forgotten about that.

631
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:42,583
I'm proud of you, Nate.

632
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:45,480
Thanks.

633
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:49,085
I'll see you later.

634
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:55,221
- Where are you going?
- I have a client at 8:30.

635
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:59,765
- That's a little late, isn't it?
- No, it's not that late.

636
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,135
Can I come over later?

637
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:06,468
Not tonight, okay?

638
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:13,679
I'm having enough trouble
just being with myself right now.

639
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,441
I'm sorry. It's not you.

640
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,588
It's me. I'm fucked up.

641
00:54:27,596 --> 00:54:29,257
And you can't fix it.

642
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:57,217
You're in the game now, buddy boy...

643
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,347
whether you like it or not.
