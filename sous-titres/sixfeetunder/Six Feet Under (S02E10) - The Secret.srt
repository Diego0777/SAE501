1
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,569
- Hey.
- Hi. I need to sit down.

2
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,032
Oh, God, I'm so fat!

3
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,035
So what papers do you need me to sign?

4
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,796
Don't tell me I forgot them.

5
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,032
I'm forgetting everything.
It's because of the hormones.

6
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,839
Which, by the way, made me
a complete freak the last time I saw you.

7
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,150
I'm sorry again for being so hostile.

8
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,157
How are you doing?
It's so good to see you again.

9
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,028
Hi, Lisa, I didn't know you were in town.
What's new?

10
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,992
- Doing the whole single-mom routine.
- Right, I can see that. Good for you.

11
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,071
Are you taking pictures these days?

12
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,517
No. I took some photos with a friend's
camera and I wanted to keep doing it.

13
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,670
So I went on eBay and I got my own.

14
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,912
But it was really just because I was bored
and it was kind of stupid. But...

15
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,351
I have to go to school. So I'll see you later.

16
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,396
I'll be out in a second.

17
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,915
Shit!

18
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,113
Okay, let's go.

19
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,715
Hey, you think your chair seems right
for that space?

20
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,196
You said you were kidding about
me not bringing my ugly-ass furniture.

21
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,349
It's so big.

22
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,954
It's a really good chair
for watching television.

23
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,268
I guess.

24
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,189
Maybe it is too big. I think it is. It's too big.

25
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,629
You know, I'll put it in storage
with the rest of my stuff.

26
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,794
Shit. I gotta return <i>The Great Escape</i> today.
I'm gonna be fucking late.

27
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,155
I'll return it. It's on my way.

28
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,000
I never get tired
of watching Steve McQueen.

29
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,192
I think I've seen every one of his movies
at least three times.

30
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,510
Yeah, some of them four times.

31
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,554
Wow, this is...

32
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,870
Since I want your name
on the birth certificate...

33
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,077
my lawyer says you need to sign away
all custodial rights.

34
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,552
- I thought...
- What?

35
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,279
I thought we were gonna be
more casual about this.

36
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,079
It's a baby.
It's hard to be that casual about it.

37
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,275
Right.

38
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,640
Maybe I should have my lawyer look at this.

39
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,473
It's just a formality.
Cut the bullshit and just sign it.

40
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,629
Okay.

41
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,152
- You know what's weird about dead people?
- Everything?

42
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,352
How they look so perfect.

43
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,358
I just want to mess this woman's hair up
a little bit.

44
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,873
Please don't.

45
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,513
When I die, I want to be one big mess.
That's what life is: Messy.

46
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,036
Nate, I'm not accusing you.

47
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,989
It's better this way. We both know that.

48
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,353
I mean, I can't lie.

49
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,718
Of course, I would've loved to do this
with someone who wanted to be a father.

50
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,119
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,959
- I don't know what else to...
- But then I think how perfect this baby is.

52
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,508
And everything somehow seems right.

53
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,954
You know, somehow it's just so funny.

54
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,518
And you know, actually, I'm proud,
in a weird way.

55
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I'm having a child...

56
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,676
with the last person in the world
who would ever want a child.

57
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,430
Why aren't you wearing your casts?

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,592
I take them off.

59
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,319
It's time for me to go.

60
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,868
But you're supposed to keep them on
until next week.

61
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,794
- I'm calling the doctor.
- He say it's okay. Look. See?

62
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,596
Your left foot looks purple.

63
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,315
Is always like that. Is from bad circulation.
You know that.

64
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,038
I guess I forgot.

65
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,190
Okay, it's time to get this show
on the road, yeah?

66
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,750
I guess I could call a taxi...

67
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,236
- even though it's a total rip-off.
- I can drive you!

68
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,671
It was a heart attack.

69
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,277
He died just like that.

70
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,393
So you want
a traditional Thai Buddhist service?

71
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,949
If that's a problem,
we can go somewhere else.

72
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,873
There are very specific elements,
and if you can't do it...

73
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,474
Please do not behave this way.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,434
You will have to excuse my son.

75
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,715
He and my husband
hadn't spoken in months, and...

76
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,758
Mom, please. Not in front of this person.

77
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,519
Okay, Mr. Fisher, if you know the procedure,
let's hear it.

78
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,310
Actually, I've only been here
for a year or so, and...

79
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,830
Although I did read <i>Zen and the Art</i>
<i>of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> in high school...

80
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,751
That's probably my brother. David!

81
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,709
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop at Video West.
Some idiot ahead of me was writing a check.

82
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,112
I didn't even want to watch a movie
last night, but Keith got his way, as usual.

83
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,190
- This is...
- Bette and Phil Srisai. I'm David Fisher.

84
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,229
I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.

85
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,152
I'm so sorry for your loss.

86
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,430
Thank you.
We were just discussing my father's service.

87
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,637
I assume the deceased
will remain at the temple for three days...

88
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,438
before we have the service here?

89
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,796
Of course, Fisher & Sons will provide
all the requisite supplies:

90
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,394
The Buddha, the altar, the carpet-kneelers.

91
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,069
And you'll want some monks for chanting.

92
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,555
We prefer to use the ones from Riverside...

93
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,838
but if those aren't to your liking, we have
some good ones over in Eagle Rock.

94
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,509
Nikolai, your apartment is so...

95
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,913
It's very...

96
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,117
It has a lot of charm.

97
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,519
Thank you.

98
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,309
I still don't know what your big rush was.
You could've stayed with me until...

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,594
It was time.

100
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,195
But how do we know you're safe here?
You could be hurt by these ruffians.

101
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,395
I spoke to Yuri.

102
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,597
I tell him that February
is the biggest month for flowers.

103
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,148
He say he give me 30 days
to come up with the money.

104
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,993
- Are you gonna be able to do it?
- Yeah, sure, of course.

105
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,832
Well, that's nice.

106
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,470
Thank you for all the taking care of me.
You don't have to do that now.

107
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,039
You are done.

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,552
What about dinner?
You probably don't have any food.

109
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,712
I was gonna pack you lamb, but I forgot.
I'll go get the lamb.

110
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,190
No, I'll be fine. I get takeout from Eat-a-Pita.

111
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,758
Goodbye, Nikolai.

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,352
Goodbye, Ruthie.

113
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,550
I bet you Mr. Van Kirk
has sex with students in here after hours.

114
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,359
We should stake this place out later, okay?

115
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,840
- Claire?
- Oh, fuck.

116
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,951
- I think there was dust on the negative.
- No one's gonna notice.

117
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,156
No, I want it to be perfect.

118
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,234
- Claire, these are so sick!
- Thanks.

119
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,074
I've taken shots
of almost every single person...

120
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,674
that's come through in the past three weeks.

121
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,875
They're amazing.

122
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,919
It's like each one
is someone who's lying in bed with you...

123
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,717
telling you a little story
before you go to sleep.

124
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,753
I'm putting them together
for that thing for Foster's class.

125
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,150
- The fucking <i>Spoon River Anthology</i> paper?
- Yeah.

126
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,473
I just thought that since each poem
is from the perspective of a dead person...

127
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,235
that it would be a really interesting way to...
I don't know.

128
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,509
Show what the poems brought out in me.

129
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,957
Okay, that sounded really geeky.

130
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,874
No, that's genius.
You could really do something with this.

131
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,999
Yeah, right.

132
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,435
Claire, I have to tell you something.

133
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,554
I got into Yale. I heard yesterday.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,468
You don't feel jealous or hate me, right?

135
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,828
No. You worked really hard for it.
Congratulations.

136
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,593
I know you didn't play the game
the way I did...

137
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,468
but I'm sure you'll get into UCLA,
which is a really good school, too.

138
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,395
Actually, no, I didn't make the cut.

139
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,512
But they sent me
a list of community colleges I could go to...

140
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,909
and said to try again next year.

141
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,070
So I'm looking at East Valley.

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,837
I'm gonna be a famous photographer
and make a gazillion dollars...

143
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,196
taking pictures of anorexic models
and fucked-up actors.

144
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,158
So maybe I don't even need
to go to college, right?

145
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,031
It's a joke. I'm joking.

146
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,391
But you could.
You should just become a photographer.

147
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,309
Because, truthfully,
East Valley is kind of a shitty school.

148
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,952
So there was that one
a month ago in the bookstore.

149
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,793
Then I met this other guy
at the Farmers Market.

150
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,996
That place has gotten so touristy.

151
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,472
And then there was this guy last week
at the Rose Café, who...

152
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,433
No, that doesn't count.
That was an almost one.

153
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,433
What exactly do you hope
to get out of therapy?

154
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,796
Melissa gave me your number
because I guess I'm...

155
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,713
I don't know.

156
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,558
It's not that I'm unhappy. I'm not unhappy.
I'm really not.

157
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,876
But I know that what I'm doing
is a little strange.

158
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,993
I mean, most people who are engaged
to someone they really love...

159
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,275
don't have sex with strangers.

160
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,958
- Or maybe they do.
- Does that matter?

161
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,269
I think I like the euphoria I get
from these encounters.

162
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,479
I'm just having a little trouble with anxiety.

163
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,115
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

164
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,791
It's like I'm coexisting
in these two separate realities.

165
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,431
There's my Nate reality,
and then there's this other reality.

166
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,911
And I would like to not feel
so anxious about it.

167
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,150
It's not guilt. It's just edginess.

168
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,075
So, that's it.

169
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,754
I'd like to not feel edgy. That's why I'm here.

170
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,229
Okay, so you would like...

171
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,598
to continue to have these encounters,
as you call them...

172
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,037
- but you would like to not feel edgy.
- Ideally.

173
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,470
I know what you're thinking.

174
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,071
You think that I'm afraid of intimacy...

175
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,993
so I'm trying to sabotage
my relationship with my fiancé.

176
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,913
Is that what I'm thinking
or is that what you're thinking?

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,989
No.

178
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,352
I just wanted to clarify...

179
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,989
that I don't necessarily think
that what I'm doing is destructive.

180
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,591
It might even be healthy.

181
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,114
How so?

182
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,993
Maybe it's not good for me
to totally lose myself in one person...

183
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,468
and this is a way for me to have...

184
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,350
a completely separate,
private area that's my own.

185
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,074
Not his, not ours.

186
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,318
Maybe that's healthy for me.

187
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,358
Listen, I assume that Melissa told you...

188
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,954
one of my specialties is sexual addiction.

189
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,115
No.

190
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,358
I don't know how much you know
of this issue, but obviously...

191
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,718
it involves the sublimation of emotions
that are too painful to address.

192
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,831
It's the root of all addiction, really.

193
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,435
<i>I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you</i>
<i>because you don't need help.</i>

194
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,354
<i>You've clearly evolved beyond the need</i>
<i>for therapy. I'm actually in awe of you...</i>

195
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,637
<i>because I'd be fucking strangers</i>
<i>like a truck-stop whore on crack...</i>

196
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,359
<i>if I wasn't so inhibited</i>
<i>by my Judeo-Christian upbringing.</i>

197
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,191
It's not down here.

198
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,750
We used to have a few Buddhas in here.
I can't believe we can't find one.

199
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,196
I've read all this stuff about Buddhism,
but it never stays with me.

200
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,316
Just know that everything is nothing.

201
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,868
Is that it?
I thought it was, "Nothing is everything."

202
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,918
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- I found one.

203
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,230
- It looks kind of girly, doesn't it?
- Sort of.

204
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,279
Think it's water damage. I'll get you
some stuff to clean him off, okay?

205
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,751
His little hat is cute, so pointy.

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,673
I wonder if anyone
poked their eyes out on one by accident.

207
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,955
Look at all these unclaimed cremains.

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,873
Can you imagine
having a member of your family cremated...

209
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,793
and then not caring enough
to pick up their ashes?

210
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,153
I think sometimes it's too hard
for people to acknowledge...

211
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,073
that someone they loved
is now just chunks of soot.

212
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,434
David Fisher. Hey.

213
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,878
Yes, I returned the videos.
Didn't I say I would?

214
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,473
Sure, swordfish is fine. Whatever. Bye.

215
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,918
You hate swordfish.

216
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,759
I know. It's funny.
Now that Keith and I are living together...

217
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,957
I find myself trying to be
so fucking agreeable all the time.

218
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,600
- Why?
- Because, if you aren't, things come up...

219
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,989
and you've no idea
how big the thing's gonna be.

220
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,789
It's like this constant negotiation.
You can never just relax.

221
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,473
Is that just a phase
or is it always going to be like that?

222
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,472
Don't ask me. Look, I have no fucking idea.

223
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,028
Maybe that's just what a relationship is.

224
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,430
Constantly doing things
you have absolutely no desire to do.

225
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,749
Nate, Brenda, come on in!

226
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,593
We have so many details to go over...

227
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,389
before the bridal shower on Sunday.
Isn't it exciting?

228
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,759
It's all too much for me.

229
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,276
Please, it's all for you.
I'd rather just cancel it.

230
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,952
Are you mad?

231
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,794
Lulu Smeigel cancelled her weekend
at Canyon Ranch just to be here.

232
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,919
Now, you must try one of these.

233
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,435
It's made from this incredible liqueur...

234
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,432
that comes from the most
poverty-stricken village in Belize.

235
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,909
- It's delicious!
- Right. Your trip.

236
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,275
- You look like you had a good time.
- It was fabulous!

237
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,354
Your skin looks good.
Did you have some work done?

238
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,353
Not at all. It's just happiness.
You should try it sometime.

239
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,149
Is Billy here?

240
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,638
No. When I got back, I found a note saying
he's staying with friends in Portland.

241
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,278
But he didn't leave a number.

242
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,351
Brenda, did he give it to you?

243
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,596
- No, he didn't.
- That's right.

244
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,513
He still has all that raging resentment
towards you.

245
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,196
Who are you hiding in the bedroom?

246
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,352
Let me guess. Another one
of your young South American gigolos?

247
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,353
Not at all, darling.
He's an aging intellectual from the Bronx.

248
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,677
Isn't this fabulous?

249
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,873
Bern and I are back, and better than ever.

250
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,349
So I realized I'd made a terrible mistake,
got on the next plane to Belize...

251
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,476
and begged your mother to take me back.

252
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,233
Come on, be honest, dear.
The whore dumped you.

253
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,709
Because I was subconsciously
pushing her away...

254
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,196
because I really love you.

255
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,430
The point is, the sex has been incredible.

256
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,391
Just like when we first met.

257
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,793
I'll never forget what you were wearing
the first time you walked into my office.

258
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,919
The tight Givenchy blue skirt with a slit
that went right up to my wazoo.

259
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,198
I knew immediately I was gonna have
some wildly inappropriate feelings for you.

260
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,872
And, boy, was I right!

261
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,039
Mom was one of Dad's patients.
It's actually kind of disgusting.

262
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,153
I was not a patient. I was in grad school.

263
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,992
I was an intern.

264
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,631
And the second I lay down...

265
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,110
I knew I was never gonna get up
off that couch.

266
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,395
We terminated therapy after a few months...

267
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,190
and waited the correct amount of time
before embarking on a relationship.

268
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,400
At least, that's what we tell everyone.

269
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,189
I'll give you a hand with that.

270
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,993
Okay, what?

271
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,559
I can't believe you just took him back.

272
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,750
Are you that scared of being alone?

273
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,674
God, you're so fucking depressing.

274
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,392
I love your father.

275
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,798
And I'm very happy. You noticed it yourself.

276
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,468
Maybe that's what's upsetting you so much,
that I'm so happy.

277
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,515
I'm sorry for whatever tensions this
engagement is bringing up in you and Nate.

278
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,717
But my advice to you...

279
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,759
is get your shit together
and don't blow it with this one.

280
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,514
Because you are a major handful.

281
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,237
Sorry. I noticed a coffee stain on the couch.
I was trying to get it out.

282
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,949
You still mad at me about the swordfish?

283
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,439
You should've told me you didn't like it
instead of waiting till I slaved over it.

284
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,717
- You're right. I should've told you.
- So why didn't you?

285
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,877
Because you scare me.

286
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,398
Shut the fuck up.

287
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,275
You want everything to be perfect,
all the time.

288
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,555
When it's not, you get upset.

289
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,791
I didn't get any sleep last night.
I'm too tired for this conversation.

290
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:10,093
Sometimes I feel like
if I don't do or say exactly what you want...

291
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,176
you might decide
you don't want to be with me.

292
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:16,062
That's just stupid.

293
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,378
Thanks.

294
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,180
When we were together the first time...

295
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:35,495
it seemed like all our problems stemmed
from my not coming out.

296
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:36,812
They did.

297
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:43,054
Now I think it was just easier for you
to make us believe that.

298
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,024
If everything could be blamed
on my not coming out...

299
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,823
then nothing ever had to be your fault.

300
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,540
What's under that arm right here?

301
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,696
- Hey, Nate!
- Hey!

302
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,855
- Say hello to Nate.
- Hello.

303
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,901
You didn't like that?

304
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:44,536
All right. Let's go.

305
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:50,775
Look, Vanessa's sister,
she's got this publicist...

306
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:54,897
and the first thing she does is get her
invited to some spa thing in Long Beach.

307
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:55,973
So?

308
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:59,818
So she took Vanessa and the baby.
Now my sitter's sick, so here we are.

309
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,372
Mrs. Hirsch needs to be finished by 1:00.

310
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,181
I have a kid, okay?
These type of things happen.

311
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:11,982
Anyhow, I gave Mrs. Hirsch the once-over.
She's a young breast cancer. Piece of cake.

312
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:15,977
- Hopefully I'll get a sitter in time to do her.
- That's not good enough.

313
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:19,539
My hands are tied here, okay?

314
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,297
Unless you take care of Julio
while I do Mrs. Hirsch.

315
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,978
- No...
- Come on, I don't see you doing anything.

316
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:30,693
Look, I can't. I have to clean a Buddha.

317
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,815
He looks like he's asleep.

318
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,058
He's not.

319
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,495
He's just blissed out
because he has the secret to enlightenment.

320
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,336
What's "enlightmintz"?

321
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:51,853
- I guess it's knowing everything.
- My dad knows everything.

322
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:54,817
Well, he knows a lot.

323
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,822
He knows everything.
How much do you know?

324
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:01,172
Not much.

325
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:18,573
- Ruthie? Did we have plans?
- No.

326
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,494
Does that mean I have to go away?

327
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,575
I do not need my house
to smell like fake lemons.

328
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:31,098
- It smells good already.
- No, it doesn't.

329
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:35,134
- I like everything the way it is.
- But I don't.

330
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:45,183
I thought I would... Isn't this fun?

331
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:47,255
It's a surprise sleepover.

332
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:52,455
Okay, let's do it, sure.

333
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,014
- Then let's get started.
- Okay.

334
00:25:55,504 --> 00:26:00,214
First, we have to get this place into shape,
so we can have a nice, cozy, clean evening.

335
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,137
We're going to wallpaper?

336
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:05,296
No, silly. It's contact paper for the drawers.

337
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,252
Ruthie, why do I want little cherries
in my drawers?

338
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,818
It's hard to explain. You just do.

339
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,023
You failed me?

340
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:20,062
I'm sorry, Claire,
but I asked for a literary analysis.

341
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,181
- So you didn't think they were any good?
- That's not the point.

342
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:26,222
This is an English class.
I wanted something in English.

343
00:26:26,304 --> 00:26:29,501
So you'd just prefer I download
some stupid crap off the Internet...

344
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:32,496
than do something that's actually creative?

345
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:36,738
I don't have time for this.
Would you just do the make-over?

346
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,858
I was really happy with Mrs. Sibley.

347
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:48,573
"The secret of woman, the soil.

348
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,414
"My secret: Under a mound
that you shall never find."

349
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,414
Just so you know,
I put a lot of myself into this.

350
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:02,574
I wasn't just slacking off.

351
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:06,461
Look, I don't want to fail you.
Just give me some kind of paper.

352
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:09,980
I assume you need to graduate.
You are going to college, right?

353
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:13,101
- Yup, East Valley.
- Really? I went there.

354
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,412
David Fisher.

355
00:27:25,504 --> 00:27:27,301
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Hi.

356
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:31,862
I'm calling to tell you we're having lunch
with Taylor and Karla on Saturday.

357
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:36,737
You can't just schedule things without
asking me first. That's not what couples do.

358
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,816
- How would you know what couples do?
<i>- I watch TV.</i>

359
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:43,061
Or at least I used to
when I had a comfortable chair to sit in.

360
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:45,897
<i>Listen, I was in the middle</i>
<i>of five things at work, okay?</i>

361
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:48,373
You know,
not everyone can always act so perfect.

362
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:52,139
Yeah, I know that. That's what
I was trying to tell you last night.

363
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:56,543
You should check with me
before you say yes to things.

364
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,013
- Are you available?
<i>- Yes.</i>

365
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:01,575
Then pretend I asked you first.

366
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:11,053
So I went the one time,
but I'm not going back to Dr. Michaelson.

367
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:15,700
- Are you annoyed?
- No, why would I be annoyed?

368
00:28:15,784 --> 00:28:19,823
- You can do whatever you want.
- I'm sure she's good. She's just not for me.

369
00:28:20,344 --> 00:28:23,063
You didn't tell me she was so serious.

370
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:26,463
I didn't realize you were looking for laughs.

371
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:33,782
I can ask around for more names.
My friend Paula's been to 40 shrinks...

372
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:37,300
although I guess that's not
the best endorsement for them.

373
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:41,696
I'm fine. I think I'm the only one
that can solve any of my problems.

374
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,697
Yeah, we are ultimately
stuck with ourselves.

375
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:47,259
It's so fucking puritanical...

376
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:50,541
how we're conditioned to buy into
the whole true-Iove-monogamy crap.

377
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:52,774
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.

378
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:59,259
So I've been thinking,
the next time that I feel adventurous...

379
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:02,300
what if I include Nate?

380
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,257
Not a bad idea.

381
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:08,374
You remember Terry from Orange County
I was telling you about?

382
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:11,774
- She has the lifestyle parties on weekends.
- Oh, right.

383
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:15,823
She and her husband are committed.
They have sex with strangers once a week.

384
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,692
They're really happy.
Monogamy just isn't for everyone.

385
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:21,342
I know. Look at my parents.

386
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:24,336
Actually, don't look at them.
That's what they want.

387
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:30,573
So maybe we could go to Terry's
this weekend and check it out.

388
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:33,132
Yeah, whatever. I'll give you the address.

389
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:36,421
- I hope you and Nate like it.
- I don't want to bring Nate.

390
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:40,213
I mean not yet. First you and I should go
and see what it's like.

391
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:56,620
Okay, what do you think?

392
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:59,262
It feels like a whole new place.

393
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,574
Yes, it really does.

394
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:05,736
Who am I kidding?

395
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:08,536
I can't stay here.

396
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:11,340
I'll never be able to stay here.

397
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:15,061
It's too dank. It will always be dank.

398
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:18,657
I'm only human. I can only do so much.

399
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:23,500
Nikolai, this is crazy.
Why aren't you moving into my house?

400
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,734
I don't know, it's...

401
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,455
Why are you acting like we talked
about this? We haven't, have we?

402
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,455
I guess it's just been on my mind.

403
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,933
I like how things have been
for the past few months.

404
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:38,256
I like seeing you every night and morning.
I don't want to go backward, do you?

405
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:47,779
I love you.

406
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,377
I wish you didn't sound so sad
when you say that.

407
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:57,933
I wish I wanted to move in with you
and be with you all the time.

408
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:01,623
I want to want that more than anything.

409
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:05,736
But I don't.

410
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:09,139
Maybe I am the one with the problem.

411
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,538
Maybe I have been alone and cut off
for so long...

412
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,774
that I no longer know how to do it.

413
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:18,734
Maybe I am not capable of it.

414
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:23,817
Can't we go on as we were before accident?

415
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,380
I think I should go home.

416
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:40,582
Didn't Mom leave any real food for dinner?

417
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:43,980
No, there was just a note saying
she was gone for the night.

418
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,818
So why aren't you two
with your loved ones?

419
00:31:48,904 --> 00:31:51,020
- Late shift.
- Shiatsu appointment.

420
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,822
- What's this?
- Give me that.

421
00:31:56,904 --> 00:31:59,737
- It's this thing for school.
- I don't believe this.

422
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:02,501
David, look at these.

423
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:05,942
That's Mrs. Steiner.

424
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,977
Mr. Thomas. The Harrisons.

425
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,861
Mr. Benson.

426
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:18,178
Mrs. Orozco.
God, Rico did an amazing job on her.

427
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:22,741
- So do you think they're any good?
- I think they fucking suck!

428
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:25,292
Do you know
what kind of lawsuit this could cause?

429
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:27,852
What kind of stupid,
fucked-up child are you?

430
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,333
I was trying to do something
I gave a shit about.

431
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:31,937
What's going on here?

432
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,420
Nate, I heard you yelling.

433
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:38,941
- Someone please tell me what's going on.
- Nothing.

434
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:42,892
You were spending the night out.
Why are you back?

435
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:44,861
That's none of your business!

436
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:05,455
Hey, got some change?

437
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,697
Fuck you, too!

438
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:13,215
You're not listening to me.
I said this shirt feels funny.

439
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:17,092
- It scratches my neck.
- Too bad. It's the only clean one you had...

440
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:21,018
and I can't take your uncle's bitching
if he sees one little apple juice stain.

441
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:23,777
- I want to go back and get my yellow one!
- I said no.

442
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:26,822
- Turn around, now!
- You don't tell me what to do.

443
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:28,622
Mom!

444
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,903
- What are you doing?
- We gotta get out of here.

445
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:46,183
I had no idea
East Valley was so close to the freeway.

446
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,777
It's very convenient.

447
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:51,420
That's the Student Center.
That's where your mailbox will be.

448
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:52,812
Great.

449
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,903
I can go there and get letters
from people begging me not to kill myself.

450
00:33:57,824 --> 00:33:59,974
I bet you some famous people went here.

451
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,577
Someone like...

452
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,457
David Spade.

453
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:10,899
Okay, there's way too many flyers
with the word "Baptist" on them.

454
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:16,180
Look, you can make extra money
as a phone sex operator.

455
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,300
Yeah, Baptist phone sex.

456
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:21,817
It says here
they have a really good arts center.

457
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:25,101
No, it's under construction.
It won't be open till 2004.

458
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:30,623
That's okay.

459
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:33,452
I need to start being more connected
to the real world.

460
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:36,263
I'm thinking about taking
some business courses.

461
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:47,420
- Mommy, we have to...
- Just shut up.

462
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:49,377
I need to think.

463
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:53,973
Okay. Nothing there. I think nothing's there.

464
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:55,856
Where have I missed?

465
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,376
- I don't want anyone to find anything.
- We have to tell the cops.

466
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,536
No, we don't!
We just got to pray nobody saw us.

467
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:06,855
It wasn't my fault. We can't help him now.

468
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:09,533
- We have to tell somebody.
- No, we don't!

469
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:13,378
God! I am so tired!
I am so fucking tired of this shit!

470
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,012
Why can't I ever have some fucking peace?

471
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:25,817
Baby, we can't tell the cops.

472
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:29,696
Okay? They'll take me away from you.

473
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:32,139
Do you want the cops
to take me away from you?

474
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,863
- No.
- Then we don't tell the cops.

475
00:35:36,224 --> 00:35:39,819
Okay? This is our little secret.
Do you hear me?

476
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:42,577
Our little secret.

477
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:47,257
- Say it.
- It's our little secret.

478
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:59,932
Of course they're late.
I've got a turkey breast drying up.

479
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,060
I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

480
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,339
No, I didn't get any sleep last night
because you were kicking me for hours.

481
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:13,781
You know what? I have nightmares.
Is that my fault, too, like everything else?

482
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:23,100
- You're 40 minutes late.
- Sorry, something came up.

483
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:29,502
Hey, little girl.

484
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:33,942
Fuck, Bren, it's just that it's Saturday night.

485
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:37,622
You know, I thought we planned to
on Saturday night...

486
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:40,622
Yeah, I know you have
the shitty shower tomorrow.

487
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:46,500
All right. No.

488
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:50,896
Just stay at home
and take care of yourself, all right?

489
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,463
All right, bye.

490
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,776
Maybe you shouldn't jump so hard.
What if he catches us?

491
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:06,503
- I don't care.
- Taylor, that's enough.

492
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:10,223
My mom ran over somebody on Washington.

493
00:37:11,624 --> 00:37:12,773
What?

494
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,656
It was an accident.
It was an old, bald white guy.

495
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:19,463
But we're not gonna tell anybody.
It's a secret.

496
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:24,498
But secrets are so stupid.
People always find out about secrets.

497
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,743
Oh, my God.

498
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:31,223
I was just kidding.

499
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:34,584
I got you, I got you good.

500
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,058
- Taylor, that's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

501
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,382
This is even more of a shitbox
than I remembered.

502
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:53,693
Do you want to get out
while there's time to run?

503
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,900
Are you kidding? This is fantastic.

504
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:58,854
Melissa, you made it!

505
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:00,698
Oh, crap.

506
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:03,742
Hey, Terry, look at you, girl!

507
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,455
Sex is so stupid.

508
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:19,573
This is like these parties
my parents used to have when I was a kid.

509
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:22,696
There was always
this really weird energy in the air.

510
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,217
Just like tonight.

511
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:27,296
Oh, yes, the heady haze of expectancy.

512
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:30,860
Everyone got really drunk, got all handsy.

513
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:35,658
Although I don't think they were
official sex parties, like this one.

514
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,742
We should mingle.

515
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,178
This shit's amazing.

516
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:47,142
I found it in my kid's room
and beat the crap out of him.

517
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,021
Don't get me started on my kids.

518
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:52,255
They leave the house at all hours.
I've no idea what they're up to.

519
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:54,812
If I think about it too hard, I could cry.

520
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,063
You like that?

521
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:21,942
Why are you getting so upset?

522
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,982
I'm saying, isn't it weird
that Taylor made up this story?

523
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,941
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

524
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:30,653
Because you were going on and on
about the coffee stain on your couch.

525
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,417
It was me, okay? I did it.
I'm sorry. It was me.

526
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,018
Now shut up already about the coffee stain!

527
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:42,503
Don't call her. Let's just forget it.
It's just this weird thing Taylor said.

528
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:44,654
I'm not calling her, idiot.

529
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:50,178
Hello?

530
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,935
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

531
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:14,494
You killed me.
It was about seven years ago, remember?

532
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,860
You drove Lisa to have me killed.

533
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,376
Don't get me wrong.
I don't harbor any bad feelings or anything.

534
00:40:20,464 --> 00:40:21,977
I'm pro-choice.

535
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,739
At least I would be, if I were alive.

536
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:29,497
You killed me, too.

537
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:34,813
Actually, I was miscarried by the girl
who worked at that Starbucks on Fremont.

538
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:38,615
I don't think she was ever planning
to tell you about me.

539
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:44,021
Yeah, Mom was your first real girlfriend.
Then I came along.

540
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:46,493
You guys offed me and then broke up.

541
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,343
Excuse me.

542
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:57,976
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

543
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:05,821
Who wants cookies and milk?

544
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,900
<i>I know the secret to everything.</i>

545
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:18,576
<i>But you'll never know it,</i>
<i>because you killed us.</i>

546
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:38,179
Hit-and-run at Washington and Third.

547
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:41,982
The vehicle's description
matches Karla's car.

548
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:46,175
The old, bald white guy was dead
before he got to Cedars.

549
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,536
Oh, my God.

550
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:56,180
- What do we do?
- What the hell do you think we do?

551
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,659
Marly and I were fighting night and day.

552
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:02,133
And then we came to one of these parties.

553
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:04,818
It was like we rediscovered each other.

554
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:08,219
And things have been hot between us
ever since.

555
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:10,693
Isn't that such a heartwarming story?

556
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,261
Some people just need a little extra help
to stay together, you know?

557
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:20,663
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- I'm for getting all the help I can get.

558
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,980
Marly, show the gals
that thing I got you for your birthday.

559
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:29,579
- This has given us another five years.
- This sounds good.

560
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:32,373
- Should we guess what it is?
- No, I'll tell you.

561
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:36,980
It's this little gizmo that he got online
at a sex website.

562
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:41,502
You've just got to see it to believe it.

563
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:45,702
- I can't wait.
- I can. I'm gonna get another drink.

564
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:48,736
I can't find it.

565
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:53,537
I'll just kill myself if I've lost that.

566
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:57,220
- Why do I lose everything?
- You probably left it in your coat.

567
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:59,943
I think we left them in that room over there.

568
00:43:05,744 --> 00:43:08,019
I'll just go help Marly for a second.

569
00:43:09,264 --> 00:43:11,653
Or you could come with us, if you want.

570
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:24,344
Sure, I'll help you.

571
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:52,060
I just saw Mr. Srisai's brother-in-law
put $20 in the casket.

572
00:43:52,264 --> 00:43:54,653
It's traveling money for his journey.

573
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:58,699
Apparently, unlike the rest of us,
Buddhists can take it with them.

574
00:44:00,424 --> 00:44:05,100
- Why am I giving Brenda napkin rings?
- Because that's all I had in the gift closet.

575
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:14,739
Hey, they're allowed to take pictures
of the dead guy, but I'm not?

576
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:18,420
- That's right. They're family.
- Claire, we're going to be late.

577
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:22,463
- I can't believe I have to go to this thing.
- All right, look, I'm sorry.

578
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:24,019
On the plus side...

579
00:44:24,104 --> 00:44:28,177
I bet it'll take you two sips of punch
before you're completely wasted.

580
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,694
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

581
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:35,935
- More punch, anyone?
- Yeah, sure, I'll take another hit.

582
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:39,981
That brat's over an hour late.

583
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:43,977
For the life of me, I don't know
how she got so damn passive-aggressive.

584
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:47,419
Isn't that just being aggressive?

585
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,656
Are you sick, dear?
Or are you always this deathly pale?

586
00:44:58,064 --> 00:44:59,782
I'm not late, am I?

587
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:02,055
You most certainly are.

588
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:05,735
Ice-cold mini asparagus quiche, darling?

589
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,420
What are they doing
with those cups of water?

590
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:14,903
It's a cleansing ritual.

591
00:45:14,984 --> 00:45:18,260
You rid yourself of any wrongs you've done
to the deceased.

592
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:26,303
You really think that changes anything?
Pouring a little water into a bowl?

593
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:29,775
I don't know. Maybe.

594
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:33,057
I have to go.

595
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:37,062
Can you make sure
that the monks get home all right?

596
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:43,536
And you'll pour the water out
from Mr. Srisai's bowl?

597
00:45:43,624 --> 00:45:48,061
You're supposed to do it over the oldest
tree you can find. I use the one out front.

598
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:50,693
I don't know why they bring
so many oranges.

599
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:53,901
But if there are any extra,
grab some for the prep room.

600
00:45:56,944 --> 00:45:59,219
This punch is delicious.

601
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:02,297
Your mother made it
with a liqueur from Belize.

602
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:05,981
It's some word with a tilde over the "n."

603
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:11,297
So what's new?

604
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:17,175
Actually, I spent all night...

605
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:20,377
doing it with this couple
from Orange County.

606
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:22,894
And I have absolutely no idea why.

607
00:46:25,224 --> 00:46:27,738
It's one of those sex things, you know.

608
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:30,896
- Lifestyle parties.
- I don't know anything about that.

609
00:46:30,984 --> 00:46:32,542
They had this...

610
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:36,453
little high-tech Japanese vibrator...

611
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:40,577
that stimulates the clitoris
through very low-voltage electrical shocks.

612
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,814
Anyway, they invited me, you know,
to go with them...

613
00:46:44,904 --> 00:46:47,782
and I thought,
"Now this would be crossing a line."

614
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:50,424
Which I seem to be doing
more and more these days.

615
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:54,656
Because you know what?
The lines are only in our heads.

616
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:57,534
In actuality, there are no lines at all...

617
00:46:57,624 --> 00:47:00,855
which is really fucking terrifying,
if you think about it.

618
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:04,576
What's so funny?

619
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:08,741
Nothing. Everything. This.

620
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:14,139
I want you to know something, Brenda.

621
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:18,542
I love you.

622
00:47:20,744 --> 00:47:24,703
I love you, because you are so independent
and spirited...

623
00:47:25,904 --> 00:47:28,543
and you make no apologies to yourself.

624
00:47:28,864 --> 00:47:32,903
And you know you can't smother someone
or you'll lose them.

625
00:47:34,264 --> 00:47:37,813
You accept Nate as he is,
and that is beautiful.

626
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,933
I don't know how to do that. Not at all.

627
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:48,982
Maybe that's why I resented you so much.

628
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:51,420
But now I don't.

629
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:54,940
Now I admire you.

630
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:04,577
Thank you.

631
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:07,578
Thanks.

632
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:11,934
I have to go to the bathroom.

633
00:48:20,784 --> 00:48:22,934
Claire, are you feeling all right?

634
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:25,616
Yeah, I'm just tired.

635
00:48:26,864 --> 00:48:28,900
Let me feel your forehead.

636
00:48:32,824 --> 00:48:34,337
It feels okay.

637
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:39,017
I don't know why you should be tired.
You slept almost 11 hours last night.

638
00:48:40,144 --> 00:48:44,137
I'm not really like want-to-go-to-sleep tired.
I'm just sort of like...

639
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,340
sick and tired of everything.

640
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:49,942
- What do you mean?
- Just all the lies we're fed.

641
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:53,653
The bullshit we're supposed to care about,
how everybody is so scared...

642
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:56,781
of anything that's different
from everything else.

643
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:00,495
I don't know.

644
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:04,779
I'm gonna get some coffee.
Do you want some?

645
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:06,741
I have to use the bathroom.

646
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:15,533
You must be Ruth. Bernard Chenowith.

647
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:19,140
- Oh, hello.
- I'm so sorry to startle you.

648
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:22,022
I was supposed to confine myself
to the master suite...

649
00:49:22,104 --> 00:49:25,016
but Margaret doesn't like me
to use her bathroom.

650
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:28,256
She gets insanely territorial
about that damn bidet.

651
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:34,824
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- I know.

652
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:38,817
I don't know why Nate and Brenda
haven't arranged a dinner or something.

653
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:42,574
I could give you half a dozen reasons
just off the top of my head!

654
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:44,780
But I'd like to ask you something.

655
00:49:46,504 --> 00:49:49,894
What steps have you taken
to treat your daughter's depression?

656
00:49:49,984 --> 00:49:52,418
I have no idea what you're talking about.

657
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:55,020
Surely you must be aware of it.

658
00:49:55,864 --> 00:50:00,301
Now, if you're adverse to talk therapy,
there are scads of pharmaceutical solutions.

659
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:03,854
Either way, I'd be happy to recommend
the name of somebody she can see.

660
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:06,663
I'm sorry. I have to use the bathroom.

661
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:00,983
You're breaking up with me?

662
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:05,501
I don't think we have a healthy friendship.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

663
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,734
- Okay.
- I don't know how else to explain it.

664
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:12,303
Don't bother, really.

665
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:15,217
I'm going through something.
I don't understand what it is...

666
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:18,137
but I need to be around people
who aren't like you.

667
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:22,134
People who have clear values, or something.

668
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:23,896
Okay, got it.

669
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:28,662
If I hadn't met you, I probably wouldn't be
doing all the shit I've been doing.

670
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,621
Not that I blame you, exactly.

671
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:33,497
Oh, brother! Just can it, sweetheart.

672
00:52:34,344 --> 00:52:38,576
You can't stand to see the truth
about yourself, so I've got to take the fall.

673
00:52:40,184 --> 00:52:43,176
Just do me a favor.
When you feel bad about this later...

674
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:46,495
you can skip the big apology
and trying to be friends again.

675
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:48,939
It was fun, but we should both move on.

676
00:52:56,624 --> 00:53:00,503
So now you know what was really
going on with me that night in Seattle.

677
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:05,139
So is the Western medicine
controlling the seizures?

678
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:07,502
Not entirely.

679
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:14,221
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about this earlier.

680
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:18,102
I think I was just trying to not face it myself.

681
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:23,662
Lisa, I've changed.

682
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:29,815
I used to be this person who ran away from
responsibility, but I'm not him anymore.

683
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,813
I want to be a part of our child's life.

684
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:45,261
I really want to. I need to.

685
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,421
Is this about
you being a father for someone...

686
00:53:51,504 --> 00:53:54,064
or is this about you being scared of death?

687
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:56,936
Does it really matter?

688
00:53:59,304 --> 00:54:00,737
Maybe it doesn't.

689
00:54:03,784 --> 00:54:07,618
This is going to take some adjusting.

690
00:54:11,344 --> 00:54:14,973
Okay, maybe we can work out something.

691
00:54:17,344 --> 00:54:20,416
- This is what you want, right?
- Absolutely what I want.

692
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:26,660
It's not like Brenda told you
this was the right thing to do, or something.

693
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:27,733
No.

694
00:54:28,944 --> 00:54:31,014
She doesn't even know about it.

695
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:37,533
What?

696
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:42,579
Nate, you are so...

697
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:45,983
This is no good.

698
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:49,693
- I just want to get away from you.
- I don't understand. What's going on?

699
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:53,697
I was so stupid to think
that anything could ever change you.

700
00:54:54,464 --> 00:54:58,537
You don't want a child, so you agree
not to be a part of that child's life.

701
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:02,896
Then you decide you do want a child, and
you say you'll be part of the child's life...

702
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:06,613
with a total disregard for the person
you're supposedly sharing a life with.

703
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,422
- All I said...
- Jesus, Nate...

704
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:11,780
if you can't put anyone but yourself first,
how can you be a father?

705
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:12,933
You can't.

706
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:16,539
So do us both a favor
and stay out of our lives. Please.

707
