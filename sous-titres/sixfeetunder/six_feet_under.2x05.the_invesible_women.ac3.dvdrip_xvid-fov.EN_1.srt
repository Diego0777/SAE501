00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,618
<i>... a report by this entertainment industry</i>
<i>analyst released today...</i>

2
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:28,252
<i>showed a severe drop in the summer</i>
<i>box office results at the major studios.</i>

3
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,297
<i>A Warner Brothers spokesperson</i>
<i>pooh-poohed the projections...</i>

4
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:31,917
Previn?

5
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,250
Previn, are you in there?

6
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,996
It's George, the building manager.

7
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,261
I started to smell something
a few days ago...

8
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,894
but I just thought
someone was cooking cabbage.

9
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,939
See? You can still smell it. I'm not crazy.

10
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,872
Oh, my God!

11
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm just surprised.

12
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,458
Why? I told you I was going to write a book.

13
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,124
- No, you didn't.
- I thought I did.

14
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:17,735
- What?
- I need to get in there.

15
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:21,634
So you're just gonna sit down today
and start writing?

16
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,609
Yeah, I think that's how it's usually done.

17
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,543
Except for Hemingway. He stood.

18
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,677
- What?
- I need to get in there now.

19
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,583
- What? You think I can't write a book?
- No, of course not.

20
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,597
It's just a book is so big.

21
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,730
Not all of them.

22
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:52,429
Well, it's just the last time we talked
about you doing something new...

23
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,032
you mentioned getting Billy's friends
to help you open an art gallery.

24
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,838
Yeah, well, I got to thinking.

25
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,402
I don't need to help others
express themselves.

26
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,345
I should do it myself.

27
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,348
I think this is great.

28
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:07,249
Charlotte finally speaks.

29
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,188
Your fucked up childhood from your
point of view. People will want to read that.

30
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:14,158
No way. I'm not gonna write a memoir.

31
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,155
What is it, then?

32
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,989
- Fiction.
- Really?

33
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,136
That's so ambitious. I love it.

34
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:32,671
I hope I'm going to be in it.
I've always wanted to be thinly veiled.

35
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,474
You might be in it...

36
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:37,840
if you ever do anything interesting.

37
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,620
I need help.

38
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,917
Do you think the hair
on Mr. Peterson's forearms is sexy?

39
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:49,189
Or is it too unkempt?
Sometimes he gets all tufty.

40
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,230
I really don't have time for this.

41
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,789
This weekend is my last chance
to take the SATs. I have to do well.

42
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:58,132
Just take a break.
It'll keep you from burning out.

43
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:03,069
Every fall,
I rate the male teachers' fuckability.

44
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,138
I've been doing it since the sixth grade.

45
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:09,010
I am, like, 400 times smarter than you.

46
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,380
Why aren't you panicking more
about this test?

47
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,419
Because I know how to play the game.

48
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:16,319
I have a tutor. I've taken practice tests.

49
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,922
And my mom's life coach is advising me.

50
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,857
Your mom's life coach?

51
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:25,029
Parker, do you have any idea
what a parody of yourself you are?

52
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,425
I feel bad for Mr. Van Kirk.

53
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,903
If he hadn't stopped working out,
he could've easily cracked the top 10.

54
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,106
Give me that.

55
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,868
Gitterman's coming in at 22?

56
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,572
I was feeling generous.

57
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,047
- Hey, Claire.
- Gary, hi.

58
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,445
- See you this afternoon?
- Yep.

59
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:53,752
Gary has a great ass.

60
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,596
- You think he has a great ass?
- Yeah.

61
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,357
Like you haven't noticed.

62
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,994
My mom calls them buns.
She's so not of this century.

63
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,065
I don't care how much she pays
her life coach.

64
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:15,237
I could fuck Gary. Easy.

65
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:23,481
So this woman in her 40s
just died alone in her apartment?

66
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,520
Just out of the blue?

67
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,727
I mean, she must have had
some kind of medical condition.

68
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,764
No, she choked to death.

69
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:35,930
She lay there for a week
before anyone found her.

70
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,402
Why didn't anybody notice sooner?

71
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,569
Maybe they thought she was on vacation.

72
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,838
Here are the arrangements for her funeral.
They're self-explanatory.

73
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,970
You should be able to take care of it.

74
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,913
Shouldn't I talk
to whoever's gonna bury her?

75
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:52,746
Nate, it's a pre-need. She buried herself.

76
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,379
She bought everything she wanted
ahead of time.

77
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:59,118
You have her contacts for family
and friends, directions for the service...

78
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,558
and the specifications about her restoration.

79
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,425
She knew exactly what kind of service
she wanted.

80
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:07,295
You'll need to order the sheet music
for the organist.

81
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,961
<i>And I am telling you I'm not going.</i>

82
00:08:11,537 --> 00:08:14,028
She certainly had a sense of humor.

83
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,206
What song is that?

84
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,300
It's from <i>Dreamgirls.</i> You know it:

85
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,107
<i>And I am telling you</i>

86
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,908
<i>I'm not going</i>

87
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,609
<i>You're the best man I've ever known</i>

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,289
It must be weird
to fill one of these things out for yourself.

89
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,153
I had fun doing mine.

90
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:32,376
I have a test on Monday,
I have an art history paper due next week.

91
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:36,286
I know I could do a good job on both
if I had more time, but I don't.

92
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,917
- Do I have something on my face?
- No.

93
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,588
You're giving me this look.

94
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,193
It's just nice to see you so involved.

95
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:51,303
Are you taking the SAT this weekend?

96
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,497
I saw the books in the library.

97
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:56,064
- I don't know why I didn't tell you.
- It's okay.

98
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,475
- I just signed up for it. I wasn't sure.
- No, it's great.

99
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:03,345
You're taking school more seriously,
and you're gonna take the SAT.

100
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,915
- It shows you're nurturing yourself.
- Give me a break.

101
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm so scared of having my own thoughts
or going my own direction...

102
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,856
that I need some safety or approval.

103
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,655
This stuff is just cop-out distractions.

104
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:19,429
You know what?
This session's given me some clarity.

105
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,467
I should just blow this test off...

106
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:25,163
and look really hard inside myself
for what I really want.

107
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:32,408
Claire, you're obviously frightened
by taking this test. Why?

108
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,048
I don't know.

109
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,015
It's like, when I think about the test...

110
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,082
I see this nasty fluorescent light.

111
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:48,217
The kind that shows all your pockmarks
and tiny scars that you wish you could hide.

112
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:49,454
I see.

113
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:53,027
So it's very safe in the darkness, isn't it?

114
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:55,990
Okay, you're getting kind of corny.

115
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:03,501
All I'm saying is you're finally in a place
where you're coming into your own.

116
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:09,078
You're afraid if people see the real you,
it'll be scary. And guess what? It is scary.

117
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,682
For all of us. Isn't it?

118
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,447
<i>Don't be silly, David.</i>

119
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:23,392
You don't need to apologize
for what you said about the plan.

120
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:25,896
If you live in a neighborhood
for a long time...

121
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,901
and somebody moves in
and renovates the house across the street...

122
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,302
that could just make you feel
your own house is shabby.

123
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:34,532
I see.

124
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:37,541
- Did you just insult me?
- Of course not.

125
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,876
You'll see.

126
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,080
When you're ready,
you're going to live in a palace.

127
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,476
Claire, wash your hands. We're about to eat.

128
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,042
Don't set a place for me. I'm not staying.

129
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:51,120
- Who are you having dinner with?
- No one.

130
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,318
I'm having coffee
with someone I met at St. Stephen's.

131
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:57,385
David, if you have a date, just say it.

132
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,932
Nothing ever gets built
if the materials aren't labeled properly.

133
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:03,893
Okay, I have a date.

134
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,406
David, I'm having a problem
with the Emily Previn funeral.

135
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,963
Let's hear it.

136
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:14,201
I've called her entire contact list, and
the friends she listed have moved or died.

137
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,905
She has two distant relatives.

138
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:19,713
One of which I can't reach, and the other
has this phobia about funerals.

139
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,582
Some people are so sick.

140
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,555
Now we know why she wasn't found
for a week.

141
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,884
- I don't think she had anybody in her life.
- How awful.

142
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,327
Have you called her job
to notify her colleagues about the service?

143
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:34,855
No. She worked at a temp agency,
so she just had jobs here and there.

144
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,459
She must have had someone
that she forgot to list.

145
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,733
Try her high school.
Everyone has friends from high school.

146
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,330
No, they don't.

147
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:45,275
Maybe they have people they talk to,
or do things with...

148
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,278
but they're not really friends.

149
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,109
They're just filler.

150
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,042
What? It's true.

151
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,153
I want a glass of wine.

152
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,617
Oh, God.

153
00:12:58,024 --> 00:12:59,514
It's so weird.

154
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,756
Who the hell was Emily Previn?

155
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,723
Nate, are you okay?

156
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,833
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- 'Cause your eyes look really weird.

157
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:15,833
Yeah, it's just this medication I'm taking.
It makes me a little drowsy. That's all.

158
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,138
Honestly.

159
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,913
Maybe Emily Previn was autistic.

160
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:29,853
I read an article about a high-functioning
autistic person who didn't need people.

161
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:33,221
She just had a job
designing these big cattle slaughterhouses.

162
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,920
At night, she came home
and sat in a machine...

163
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,190
that made her feel
like she was being hugged.

164
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,789
And that was all the intimacy she needed.

165
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,493
That's really upsetting.

166
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,230
I don't see why
this person has to be mentally ill...

167
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:49,764
just because she had a life that doesn't
conform to a familiar image in our heads.

168
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,704
Maybe she was living the life she wanted.

169
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,973
A life without the hassle of other people.

170
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,174
What kind of a life is that?

171
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,682
"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor...

172
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,919
"but how was I supposed to know
it was your car?"

173
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,552
- I don't think I could be a public defender.
- No? Why not?

174
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,724
I just don't think
I could defend people who are guilty.

175
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,963
I guess I could be
a some-of-the-public defender.

176
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,939
So, what do you do?

177
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:26,901
Me? My family owns a business.
Actually, it's a funeral home.

178
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:33,717
But I got out of that really quickly,
and now I'm in textiles.

179
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:36,711
I like fabric.

180
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:41,856
I have to be in court in the morning.
I have a lot of work...

181
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:45,693
- Okay. Maybe we'll see each other around.
- David, relax.

182
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:49,826
It's fine. I understand.
I guess there's not much of a spark here.

183
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,700
I thought there was. You don't?

184
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:56,438
No, I do. I was just worried.

185
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,537
I'm sorry, Ben.
I get a little nervous at these things.

186
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,605
If I seem calm,
it's only because I take a beta-blocker...

187
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:08,085
before I have to get in front of a jury
or first dates.

188
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:12,683
You're still nervous on the inside,
but you don't show it as much.

189
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,623
Do you have any extra?

190
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,824
Let's go on a real date next time.
Like, for dinner.

191
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,426
Okay, that would be nice.

192
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,007
You seem a little...

193
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:34,972
- Are you coming out of a bad breakup?
- No, I'm coming out of a bad celibacy.

194
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,743
I was in a relationship, but that ended.

195
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,183
Well, whatever happened, I blame him.

196
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,720
You shouldn't. He's a great guy.

197
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:51,729
You get your spoiled little ass
into that bed right now! Do you hear me?

198
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:52,821
You suck!

199
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,923
Right now! I mean it!

200
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,992
I'm not tired.

201
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,998
When I'm at my real home,
I don't have to go to sleep until I get tired.

202
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:05,601
I'm going to turn off the lights now,
and soon you'll be tired.

203
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,168
What if I never get tired?

204
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:11,114
Then you'll lay awake for hours and hours
wondering why life is so hard.

205
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,014
That's what the rest of us do.

206
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,814
That sounds boring.

207
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,849
You get used to it.

208
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,199
Do you want to talk about anything?

209
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,430
Like how you feel about staying here?

210
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,674
Or being scared, because your mom's
been in Oakland so long?

211
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:37,766
No.

212
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,207
Okay. But we don't know how long
you're gonna be here.

213
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,512
So why don't we both try
and ease up on each other a little bit, okay?

214
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,480
You guys have bad toothpaste.

215
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:54,615
My first instinct is to get angry with her.
I open my mouth, I hear my father.

216
00:16:56,395 --> 00:17:00,024
Stop being so hard on yourself.
That child is not easy.

217
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,001
I swore to myself I would never be like him.

218
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:11,804
I'm not in the mood.

219
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,340
Fine.

220
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:06,658
<i>Get up!</i>

221
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,875
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Melissa. It's Brenda.

222
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,180
Chenowith.

223
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,153
Your massage therapist.

224
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,786
Hey, how's it going?

225
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:09,390
Listen, I was just wondering
if you hadn't eaten yet...

226
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,429
<i>if you wanted to have lunch.</i>

227
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,988
Actually, I'm at a restaurant right now.

228
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:19,203
<i>Look, I'm probably breaking</i>
<i>all these client/masseuse boundaries.</i>

229
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,739
I'll see you
at your regular appointment tomorrow.

230
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,799
No, I was just gonna say I'm by myself.
I'd love the company.

231
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,208
<i>Thank God.</i>

232
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,854
Oh, Jesus!

233
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,621
This one's gonna be one hell of a ride.

234
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:45,094
I'm sure you'll be able to take care of it.

235
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,631
Yeah? Well, don't be.

236
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:50,156
She must've been laying out for a week
in a partially-ventilated space.

237
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,726
Why can't everyone die
in an air-conditioned room?

238
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,137
Her face is discolored from being lain on.

239
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,835
That I can fix,
although it's gonna take me hours.

240
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,346
Her abdomen's all distended.
This woman's got a lot of gas in there.

241
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:04,007
When I poke a hole,
we're gonna get some major fumes.

242
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,516
Whew, Nellie!

243
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,916
I have no idea why I came in here.

244
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:10,784
- Maybe you have Alzheimer's.
- Yeah, maybe.

245
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,594
We really are just biology, aren't we?

246
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:28,335
You may need to talk the family
out of an open casket.

247
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,002
- There's only so much I can do, man.
- She doesn't have any family.

248
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,843
- No one?
- No friends, or anybody.

249
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,909
I ran an obituary in the paper today.

250
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,612
I'm just praying
someone will read it and come tomorrow.

251
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,949
Pre-need?

252
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:48,884
If she wanted an open casket,
we'll try to give her one.

253
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:52,554
I'll boost up the fluids
and see if that'll bring the swelling down.

254
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:56,897
There's a good chance we're going to get
some skin slippage, and then we're screwed.

255
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:03,432
Maybe she was just some vicious asshole,
you know?

256
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,769
Just twisted and evil. Maybe that's why
she didn't have any people in her life.

257
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:09,871
No.

258
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,416
You can tell what kind of life people lived
even when they're dead.

259
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,090
Yeah, she was all right.

260
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:28,092
Please have your IDs out and ready
so we can speed things along.

261
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,368
- Claire Fisher.
- ID?

262
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,438
- Sign right here.
- Name?

263
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,976
- Parker McKenna.
- Let's see.

264
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,170
Parker. Sign here, please.

265
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:44,807
Next?

266
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,283
Does anybody have
an extra number two pencil?

267
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,751
Here you go.

268
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:55,357
So it sounds
like a pretty serious relationship for you.

269
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:56,587
It is.

270
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,821
I love Nate. I really do.

271
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,730
But, lately, I feel kind of separate from him.

272
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,665
Which I know is healthy on one level.

273
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,670
But, on another, I kind of miss how it was.

274
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:16,109
When we started seeing each other
and weren't together...

275
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:19,446
I'd be wondering,
"What is he doing," all day long.

276
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:20,709
Now?

277
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:23,613
I never even think about it.

278
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,822
I don't know exactly when I changed.

279
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,729
But at some point,
he became less present with me.

280
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:40,467
<i>Sometimes I think it's because</i>
<i>I don't give him enough to be present for.</i>

281
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,499
<i>But then I think, maybe he's not present</i>
<i>because he knows if he was really present...</i>

282
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:48,607
then I'd leave him.

283
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,649
<i>You know, it's just so sad</i>
<i>that you can love somebody so much...</i>

284
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,020
<i>and have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what's going on in their head.</i>

285
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:06,653
- Relationships are fucked.
- That's what I always say.

286
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:10,230
I haven't had a real relationship
in over a decade.

287
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,298
- Is that because you...
- Because I blow guys for money?

288
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,534
I'm so sorry. That was...

289
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,007
It's okay.

290
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:23,304
I've only been doing that
for about five years.

291
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:24,781
So why, then?

292
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:29,075
I'm just not built for it.
Some people aren't, I think.

293
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,419
It's not healthy or unhealthy. It just is.

294
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:38,724
Oh, shit.

295
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,362
I'm being paged by a client.

296
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,164
I am not driving out to Calabasas
in this traffic.

297
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,142
Let the jerk whack off.

298
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,675
You know, I'm really glad
you could have lunch.

299
00:23:56,748 --> 00:23:57,942
Me, too.

300
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,978
You know, it means a lot to me
that you're so normal around me.

301
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,984
Most people have preconceived notions
about what I do.

302
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,290
Yeah, well, people can be
such judgmental assholes.

303
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,193
You don't have to tell me that.

304
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,391
You want to know what's worse?

305
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,599
Most girls want to be my friend
so that they can pump me...

306
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,003
for all the gory details
about being a lady of the evening.

307
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:26,810
It's just question after question,
like I'm some kind of freak.

308
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:38,281
- All right, you get three questions.
- Oh, goody!

309
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,352
There's that one.

310
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,984
No, I think that one makes you look fat.

311
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,427
Very funny.

312
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,760
Which one do you think
will look better on Miss Previn?

313
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:49,858
The pink one.

314
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:53,132
Didn't she specify which gown she wanted,
or did Dad slip up?

315
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,902
No, Dad didn't slip up.
She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.

316
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:00,536
- The outfit she came in with was shot.
- Give her the blue to get rid of it.

317
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,011
It's coming apart in the back.

318
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,240
David!

319
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,247
- Mom, did you want something?
- I was dusting your casket wall.

320
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,649
If this woman wanted to be buried
in her own clothes...

321
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,851
then one of you boys should go to her home
and pick something out.

322
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,553
Isn't that a bit much?

323
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:21,156
I remember Dad doing it once or twice.
You get the building manager to let you in.

324
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,827
Fine. I'll pick out something dressy.

325
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:26,003
Considering the shape her body's in...

326
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:28,369
I should pick
whatever covers her up the most.

327
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,839
I'll come with you.

328
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,638
- You don't have to do that.
- I know that.

329
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:38,882
Aren't the guys scary?
It must get dangerous.

330
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,651
To tell you the truth, it doesn't.

331
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:46,021
You just have to trust your instinct.
It's never wrong.

332
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,951
We're kind of like animals that way.

333
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,563
When I first meet a client,
I take a good long look into his eyes.

334
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,760
That stupid stuff they say
about looking in people's eyes is true.

335
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:59,326
- You just look into them, and you know.
- Know what?

336
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:03,204
You know, whether someone is right,
or whether they're...

337
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,677
you know, wrong.

338
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:11,277
And if they're wrong,
you just get out of there immediately.

339
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,045
No. I think everyone has the answers
to everything in life.

340
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,089
- It's a matter of knowing how to listen.
- You're fantastic!

341
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:19,783
Fuck, you are!

342
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:24,625
There is no bullshit with you!
You are just who you are. Period.

343
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,725
Even the way you talk about your work.

344
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,394
You provide a service
for which you're well-compensated.

345
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:34,366
- Unlike the rest of us losers.
- Please.

346
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:38,742
If there was anything else that paid
this much, I would do it in a heartbeat.

347
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,904
But there's not a touch
of victimhood about you.

348
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:44,481
It's almost like it's empowering, in a way.

349
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,882
I went through that whole
feminist rationalization stuff at first.

350
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:50,387
Now I'm just a little more honest.

351
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,656
It's just a way to pay the bills.

352
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,186
Sorry I can't make it to the funeral.

353
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:00,561
My kid's got a soccer game.

354
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,000
She was one of your tenants,
for God's sake.

355
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,298
She lived among you.

356
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,703
Hey, come on. I just started, all right?

357
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:11,264
She only lived among me for a week.

358
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:14,840
She never even got to finish
her crossword puzzle.

359
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,006
All right, look.

360
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:20,508
- Five minutes?
- Yep. Great.

361
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,048
Mom!

362
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:29,958
Eddie needs to adapt
to how things have changed.

363
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,428
I have a lot more responsibility now.

364
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:36,456
He needs to be more understanding
that sometimes I'm gonna be tired, man.

365
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,265
- Yeah, kids come first. Period.
- Exactly.

366
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:42,203
Have you had this conversation with him?

367
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:46,677
He'd just say I need to make more time
for him, which would piss me off.

368
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,113
So why bother talking to him about it?

369
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,047
Because you keep everything bottled up
inside you, my friend.

370
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:54,085
That's not good. That creates cancer.

371
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,619
- Give me a break.
- It does.

372
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:58,850
My wife's cousin was a very angry person,
but she never showed it.

373
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:02,121
She just cleaned all day,
then she lost both her breasts.

374
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:03,319
It's weird.

375
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,021
You get away from me, dickless fuck!

376
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:09,566
- You don't own me.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

377
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,932
You know, you fucking lie to me, bitch!

378
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:15,234
Bitch, I'll blow your fucking brains out,
you stupid cunt!

379
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,070
I wish you would,
but you don't got the balls to shoot me!

380
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:21,203
- Police! Drop the gun!
- Stay out of this! Fucking cops!

381
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,337
Drop the gun.

382
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:25,315
You shoot me, they'll shoot you.
Then you'll be dead!

383
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:27,817
You know what?
The world will be a better place!

384
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,911
- Shut up!
- Drop the gun now!

385
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,752
What is wrong with you?
What did you do that for?

386
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,457
What's wrong with you?

387
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:51,003
I like all of these, but they seem so flat.

388
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,278
I wish one had a little more oomph.

389
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:57,907
- Just grab that one. That one has oomph.
- No, it doesn't.

390
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,312
Don't rush me, Nate. I'm not nearly done...

391
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:04,878
and I haven't even started
with the shoes and the jewelry.

392
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,258
Nate Fisher.

393
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:14,494
Yeah, hi. I left a message there
for Father Martin Farrell.

394
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,167
He was requested by the deceased
to officiate at her funeral.

395
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,738
Great! Well, I'm fucked.

396
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,869
I'm sorry, Sister.

397
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:30,874
Are there any other priests
you'd recommend for a funeral tomorrow?

398
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:15,349
Mom?

399
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,822
- What, are you hungry?
- Of course not.

400
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,698
- Then, are you ready to go?
- I don't know.

401
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,095
Maybe she liked solitude.

402
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,808
Maybe she was living the life she wanted
and was happy.

403
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,207
I hope so.

404
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:37,014
But what if some nights,
she wanted to talk to someone...

405
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:38,845
and she picked up the phone...

406
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:43,286
and realized she didn't have anyone
she could call? What then?

407
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:48,819
We don't know that she didn't have
anyone to call. Maybe there was someone.

408
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,224
I hope so.

409
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:27,264
No one thinks you did anything wrong.
You were just doing your job, okay?

410
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,202
Now I know what's different.

411
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,671
You're not wearing your glasses tonight.

412
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:39,575
I was getting dressed,
and nothing looked right...

413
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:42,238
and I realized it was all my glasses' fault.

414
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,708
So I put in these contacts,
which I actually hate...

415
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,548
but I thought it was worth it, if you'd...

416
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:54,419
This is me without beta-blockers.

417
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,258
It's good.

418
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,862
Maybe it's even better.

419
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:08,666
- I still work in the family business.
- Excuse me?

420
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,870
I'm a funeral director, that's who I am.

421
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,906
I have to say, I'm glad you're not in textiles.
That sounded really dull.

422
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,811
Why did you lie?

423
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:24,550
Well, come on.

424
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:28,921
People always get that look in their eyes,
like there's something wrong with you.

425
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:33,862
They wait about 5 seconds before bringing
the conversation around to necrophilia.

426
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:38,226
I just liked you too much,
and I was scared it would repulse you.

427
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,462
So what made you tell me now?

428
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:44,375
Because on our last date,
I just sort of liked you...

429
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,235
and now I really like you.

430
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:54,277
- So I didn't screw things up because I lied?
- No, I think it's cute.

431
00:32:57,055 --> 00:33:00,513
- And I'm gonna wanna take this slow.
- All right.

432
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,787
Can we just make out, already?

433
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,812
We had plans to meet tonight. At the Tiki Ti.

434
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,142
Did we?

435
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:27,974
Claire, why did you blow me off?
And why didn't you return my phone calls?

436
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:30,316
Because I have nothing to say to you.

437
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:35,349
Look, I know this is about the SATs,
but it wasn't my fault.

438
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:39,559
It was my mother's idea. She heard
about this girl through one of her friends.

439
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,896
She's this genius from Westlake
who's going around taking the test.

440
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,935
And let me tell you, it works.

441
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:48,403
She got three people into Yale
and five into Harvard.

442
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:52,167
- This is so gross.
- What was I supposed to do?

443
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:57,147
My mom came into my room last night and
told me she'd already paid the girl $1,000.

444
00:33:57,215 --> 00:34:00,048
You make me so sick. Just get out of here!

445
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,410
Okay? I don't feel like
ever seeing you again.

446
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,516
- You're serious?
- Yeah, I am.

447
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,651
Fine. Fuck you, Claire!

448
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:16,263
By the way, I flirted for 45 minutes with
Gary Deitman outside of school yesterday...

449
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:18,427
and he's this total horny little freak.

450
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:20,232
And I'm gonna bag him, big time.

451
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:24,799
Congratulations. I hope you and
his stupid buns will be very happy together!

452
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:33,880
<i>"David Fisher and Benjamin Cooper</i>
<i>invite you to a holiday open house. "</i>

453
00:34:35,486 --> 00:34:38,080
<i>"Merry Christmas from Ben and David."</i>

454
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:41,289
<i>"Happy Holidays from the Cooper-Fishers."</i>

455
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,388
"Fish & Coop, <i>new this fall on ABC."</i>

456
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,967
Keith, what's wrong?

457
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,130
I'm not sure.

458
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:00,776
Okay. Come in and sit down.

459
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:08,481
I shouldn't have even come here.

460
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:09,781
It's fine.

461
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:11,687
You want a beer?

462
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:15,248
- I have Rolling Rock or Amstel Light...
- I killed someone today.

463
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,022
- Oh, my God.
- It was this guy...

464
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,664
Him and his woman were having a fight.

465
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,266
They were obviously
both high on something.

466
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,235
He had a gun and...

467
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:31,366
I'm sure whatever it was,
you did the right thing.

468
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,500
He's dead, you fucking idiot!

469
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:37,846
I should have aimed at his arm or his leg.

470
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,483
I'm stupid.

471
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,587
I'm so fucking stupid.

472
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:51,021
I never killed someone before.

473
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,631
I can't live with this.

474
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:58,902
I don't know how to help you.

475
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,064
Do you want to pray?

476
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:05,338
Maybe that would do something.

477
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,565
David's not up yet?

478
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,640
So where's Emily Previn?

479
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,768
She's in there.

480
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:46,512
So she's not gonna have an open casket.

481
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:51,146
- I couldn't do it.
- Okay.

482
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:55,715
I was supposed to take the kids to dinner
so Vanessa could have the night off.

483
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:57,784
But instead, I was here.

484
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,061
Until 9:00 last night.

485
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:03,526
Skin was fricking pouring off
that woman's face!

486
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,401
I get all this shit from Vanessa,
and I wasn't able to restore the poor lady!

487
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:08,871
Nobody could have.

488
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,101
But, here, you think you can do it?

489
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:14,104
Here's some tools.

490
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,544
I want to watch you swim in that skin.
Go ahead!

491
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,377
All I said was okay.

492
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,789
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:34,259
I just wish I could've done her
the way she wanted.

494
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:38,962
If it'll make you feel any better, I don't think
there are even gonna be any mourners.

495
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:42,700
Thanks.

496
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:55,944
Hello?

497
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,582
It's me.

498
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:02,615
- I thought you were still here.
<i>- I had to get back home.</i>

499
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:05,954
Are you okay?

500
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,132
Yeah, I'm fine.

501
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:11,334
Listen, what happened last night,
that was wrong.

502
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:16,971
<i>I don't know why I went to you,</i>
<i>but obviously I wasn't thinking right.</i>

503
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,173
Obviously.

504
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,169
I'm in a relationship.

505
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:23,176
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

506
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:27,149
I just thought you and I could be friends...

507
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:29,549
but I was just kidding myself.

508
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:35,123
<i>Look, I don't think that you and I</i>
<i>should see each other anymore.</i>

509
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:42,423
David?

510
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,567
Yeah, I'm here. Sure, whatever you want.

511
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,732
I knew you would understand.

512
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:53,601
Goodbye.

513
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,771
Bye.

514
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,888
Thank you. That was intense.

515
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:09,753
You're practically like jelly.
You don't need this.

516
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,557
Maybe not, but I love it.

517
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,830
You're gifted, you know that?

518
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:19,028
Hello?

519
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:24,734
Don't give me that bullshit.
I want your ass there in half an hour.

520
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,106
Okay, fuck you.
You are officially dead to me now.

521
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:31,374
Everything okay?

522
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:35,044
I have a client at 2:15,
and my watcher just cancelled.

523
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:36,517
Your watcher?

524
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:39,613
He likes to be watched
by another girl while I do him.

525
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,988
It's the easiest $100 in the world...

526
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:46,161
and this asshole just blew me off
for a runway audition.

527
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,959
God, I hate models.

528
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,558
Fuck.

529
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:55,334
If you're sitting in the corner depressed,
pick up.

530
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,134
Pick up.

531
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:00,276
All right, be depressed.

532
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:05,980
Listen, if you're in a jam...

533
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,379
This isn't a science project, honey.
This is business.

534
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,978
Please. You think I can't handle it?

535
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,391
Like I said, it's pretty easy.

536
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:24,229
Actually, it's like you're invisible.
Just sitting and watching.

537
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,564
I can do that.

538
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:28,833
I sit and watch all the time.
In fact, that's mostly all I do.

539
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:32,034
I guess you've been
in three-way situations before.

540
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:34,202
- I mean, who hasn't?
- Yeah.

541
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:37,641
Fuck.

542
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:43,780
I've never seen you this angry before.
It's terrific!

543
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:46,254
- No, my nephew made that.
- Sorry.

544
00:40:46,324 --> 00:40:47,951
Here, talk to me.

545
00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:52,223
This girl cheated on the SATs,
and now she's gonna get away with it.

546
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:55,127
Okay, what's this girl's name?

547
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,700
When I realized what was going on,
I just wanted to run and not take the test.

548
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,297
But I did. I took it, like an idiot.
And what was the point?

549
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,342
It's all just some stupid game.

550
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,843
I don't know what I want,
but I don't want this.

551
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:09,607
And this is your excuse to bail?

552
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,274
Bail? What's that?
Some hip lingo you think kids say?

553
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,184
- You are so lame sometimes.
- Direct your anger at me, if you need to.

554
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:20,656
By the way, you can fuck Parker McKenna,
but if I were you, I'd wear a condom...

555
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:23,319
because I'm sure she has hepatitis,
at the very least.

556
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:25,487
What are you talking about?

557
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:29,696
If you're referring to the conversation
I had with Parker, that's all it was.

558
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,098
A conversation.

559
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:35,161
I have conversations with lots
of young women. They approach me.

560
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:39,169
Claire, I'm worried about you.

561
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:41,002
Why?

562
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,740
You're getting your life together,
and it scares you.

563
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:47,614
So you want to slip into the old habit
of focusing on someone else's drama...

564
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:51,451
instead of concentrating on yourself.
You need to stop doing that.

565
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,027
You're right.

566
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:08,103
And now is probably as good a time as any
to talk about the sexual tension between us.

567
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,240
- What?
- It exists.

568
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:14,405
It's a part of transference
and counter-transference...

569
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:18,175
so we should acknowledge it's out there,
and it'll never be acted upon...

570
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:21,707
because to do so
would be irresponsible and destructive.

571
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:30,260
Do you have anything
that you would like to contribute?

572
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,929
No, I don't.

573
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:36,424
Okay.

574
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:44,835
I bet you I could glue this together
if I tried hard.

575
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:48,939
I know people
don't really glue things together anymore...

576
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,243
but I could probably fix this.

577
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,252
<i>You've reached the private line</i>
<i>of David Fisher.</i>

578
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,694
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

579
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:11,596
<i>Hi, David. It's Ben. I'm calling to figure out</i>
<i>what time's good for you on Saturday.</i>

580
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:16,272
<i>And I had a really good time last night,</i>
<i>especially the making out part.</i>

581
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:19,666
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

582
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,243
Yeah, honey.

583
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:34,080
You know exactly how I like it.

584
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,957
Come on. Move your tongue around it.

585
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,365
Yeah.

586
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:30,239
<i>And I am telling you</i>

587
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,106
<i>I'm not going</i>

588
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,915
<i>I'm the best man you'll ever know</i>

589
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,087
<i>There's no way I could ever go</i>

590
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,321
Nate, I love you!

591
00:44:58,742 --> 00:45:02,769
Now that I've heard this song five times
in a row, I can honestly say I dislike it.

592
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:04,837
I'm here for the service.

593
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,710
Look around, nobody's here.
There's not gonna be any service.

594
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:11,311
I couldn't even get a minister,
and they get paid.

595
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:15,415
I've taken care of that.
Father Jack is on his way here right now.

596
00:45:15,492 --> 00:45:17,983
- Just give me 10 minutes.
- For what?

597
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:25,059
- Federico?
- Yes, Mrs. F?

598
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,035
Could you come upstairs, please?

599
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:34,937
Keith?

600
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,407
David, I need you for a few minutes.

601
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:43,885
- Mom, I have a headache.
- Too bad.

602
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:49,719
- But I'm in the middle of a show.
- Just do what I say!

603
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:52,261
And get out of those ragamuffin clothes.

604
00:45:59,536 --> 00:46:01,401
Why is this happening?

605
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,706
I don't know.
Our structures probably need new fencing.

606
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:08,734
- And our roofs had bad shingles.
- I had shingles once.

607
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:14,545
She was supposed to have an open casket.

608
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:18,647
I did the best I could, okay?

609
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:21,623
I didn't see you down there helping me out.

610
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:24,856
Leave it alone.

611
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:34,529
We gather to mourn
the passing of Emily Previn.

612
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:37,298
I did not know Emily Previn.

613
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:40,275
>From what I gather, few, if any, people did.

614
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:45,243
People might wonder what point there is
in leading a life...

615
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:47,715
where you don't touch any other lives.

616
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:51,044
But it would be arrogant of us
to assume that.

617
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:56,416
Every life is a contribution.
We just may not see how.

618
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:01,654
I'm glad to encounter Emily Previn,
even if it is in death.

619
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:05,497
Everyone comes into our life for a reason...

620
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:09,596
and it is our responsibility to learn
what they have to teach us.

621
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,868
Now, in accordance with Emily's wishes...

622
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,881
I will read
from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.

623
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,679
<i>Strange, but somehow I feel like Emily won.</i>

624
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:25,417
She remains a fucking question mark
right up to the bitter end.

625
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:30,324
Basically all I know about her is that
she kept Wheat Thins in her refrigerator.

626
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:32,988
That's something.

627
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:36,032
So, tell your mother
I have to get back to work.

628
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:37,996
Unlike some people.

629
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:43,097
I'm sorry, Federico, but I have a headache.
Am I not allowed to have a headache?

630
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,611
- It's so good to see you.
- Hello, Father.

631
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:54,750
How is everything at St. Stephen's?

632
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,617
It's okay.

633
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,824
Apropos of what I said earlier,
I wanted to thank you, David.

634
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,989
I'm really glad you came into my life.

635
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:10,192
You will never know
how much you taught me about myself.

636
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:13,031
Really? How so?

637
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:15,967
Another time, maybe.

638
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,507
- You look a little sad.
- I have a headache.

639
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,373
Well, God bless.

640
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:31,515
David, come over here. There's something
I want to say to the three of you.

641
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:35,783
Oh, Lord, our gutters are clogged. I think
we need to see about removing the leaves.

642
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:37,588
That's very funny, Claire.

643
00:48:37,895 --> 00:48:40,022
I know you think the plan is ridiculous.

644
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:42,827
- No, we don't.
- We just think it's weird.

645
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:47,094
Did any one of you wonder why I felt
the need to change the structure of my life?

646
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,866
Did you even care?

647
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,902
At first I didn't understand
why I was so upset about Emily Previn.

648
00:48:54,978 --> 00:48:58,175
Then it hit me. I don't want to turn into her.

649
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:01,509
Life is hard enough
without not having people to help you.

650
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:04,179
- But, Mom, you have us.
- I do not.

651
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:08,417
Nate, you've been walking around
like a zombie for months.

652
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,050
You're lying in bed during the day,
God knows why.

653
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:12,789
I have a headache.

654
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:15,295
Claire, I can't even look in your direction...

655
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:18,425
without you acting like
it's some incredible imposition.

656
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:22,871
All I want is for us not to be strangers.
I want some intimacy.

657
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:25,603
Give me intimacy.

658
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,770
Won't any of you have intimacy with me?

659
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:37,878
Okay, I guess I have my answer.

660
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:39,848
Mom, wait.

661
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:44,189
I just think that intimacy should happen
a little more organically than this.

662
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:47,662
Fine. Then I'll simply wait for it
like I have been.

663
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:52,600
I just pray that it happens
before I end up like Emily Previn.

664
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,803
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

665
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:08,612
<i>When I saw you typing at your computer,</i>
<i>you had the strangest expression.</i>

666
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,587
I was writing. It's called flow.

667
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,786
You know all about flow, don't you?

668
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:20,086
Let me ask you a question.

669
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:24,258
Do you think you and I have
as much intimacy as you want?

670
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:30,601
I don't have as much of anything as I want.

671
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:34,009
That's not really much of an answer.

672
00:50:34,077 --> 00:50:36,944
It wasn't really much of a question.

673
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,744
Did you remember to lock the door?

674
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:45,310
Yes, I did, for the second time.
You've been acting strange tonight.

675
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:48,483
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've been all jumpy.

676
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:58,727
Oh, God.

677
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,361
Okay, something has been on my mind.

678
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,312
Nate Fisher...

679
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:24,557
would you be my wife?

680
00:51:27,397 --> 00:51:29,797
My God, this isn't what I was expecting.

681
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:32,567
- Is that a no?
- No, of course not.

682
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,841
It is kind of an ugly ring.
It's got these Greek letters on it.

683
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:44,002
Delta Phi Delta.
It's my grandfather's fraternity ring.

684
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,606
I found it when I was cleaning up...

685
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:50,352
and that's when I got the idea...

686
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,080
to propose to you.

687
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,018
So why today?

688
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,362
I don't know.

689
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,325
I just started thinking...

690
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:10,030
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

691
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:14,737
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,341
Promise?

693
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,894
Of course I'll marry you.
I love you. Absolutely.

694
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:34,390
I love you. Yeah, let's get married!

695
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:37,399
Yes! Let's get married!

696
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:38,729
Come on!

697
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,163
I love you, too.
