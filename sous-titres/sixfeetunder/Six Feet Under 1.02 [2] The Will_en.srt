1
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,328
You can have anything you want.

2
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:47,732
It's yours for the taking.

3
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:52,329
But we've been conditioned to think
that this isn't fair somehow.

4
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:55,530
That that's taking something away
from someone else, right?

5
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:56,693
- Right.
- Right.

6
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,617
Wrong.

7
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,535
The bounty of the universe
is without limits.

8
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,459
What exactly is Beauty Vision anyway?

9
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,051
Oh, it's a personalized
life-management system.

10
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,376
It sounds kind of culty.

11
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:14,499
Everybody wants a better life.

12
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,216
Shit, two years ago,
I was living out of my fucking car.

13
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:21,137
He told me the first time we went out
he was going to marry me.

14
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:26,542
It was unbelievably romantic,
and now I have this beautiful baby.

15
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,335
And that's what Beauty Vision is.

16
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:33,619
It's a way of seeing the world
without fear.

17
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:39,582
Now, these new territories are gonna
go so fast. The franchise fee is $45,000.

18
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,254
Sign me up.

19
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,100
Are you really ready for this?

20
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,900
Fuck, yeah.

21
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:54,263
Well, welcome to Beauty Vision.

22
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:04,740
- Your husband is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,821
He spends an hour on
the StairMaster every day.

24
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,308
Jesus.

25
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,024
Is that blood? Shit!

26
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,463
He must've hit his head
on the bottom of the pool.

27
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,668
Chandler!

28
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,387
Oh, my God.

29
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,748
Wake your tired ass up, sleepyhead.

30
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:39,914
- What's for breakfast?
- Me, stupid.

31
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:55,632
Now, which one of you is the wife?

32
00:03:55,837 --> 00:04:01,037
No, no, keep going. Keep going.
I'm kind of curious as to how this works.

33
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,719
No breakfast?

34
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:22,959
- Why'd you let me sleep late?
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.

35
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,995
You looked so relaxed,
which I don't see that often.

36
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:29,679
Today's the reading of Dad's will.
You know about that.

37
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:32,920
It'll all be over real soon.

38
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:37,721
- Thank you for sleeping over.
- You snore.

39
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't forget about the meeting
tomorrow night.

40
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:44,121
You think I'd miss a meeting
of gay police and firemen?

41
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,475
You'll like these guys. They're cool.

42
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:49,246
I'll pick you up around 7.
We'll grab a bite to eat.

43
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,645
- Call me before you head over.
- So you can weasel your way out of it?

44
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:57,806
I never know when I'm gonna have to
work, Keith. This is a busy time for us.

45
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:03,082
A lot of people hold on
for one last Christmas, and then bye-bye.

46
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:07,398
I always thought shiatsu
was more intense than this.

47
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:10,407
Oh, it'll get there.

48
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,488
I'm just trying to find out
where you're wounded.

49
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,408
Wounded?

50
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,519
I got stabbed in the thigh
with a BIC pen once.

51
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,804
I wasn't speaking literally.

52
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,442
Oh, here's a good one.

53
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:33,363
Old, but recently reopened.

54
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:37,088
- You're so full of shit.
- Well, we're all wounded.

55
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,362
We carry our wounds
around with us throughout life...

56
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,372
...and eventually, they kill us.

57
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:49,013
Things happen that leave
a mark in space, in time, in us.

58
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:56,006
I'm sure this is all
very deep and profound...

59
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:59,493
...but you know,
I get enough depth at home.

60
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,368
You're supposed to be
my haven away from all that.

61
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,928
I'm not supposed to be anything.

62
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:32,256
Morning, Dave.

63
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,453
Aren't those the same clothes
you had on yesterday?

64
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,937
Everything I own looks alike.

65
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,857
I sense you're not being completely
honest with me, Dave.

66
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,380
Have you changed any
since you were 14?

67
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:48,134
Hey, I'm all for you
getting laid, believe me.

68
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,659
Morning.

69
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,539
You gotta try these. They're hydroponic.
Grown in water.

70
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:08,660
I know the guy who grows them.
He's a big supplier to the co-op.

71
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,020
- So my peaches are no good?
- What?

72
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,663
No, they're fine.

73
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,668
Mr. Hickey wants us there on time
for the reading of the will.

74
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,668
We should all go in the same car.

75
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,751
Great, I have to miss
another day of school?

76
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,342
What am I, some poor Victorian waif,
who has to stay hidden from view?

77
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,668
Fine, go to school...

78
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:40,543
...stay out all night,
live in the streets. See if I care.

79
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,508
Was she like this growing up?

80
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:51,954
No, not really,
but she was well on her way.

81
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,466
Morning.

82
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,987
You're looking spiffy
in that suit, Dave.

83
00:07:57,236 --> 00:08:00,114
That's so clever. You're talking
like the computer in the movie.

84
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:01,989
Wow, you're funny.

85
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:05,030
Have a hydroponic raspberry
grown by a guy named Gunther...

86
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:08,196
...who once slept with Stevie Nicks.

87
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:12,673
So, Dave, are you gonna
tell us about her?

88
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:14,676
- Who?
- Oh, he's got a friend.

89
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,712
- Are you and Jennifer back together?
- No.

90
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,708
- Have you met someone else, Dave?
- Leave him alone.

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,269
- Someone from outside your pod?
- Shut up, asshole.

92
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,235
Thank you, Claire.

93
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,479
Why are you still here anyway?
Why don't you go back to Seattle?

94
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,471
Because I would miss
the joyful sense of belonging I get here.

95
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,556
I have no idea what kind
of service he'd want.

96
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, at this scale,
it depends on who he was...

97
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:04,439
...and how he saw himself.
The statement that he made with his life.

98
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,965
He was, like, so dynamic.

99
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:13,997
He had his own business. Beauty Vision?

100
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,679
- From the infomercial?
- Chandler invented it.

101
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,845
Large scale.

102
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,438
I'll arrange viewings
for tomorrow and the next day...

103
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,006
...interment at Cedar Hill,
service for 200.

104
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,886
Now, we should choose
an appropriate resting vessel...

105
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:34,524
...one that befits a man of his stature.

106
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:50,246
May I ask what kind of car
your husband preferred?

107
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:52,690
He drives a BMW.

108
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,170
Do you know which model?

109
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,764
The biggest, fastest one.

110
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:01,207
I recommend the Titan Series.

111
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,249
Solid mahogany, pan-finished
with burwood accents...

112
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:07,216
...the same wood used in luxury
automobile interiors.

113
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:11,205
- It looks expensive.
- Nine thousand.

114
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,651
It's more than just a casket. It's a...

115
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:18,497
...tribute, really.

116
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,735
Okay.

117
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:25,816
- Are we finished?
- A major credit card to get us started.

118
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,375
Hi.

119
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:35,854
"I, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, a resident
of Los Angeles County, California...

120
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,850
...declare this to be my last will
and revoke all former wills and codicils.

121
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,901
First, to my wife, Ruth...

122
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:45,140
...I leave all bank accounts,
stocks and bonds that are in my name.

123
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:48,420
That's in addition to the life insurance.

124
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:51,377
Second, I bequeath the company,
Fisher & Sons Funeral Home...

125
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,099
...and all real property and business
interest attached as follows:

126
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,259
Fifty percent to my son
David James Fisher...

127
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:02,424
...and fifty percent to my son
Nathaniel Samuel Fisher Jr."

128
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,423
What?

129
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:08,456
What, was he high?
Why would he do that?

130
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,541
David.

131
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:20,346
- Wow, I guess I don't even rate.
- No, he set up a trust for you.

132
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,147
David.

133
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,828
Hey, wait, David.

134
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,463
David, David, David, I don't want it.

135
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:31,027
Well, excuse me while I go contemplate
the irony of that.

136
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,383
- What's my recourse here?
- Recourse?

137
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,741
Your entire college education
is provided for.

138
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:41,507
- So I don't get anything.
- You get education, Claire.

139
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,101
A privilege that not everyone gets.

140
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,780
- What if I don't wanna go?
- You need it these days...

141
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,945
...not just to succeed,
but to survive.

142
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:55,547
Okay, spare me the tough-love
rationalization, just bottom-line it, please.

143
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:58,905
Should you decide not to go, the money
will become available to you...

144
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,151
...when you're 25.

145
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:05,303
So this is like blackmail
from beyond the grave.

146
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,870
What in the hell was Dad thinking?
Is this some sick joke?

147
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:12,551
It's Fisher and Sons.
You're the sons.

148
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,748
Mom gets half a million
in life insurance...

149
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,993
...which is fair, but I
have strings attached?

150
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,553
- Let's not talk about what's fair.
- Have my half.

151
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,868
No, your father knew exactly
what he was doing.

152
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,387
He wanted everybody happy,
and we will be happy.

153
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,908
I guess what I want is totally irrelevant.

154
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,749
Dave, listen, this is all wrong.
It should be yours, or yours and Mom's.

155
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,599
I really don't wanna discuss it now.

156
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,994
Maybe I'll move to Florida.

157
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,596
That's ridiculous, Mom,
and it's not helping.

158
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,156
You're adults, and Claire
will be leaving next year.

159
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,114
Yeah, to join the Marines.
I wanna learn to kill, kill, kill.

160
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:54,994
- Is that Mr. Swanson? How does he look?
- Easy.

161
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:57,672
Head split open, some scalp work.

162
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:00,637
Hair extensions to cover
the stitches, maybe.

163
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,123
You guys are in my way.

164
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,080
Mrs. F.

165
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:10,481
Vanessa called.
We got a fresh one at Bay Breeze.

166
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:14,235
- Pick it up. I'll get Swanson.
- No, I still gotta finish Mrs. Huffington.

167
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:17,763
- Federico, her viewing is at 3:00.
- Yeah, well, she's majorly jaundiced.

168
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:22,086
- Crank up the pink spots over her casket.
- David, the woman looks like a banana.

169
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:24,324
I don't airbrush her,
the family will freak.

170
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:28,886
You wanna put her out like that,
then take my name off the certificate.

171
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:36,318
Nate, I need you to pick up a body
at Bay Breeze Nursing Home.

172
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,126
- I don't know how.
- Put him on a gurney...

173
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,764
...put the gurney in the car...

174
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:43,007
...take the elevator,
put him in the freezer.

175
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,167
You think you can handle that?

176
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:49,041
You own half the business now.
Start pulling your weight.

177
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:53,691
News flash, other people exist!

178
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,008
Hey, give me 20 minutes.
I'll go with you.

179
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,293
Thanks.

180
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:13,855
So did Dad ever say anything to you
that might explain why he would do this?

181
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:19,131
Like, "By the way, Federico,
I've lost my fucking mind."

182
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:23,616
It's a good business. Steady.

183
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:27,533
He was still pissed at me
for not going into it...

184
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,492
...but what does he think,
he can force me?

185
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,456
Maybe he was pissed at Dave.

186
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,021
Hey.

187
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:07,217
You wanna go to a thing tonight?

188
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,536
I'm not in the mood
for a thing, Gabriel.

189
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,377
Come on,
don't go through this alone.

190
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,736
Fat chance, it's like I got
a sign on my head...

191
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,619
...that says, "Freak with the dead dad."

192
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:19,580
And like all these people,
who are so tragic, even knew him.

193
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,266
I met your dad once.

194
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,340
Remember, he buried
my grandmother Alice.

195
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,108
Why are you talking to me?

196
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:30,027
- What, you think I'm a jerk?
- Yes.

197
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:34,058
You know you're different now.

198
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,588
I can see through walls.

199
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,906
Don't your skanks need to be walked?

200
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,465
I wanna see you.

201
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,109
Mrs. Fisher?

202
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:09,750
I'm Matthew Gilardi.
Do you have a moment?

203
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:16,830
- Did David mention me, by any chance?
- I don't think he did.

204
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,106
Well, I thought I'd drop off the details...

205
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,910
...of our buyout offer
so you could look it over.

206
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,267
The terms are quite generous.

207
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:27,671
Especially the stock options.

208
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:32,634
Who are you to buy us out?

209
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,114
I never saw you before in my life.

210
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,275
I represent Kroehner
Service International.

211
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,355
A chain?

212
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,235
Kroehner is a family of quality
death-care facilities, Mrs. Fisher.

213
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,431
We have a 157 units
in Southern California...

214
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,195
...and we're inviting you to be 158.

215
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,961
You should discuss
the situation with your son David.

216
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:56,840
- I have two sons.
- Really? I was only aware of one.

217
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,041
I know how many sons
I have, Mr. Gilardi.

218
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:05,193
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:08,562
Just look at the numbers.
I'll let myself out.

220
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,437
Morning.

221
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,720
How are you folks today?

222
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,322
Don't expect to be popular.

223
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:27,520
- Hey, baby. Nate, look at you.
- Look at you.

224
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,002
Four-and-a-half months,
this one wants out already.

225
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,405
- Mr. Suarez all ready to go?
- Yeah, but, honey, we got a problem.

226
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,485
My sister can't pick up
Julio from school.

227
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,203
She got another callback
from that cat-food commercial.

228
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,843
- What about my career, huh?
- Come on.

229
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,517
I can't do it, not today.
David's head would explode.

230
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,245
Nate, you ought to remind your brother
how many clients I have referred...

231
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,642
...to you guys from here
and tell him to cut Rico some slack.

232
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,411
No, no, no.

233
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,567
You won't.

234
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,442
Rico, go.

235
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,928
I'm the new boss, right?

236
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,250
Okay, but I'm telling Dave
you said I could.

237
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,203
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:15,973
I can do this. I just need some help
getting him onto the gurney.

239
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:29,446
You can touch him if you wear
one of these. Believe me, he won't mind.

240
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:35,333
All right, pull the bed back.
Line it up with the gurney.

241
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,449
All right.

242
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,618
- Okay.
- That good?

243
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,858
Yeah, take this off for a second. Okay.

244
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,532
All right, grab his shoulders.
On three. Ready?

245
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,620
One, two, three.

246
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:02,776
Angel lust.

247
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:05,736
- Does that happen a lot?
- A fair amount.

248
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,902
You can be dead,
but you're never really dead.

249
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:24,937
- Hello.
- So I've been thinking.

250
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:27,899
We skipped way too many steps.
We need to have a first date.

251
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,181
Okay.

252
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:31,696
I'm at Pinot Hollywood,
Know where that is?

253
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:34,626
- You mean right now?
- Yeah,

254
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:37,467
I'd love to, but I've got
a dead body in the car with me.

255
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:41,058
I can certainly understand why you
wouldn't want to get away from that.

256
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:46,147
Come on, just a glass of wine,
15 minutes. The dead guy won't mind.

257
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,621
- Do me a favor, keep it out of the sun.
- Yeah, sure.

258
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,185
I had forgotten. They make these noises.

259
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:58,389
The air comes out. It's like:

260
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,709
No.

261
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,541
Dad knew that I hated
this whole fucked-up business.

262
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,026
He should respect that.

263
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,425
Well, poor Dave, I'd be pissed too.

264
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:12,712
Although, he does seem to take it
to this extra, Old Testament level.

265
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:15,986
So does this mean you're not
going back to Seattle on Sunday?

266
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,593
Fuck.

267
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:21,913
Okay, don't think about it.
Tell me about yourself.

268
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,984
Like this is our first date and we never
had sex before you knew my name.

269
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,990
You mean the recap
of major life events...

270
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,391
...told in a humorous
and self-deprecating way...

271
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,031
...which almost always
gets me laid?

272
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:37,707
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:41,116
- I'm not that guy with you.
- Who are you?

274
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,915
I don't know, somebody new.

275
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,118
It's because of your father.

276
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,515
You're with me
at your most vulnerable.

277
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,759
You felt comfortable.
You felt really accepted.

278
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,638
You always analyze guys
on the first date?

279
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,760
- Only if they're interesting.
- Oh, so you think I'm interesting.

280
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,715
Yeah. I don't meet that many
men with dead guys...

281
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:10,915
...with hard-ons in their car.

282
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:26,397
When Mrs. Swanson's credit card
didn't go through, I ran a check...

283
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:28,641
...and they were in debt
up to their ears.

284
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,918
We have a $3200 Titan casket
being delivered tomorrow.

285
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:35,482
Why didn't you tell me
there's an offer to buy us out?

286
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,679
I knew what you and Dad thought
of Kroehner Service International.

287
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:41,606
You don't know what I think.

288
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,721
Not that it matters to you.

289
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,157
And Nate is not your enemy.
He'll do whatever you want.

290
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:53,119
Why do you say that? He spent
his entire life doing what he wants.

291
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,569
- Dad must've really hated me.
- Hush.

292
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:07,845
It's Fisher & Sons. That's gotta continue,
and you're never gonna have kids.

293
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:16,562
Well, it's about time.
What took you so long?

294
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:20,289
- I stopped to eat.
- I wish you'd called.

295
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:23,884
I think Mr. Suarez kind of shit himself.
Is that normal?

296
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,729
Stopped to eat? Do you have
any respect for human life?

297
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:30,245
I have a huge respect for human life.
I didn't know they can take a dump!

298
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:33,129
- Well, they can. Make a note.
- I don't like this bickering.

299
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:36,812
Yeah, well, I don't like you
sleeping with hairdressers.

300
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:54,575
Look, don't take this out on Mom.
What is it you wanna say to me?

301
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,933
Well, there's a body that spent
over two hours in a van...

302
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,019
...unrefridgerated, decomposing at a rate
much faster than you could ever imagine.

303
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,815
Thanks for making my life
just that much more difficult.

304
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,660
Thanks for undermining
my authority with our employees...

305
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,413
...and thanks for making it clear
that my choice to dedicate myself...

306
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,534
...to this business and to this family
was really stupid.

307
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:18,053
Apparently, I would have been rewarded
just the same for wasting my life.

308
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:22,217
Oh, my life is a waste? Fuck you!
At least I enjoy it.

309
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:23,743
Yeah, well, lucky you.

310
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:30,137
- Dave, at least let me help.
- You've helped enough!

311
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,625
It's just not fair that my life
is being decided by other people.

312
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,338
Hey, college is paid for.

313
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,982
They have great parties.
No student loans to pay off.

314
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:56,340
I'm not exactly a party person.

315
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,107
By the way,
that shit you gave me...

316
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,665
...the night my dad died,
it really fucked me up.

317
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,225
I'm sorry about that.

318
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,546
You should be.

319
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:13,185
Just, why is college the only option?
I don't even know what I wanna do.

320
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,942
I just feel like there's
something inside me.

321
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,668
I'd just like to figure out what it is
before I get completely reprogrammed.

322
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,546
Hey, nobody could reprogram you.

323
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:26,627
You're the most original girl
in the school.

324
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,348
Come on, look at this car
that you drive.

325
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,473
This face that you drive.

326
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:38,071
- Thanks a lot. Liar.
- I'm serious.

327
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:41,865
You know how much guts it takes
to be somebody like you?

328
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,235
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

329
00:24:57,439 --> 00:25:00,954
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

330
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,758
Who do you got there, David?

331
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:13,396
Who is that? It's him?
That's Mr. Bloomberg?

332
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,521
Put him right down next to him there.

333
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,235
Oh, my goodness.

334
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:21,994
Yeah, you're okay, David.

335
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:38,599
Mom wants to see us.

336
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,601
I'm going on a hike with someone.

337
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:54,560
Okay.

338
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:57,521
- Okay?
- I am not asking your permission, David.

339
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:00,801
I am your mother, how dare you!

340
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:07,567
You both have private lives,
and I know it.

341
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,808
- Why shouldn't I?
- You should.

342
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:14,726
Go.

343
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:18,527
Excuse me, I need her to meet
with Mrs. Swanson.

344
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,844
It's Fisher & Sons.

345
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,172
Well, this sucks.

346
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:28,171
I have to fight for a hole in the ground
at Rosemont Cemetery...

347
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,205
...or the Suarezes
won't be buried together.

348
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:35,482
They'll be on opposite sides
of the goddamn freeway.

349
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:40,287
Dave...

350
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:42,414
...listen.

351
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:47,169
Can I do anything to help?

352
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:54,127
Can you tell Adele Swanson we know
she's broke and can't afford the funeral?

353
00:26:54,337 --> 00:26:57,330
- Can you do that?
- I guess.

354
00:26:58,738 --> 00:27:00,012
Yes.

355
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:04,495
The Swansons are con artists.
They ran a franchise pyramid scheme.

356
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,054
They have no money,
and they're not gonna con us too.

357
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,697
I made some notes, in case
you're not familiar with credit reports.

358
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,973
You know, I work with vendors,
big ones, national ones.

359
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,775
I'm not a idiot. I can do this.

360
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:24,213
Thank you.

361
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,854
Shit.

362
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,335
What?

363
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:48,697
Do you have to be anywhere tonight?

364
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,936
Not really.

365
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:05,941
The other Mr. Fisher recommended
the $9000 coffin. I didn't ask for it.

366
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,788
I think cremation is much more dignified.

367
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:12,187
And it's within range,
given the financial situation.

368
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,705
Chandler created Beauty Vision.

369
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,506
We have franchises in 13 states
and the nation of Uruguay.

370
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,868
How much did you know
about your husband?

371
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,020
Because he's been running up
bad debts for some time.

372
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:26,109
We were always moving.
I thought it was...

373
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:28,223
...because he was making
so much money.

374
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:32,221
Each place was nicer than the last.

375
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:36,428
Former partners are suing him.

376
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:39,273
He had several credit cards maxed out...

377
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:42,785
...run-ins with the IRS,
dating to 1996...

378
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:47,307
...and Yale University would like him
to quit telling people he went there.

379
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,235
This can't be happening.

380
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:54,635
I have a baby.
I can't go back to waitressing.

381
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,034
And now you're telling me
that we can't even afford a coffin?

382
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,310
What will people think?

383
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:06,197
Mrs. Swanson, I'm sitting here thinking,
"Why don't you rent it?"

384
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,197
- How much would that be?
- How much do you have?

385
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,590
I don't know. My ATM card's
not working.

386
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,358
We'll work something out.

387
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,909
And afterwards, we'll give you
his ashes in an urn.

388
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:40,563
- You really loved him, didn't you?
- Yes.

389
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:44,044
Okay, it's okay.

390
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,519
It's all right. Let it out.

391
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:00,285
I think it's good
you told your boys about me.

392
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,764
Are you kidding? It was insane.

393
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,005
I certainly didn't choose to do it.
It just happened.

394
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,766
It was brave.

395
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:11,563
It was guilt.

396
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,769
I loved my husband.

397
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,525
I know you did.

398
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:27,925
Hiram, when I think of us now...

399
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:33,889
...I feel like I'm watching the whole thing
on some sex channel on cable TV.

400
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,292
- Is that right?
- Yes.

401
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:42,968
And that my husband
might be watching it too.

402
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:46,368
I want some changes made,
I'll tell you that.

403
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:50,005
I'm not answering dead calls
all night long anymore.

404
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,934
Let them hire somebody...

405
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,696
...or sell the business or whatever.

406
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:00,691
I wanna take you somewhere,
away from all this.

407
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,808
- No.
- They're adults.

408
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:06,414
They can take care of themselves.

409
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:10,290
I have two plane tickets to Costa Rica
a week from Monday.

410
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:13,133
Separate rooms.

411
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,374
I was 19 when I got married.

412
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,615
I've never been on my own.

413
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,811
I wouldn't even know how.

414
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,094
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:36,299
You're a very kind person,
and you've been good to me.

416
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,017
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,693
Goodbye.

418
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:09,703
Good choice of music.

419
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:15,302
It's from his car.
It's the last CD he ever heard.

420
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:22,907
Adele Swanson, your husband
owes me $45,000.

421
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,463
He kept it all from her.

422
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,986
She's broke with a baby.
You'll leave her alone.

423
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:29,187
- Who the fuck are you?!
- I own this place.

424
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:33,385
- Get out before I call the cops.
- You people suck.

425
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:38,908
- What was that?
- Some freak Swanson owed money to.

426
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,269
Nate, I notice Mr. Swanson
is in the Titan casket.

427
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:50,272
Yeah, but she's giving it back.
I made the deal for cremation.

428
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:53,308
They can't give it back.
By law, it has to be burned with him.

429
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:56,154
You just cost us $9000,
you fucking moron.

430
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:57,947
What?

431
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:00,828
How was I supposed to know that?

432
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:10,749
- I'm so sorry about your father.
- Jennifer.

433
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,869
I was in Boca Raton.
My mom had to have her hip replaced.

434
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,907
- Oh, dear, how is she?
- She's better, thanks.

435
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,874
So I didn't find out
about Mr. Fisher till yesterday.

436
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,152
I'm just heartbroken about it.
I'll miss him.

437
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,239
Well, he adored you.

438
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:40,676
Oh, David, I won't be answering
the phones anymore.

439
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,794
Okay.

440
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:59,244
Now every part of your body
has a new meaning to me.

441
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:04,355
- We should go.
- Like your nose.

442
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:08,355
- Come on.
- And your little hands.

443
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,478
Hands I get.

444
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:15,478
- And your toes.
- It's ticklish.

445
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:19,681
Here, try these.
You can play with mine.

446
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,518
- You're right. Now I don't feel anything.
- See, it's perfect.

447
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,079
Would you...?

448
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:34,681
- No, I'm embarrassed.
- What?

449
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:42,366
Would you rub it?

450
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,771
Okay.

451
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:50,651
You're making my toe hard.

452
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,972
- Do you want to kiss it?
- Your toe? No.

453
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:01,252
Come on, I'll do something for you.
Anything.

454
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:09,532
Aren't you forgetting something?

455
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:12,646
Please.

456
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,648
You filthy, dead fuck.

457
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:39,060
Hey, Nate. Keith.
I met you at your dad's viewing.

458
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,696
Oh, yeah, David's racquetball partner.

459
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:44,982
Is David inside?

460
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,902
No, he went out for dinner
with his ex-fianc'ee.

461
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:51,891
She missed Dad's funeral,
and they were pretty close, so...

462
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:55,574
- That's cool, I understand completely.
- I have his number if you wanna call.

463
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:58,776
I already gave it a shot.
He didn't answer.

464
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:01,624
Hey, is David any good...

465
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,180
...at racquetball?
We used to play in high school...

466
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,456
...and he was pathetic,
running into walls...

467
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,022
Yeah, I think you'd be pretty surprised
just how good he's gotten.

468
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:14,379
- Well, I'll tell him you came by.
- Thanks.

469
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:28,103
Dear God.

470
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,100
I need to get his watch.
I need to sell it for the money.

471
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:47,146
- My life is over.
- This is a hard time, the hardest.

472
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:53,189
It was all a lie! He left us with nothing,
because there never was anything.

473
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,744
Bastard.

474
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:21,709
I almost died when I saw our
engagement pictures still on your mantle.

475
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:27,555
Why? My family loved you,
my father especially.

476
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,954
He loved you.

477
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,719
Yeah, he had a funny way of showing it.

478
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,028
I'm drunk.

479
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,596
Then I can ask.

480
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,116
Are you happy?

481
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,436
I'm still me.

482
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,842
Your father knew.

483
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,081
We had coffee once, and he told me...

484
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:59,162
...he understood why we
couldn't be together.

485
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:02,677
He said you spent so much time
trying to make people happy...

486
00:38:02,884 --> 00:38:05,524
...you never thought about yourself.

487
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,193
He worried about that.

488
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:15,882
So do you have anyone now?

489
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,637
Can you tell me about him?

490
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:25,682
You're wrong about my father.
You didn't know him at all, nobody did.

491
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:36,247
Let's get a room at the Haverford Inn
and fuck our brains out. How about it?

492
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,680
Jesus, David.

493
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,888
Hi. I got your message.
Sorry I didn't call you back.

494
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:54,890
I had to go out to County Hospital.

495
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:58,563
The body's still in Long Beach.
The autopsy's not even finished yet.

496
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,128
It's unbelievable.

497
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,802
How was the meeting?

498
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,130
Everyone asked about you.

499
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,724
- They wanna meet you.
- I wanna meet them.

500
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:16,205
I'm a little drunk. You might have
to undress me.

501
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:17,974
Okay.

502
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,494
Right after you stop lying to me.

503
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:29,344
- Brenda?
- Yes, Nate.

504
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:34,861
- Why is my name tattooed on your ass?
- It's not your name.

505
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:38,302
Yes, it is.

506
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:42,059
You're not the only
person named that.

507
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:54,140
Nate, it's a coincidence.
It's not you or anyone you know.

508
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,866
Come on. What, you think
I'm so enamored with you...

509
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:02,029
...I had your name
burned into my flesh?

510
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:04,993
Then how come I never saw it before?

511
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:08,027
We've had sex twice.

512
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:11,146
Once with our clothes on
and once in the dark...

513
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:12,907
...after three martinis apiece.

514
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:17,552
You obviously liked some guy enough
to have his name burned into your flesh.

515
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:23,310
I would have done
a lot more than that for him.

516
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:09,478
It's about time, you fucking moron.

517
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,960
- What are you doing in there?
- Help me out, you fucking moron.

518
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:16,273
- Why can't you just climb out?
- I think we both know...

519
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,919
...the answer to that, you fucking moron.

520
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,762
You really should do
something about this.

521
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,562
It's really deep.

522
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,561
It might as well be bleeding.

523
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:47,006
- Could you be a little more dramatic?
- Oh, I could be a lot more dramatic.

524
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,804
What are you doing today?

525
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:56,727
Dave and I have to go get the registration
out of the wrecked hearse.

526
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:59,440
Insurance won't replace without it.

527
00:42:59,652 --> 00:43:01,643
What time?

528
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:06,689
- 2:30, I think.
- Take your cell phone.

529
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:10,249
- Okay.
- Promise me you will.

530
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:13,565
All right.

531
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,126
Oh, I don't feel like carbs this morning.

532
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:27,732
Do we have any more
Stevie Nicks raspberries?

533
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:29,574
Claire.

534
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:36,215
- Do you have an eating disorder?
- What? No, Mom. I wish, but...

535
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:53,089
- Are you being helped?
- Yeah, my pop's here. Suarez.

536
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,892
Of course.

537
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,856
That's the Titan Series.
It's quite beautiful.

538
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:02,169
- Give me a number.
- Nine thousand.

539
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:04,499
You guys ought to get your act together.

540
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:07,091
Your brother said
that this was on special, 4500.

541
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:10,375
And then he came down to 4000,
so why don't we start there?

542
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:17,938
That's not legal, reselling a coffin.
There are fluids that seep.

543
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:22,104
- Okay? And Mr. Swanson, he seeped.
- What did you tell Mr. Suarez?

544
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:24,540
He wants a quality coffin.
We happen to have one.

545
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,465
I don't agree with this at all.
It's against my beliefs.

546
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,543
- Thank you, Federico.
- And it's unsanitary.

547
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:32,581
They're dead. What disease
can they possibly catch?

548
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:35,585
It's too late, Nate.
It's a $9000 retail item...

549
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:39,018
...our cost is 3200. We eat that,
and plus we lose the profit.

550
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:42,777
Wait, there's a $6000 markup?

551
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:50,583
Mr. Suarez, we cannot
let you have that casket.

552
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,224
- Sorry to hear that.
- We can't legally sell it...

553
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,149
...because very briefly,
it was occupied by another person.

554
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,784
- 3500.
- Sold!

555
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,063
- Absolutely not.
- David, don't be a fucking moron.

556
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:05,584
Fellas, let's split the difference because
I gotta get a haircut before the service.

557
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:10,144
- My brother has no authorization...
- Mr. Suarez, it's a $9000 product.

558
00:45:10,352 --> 00:45:12,423
It's used one night.
You're getting it at cost.

559
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:15,705
Would you stipulate that you
understand the condition of the coffin?

560
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,265
Sure, whatever.
May I make a suggestion?

561
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:23,866
You've closed, okay? Don't overclose.
It kills the word of mouth.

562
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:54,949
Is that the best they could come up with?
"Father, husband, caregiver"?

563
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,312
How would you prefer?
"Introvert, sadist, mind-fucker"?

564
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,800
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher. Matt Gilardi
of Kroehner Service International.

565
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:08,677
I understand you're now
part-owner of the business.

566
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:14,039
You are aware we've made a very rich
buyout offer for your unit.

567
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:15,756
Okay.

568
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:18,843
- This a one-time offer.
- I don't know about that.

569
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,075
You think you can hold out?

570
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:25,240
We control suppliers now. Where are
you gonna get your chemicals?

571
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:28,243
How about your caskets and liners?
What about this Diaz kid?

572
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:32,040
I mean, this guy is a topnotch
restorative artist.

573
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:34,123
You threatening to put us
out of business?

574
00:46:34,326 --> 00:46:36,044
We look at it as a partnership.

575
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:40,365
In the death-care industry now,
it's consolidate or die.

576
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,445
Decide which, Nate, and give me a ring...

577
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:47,197
...because we will put things in motion
either way.

578
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:54,088
"We'll put things in motion either way"?
Tough guy.

579
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,598
Shut up.

580
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,601
Right in here.

581
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,085
Sign this right here.

582
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:21,725
Well, it's totaled. The insurance company
was right about that.

583
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,051
Fuck.

584
00:47:36,096 --> 00:47:38,690
There's still blood on the wheel.

585
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:55,336
- Okay, let's go.
- Jesus, don't you feel anything?

586
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,212
Yeah, I feel betrayed.

587
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,694
Hello.

588
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:11,373
Meet me at the corner of Sunset
and Gordon, Now, It's important,

589
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:13,379
- What?
- Bring your brother,

590
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:16,779
Trust me, you need to do this,

591
00:48:23,743 --> 00:48:25,780
I spoke to Gilardi.

592
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:27,258
And?

593
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:30,979
He says we sell
or they put us out of business.

594
00:48:31,264 --> 00:48:32,937
Fuck.

595
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:37,822
I think we should sell.

596
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:41,621
And erase everything this family
has meant for 50 years?

597
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:44,899
That might not be a bad thing.

598
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:57,466
- Hey.
- Brenda.

599
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:01,662
- This is my brother, Dave.
- Come on.

600
00:49:02,709 --> 00:49:05,702
Come on. Let's do this.

601
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:18,108
This is the bus.

602
00:49:18,312 --> 00:49:20,382
What bus?

603
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:22,823
The bus.

604
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:28,592
Brenda, this isn't funny.

605
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:32,912
This is fucked up. What gives you
the right to do something like this?

606
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:46,795
He's...

607
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:52,027
I never...

608
00:50:49,015 --> 00:51:01,970
