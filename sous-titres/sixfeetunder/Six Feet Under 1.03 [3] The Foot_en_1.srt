1
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,991
Okay, this here's the dough mixer.

2
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,071
You gotta get in there, really scrub it...

3
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,742
...hose it down every night.

4
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:52,709
Keep the bugs out.

5
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:56,552
Because someone found a roach in
a loaf of wheat once and sued.

6
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:01,832
- Can't you just spray it with Raid?
- Then you got poison in bread, kill 100.

7
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:03,469
Is that good?

8
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,032
Oh, Jesus.

9
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,750
I gotta get to my chiropractor.

10
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,834
Hey.

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,389
Think anyone's
ever had sex in here?

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,399
Now, why the fuck would
you even think that?

13
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:44,512
Romano?

14
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,594
Romano?

15
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:58,114
Romano, are you okay?

16
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,721
That was...

17
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,445
You made the weirdest noise back there.

18
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:35,565
If I were you, I would not
get into a weird-noise contest.

19
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,763
Oh, yeah?

20
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,449
Oh, boy.

21
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:44,086
I love this song.

22
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,011
This, really?

23
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,363
Yeah.

24
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,929
My dad had all these
old big-band records.

25
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:53,331
It always reminds me of...

26
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:56,129
I don't know, being a kid.

27
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:01,251
Still being blissfully ignorant
about what a sick joke life can be.

28
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:05,336
I would've pegged you
as more of a fan of...

29
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,767
What? Sting?

30
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,368
U2? You know, grew up in the '80s
but too straight to be into the really...

31
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,409
...hard-core punk stuff.
- Oh, yeah?

32
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,927
I suppose you were into
the hard-core punk stuff.

33
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,812
I think it was just the heroin talking.

34
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,691
Oh, man, I love that look.

35
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,449
No, I really should go.

36
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:32,459
Mom and David and I are having
some sort of family meeting...

37
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:36,940
...to discuss whether we should
sell the business to Kroehner.

38
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,656
God, I hope we will.

39
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,341
Why?

40
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:46,218
So that I can get the hell
out of here and go back to Seattle.

41
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:51,612
Why don't you come with me?

42
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,460
Why on earth would I do
something like that?

43
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,977
Because you are my woman.

44
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,061
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,302
How come my name is
branded on your ass?

46
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,625
I love that look.

47
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,863
You don't understand
how serious this is.

48
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,218
We're under siege by
a major corporation.

49
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,340
- Stop being so dramatic.
- Mom, it's a fact.

50
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,857
David, we all have problems.

51
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,060
This oat bran is stuck on here
like cement...

52
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,146
...because you didn't soak
any water in it.

53
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,784
Listen to me.
Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers...

54
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,469
...to demand money upfront.

55
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,547
Now Continental Caskets wants us
to pay...

56
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,311
...for anything we put in the show room
before we sell it.

57
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,263
That's thousands of dollars.

58
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:35,270
Your father never let these things
get to him like you do.

59
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,747
He never had to deal with
this kind of situation.

60
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,261
I'm sure things will work out.
They always do.

61
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,941
- No, they don't.
- Good morning.

62
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,506
What's going on with you?

63
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,390
Nothing.

64
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,870
You're not leaving here until you
put some food in your stomach.

65
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,274
I'm starving.

66
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,355
Are you bulimic? Is that what we're
going to have to deal with now?

67
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,518
Mom, apparently you want a child
with an eating disorder.

68
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,473
Morning.

69
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,874
How was your run?

70
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,994
I haven't gone yet. I stayed over
at Brenda's last night.

71
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:37,555
No one cares where you were.

72
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,401
Why do you have to tell people
every single thing you do?

73
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:44,676
Sorry, I forgot we're all supposed
to live under a shroud of secrecy.

74
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,839
So I think we should sell.

75
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,914
I'm not saying that just because I don't
want anything to do with this business.

76
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,564
Have you looked at their offer?
A lot of money. Stock options?

77
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,757
Do you have any idea
how arrogant you are?

78
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:05,162
You don't get to decide
what we're doing.

79
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,960
I own half, Dave.

80
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,362
You haven't spent the last
11 years working here.

81
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,558
You didn't give up
anything for this.

82
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,167
Is this really what you want...

83
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:15,518
...or are you trying
to make a dead man happy?

84
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,840
We should have this
conversation later.

85
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,839
- Why can't she be a part of this?
- Thank you.

86
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,239
Nate, this is all I know.

87
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,282
Stay and run the place for Kroehner.
Go to law school like you wanted.

88
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:35,402
Take my trust fund.
I'll take the cash.

89
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:38,084
I think Nate's right.

90
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:44,567
Who knows how long any of us has left?
We should do what makes us happy.

91
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:48,210
Fine, sell, what do I care?

92
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,402
- You mean it?
- Sure.

93
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:55,005
Let's just invalidate my entire life.

94
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,612
I'll go to Gilardi today
and tell him our decision.

95
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,374
Oh, I don't know.
I guess the one with the satin interior.

96
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:09,126
Ma, there were five with satin interior.
Let's just go with the Classic Regal.

97
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:11,932
- I liked the White Pearl.
- The Classic Regal will be fine.

98
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,537
Who cares anyway?

99
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:18,449
My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces
by a big, giant dough mixer.

100
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,695
Oh, Ma, Pop wasn't
in that many pieces.

101
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,098
Ma, he's gonna look just as you
remember him. Right?

102
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,252
It says in your brochure you have
a gifted restorative artist. Whatever.

103
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,339
Can he make sure Pop look good
enough for an open casket or not?

104
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,618
Because you know,
we'll go elsewhere.

105
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:42,782
You'll be completely satisfied
with our work. I guarantee it.

106
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:47,853
Humpty Dumpty, huh? Train tracks?

107
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:49,543
Dough mixer.

108
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,613
Can you go to St. Joseph's
to pick him up?

109
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,304
Not today.

110
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:57,144
It's my cousin Ramon's baby's
christening. I told you.

111
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:00,975
I'll give you 50 bucks extra.
A hundred.

112
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,654
I'm the godfather, David.

113
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,096
Shit. I can't go because
of Mrs. Bond's viewing...

114
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:09,185
...and Kroehner told Marty
if he does our pickups...

115
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:11,901
...he'll lose all their business.
- So send Nate.

116
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:15,896
You know, I know he hates this shit,
but he's your partner now, right?

117
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,901
- He's, like, in a lot of pieces.
- Humpty Dumpty, I know.

118
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,385
Careful, that could be his head.

119
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,627
- Jesus.
- Or his pelvis.

120
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,220
It's probably his head.

121
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,910
- What happened to Rico, he get canned?
- No, he's just busy.

122
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,784
You new over there?

123
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,062
No, I'm just a temp.

124
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:46,141
I heard old man Fisher kicked.
You know him?

125
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,184
Not really.

126
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:52,023
Hey, no offense, pal,
you might want to call your agency...

127
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,671
...and ask for a new assignment.
- I'm already on it.

128
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:05,712
Hey, Gabe. I looked for you in the quad
this morning, but I didn't see you, so...

129
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,432
Maybe you stayed home because
you were tired or something, but...

130
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:15,270
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you and...

131
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:19,916
Not in any serious way,
I was just thinking about you casually.

132
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,190
Okay. Bye.

133
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,469
I wanna kill myself.

134
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:34,995
Hey, Morticia!

135
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,120
Foot slut!

136
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,599
It's such a fucking easy decision for him.

137
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:00,798
And then Mom takes his side.
Big surprise.

138
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,485
It's like I don't even exist.

139
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,961
Like me giving up law school
meant nothing.

140
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,318
So fight. If you really want to keep
the business, don't give it away.

141
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:12,806
See, that's just it. All day long, I've
been feeling this incredible sense of...

142
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,680
Relief.

143
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:18,517
I don't know if I want to keep it.
I could do anything. I'm still young.

144
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,324
- Right?
- Are you kidding? You're still a baby.

145
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,288
What about that one?

146
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,722
That's a little Mayberry for me.

147
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,721
Something simple and clean.

148
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,365
Like the ones that hang
in a deserted truck stop...

149
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,962
...when that handsome
drifter blows into town.

150
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:41,402
Of course.

151
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,005
What about that one?

152
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,532
Not bad.

153
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,610
I could see Ava Gardner
lying beneath it...

154
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:51,044
...plotting to steal Clark Gable
from Grace Kelly.

155
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,848
People start their lives
over all the time, right?

156
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:02,251
- That guy just cruised you.
- Really?

157
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:03,651
Bitch.

158
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,892
Right in front of me,
like I'm not even here.

159
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:07,052
He did?

160
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,816
And I missed it?

161
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:10,570
Oh, sorry.

162
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:15,337
- Oh, Ruth.
- Amelia.

163
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:17,696
Another casserole.

164
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,048
Lemon bars.

165
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,815
The kids will love them.

166
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,850
Don't you have candy striping today?

167
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,931
I did, but I told them
my best friend needed me.

168
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,696
- You've made the right decision.
- I know.

169
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:37,372
I never realized how much money there
was to be made in the funeral business.

170
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:38,617
Death-care industry.

171
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:41,541
And it's only gonna grow,
with all the baby boomers and all.

172
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,776
- Gee, there will be bodies everywhere.
- Hopefully.

173
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,100
And all in final resting places
provided by Kroehner.

174
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:50,374
With a little help from Fisher & Sons.

175
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:53,542
You know, we've had our eyes
on your operation for some time.

176
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:57,977
Your father was a nice guy, but he
didn't know how to run a business.

177
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,062
Well, my dad was never
in it for the money.

178
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:04,145
I think he was more concerned about,
you know, helping people.

179
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:06,735
You wanna help people,
join the Peace Corps.

180
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,621
- Yeah.
- Greedy little Nazi fuck.

181
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:13,380
So how exactly will this work?

182
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,943
We won't change the appearance
of your unit at all.

183
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,298
Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading,
perhaps.

184
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,898
But preparation of loved ones
will now take place...

185
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:24,658
...at a centralized location,
which services several other units.

186
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,384
Technicians on staff,
constantly producing.

187
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,623
So it's like a little factory.
Of embalming.

188
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,102
Preparation for visitation.

189
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,064
- We maintain a small fleet of vehicles...
- Hearses?

190
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,944
- Funeral carriages.
- Dead wagons.

191
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,143
Removal vans.

192
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:45,627
Once you centralize operations, you'd be
amazed how you maximize profits.

193
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,589
So in the end, we're all just
human McNuggets.

194
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:53,273
Just as we began.

195
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:54,953
I like you, Nate.

196
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,430
You hear that, buddy-boy?
He likes you.

197
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,024
Wow, you are so cool.

198
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,154
Your initial payment, sir.

199
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:10,068
The rest will follow after both our
lawyers have held up the process...

200
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,074
...Iong enough to justify their fees.

201
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,395
In the meantime, we'd like to send
a facilities inspector out to...

202
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:17,873
...take a look at things
as early as next week.

203
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,715
You know, like the president.

204
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,598
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right. Later.

205
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,871
Hey.

206
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,191
What's going on?

207
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:40,191
You fucking asshole.

208
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,271
Why is my car covered with
words like "toe sucker"?

209
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:51,443
I... I don't know. L...

210
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,796
You didn't, for instance, blab to
your friends that you bagged me...

211
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,438
...and that I sucked your toes?

212
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:01,557
I might have told one person.

213
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:06,760
Andy. He just... He asked me what I did
the night before, so I told him. I mean...

214
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,236
It's not like I thought this
was gonna work out...

215
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,325
...because I know nothing
ever works out...

216
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,804
...but I guess I just wanted
to enjoy this for a little bit.

217
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:22,604
Instead, the whole world's calling me
"this little piggy lover."

218
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,008
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,563
I mean, come on. So what?

220
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,886
- So it got out. Who cares?
- Know what I wish?

221
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,165
I wish that just once people wouldn't
act like the clich'es that they are.

222
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,045
This can go to Goodwill.

223
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:43,207
And this...

224
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,642
And this one too.

225
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,094
Maybe Nathaniel's clothes
are too dull for Goodwill.

226
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:56,608
- Does Goodwill ever refuse anything?
- Ruth. If you want to cry, cry.

227
00:15:56,815 --> 00:16:01,366
- What are you talking about?
- Just let it out. That's why I'm here.

228
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,806
For the last time, I'm fine.

229
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:07,645
I just think it's very interesting. You're
supposed to be making two piles.

230
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,496
One for Goodwill
and one for memories...

231
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:13,006
...and yet you have not
held on to one thing.

232
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,254
The memory pile was your stupid idea.

233
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,449
What can I do with Nathaniel's
old clothes?

234
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:22,175
Make pillows, a quilt?
I ought to just burn them all.

235
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,378
How can someone with so little
clothing have so much clothing?

236
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,537
What is this?

237
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,329
Nothing.

238
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,496
It's stupid.

239
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,377
Something about visiting the pyramids,
taking ballet lessons?

240
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,017
I wrote down things I might
want to do now that I'm...

241
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:42,020
- I have more time.
- Well, I think that's wonderful.

242
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,532
No, it's not.

243
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:48,452
It's stupid. I don't even want to do
any of these things.

244
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:50,541
I just did it because
some book told me to.

245
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:53,133
- What am I, gonna be in Swan Lake?
- Why not?

246
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,382
You see stories like that on the news
all the time. It's inspiring.

247
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:00,055
It's depressing. It seems so desperate.

248
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,142
Maybe it's a little desperate.

249
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:06,418
Besides, who knows?

250
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:10,576
It's always possible
you might meet a man.

251
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:14,177
That part of my life is over.

252
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:18,906
You're supposed to flip this mattress
every two months.

253
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:22,142
I do mine every 14 weeks.

254
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:26,582
Well, I can't remember ever flipping this.
It's probably been 20 years.

255
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,109
Come on, get up.

256
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,946
You haven't finished going
through Nathaniel's clothes.

257
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,347
Ruth.

258
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,060
Ruth, how can I help you?

259
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:42,264
You can lift this up with me.

260
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,109
An uncovered mattress is so sad.

261
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,986
Help me turn this over!

262
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:51,870
All right.

263
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,665
Okay.

264
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,386
All right.

265
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,225
Does it feel any different?

266
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,268
No.

267
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,876
Save our park!

268
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,118
Save our park!
Save our park!

269
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,359
Save our park!
Save our park!

270
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,474
No more money for politicians!
Money for parks!

271
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,478
Save our park!
Save our park!

272
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:04,040
What are you doing?

273
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:07,682
You have a gift.
You can help people.

274
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,036
Fine.

275
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,842
Go back to peddling soy milk
and nailing waitresses.

276
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,925
What do I care? I'm dead.

277
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,243
Move it, asshole!

278
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:28,084
Save our park!
Save our park!

279
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,803
So now you don't want to sell.

280
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,005
- I know it sounds crazy.
- No, not at all.

281
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,726
We'll keep the business for the rest of
the day, then sell it again tomorrow.

282
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,603
- Hear me out.
- This is a good system.

283
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,201
We'll sell in the mornings,
keep it in the afternoons.

284
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:44,563
Sometimes, we sell again in the evenings
when we can't make a decision.

285
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:46,570
David, you're not being fair.

286
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:49,128
When I didn't want to sell,
you could've cared less.

287
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,686
When Nate doesn't, you listen.

288
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:55,649
Okay, I'm a terrible mother, who's
responsible for all your problems. Happy?

289
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:01,366
So you had some revelation, and
now you wanna be a funeral director?

290
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,329
- How long is that going to last?
- He does have a point, Nate.

291
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:07,688
- You don't always stick with things.
- You can't be in the same room...

292
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:08,851
...with a dead body.

293
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:12,095
I know, but there's a reason for that.

294
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:15,656
This is what I'm supposed to do.

295
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,452
Which is why I've spent so much time
running away from it.

296
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,695
My whole life, I've been a tourist.

297
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,052
Now I have the chance to do some
good instead of just sucking up air.

298
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:39,138
I know it's a lot to ask of you, I know,
but I just really think that we can do this.

299
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:41,697
You and me, together.

300
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,059
Brothers.

301
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,333
Like we used to be.

302
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,222
We could still sell to Kroehner
and both manage Fisher & Sons.

303
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:55,654
Yeah, but then we're just
spokesmodels...

304
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:58,538
...working to make fat Republican
stockholders richer.

305
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,054
Kroehner doesn't give a shit
about people. We care.

306
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:05,100
- We can help them through their grief.
- This is a business, Nate, not a charity.

307
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,695
Of course it's a business, but...

308
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:09,898
...it's more than that, and you know it.

309
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,062
Okay.

310
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:19,496
Great.

311
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:22,907
I'll call Gilardi and tell him
he can kiss our collective ass.

312
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:24,383
Language.

313
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:28,388
Maybe Dad knew what he was doing.

314
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,107
You did not have to waste this stuff
on me.

315
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,302
Oh, please. My parents got a case of it...

316
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:43,744
...from some TV movie they
were technical advisors on.

317
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,103
Some serial-killer thing for cable.

318
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:49,385
Oh, they're such whores.
They'll do anything.

319
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:50,867
Gosh.

320
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:54,032
Can you believe this
stuff is expensive?

321
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:59,271
You know, I've always wanted to tell off
some corporate suit, some...

322
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,547
...greedy little
Nazi fuck, you know?

323
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,909
That's very hostile.

324
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,825
No, I was very diplomatic. I just said,
"Thanks, but we changed our minds."

325
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,232
What did he do?

326
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,587
He didn't do anything.
What's he gonna do?

327
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:17,154
- This is completely unacceptable.
- The Baxters changed their mind.

328
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:21,397
- They're going with the Unger Mortuary.
- Was there a reason?

329
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,229
They probably just underbid you.

330
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,111
Hal Unger never underbid anybody.

331
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,312
He moved to Florida. They were
bought out by Kroehner months ago.

332
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,397
Sign here.

333
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,079
You know...

334
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:40,355
...I didn't just decide to stay in
Los Angeles because of the business.

335
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,554
- I had another reason.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this.

336
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,438
- I've got such a nice buzz going.
- It was you.

337
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:49,518
Nate, get serious.

338
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:51,760
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

339
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:54,842
You're staying here because
you found something you want to do.

340
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:59,914
I am the extra bonus
that probably won't work out.

341
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,435
Sometimes your honesty
gets really tiresome.

342
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:07,514
- I don't want any children.
- Who said anything about children?

343
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,877
I was referring to you.

344
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,362
I got something for you.

345
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:25,880
Open it.

346
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,041
Glenn Miller Orchestra
at the Hollywood Palladium.

347
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,049
Brenda, this is so cool.
I've never been to the Palladium.

348
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:38,607
You grew up in L.A., and you've never
been to the Palladium? Pathetic.

349
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,766
These are for three weeks from now.

350
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,248
How'd you know
I wouldn't be in Seattle?

351
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,409
I didn't.

352
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,574
Morning, Rico.

353
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,102
Just what I need, another boss
breathing down my neck.

354
00:24:41,302 --> 00:24:43,133
Put me to work.

355
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:48,699
Hello?

356
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:06,896
Pregnancy's kicked Vanessa's hormones
into overload. I gotta talk her down.

357
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:10,497
If you wanna help, take Mr. Romano
out of the bag and put him on the table.

358
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:14,063
Remember, breathe through
your mouth, man. He's pretty ripe.

359
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:42,827
Oh, Christ.

360
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,029
- Nate.
- Great, look what you made me do.

361
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,873
Oh, gross.

362
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:58,993
I want to talk to you
about something.

363
00:25:59,195 --> 00:26:04,953
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
a little busy swimming in a man's guts.

364
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,474
I don't know what this is.

365
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:14,228
I'm picking up a part of a person,
and I don't even know what part it is!

366
00:26:14,437 --> 00:26:17,714
Fine, I'll talk to you later.

367
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:18,873
Oh, God.

368
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,878
Sorry.

369
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,273
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:44,280
I work here now.
I have to be a part of things.

371
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:47,316
Let Rico take care of him.

372
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:52,358
I have a job for you that's much better
suited to your particular talents.

373
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:08,598
Morning, Nate.
Lovely day, isn't it?

374
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:10,957
I've seen better.

375
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:14,603
I only wanted to say hello,
seeing that I'm your new neighbor.

376
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,884
We just bought that house
across the street.

377
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:23,480
Got it for a song too.

378
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:28,240
Oh, and by the way, we're planning to
put you out of business in six months.

379
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:31,329
They're opening a Poseidon Society
across the street?

380
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,327
That's right.

381
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,761
What is a Poseidon Society?

382
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:39,680
They sell cremations, cheap cremations.
Now, for a fraction of what we charge...

383
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,690
...you can dump off the relative
you never really liked...

384
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:45,406
...at the Torch Mart across the street.

385
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,525
I guess we have to just
continue to do our best.

386
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,291
And how exactly do we do that?

387
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:53,769
You know Lou the florist,
that sweet old guy?

388
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:56,727
He just upped what
he charges us by 200 percent.

389
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:59,694
And that chemical dealer
on Figueroa is now suing us...

390
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,967
...over some nonexistent
shipment of cavity fluid.

391
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:05,895
Every other supplier that we have
in common with Kroehner...

392
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,929
...suddenly developed
some problem with Fisher & Sons.

393
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,013
For some reason,
by the name of Kroehner...

394
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,811
...the Health Department
is going to inspect us next week.

395
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:16,372
Yeah, so what? Isn't everything clean?

396
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:20,731
Yes, but any inspection means
we have to update something.

397
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:24,409
If it's the ventilation system, we're sunk.

398
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:27,532
We should've sold.

399
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,891
Nate? I'm having a problem.

400
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,372
You don't happen to have
Mr. Romano's foot on you, do you?

401
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:40,011
Do you remember picking up the foot?

402
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:44,374
I think so, but my eyes were shut,
and I was trying not to vomit.

403
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:46,971
I'm not happy.

404
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:51,335
Well, that's very interesting, David,
because I'm ecstatic.

405
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:55,454
Maybe the morgue
never gave us that foot.

406
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:58,380
Both feet are listed
in the paperwork, Nate.

407
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:01,736
Just think, Nate. Is there
any other point you could've lost it?

408
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:03,936
- Lost what?
- Nothing.

409
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:07,695
If you lost something, look under the
bed. That's where things always turn up.

410
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:11,057
- I doubt that applies in this case.
- That's what people always say...

411
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,906
...then they find what they're
looking for under the bed.

412
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:17,623
- Mom, we're really busy down here.
- The upstairs machine is broken.

413
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:19,307
I called the repairman but...

414
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,386
Oh, my God, what is this?

415
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:29,418
Someone left a Kleenex in their pocket,
and now it's all over everything.

416
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,658
It's disgusting.

417
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,461
Nate, retrace your steps.

418
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:41,789
Is there any other point
you could've lost the foot?

419
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:45,669
I almost dropped him at the morgue,
but the bag didn't open.

420
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,866
I tripped on the stairs,
but nothing fell out.

421
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:52,508
Banged into the freezer.
Spilled him onto the floor...

422
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:56,423
- And I picked him up from off the floor.
- It should be here.

423
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:01,109
I'd say it's an $8 million lawsuit.

424
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:03,711
At least.

425
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:16,037
- Here she comes.
- Like my new shoes? They're size 12.

426
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:17,306
Toe slut.

427
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,638
Amelia?

428
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:09,485
It's me, Ruth.

429
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:13,316
Your best friend needs help.

430
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:29,281
Is he all put together?

431
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:33,279
- Oh, he's 100 percent there.
- Absolutely.

432
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,719
I'd like to see him.

433
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:41,370
I'm sorry, our embalmer
is a little on the artistic side.

434
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:44,245
He gets crazy if he has any input.

435
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,602
It's best to wait until
we're completely done.

436
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,603
One more thing.

437
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:51,166
His shoes.

438
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,853
- What are you, an idiot?
- Those are his favorite shoes.

439
00:31:56,054 --> 00:31:59,729
He has perfectly comfortable loafers,
which would be much more appropriate.

440
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:04,850
Yes, I myself have loafers
which are just like walking on air.

441
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:07,694
We should've just
told her the truth.

442
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:12,535
"Sorry, Mrs. Romano, but my idiot
of a brother lost a part of your husband."

443
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,693
Yeah, that would've worked.

444
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:16,091
Where are you going?

445
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,776
I have someplace I have to be.

446
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,776
When I return, I hope to
be greeted by a foot...

447
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:23,936
...a solution as to how to stop
a billion-dollar corporation...

448
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:28,291
...from putting us out of business
and pruned hedges.

449
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,090
- Aren't you glad you're out of the house?
- Yes, this is just what I needed.

450
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:38,417
We should try and get a seat
right in front.

451
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:42,296
- I'm placing a bet.
- We should just try and enjoy the day.

452
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,892
I don't see why we need to gamble.

453
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:49,897
That's sweet.

454
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:53,373
You both look so happy.

455
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,575
It's just an act.

456
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:59,860
Just enjoy it while it lasts,
which isn't very long.

457
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:01,454
Excuse me?

458
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:04,577
You think you have forever,
but you don't.

459
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,936
Soon you start to get on each
other's nerves...

460
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,699
...then you don't tell the other person
as much as you used to.

461
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,467
What's the point?
You thought they understood you.

462
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,464
- But they never did, not really.
- Ruth.

463
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,181
Finally, not only do you not
tell him anything real...

464
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:19,980
...you actively start lying to him.

465
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,781
Then when you think it can't get
any worse, he up and dies.

466
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:30,222
- I think I see a shorter line over there.
- Bye.

467
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,066
No matter what you do,
you end up alone!

468
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,864
Not knowing who you are
or what you really want!

469
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,030
Ruth, Ruth, why did we
come here today?

470
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:43,982
To have fun. Aren't you having fun?

471
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,387
I think it's wobbling.

472
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:52,381
It just looks like it's wobbling because
you've been staring at it for so long.

473
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,664
It's definitely wobbling.

474
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,626
You're hallucinating.

475
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,789
Life is strange.

476
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,873
If one of those tiny screws
isn't screwed on tight enough...

477
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:04,067
...that thing could fall
and kill us instantaneously.

478
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,870
Just chop us to bits like a Cuisinart.

479
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:12,307
And an assassin with a semiautomatic
could walk through the door...

480
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:16,066
...and spray our brains all over the place.

481
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:21,636
The sun could become a supernova
and engulf the entire planet in flames.

482
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,715
David Fisher.

483
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,638
We just got a call from Claire's school.
She's in trouble.

484
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,232
- Can't Mom handle this?
- She's MIA.

485
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,513
And besides, I think you might be
interested in what they told me.

486
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,520
What? Start from the beginning.

487
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:46,557
Jesus.

488
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:51,201
Okay, I'll be right there.
Until then, tell Nate to...

489
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:53,837
Oh, great, he's MIA too?

490
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:56,399
All right, bye.

491
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:02,080
There's a rumor going around school
that my sister put a dismembered foot...

492
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:05,834
...into some boy's locker.
- Shut the fuck up.

493
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:24,404
She did it. I know she did.

494
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,361
Where's the foot now?

495
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,480
I don't know.
The student who found it...

496
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:32,443
...denies that it ever happened.
- Okay, where's your sister?

497
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,118
No one knows.
A police report has been filed...

498
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,879
...and now Mom is supposed to meet
with the principal.

499
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:40,559
I don't understand kids.

500
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,127
When I was her age, I never
would've taken a foot.

501
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:46,688
David, I can help. I'm a cop.
That's what I do for a living.

502
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:50,613
You find feet?

503
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:52,812
What the fuck am I gonna do?

504
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,605
Tell me who lived here again.

505
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:58,493
The Fritzens.

506
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:02,168
I have totally fucked things up.
Kept us from selling.

507
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,924
Now we're gonna go under, and it's
because of me. I'm a fucking moron.

508
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:08,092
You used to hang out over here?

509
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:12,847
Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play in here
after school. Both her parents worked.

510
00:36:13,977 --> 00:36:17,572
Brenda, this is serious.
My entire family could go bankrupt.

511
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:22,768
So swallow your pride,
go back to the corporation and sell.

512
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:28,209
They'll cut their offer in half now,
knowing we're so quick to buckle under.

513
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,412
Plus, I really don't wanna let
that greedy little Nazi win.

514
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,418
Oh, so this is a pissing contest?

515
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:43,860
Nate, I'm going to kiss you!

516
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:49,934
I lost someone's foot today.

517
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,295
Sorry.

518
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:59,822
I really thought I had, like, this...

519
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:02,858
...profound revelation.

520
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:07,295
Fuck, if this isn't what I'm supposed
to be doing with my life, then what is?

521
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:10,976
Living it.
And you're doing that, so relax.

522
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:13,656
You don't give a fuck about
what I'm going through.

523
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:19,977
Sure. As much as I can, given we've
known each other less than a month.

524
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:29,179
There's no big investment. I mean, that's
part of the appeal for both of us.

525
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:32,821
Right?

526
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,027
Right?

527
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:54,352
Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me
in this room. I wouldn't let her.

528
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:58,946
- You can't control things. Nobody can.
- Shut up.

529
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,543
There's only one thing that's certain.

530
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:08,112
- Everything changes.
- Shut. Up.

531
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,033
I already talked to the cops.

532
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,708
I don't understand why
I have to go through this again.

533
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,388
- Because this time I want the truth.
- Man...

534
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,274
A witness already said she saw you
running down the hall...

535
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:42,518
...screaming the crazy funeral-home
girl put a foot in your locker.

536
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,440
It was a joke. It was just a joke.

537
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,156
She's kind of a loser,
and we all pick on her.

538
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:51,117
- She totally asks for it.
- Modern technology is really something.

539
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:55,116
- I don't care, man.
- You should.

540
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:58,873
We have chemicals we put on your hands
to see if you've touched human remains.

541
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:00,995
No way.

542
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,719
You want to tell me
what really happened today?

543
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,677
L...

544
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:10,598
Who's that?

545
00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:13,998
That's my partner.

546
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:16,562
You better be glad you don't have to
mess with him.

547
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,235
That guy's into some crazy-ass shit.

548
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:22,485
Now, either you can tell me
where you put the foot...

549
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:25,998
...or you're gonna be dealing with
that crazy-ass motherfucker.

550
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:48,601
Big Shirley by a nose!

551
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,686
She won!

552
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:58,367
Oh, God, I just can't believe it.
I won $ 16.

553
00:39:58,574 --> 00:39:59,893
I told you this would be fun.

554
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:03,292
- How much did you win?
- I don't know.

555
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:05,884
- Four thousand.
- Four thousand what?

556
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:08,291
Dollars.

557
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:22,690
And by the way, I had an affair
with a hairdresser last year.

558
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:27,689
- You did?
- Yep.

559
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:42,739
Are you a cup?
How many cups are you?

560
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,093
I'm a loaf of bread.

561
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,900
Hello?

562
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:51,617
Okay. Talk slowly.

563
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,982
I'm gonna see you in a few hours.

564
00:40:58,184 --> 00:41:01,494
Slow down. Slower.

565
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,696
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

566
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:07,454
- Because you have to.
- Brenda.

567
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,144
Just stay there.
I'll call you in a half-hour.

568
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,859
- Promise?
- I promise.

569
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:19,826
- Who was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

570
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:24,060
- I gotta go.
- Brenda, who was it?

571
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:28,707
Just someone else, okay?
Just back off.

572
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:33,267
I can't deal with this right now.
I'll call you.

573
00:41:40,271 --> 00:41:43,581
I'm glad you're staying in town.

574
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:55,272
- He threw it out of his car?
- He was taking it to show some friends.

575
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,511
Then it hit him,
he might get in trouble.

576
00:41:57,714 --> 00:42:00,706
What with people not supposed to
be in possession of others' feet.

577
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:03,349
- He tossed it out.
- I've gotta get home.

578
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,750
Just drop me off, and I'll
pick up my car later.

579
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:08,834
All right, I'll take a look
where he said he tossed it.

580
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:12,995
- You don't have to do that.
- Hey, how can I sleep?

581
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:15,267
Knowing that there's
a foot on the loose?

582
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:20,153
- You lost $25,000? It's just gone?
- I suppose it still exists.

583
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:22,474
It's just not mine anymore.

584
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,034
- I'm waiting for an explanation.
- Don't talk to me like a child.

585
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,433
I was on a...

586
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,357
What do you call it? A roll.

587
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,597
So I kept betting more and more,
and I just felt so good...

588
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,713
...like I was living someone else's life.
I was up $9000!

589
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,196
And then I started to lose.

590
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:44,792
And then I started to feel like me again,
and so I kept betting more and more...

591
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:47,835
...and losing more and more.
- You should've been more careful.

592
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,160
I don't want to be careful.
I want to feel alive.

593
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,355
There should be a way to do that
that's a little less expensive.

594
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:57,118
I have a right to make mistakes, Nate!

595
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,713
You of all people shouldn't
begrudge me that.

596
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:06,999
What?

597
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:14,677
I lost $25,000. Okay, you got it
out of me. Now leave me alone!

598
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,166
Hey.

599
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,042
Claire?

600
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:44,121
- You're David's friend.
- Keith.

601
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:47,725
What's going on?

602
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:53,162
Not much.

603
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,652
So where's Claire now?

604
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:05,413
I gotta say I'm totally relieved.
That I didn't lose it.

605
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:08,251
Hey.

606
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:17,017
Nice job, Rico.

607
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:21,173
- Thank you.
- Boy, they did do a marvelous job.

608
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:24,327
They ought to, they charged a fortune.

609
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,889
Can I assist you, Miss Romano?

610
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,453
I know it's silly...

611
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,734
...but I just wanted to see with my own
eyes that Pop's all put together right.

612
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,977
We get to do that, don't we?

613
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,942
Okay. Good.

614
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:06,824
I think I'll be able
to sleep much better now.

615
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:21,540
- Rico, you gave him a foot?
- Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,625
I thought it was for the best.

617
00:45:23,828 --> 00:45:26,023
Remember that leg of lamb
that your mother had...

618
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:28,743
...in the back of her freezer for forever?
- Okay, stop.

619
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:31,747
Embalmed, wrapped in latex
and duct tape.

620
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:36,543
I was following him home
to get it back when I saw him toss it.

621
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,218
Now I've been here for
hours, and I can't find it.

622
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,423
- Describe it to me again.
- It's a foot.

623
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,225
Why did you take it in the first place?

624
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,902
Well, at the time, it seemed like a good
way to pay him back for something.

625
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,467
I just wanted to shake him up.

626
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:55,382
I don't understand how guys
can be so unshakable.

627
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,229
I know what you mean.

628
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:02,827
Did you ever suck a guy's toe?

629
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:08,271
Yeah.

630
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:12,106
Me too.

631
00:46:15,116 --> 00:46:18,473
Have you been
watching Mrs. Romano?

632
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,755
Yeah.

633
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:23,233
Been watching her all night.

634
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:25,269
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

635
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:28,232
Casket climber.

636
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,631
Her? She doesn't look that energetic.

637
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:35,595
Yeah. Those are the ones
that really go for it.

638
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,669
So we should probably have
a conversation with Rico...

639
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,031
...about what's going on with Kroehner.

640
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:45,557
Okay.

641
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,751
So there was no baby christening
the other day. I lied.

642
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:52,833
But I only took one
meeting with Gilardi.

643
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:57,195
- You met with him? Why?
- Hey, Gilardi called me, okay?

644
00:46:57,403 --> 00:46:59,713
I have the right to consider my options.

645
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:02,279
My father put you
through mortuary school.

646
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:09,323
- I wanna go with you!
- Mrs. Romano! Mrs. Romano!

647
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:10,595
- It's okay.
- Mommy!

648
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:13,559
Grab her legs! It's okay.
It's okay. Here we go.

649
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:15,518
- Here we go, Mrs. Romano.
- I'm sorry.

650
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,243
I give up.

651
00:47:26,088 --> 00:47:28,444
It's not here.

652
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:33,802
This probably isn't over.

653
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:41,201
If there's a lesson to be learned, it's
that your actions have consequences.

654
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,209
Yeah, well, Gabe should learn that.

655
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:52,003
I know you and my brother are,
like...

656
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:54,365
...gay.

657
00:47:57,053 --> 00:47:59,090
Okay.

658
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:04,452
What do you see in him?

659
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:11,293
- He's just David, you know?
- I know. That's why I'm asking.

660
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:16,615
He is smart. He's kind. He's funny.

661
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:21,926
I know he can be a little uptight,
but underneath that, he's...

662
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,493
...such a little boy. Innocent.

663
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:28,734
And I like that.

664
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:33,416
Most of the men I meet, well...

665
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,975
...they kind of just want me
to be one thing.

666
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,490
What, like, big, black sex cop?

667
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,091
"Sorry I was speeding, officer, I guess
you'll have to punish me now."

668
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:43,700
Yeah.

669
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:48,498
And I don't want to be that.
Rent a video.

670
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:50,300
David...

671
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:52,973
...he gets me.

672
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:58,659
When someone sees you as you
really are and wants to be with you...

673
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:01,538
...that's powerful.

674
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,180
Whatever.

675
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:13,063
I wish I could know
the David you know.

676
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,260
You could be a little nicer to him.

677
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:18,458
He's under a lot of stress...

678
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,306
...with that cremation place
opening across the street.

679
00:49:22,107 --> 00:49:25,225
What cremation place?

680
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,544
She stole a foot?

681
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:29,341
From a person?

682
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:33,098
Yes. Would it have been better
if it was an animal's?

683
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:34,378
A little bit.

684
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:38,026
You wake up one day
and your baby's stolen a foot.

685
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,780
- Where have I been?
- Losing $25,000.

686
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:47,623
Hey.

687
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,947
Okay, I've had a long day.

688
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:59,750
Oh, David, I ran into your friend Keith.

689
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:03,510
- Who's Keith?
- You met at Dad's thing.

690
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:07,344
- I never met a Keith.
- Yes, you did, the cop.

691
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,273
I asked him to help out.

692
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:12,468
He'll see what he can do
about there not being an official report.

693
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,190
Why does this person have to be
so involved in our life?

694
00:50:15,396 --> 00:50:18,787
Claire, we should probably talk about
getting you some help.

695
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:21,548
You are not my father.

696
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:25,948
If you need a project, get a dog.

697
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:30,116
Keith says the school's probably
gonna make me see a shrink anyway.

698
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,957
Oh, dear.

699
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,195
By the way, that house
across the street?

700
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,439
It's on fire.

701
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:01,238
I guess this should solve
all your problems.

702
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,276
Freckles!

703
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:23,401
Freckles!

704
00:51:23,608 --> 00:51:25,644
Here, girl!

705
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,717
Freckles!

706
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:49,976
