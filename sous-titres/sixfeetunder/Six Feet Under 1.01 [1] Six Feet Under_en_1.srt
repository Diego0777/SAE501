1
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:41,968
Sleek, Sophisticated, Seductive,

2
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:46,170
The new Millennium Edition
Crown Royal funeral coach,

3
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:52,612
Because your loved one deserves
the very best in style and comfort,

4
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,730
- Nathaniel Fisher.
- Nathaniel?

5
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,053
It's Ruth. Did you take your
blood pressure medication today?

6
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,773
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me.

7
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,814
I took it, What do you want
me to do, OD on it?

8
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:40,378
Oh, and I just realized we don't have
any of that soy stuff Nate drinks.

9
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,732
You know, since he gave up milk.
I don't know what it's called.

10
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,332
Why not just cut some milk with tap
water? He'll never know the difference,

11
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,817
Look, if you don't want to go, I'll go.

12
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:52,252
It's not as if I don't have enough
to do already.

13
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,259
I'm kidding, I'll get some.

14
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:59,058
But it has to be after I pick up Nate
at the airport. I'm already running late.

15
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,662
Nathaniel!

16
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,581
- Are you smoking?
- Nope.

17
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,617
- Yes, you are. I heard you.
- I'm not, No, I'm not.

18
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:11,021
Look, forget you'll give yourself cancer
and die a slow and horrible death.

19
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,784
You should not be stinking up
that new hearse,

20
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:17,454
- I told you not to let him take it.
- Like I could've stopped him.

21
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,498
He's as proud of that thing as your fool
brother was of that damn motorcycle.

22
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,422
And who still has a pin in his foot?

23
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:27,904
Nathaniel, people want things
to be nice when there's a funeral.

24
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,983
They don't want their loved ones riding
in something that smells like an ashtray.

25
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:36,818
All right, look. I'm quitting right now.
I promise.

26
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,778
Okay? I'll see you tonight.

27
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:09,985
That new hearse
was a total waste of money.

28
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:12,827
There was nothing wrong
with the old one.

29
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:17,068
I think your father's having
some sort of midlife crisis.

30
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,181
It would've made more sense
to invest in repaneling the chapel...

31
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,266
...or adding coffee bars
to the slumber rooms.

32
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:25,381
Well, I'd much rather he buy himself
a fancy new hearse...

33
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,229
...than leave me for a younger woman.

34
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,342
Or a woman my age,
for that matter.

35
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,419
Or heaven forbid, a man,
like my cousin Hannah's husband did.

36
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,623
God sure has dealt that woman
some blows in this life.

37
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,383
Mom.

38
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,784
Can I do anything to help?

39
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,983
No, no, honey. I'm fine.

40
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,706
Besides, don't you
have a viewing tonight?

41
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:59,383
- You should probably be getting ready.
- Right.

42
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:13,342
So I enjoyed talking to you
about that whole shiatsu thing.

43
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,464
I really hope that pans out for you.

44
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:18,268
You should let me
work on you sometime.

45
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:22,513
Here's my cell number.
I'll be here until the 29th.

46
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,864
Here you go.

47
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:31,865
My dad was supposed
to meet me here.

48
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:35,067
- I could give you a ride.
- I'm sure he'll be here soon enough.

49
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:38,108
I wasn't talking about that kind of ride.

50
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:45,471
You've done a nice job.

51
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:50,674
- She looks so peaceful.
- Well, she is at peace now.

52
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:57,316
If there's any justice in the universe,
she's shoveling shit in hell.

53
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,913
Excuse me.

54
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:05,030
- David Fisher.
- David, it's Claire.

55
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,910
- Is Nate there yet?
- Nope.

56
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,790
I thought he was coming
so we could do,,,

57
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,193
...the forced Christmas Eve family thing.
- Well...

58
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:14,117
There are some really excellent parties
I could be going to.

59
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,354
Claire.

60
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,108
This is one of the few times
we're all together.

61
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:21,879
Don 't get all Pat Robertson on me,
I'll be there,

62
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,948
I have to drop some stuff off at a friend's
house before I head over, okay? Bye.

63
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,274
Fucking Boy Scout.

64
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,079
Attention, passengers of flight 71,,,,

65
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,554
This is kind of disgusting.

66
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,833
- Disgusting good or disgusting bad?
- Disgusting very good.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,156
I know.

68
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,478
- You are so fucking hot.
- You're so sweet.

69
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,512
I'm a sweet guy.

70
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:52,713
Shut up and fuck me.

71
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,401
Hello.

72
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,676
This is Ruth Fisher.

73
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,679
Yes, I'm his wife.

74
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:09,191
What is this about?

75
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,194
What?!

76
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,880
Excuse me.

77
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:36,283
Mom, what the hell are you...?

78
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,277
There's been an accident.

79
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:43,397
The new hearse is totaled.

80
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:46,718
Your father is dead.

81
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:52,001
Your father is dead,
and my pot roast is ruined.

82
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,719
Oh, my God.

83
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:58,604
You carry a lot of tension
around in your lower back.

84
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:02,079
Not as much as 20 minutes ago.

85
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,676
Just so you know...

86
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:11,686
...I never do this.

87
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:15,722
Oh, yeah. Me neither.

88
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:23,599
So...

89
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,720
...were you ever gonna
tell me your name?

90
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,443
Probably not.

91
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,324
Why not?

92
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,043
Because I'm a realist.

93
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,127
That's my father looking for me.

94
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,169
Hey, Dad.

95
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,364
Oh, Dave, hey. Merry Christmas.

96
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:58,406
Of course I'm okay.
Couldn't be better in fact.

97
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,929
What?

98
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:11,924
I'm so sorry, Nate. I hate
to have to be the one to tell you.

99
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:27,172
This is just speed, right?
Promise me this isn't crack.

100
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,888
I'm having Christmas Eve dinner
with my demented family.

101
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,324
It'll be weird enough
without being high on crack.

102
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:38,769
No, it's just crystal meth. It just makes
everything burn a little bit brighter.

103
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:43,449
And it makes sex, like, totally primal.

104
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:48,494
Here. It's all right.

105
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:59,853
Oh, well, it's too late now.

106
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,445
It's mine.

107
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:06,733
Hello? David, hi.

108
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,211
Hang on a second.

109
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,013
So is Nate there yet?

110
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:20,246
No, he's still at the airport.
Claire, I've got bad news.

111
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,011
What?

112
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,696
Yeah, sure.

113
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,572
Okay, I'm on my way.

114
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,375
I have to go.

115
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,048
- No fucking way!
- Excuse me.

116
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,978
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

117
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,332
- You're coming back, right?
- I don't think so.

118
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:03,980
My dad just got hit by a bus,
and it broke his neck, and he's dead.

119
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:09,571
I gotta pick up my mom and bring her to
the morgue so she can identify his body.

120
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:16,537
No, I'm not kidding.
This is actually happening.

121
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,970
And now I'm high on crack!

122
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,220
- Crystal.
- Whatever!

123
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:24,018
So I guess this whole hellish experience
I'm about to go through...

124
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,498
...is just gonna burn
a little brighter now, right?

125
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:30,378
Great! Thank you! Fuck!

126
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,897
You really didn't have to do this.
I could've rented a car.

127
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:43,982
It's okay.
You're in no shape to drive.

128
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:49,180
I'm in no hurry to get home to my
family's annual Christmas Eve massacre.

129
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,781
Parents who stayed together
for the children...

130
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:55,534
...but really because they got off
on tormenting each other so much.

131
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:58,465
Manic-depressive brother...

132
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,863
...who always chooses the holidays
to go off his medication.

133
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:07,186
And an ancient springer spaniel who's
completely blind, deaf and incontinent.

134
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,620
What about you?

135
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:14,341
Actually, we're pretty normal.

136
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,822
My mom's a control freak.

137
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,382
My brother...

138
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,896
...well, he's a control freak too.

139
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:25,100
And my sister...

140
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:30,138
Well, I left home before she was born
so I never really knew her that well...

141
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,420
...but she's kind of wild like I was.
- Was?

142
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:41,545
My dad really rode my ass
when I was a kid.

143
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:45,063
I couldn't go rafting because
he buried a girl who drowned.

144
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,979
He buries this dipshit loser who OD'd
at a Flock of Seagulls concert...

145
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,465
...and I'm not allowed to go
to concerts for a year.

146
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,228
Your dad worked in a cemetery?

147
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,389
How could a man who's so scared of
everything, who never had an accident...

148
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,903
...or a speeding ticket in his entire life,
how could he have a car wreck?

149
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:07,583
Are you mad at him,
or the fact that we're all gonna die?

150
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:13,510
- Are you a shrink?
- No! God, no. No!

151
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,465
Both my parents are.

152
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,224
So, what else do you
want to talk about?

153
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,309
The weather?

154
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,142
Or the fact that we both
just fucked a perfect stranger?

155
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:32,141
And that we both lied
when we said we never did that.

156
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:44,823
- Wonderful service.
- Yes, it was. Very nice.

157
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:57,266
She looked so peaceful.
Thank you so much.

158
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,387
- You're welcome.
- Wonderful job.

159
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,234
Did you know that
before you were born...

160
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:10,394
...funeral homes
ran the ambulance business?

161
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,552
No.

162
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:17,275
Hearses were the only vehicles
that could transport people lying down.

163
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,390
Your father used to joke about that.

164
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,748
"Just drive him around the block
a few more times.

165
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:29,507
We won't need to stop
at the hospital."

166
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:32,996
You're kind of freaking me out
right now.

167
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,348
Claire...

168
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:39,632
...are you having sex?
- What?

169
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,433
Or doing drugs?

170
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,278
Why are you asking me this right now?

171
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,198
Your father is dead.

172
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,633
I can't even remember the last time you
and I talked about anything important.

173
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,752
I need to know you're okay.

174
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,678
Oh, yeah.

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,072
Believe me, I'm okay.

176
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:09,239
You know, considering.

177
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,914
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

178
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:20,590
I wanted to compliment you
on the music.

179
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:25,512
I've been to three funerals this year.
Cancer, stroke, pediatric leukemia...

180
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,920
...and the music is always
that same sad organ music.

181
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,193
It reminds me of soap operas
my mom watched...

182
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:35,954
...before I started kindergarten. Oh, God,
you're probably too young to remember.

183
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:41,476
Anyway, I so prefer this light classical,
you know, chamber orchestra stuff.

184
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:45,154
It's still spiritual, but doesn't
seem so dated or depressing.

185
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:46,513
I studied music appreciation.

186
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:49,716
You think I'm really boring, don 't you?
Well, get used to it,

187
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,437
Now that your father is dead,,,

188
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,714
,,, you can forget
about going to law school,

189
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:57,804
It's just you and dead people and freaks
like me for the rest of your life!

190
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,882
Mom.

191
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:13,638
Mom, I'm so sorry.

192
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:18,079
Who's she?

193
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,683
- This is...
- Brenda Chenowith.

194
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,082
Brenda Chenowith.

195
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:28,722
Brenda, this is my mom,
Ruth Fisher.

196
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:31,477
And my sister, Claire.

197
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:36,603
- Nate, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, just give me a minute.

198
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,322
- Mom, did you already do the...?
- I can't.

199
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,800
I've seen too many dead people
in my life. They're work.

200
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:47,878
I won't see your father that way.
I need you to do it.

201
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:52,366
Nate, I need to talk to you now,
please. It's urgent.

202
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:01,646
- So how did you and my son meet?
- In cooking class.

203
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,007
I have to tell somebody.
I am tweaking.

204
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,283
- Yeah, we're all upset.
- No, I'm high on crystal.

205
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:13,130
I smoked some with some friends
before David called me.

206
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:15,526
- You did what?
- Don't worry, it's the first time.

207
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,323
But I think I'm having a meltdown...

208
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:21,319
...and I can't tell if it's Dad being dead
or the crystal, but...

209
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,252
I'm really scared.

210
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,920
You cannot do this to me right now.

211
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,282
Don't be a narc.
We smoked pot at Thanksgiving.

212
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:32,848
Look, I have to go identify
our dead father's body.

213
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,490
I'm sorry you're having
a bad drug experience, but deal with it.

214
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,810
Well?

215
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,845
Well, well,

216
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,286
The prodigal returns,

217
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:16,966
This is what you've been running away
from your whole life, buddy-boy.

218
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:20,088
Scared the crap out of you
when you were growing up, didn't it?

219
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:25,455
And you thought you'd escape,
well, guess what?

220
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:28,007
Nobody escapes.

221
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:36,816
- Well?
- Yeah, that's him.

222
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,896
Okay, let's get out of here.

223
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,808
How'd he look?

224
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,055
Dead.

225
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,376
Will there need to be
a lot of reconstruction?

226
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,173
David's not that skilled
at the really hard stuff.

227
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:02,452
Federico usually does that.
He's quite gifted.

228
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,455
You don't think we'll have
to have a closed casket, do you?

229
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,128
- I would hate to send that message.
- What message?

230
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,854
That we're not equipped to handle
a major restoration...

231
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,258
...or that we're not proud of our work.
- Can we talk about this later?

232
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:19,773
We should really get Nate home.
He's probably exhausted. Let's go.

233
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:33,931
Thanks for driving me here.

234
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:39,978
Please. I'm just avoiding my own hell.
I'm a big coward.

235
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,418
Me too.

236
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:48,542
I don't know if I can handle this.

237
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:52,737
Well, you're about to find out.

238
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:56,536
I wish you the best, Nate.

239
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:58,496
Goodbye.

240
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:17,943
Claire.

241
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:23,700
- You're driving too fast.
- This isn't fast. You wanna see fast?

242
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,854
Pull over!

243
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,577
Listen, do you do a lot of drugs?

244
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:44,541
What? No.
And it's none of your business.

245
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:45,942
Yes, it is my business.

246
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,106
You were driving like a maniac.
You could've gotten us killed.

247
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,186
What the hell is this?
You're not my father.

248
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:54,344
You split as soon as you could.
You don't even know me.

249
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:58,588
So don't start thinking you can
tell me what to do, okay?

250
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,147
So where's Dad, downstairs already?

251
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,342
He's still in the morgue.

252
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:23,788
You didn't bring him back with you?

253
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,346
Oh, dear.

254
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,185
That didn't even cross my mind.

255
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:33,226
We should've taken the van
so we could bring him home.

256
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:38,062
I'm sorry.
That was very stupid of me.

257
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,268
Nice going, Dave.

258
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:48,033
Like she doesn't have enough
to feel bad about right now?

259
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,509
Things have to be done.
Federico's downstairs, ready to start.

260
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:55,228
Every second we wait will only make
Dad's restoration more difficult.

261
00:21:55,433 --> 00:22:00,064
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you, bag boy?

262
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,703
"Bag boy"?

263
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:07,466
I'm assistant manager of organic produce
at Seattle's highest volume food co-op.

264
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,350
Jesus, pull your dicks out and measure
them. Let's get this over with.

265
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,869
Were we supposed to throw Dad
in the back of Claire's car?

266
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:18,145
It is a hearse!

267
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:21,188
Yeah, hi. It's David Fisher.

268
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:23,785
Yeah, so I need to come
pick up the body.

269
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:26,032
These people mean nothing to me,

270
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:29,706
Know you not the family of the man
who has slaved for you,,,

271
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,350
,,, from dawn to dark
these many years?

272
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,433
They appear to be so happy,,,,

273
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:38,266
- I made you some dinner.
- I'm so not hungry.

274
00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:43,073
We have to eat, Claire.
We didn't die.

275
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:46,150
What is that?

276
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:50,954
- For your father,
your brother, Tiny Tim,

277
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,069
On three. One. Two. Three.

278
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,395
Really sorry, man.

279
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,878
Thanks.

280
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:39,070
For a body that's firm, yet flexible,

281
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:42,513
For skin that begs to be touched,

282
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:47,034
For the velvety appearance
of actual living tissue,,,

283
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:51,794
,,, top morticians rely on Living Splendor
embalming fluid,

284
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:57,077
Living Splendor,
Only real life is better,

285
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:50,198
Hey, buddy-boy.

286
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:53,520
Come on in, it's okay.

287
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:57,597
Say hello to Mr. Bloomberg.

288
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:03,359
There isn't anything to be afraid of, Nate.
Mr. Bloomberg's dead.

289
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,641
I'm getting him ready so his family
can see him for the last time...

290
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:09,841
...and say goodbye to him.
It'll make them feel better.

291
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,757
That's what Daddy does.

292
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:16,760
What do you got?

293
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,003
You got me.

294
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,363
You can touch him
if you wear one of these.

295
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,846
Believe me, he won't mind.
He won't care.

296
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,524
Nate!

297
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,601
What's up?

298
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,324
- Hey, Rico.
- It's good to see you.

299
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,127
Really sorry about your dad, man.

300
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:59,485
But, well, you know,
when your time's up, it's up, right?

301
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:01,649
How's he doing?

302
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:03,327
So far so good.

303
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:06,525
I really appreciate you coming in
on Christmas Eve, Federico.

304
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,204
It's the least I could do for Mr. F.
Everything he did for me.

305
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:14,330
I was gonna be up all night anyway,
putting together useless shit...

306
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:16,286
...Santa Claus is bringing my kid.

307
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,566
We don't use that kind of language
in here. Show some respect.

308
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:29,963
- You need something?
- No.

309
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:32,245
I just...

310
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:34,251
David Fisher.

311
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:39,685
Hey, I just want to remind you, don't
eat too much with your family tonight...

312
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:43,969
...because I am making you something
totally decadent and fatty for dessert.

313
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,652
Hold just a second, please.

314
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:56,292
Hi.

315
00:26:56,897 --> 00:27:00,334
Keith, I'm sorry, I can 't make it,

316
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:02,653
Why not?

317
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:05,774
My father was just killed
in a car accident.

318
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:08,617
Oh, shit. David, I'm so sorry.

319
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:10,490
What can I do?

320
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:13,418
Nothing, thanks.
But I have to stay here.

321
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:18,295
Listen, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call me.

322
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,615
Sure,

323
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:24,938
I mean it, David. You don't
have to go through this alone.

324
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,095
I gotta go.

325
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,017
Okay, here it goes.

326
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,735
This is the one I'm most proud of.

327
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:41,776
The husband, okay?
He got fired, flipped out...

328
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,417
...shot his wife point-blank in the head,
then shot himself in the mouth.

329
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:49,820
Some seriously closed-casket shit, right?
Now look at this.

330
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:55,621
Like the bride and groom
on top of a cake.

331
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,932
And then we cremated them.

332
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:02,180
What a fucking waste.

333
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,578
Actually...

334
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:09,935
...this right here is...
This is my best work.

335
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:14,332
Wait a minute, this kid
was born just last month.

336
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:18,742
He'll be 4 fucking years old in April,
can you believe it?

337
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:23,139
Vanessa's pregnant again.

338
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:26,176
You stud!

339
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:31,222
Hey, it wasn't planned. You know what?
Neither was this one.

340
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:34,735
And he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

341
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:38,062
Keep an eye on those chemicals,
Federico. We don't want him to burn.

342
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:54,306
Hey.

343
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,903
- Where's Mom?
- She went to bed.

344
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,659
Was she feeling any better?

345
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,861
Yeah, Nate, she was on top
of the goddamn world.

346
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:18,704
- Where's David?
- He's downstairs, working.

347
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,469
On Dad?

348
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:25,340
Yeah, well, him and Rico.

349
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,063
He said not to wait up for him.
We should try and sleep.

350
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,103
Yeah, as if that were a viable option.

351
00:29:55,632 --> 00:30:00,069
- You want to go to the grocery store?
- Yes. Anything to get out of here.

352
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,713
Well, it's about to start
raining frogs here.

353
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:29,188
How are things on your end?

354
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,307
- God, I'm glad you called.
- Really, why?

355
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:35,393
I don't know.
Because you...

356
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,426
You have a calming effect on me.

357
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:42,426
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "projection"?

358
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,991
Are you familiar with the psychological
term "blow me"?

359
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:49,951
Come on, You grew up
with all that psychobabble,

360
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,624
You rebelled against it
every chance you got, Still do,

361
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,227
And that includes having sex
with strangers in closets at airports.

362
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:59,346
And you think you're
not easy to read?

363
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,833
Coasting by on your looks and charm
isn 't working like it used to,,,

364
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:06,871
,,, but you have no idea what else to do
because you've never had to learn,

365
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,990
Any woman with half a brain
looks at a guy like you and thinks:

366
00:31:10,198 --> 00:31:13,395
"Good for a hot fuck."
But believe me, that's it.

367
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,469
L...

368
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,157
Nate, can we go home?
I really gotta take a shower.

369
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,991
Oh, God, Jesus Christ! Am I not allowed
to have even a single moment to myself?

370
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,635
Okay.

371
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,550
It's okay.

372
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,036
What can I do?

373
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,471
Nothing. No one can do anything.

374
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:54,877
- You'll have to pay for that cantaloupe.
- You fuck off!

375
00:32:04,682 --> 00:32:07,276
She looked her best
every day of her life,

376
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:11,112
Don 't let one horribly disfiguring
accident change that,

377
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:14,315
Use new Wound Filler
cosmetic molding putty,

378
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:17,083
Now faster setting and self-sealing,,,

379
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:20,514
,,, to help make masking
unsightly wounds a breeze,

380
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:40,319
Ma, you remember that stuffed dog
I used to have?

381
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,995
I dragged it around until its ears fell off,
then you made new ears out of a towel.

382
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:48,518
I hated that dog after that.
And I threw it up on the roof.

383
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,284
No.

384
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:53,635
I wanted it back and begged Dad
to get it, but he said no...

385
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,043
...if I really wanted it, I'd never
have thrown it in the first place.

386
00:32:57,246 --> 00:33:01,798
Your father did so many wonderful things
for you, and that's all you can think of?

387
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:06,040
- I just remembered it.
- He was a good man!

388
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,676
I'm going running.

389
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:30,920
Oh, no, you're doing me?
You're the worst one we've got.

390
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:33,518
- Thanks, Dad.
- Where's Federico?

391
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:37,438
It's Christmas morning. He's with
his wife and kid. He'll be in later.

392
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,164
Couldn't this wait?
I don't want you ruining my face.

393
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,930
- It's a little late for that.
- Not funny.

394
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,839
- I need to stay busy right now.
- So go reorganize some files.

395
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,247
Or develop a new bookkeeping system.
That's what you're good at.

396
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,080
You never really had any aptitude
for this stuff.

397
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,647
I know.
And what did I do with my life?

398
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:01,685
I went to school to learn
exactly how to do this stuff.

399
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:05,362
Other kids my age were going
to frat parties, I was draining corpses...

400
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:08,564
...and refashioning severed ears
out of wax.

401
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:12,321
Thank God I didn't lose an ear. I can
only imagine what you'd do with that.

402
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,365
And I did it all for you.

403
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:20,247
I did it to make you happy,
you ungrateful son of a bitch.

404
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,730
Dave?

405
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,011
I just wanted to let you know
I was here.

406
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,371
We'll deal you in next hand.

407
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,061
- I'm about to jump out of my skin.
- Don't.

408
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:28,494
I'm just barely holding it together.
Are you still high?

409
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:33,778
- I don't know. Am I sweating?
- I know I am.

410
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:39,018
This is too fucking weird.
It's been three days...

411
00:36:39,224 --> 00:36:43,342
...and I'm still trapped in zombie world.
- This is all happening to you.

412
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,104
Fuck off!

413
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,662
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one
who wasn't prepared for this.

414
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:53,096
I came expecting to sleep late and chow
down on Mom's cooking for six days.

415
00:36:53,305 --> 00:36:55,978
And now I find myself feeling like...

416
00:36:56,185 --> 00:37:00,099
...I'm not even a part of this family.
- I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat.

417
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:02,740
At least you got out of here.

418
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:06,177
I live in a shitty apartment
which was supposed to be temporary.

419
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,616
I work at a job,
also supposed to be temporary...

420
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,740
...until I figured out what I wanted to do
with my life, which apparently is nothing.

421
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,496
I have lots of sex, but my relationships
don't last more than a couple months.

422
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:21,098
I don't even have the self-discipline
to floss daily. I've had four root canals!

423
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:25,062
I'm 35, I've had four root canals.

424
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:31,220
I'm gonna be a loser who ends up
in his deathbed saying:

425
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:33,544
- "Where'd my life go?"
- No, you won't.

426
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,906
You'll be saying,
"Where the hell's the morphine?"

427
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,228
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

428
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:43,546
I've spent my whole fucking life
being cheerful.

429
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:48,265
I'm sorry about your father,
but he's in a much better place now.

430
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,348
You are so right about that.

431
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,228
Who the hell is that?

432
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:18,827
I know, Ruth.

433
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,071
I know everything.

434
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:28,062
I've known the Fishers
for years from church.

435
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,424
- You know them too?
- Yes, yes. I work here.

436
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,191
Oh, you work here.

437
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:46,834
- What are you doing here?
- I just got off duty. I came...

438
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:51,186
...to pay my respects to your father.
- You never even met my father.

439
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,955
Exactly. And you've met my parents
how many times now?

440
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:56,988
- We spent the weekend at their house.
- Don't do this to me.

441
00:38:57,195 --> 00:38:59,470
- This is not your high-school reunion.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,347
This is not the time to be political.

443
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:04,070
- You think I'm here to be political?
- Keep your voice down.

444
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:08,030
What is this? We can fuck, but I can't
be a shoulder for you to cry on?

445
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:11,148
- I'm not crying.
- So, what am I? Am I just sex to you?

446
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:12,835
Jesus!

447
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:15,789
Do we really have to have
this conversation now?

448
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:19,228
Oh, shit. Here comes my mother.

449
00:39:20,597 --> 00:39:25,432
- I'm so tired.
- I know, Mom. It's exhausting.

450
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:28,310
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

451
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:32,147
This is Keith Charles, a friend of mine.
He came to pay his respects to Dad.

452
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,271
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Fisher.
I'm really sorry about your husband.

453
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:43,189
- You're friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

454
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,388
Nice to meet you.

455
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,591
I'd like to see your father now.

456
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,195
Who's that cop?

457
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,319
- My Aunt Shirley was laid out here.
- Aunt Shirley, huh?

458
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,150
Shirley Hamilton.
Terrible accident, lost her ear.

459
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:12,512
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know Shirley.
I remember Shirley.

460
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:13,756
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:18,910
I was the person who sewed her ear
back on. That was me. That's my work.

462
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,003
What? She's sad,
so he has to get her out of sight?

463
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,158
They always do that.

464
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:39,639
The second someone starts to lose it,
they take them off into that room.

465
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:42,038
It makes the other people uncomfortable,
I guess.

466
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:45,236
This is not about the other people!

467
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,400
Volume.

468
00:40:53,644 --> 00:40:58,002
When I went backpacking through Europe
after I quit school...

469
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:00,721
...I went to this island
off the coast of Sicily.

470
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,917
It was this volcanic island,

471
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,844
And on the boat over,
there was this pine box,

472
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:09,958
Somebody from the island
being returned to be buried there,

473
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:13,483
And there are all these old Sicilians
dressed up all in black...

474
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:15,964
,,, waiting, lined up on the beach,

475
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,316
And when they got
that coffin to the beach,,,

476
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:22,520
,,, those old Sicilian women went apeshit,
screaming, throwing themselves on it,,,

477
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:25,878
,,, beating their chests, tearing
at their hair, making animal noises,

478
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:27,964
It was just so,,,,

479
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,044
So real,

480
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:32,807
I mean, I'd been around funerals
my entire life,,,

481
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:36,398
,,, but I had never seen such grief,

482
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:39,918
And at the time,
it gave me the creeps,

483
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:45,438
But now I think it's probably
so much more healthy than...

484
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:49,159
...this.

485
00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:54,927
That cop is hot.

486
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:58,918
- Oh, David, David.
- I know, Mom.

487
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,598
It's going to be okay.
It just takes time.

488
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,280
- I've done a terrible, terrible thing.
- What?

489
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,446
I've done a terrible thing.

490
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,766
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

491
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,965
I'm not fine. I'm a whore! I was
unfaithful to your father for years!

492
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:18,800
And now he knows.
He knows.

493
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:25,327
I met a man at church once
when your father didn't come with me.

494
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:29,204
- Mom...
- And he invited me for coffee...

495
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:31,880
...and he said he liked my hair.

496
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,925
He's a hairdresser, a widower.

497
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:40,765
Well, they divorced before she died,
so technically I guess he's divorced.

498
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,203
He invited me to accompany him
on a hike.

499
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:44,732
This is really not the time.

500
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:47,606
- Maybe she needs to get this out.
- I don't want to hear it.

501
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:51,602
I used to love hiking when I was
younger, and being outdoors.

502
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:53,930
I always wanted
to take you kids camping...

503
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:58,127
...but your father would never
leave the business!

504
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:04,251
Well, I can tell you. I went camping
with this man from church several times!

505
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:07,769
Told your father
I was visiting my sister.

506
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,374
If he'd ever thought to call...

507
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:11,964
Can you even begin to fathom
the impropriety of this?

508
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,767
Your husband is lying
in a casket.

509
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,251
David, she's grief-stricken, okay?
Fuck propriety.

510
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,572
We don't say that word!

511
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:31,847
Did you know him?

512
00:43:32,057 --> 00:43:33,695
No.

513
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:36,047
Did you?

514
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:38,487
He was my father.

515
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:40,893
You're Claire?

516
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,489
- Yeah.
- Keith Charles.

517
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:45,177
I'm a friend of your brother's.

518
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:47,812
- Of Nate's?
- No, David's.

519
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:51,694
- David's friends with a cop?
- We play racquetball together.

520
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:55,016
- David plays racquetball?
- Excuse us.

521
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,056
You want me to cry
on your shoulder? Fine.

522
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:04,012
My mother just confessed
she was having an affair.

523
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,450
- Wow.
- Yeah, with some hairdresser...

524
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,369
...who likes to hike. Now Nate is in there
playing Mr. Sensitive with her...

525
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,095
...while her dead husband
lies in the next room. It's disgusting.

526
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,259
- Breathe. You're gonna get through this.
- Oh, I know.

527
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:21,340
I'll be the strong, stable, dependable one,
because that's what I do.

528
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:25,454
Everyone around me will fall apart
because that's what they do.

529
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:29,257
Don't you get exhausted being so hard
on everyone? And yourself?

530
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:32,215
Oh, shut up.

531
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:36,935
- She met him at church.
- You met me at church.

532
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:45,577
Hands.

533
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:57,133
I didn't even realize how lonely I was...

534
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:02,134
...or how long it had been
since a man touched me like that.

535
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:09,015
Well, loneliness is a terrible thing.

536
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:12,695
I'm still a woman, you know.

537
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:14,941
Yes, I know.

538
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:21,585
And now your father sees me.
Like God sees me.

539
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:27,463
He knows everything.
I'm so ashamed.

540
00:45:29,986 --> 00:45:32,899
You didn't do it to hurt anybody.

541
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:36,417
You were lonely.
I'm sure Dad forgives you.

542
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:44,663
- And God doesn't?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure he does too.

543
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:52,823
Look, it's okay.

544
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:57,420
Everybody forgives everybody.
For everything.

545
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,945
Fuck.

546
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:42,665
If you're looking for the olives, honey,
they're right here.

547
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:56,029
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,,,

548
00:46:56,233 --> 00:47:00,273
,,, is easy as pie with Franklin 's
new leak-proof earth dispenser,

549
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:02,988
Say goodbye to soiled fingers forever,

550
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:08,946
Only from Franklin Funeral Supplies,
We put the fun back in funeral,

551
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:16,073
In the midst of life,
we are in death.

552
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:19,585
Of whom may we seek for succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

553
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,629
Who for our sins art justly displeased?

554
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:27,192
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

555
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:30,069
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayer.

556
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:35,145
But spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty.

557
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:40,989
O holy and merciful savior,
thou most worthy judge eternal.

558
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:43,836
Suffer us not, at our last hour...

559
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:48,872
...through any pains of death,
to fall from thee.

560
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:57,354
In the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life.

561
00:47:57,998 --> 00:48:00,671
Through almighty God
we commend our brother...

562
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,995
...Nathaniel Samuel Fisher...

563
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,714
...and we commit his body
to the ground.

564
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:09,558
He looks like he's salting popcorn.

565
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:13,354
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...

566
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,516
...dust to dust.

567
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,029
The Lord bless him and keep him.

568
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,313
The Lord make his face to shine
upon him and be gracious unto him.

569
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,400
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace.

570
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:59,761
- Nate...
- No!

571
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:02,318
I refuse to sanitize this anymore.

572
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:05,758
- This is how it's done.
- Yeah? Well, it's whacked.

573
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:08,637
What is this stupid saltshaker?

574
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:13,235
What is this hermetically sealed box?
This phony AstroTurf around the grave?

575
00:49:13,444 --> 00:49:19,759
Jesus, David, it's like surgery.
Clean, antiseptic, business.

576
00:49:20,245 --> 00:49:22,281
- He was our father!
- Please don't do this.

577
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,761
You can pump him full of chemicals,
you can put makeup on him...

578
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,638
...and you can prop him up
for a nap in the slumber room...

579
00:49:28,845 --> 00:49:34,716
...but the fact remains that the only
father we're ever gonna have is gone!

580
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:37,724
Forever.
And that sucks.

581
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:40,918
But it's a goddamn part of life,
and you can't really accept it...

582
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:43,004
...without getting your hands dirty.

583
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:46,119
Well, I do accept it, and I intend
to honor the old bastard...

584
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:51,959
...by letting the world see how fucked
up and shitty I feel that he's dead!

585
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:54,728
Goddamn it!

586
00:49:57,488 --> 00:49:58,523
Amen.

587
00:49:59,808 --> 00:50:01,321
Wait.

588
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:37,042
Let her.

589
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,292
Let us pray.

590
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:16,364
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

591
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:22,412
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

592
00:51:22,615 --> 00:51:27,086
Give us this day, our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses...

593
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:30,685
...as we forgive those
who have trespassed against us.

594
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:35,208
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

595
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:40,649
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

596
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,576
Amen! Amen!

597
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:47,375
The Lord be with you.

598
00:51:53,897 --> 00:51:57,094
Mom, Federico's gonna
drive you back, okay?

599
00:51:57,297 --> 00:52:01,007
I just need to go over a few details
with Nate. We'll be right behind you.

600
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,652
Put her there, Mrs. F.

601
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:09,731
You have such delicate hands, Federico.
Like a statue.

602
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:13,375
Or an illustration in an antique book.

603
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:18,528
Or one of those little ceramic hands
they use to display gloves.

604
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,373
You want to be the alpha dog,
Nate, is that it?

605
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,014
Coasting toward mid-life
with nothing to show for it.

606
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,132
You wanna come back and be the rock
for this family to lean on?

607
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:39,059
- Fuck you.
- That is not what I'm...

608
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:42,059
You want to get your hands dirty?
You sanctimonious prick.

609
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:45,219
Talk to me when you've had to stuff
formaldehyde-soaked cotton...

610
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:47,981
...up your father's ass
so he doesn't leak.

611
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:49,740
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

612
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:53,696
Well, I'm sure you just would've
tossed him out with the garbage.

613
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:55,176
It may seem weird to you...

614
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:58,454
...but there is a reason
behind everything that we do here.

615
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:01,051
We provide people
with a very important...

616
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,494
...and sacred service
at the darkest time in their lives.

617
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:07,501
Because maybe they don't wanna
make a spectacle of themselves.

618
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:10,217
Because maybe they'd prefer
to grieve in private.

619
00:53:10,423 --> 00:53:11,378
Why?

620
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:16,100
Why does it have to be such a secret?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

621
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:20,534
- Dave, please...
- You know nothing!

622
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:22,935
Nothing!

623
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:28,937
You had a responsibility
to this family...

624
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:31,101
...and you ran away,
and left it all for me.

625
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:34,422
Don't blame me if you're
not living the life you want.

626
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:37,298
That is nobody's fault but your own.

627
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:44,655
Okay, fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

628
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:47,096
You got out...

629
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:49,774
...stay out.

630
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:57,816
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher, sir?
If I could get a moment of your time.

631
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:00,666
- What?
- I'm from Kroehner Service International.

632
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:04,223
I'd like to talk to you about joining
our family of death-care facilities.

633
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:06,783
- I cannot believe this.
- Lf you'd just hear me out...

634
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:08,785
We're not selling.
Get the fuck out of here!

635
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:10,706
We wouldn't change
the name of the business.

636
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:12,785
We would retain you
as a salaried manager.

637
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:17,699
Look, I really want to hit somebody
right now, and it might as well be you!

638
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:27,863
I'll call you when you've had some time
to recover from your loss.

639
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,987
- You're really lucky, you know that?
- You kidding? It was over in a second.

640
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,182
I didn't have to be afraid of it
or even think about it.

641
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,667
- No more bullshit.
- No more responsibility.

642
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:45,783
- And no more having to care.
- No more boredom!

643
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:48,829
No more waiting to die.

644
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:17,910
Hi.

645
00:55:20,394 --> 00:55:24,785
Well, after four days with my family,
I'm ready for shock therapy.

646
00:55:24,994 --> 00:55:29,112
I'm just waiting to see
if my HMO covers it.

647
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:36,027
- How's it going with you?
- Oh, it's great. Great.

648
00:55:36,235 --> 00:55:39,227
My father's dead, my mom's a whore,
my brother wants to kill me...

649
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:43,713
...and my sister's smoking crack.
I think I win.

650
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,272
Four days ago,
I was a relatively happy guy.

651
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,593
Now it's like I don't even know
who that guy was.

652
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:57,274
I'm a fucking mess.

653
00:55:57,477 --> 00:56:00,071
If you want to know the truth.

654
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,476
But I think you're already aware of that.

655
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,988
Well, here's my number.

656
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:15,716
If you ever want to, I don't know,
go out on a real date?

657
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:19,672
You know, where you buy me dinner
before I put out.

658
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,876
Maybe I'm a woman that meets a man
who seems emotionally conflicted...

659
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:30,833
...no relationship skills, and I figure,
"Hey, that's for me."

660
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,509
- I don't even live here. I live in Seattle.
- That makes you more attractive.

661
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:36,392
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,154
Well, I also happen to be a serial rapist.

663
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,511
I've got 10 nurses
buried under my house.

664
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,432
Now you're making me wet.

665
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:29,082
I... I need...

666
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:31,880
I need...

667
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:49,999
It's okay. It's okay.

668
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,881
Good morning.

669
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,684
Thank God you're here.

670
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:58,122
Yeah, well, of course I'm here.

671
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:08,325
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Oh, I'm gonna go for a run.

672
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:11,922
- I'll eat when I get back.
- Nate?

673
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:17,445
You don't have to go back to Seattle
right away, do you?

674
00:59:21,773 --> 00:59:25,448
I guess not.
I could make a few calls.

675
00:59:25,653 --> 00:59:29,726
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,962
Just for a few days.

677
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:38,211
Okay.
