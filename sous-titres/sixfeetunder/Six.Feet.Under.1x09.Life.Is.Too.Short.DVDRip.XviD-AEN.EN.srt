1
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,723
Yo, what's up? You get it?

2
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:23,762
No, I didn't get anything. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

3
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,845
- Anthony, go play in Mom's room.
- Why?

4
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,477
Because I said so,
you little shit. Go!

5
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:37,198
Get up, come on.

6
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,162
You suck!

7
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,603
Kid's got so much major attitude.

8
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,488
Six years old and he's
already a hard-ass.

9
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,928
You can get more of this stuff?
How much?

10
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,281
- How much money do you have?
- Oh, like I'm a fucking loaded.

11
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,884
Hey, Bennett and I are going to
that record release party tonight.

12
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,928
And then there's an
after-hours in Hollywood.

13
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,802
No, dude, I fucking hate that shit.

14
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,598
It's always a bunch of
whacked-out faggot tweakers...

15
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,278
...shoving glow sticks in your eyes.
- It's at Sin Sin.

16
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,005
Great, whacked-out Asian tweakers.

17
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,161
That club's weak, dude.

18
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,128
Anthony? An...

19
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,641
Oh, fuck!

20
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,241
Oh, shit.

21
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,807
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck!

22
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,604
I gotta get out of here.

23
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,564
- What?
- I gotta get that shit out of here.

24
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,764
Oh, fuck. Anthony?

25
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,563
Morning.

26
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,723
Okay. What are you mad
at me about now?

27
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:47,048
I'm busy, all right? My workload
has doubled since Federico's gone.

28
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:52,120
You can't expect me to engage you
in small talk just to make you feel better.

29
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,407
You flunked the licensing test.

30
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:01,486
- Did you think I didn't know?
- I didn't.

31
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,643
You didn't apply yourself.

32
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:06,525
You think this is something people do as
a last resort...

33
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:10,731
...and therefore it can't be that difficult.
- I feel bad. You wanna make it worse?

34
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,888
- I don't care what you feel...
- Bullshit.

35
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:16,203
You like it when I feel bad
because misery loves company.

36
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,926
- How'd he die?
- Heart attack.

37
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:29,124
Fell down a flight of stairs,
dead when he hit the bottom.

38
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:32,483
- His nose supposed to look like that?
- Of course not.

39
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:36,810
I have to finish embalming him before
I can start on anything cosmetic.

40
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:43,125
- I can deal with whoever it is.
- Unless it's a walk-in.

41
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,369
You are choosing
to be the victim here.

42
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,922
I could handle an intake
and you know it.

43
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,406
Ladies, teacup chain.

44
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,612
Good.

45
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,449
And walk to the middle and back.

46
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:08,047
All right, very good.
Very good, ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:12,644
So we'll see you all at the same time
next week, okay? Be safe getting home.

48
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,081
Morning, folks.

49
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:17,046
- Hi.
- Hi.

50
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:21,488
Goddamn it, why hasn't anyone
answered the door? Where is Mom?

51
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:25,292
Okay, if you haven't slept with
that guy yet, would you start?

52
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:27,644
Because I think it would
do you a world of good.

53
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,093
Don't do that.

54
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:45,252
- Do what?
- Watch me like that.

55
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,126
I can't help it.
You're beautiful.

56
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,889
Oh, for heaven's sake.

57
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:53,131
- I want to go camping again.
- Then go camping.

58
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:57,083
- With you.
- I've got a job now, Hiram.

59
00:06:57,294 --> 00:07:00,047
I can't just up and leave
whenever I feel like it.

60
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,132
Spring is a very busy
time of the year.

61
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,444
It's our anniversary tomorrow.

62
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:11,966
The first time we went camping
was two years ago tomorrow.

63
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:15,212
We don't have anniversaries.

64
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:18,851
- I never agreed to anniversaries.
- Just you and me alone in the woods.

65
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:23,054
Naked under the stars.
Just like it was at the beginning.

66
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:27,413
Tomorrow is such short notice.

67
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,651
I can't promise anything.
But I'll try.

68
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:43,335
My mom wants to know
how quickly we can do this.

69
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:49,053
Well, I'd suggest a viewing in
two days to allow proper restoration.

70
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:52,129
Viewing?

71
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:56,364
For friends, family. You can make it
as small or as large as you wish.

72
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:01,286
No, I can't see him in a box.
I can't.

73
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:03,854
All right.

74
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:14,092
Ms. Dimas, seeing your son before
you bury him might help you to let go.

75
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,208
No, I don't want to see him!

76
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:22,049
Of course. We'll arrange
for a closed-casket ceremony.

77
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,609
Will three days
give you enough time?

78
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,894
Yeah, that's gonna be fine.

79
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:43,728
- Nate will show you to the door.
- Thanks.

80
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,610
What happened?

81
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:56,253
A 6-year-old found a gun
and was playing with it.

82
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:58,652
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

83
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,328
They gave me this at the hospital.

84
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:14,576
It's some sort of receipt. I don't know...
I don't know if you need it, but...

85
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,410
What was he doing here?

86
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:33,970
- Gabe.
- It's okay.

87
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,731
Hey.

88
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:43,968
My brother just told me.
I'm so sorry.

89
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:48,491
I didn't know where else to go.
My grandmother's funeral was here.

90
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:51,694
Yeah, of course.

91
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:59,217
My mom's waiting
for me to unlock the car.

92
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:14,894
I thought we were supposed
to encourage people to have a viewing.

93
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,968
Well, sometimes
people don't want that.

94
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,898
Well, sometimes you don't
want to work any harder.

95
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,969
When faced with the option of
not having to restore a child's head...

96
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,415
...that's been blown to bits, yeah,
I don't want to do that. Do you?

97
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,730
We can't force someone to do
something they're not ready to do...

98
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,654
...because we think it's the right thing.
Because it will make us feel better.

99
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:47,408
- Can I help you?
- Roses are if you love somebody, right?

100
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:52,215
Roses are the classic choice, but other
flowers could achieve the same effect.

101
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,649
What if you were gonna
ask her to marry you?

102
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,009
Oh, how lovely.

103
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,255
Well, roses would be
the perfect choice.

104
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,494
But she turned out
to be a cheating coward...

105
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,931
...and ran off with some shithead
that she met at traffic school.

106
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,498
What color would
you give a coward?

107
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,496
- Yellow. Yellow.
- Great.

108
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,852
Twelve dozen yellow roses
sent to this address, please.

109
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,938
- What would you like the card to say?
- "Fuck you, cunt."

110
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,972
I think it would be more
personal if you write that.

111
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,130
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,013
I have to take the day off
tomorrow and Saturday.

113
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,448
Why?

114
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,254
I was supposed to have plans
with a friend and I forgot.

115
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,458
Is it with that man?

116
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:50,459
The one with the funny little car
that picks you up?

117
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:53,459
It's an electric car and it's
very good for the environment.

118
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:00,491
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you are not.

119
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,169
- You like this man?
- Can I have the days off or not?

120
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:08,296
Take! Go, I don't care.
We will miss you.

121
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,576
Beep, beep.

122
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,574
Beep, beep.

123
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:24,297
- Brenda?
- Hey there.

124
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,811
I'll be right out. I just
got out of the shower.

125
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,977
- How was work?
- It sucked.

126
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:40,977
Like I figured, I failed
that funeral director's test.

127
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:45,016
There was this intake meeting
this morning I totally fucked up.

128
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:49,971
And I just picked up a dead
6-year-old at the morgue.

129
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,575
All in all, it's been
a pretty bad day.

130
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,102
Goddamn it!

131
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,651
Sometimes I feel like I don't have
any fucking idea what I'm doing.

132
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,619
It's like I made this bullshit decision
to go into this business...

133
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,137
...for all the wrong reasons
and now it's too late.

134
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:18,341
- It's never too late.
- Jesus, Billy.

135
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:20,852
What, do you live here now?

136
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:24,857
No, Brenda just gave me a shiatsu.
I've been kind of tense lately.

137
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,133
So...

138
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:29,498
- Bad day?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:34,658
- Well, I've had my share of those.
- Well, I don't doubt that.

140
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:39,254
I don't really feel like cooking, so you
guys decide what we're having delivered.

141
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:46,416
That shit was all over the news.
Six years old, right?

142
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,060
Fuck! Some people should just
not be allowed to have kids.

143
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,503
She just sat there like a ghost.

144
00:13:56,823 --> 00:13:59,098
Just like she'd been erased.

145
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:04,502
- I felt so fucking helpless.
- Oh, God.

146
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,942
That poor woman.

147
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:16,017
There's a tribe in Nigeria that
throws a dead baby's body...

148
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:18,414
...into the bush because they believe
if buried...

149
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:23,260
...the dead infant would offend the
earth gods which bring fertility and food.

150
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:26,541
The Chinese consider the death
of a child a bad death.

151
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:29,781
The parents and grandparents
aren't expected to go to the funeral.

152
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:33,499
Or the Balinese mother who's counseled
to be cheerful after her infant's death...

153
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:39,933
...because grief makes one vulnerable
to illness and malevolent demons.

154
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:44,254
Well, that was informative.

155
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:49,981
Yeah, I thought it'd be good to read
up on your boyfriend's line of work.

156
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:54,898
What a man does is...
Well, it's who he is.

157
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,817
Right, Nate?

158
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:00,534
Yeah.

159
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:03,305
A man should know the history
of his chosen profession...

160
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,581
...if he expects to be
anything but an amateur.

161
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,614
- So I'm an amateur.
- I prefer the term dilettante.

162
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,139
And what are you, Billy?

163
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,422
Running around with your camera,
taking pictures of people's lives?

164
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:15,700
Boys.

165
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:19,540
You think knowing a bunch of arcane
National Geographic shit is gonna...

166
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:23,175
...help me cope with a 6-year-old
who shot himself in the head?

167
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,619
There are plenty of places in the world
where a kid dying is pretty common.

168
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,499
But we can't deal with it,
because a dead child...

169
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:38,779
...is the greatest failure of a culture that
believes it's reversed the order of nature.

170
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:41,102
This was an accident.
This wasn't nature.

171
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,941
You know what
I find interesting?

172
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:50,142
If you lose a spouse,
you're called a widow or a widower.

173
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:55,022
If you're a child and you lose
your parents, then you're an orphan.

174
00:15:55,626 --> 00:16:00,700
But what's the word to describe
a parent who loses a child?

175
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,418
I guess that's just too fucking
awful to even have a name.

176
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,899
- I was worried you weren't gonna show.
- I just got tied up at work.

177
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,098
Believe me, I need this
after the day I had.

178
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,422
This ought to help.

179
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,504
- Oh, what is it?
- X. Ecstasy.

180
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:39,096
- You ever done it?
- No, can't say that I have.

181
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:41,059
You're gonna love it.

182
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,704
- Are you gonna take one too?
- I'm already there. Let's dance.

183
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:50,217
- I'm not a very good dancer.
- You will be.

184
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,225
David.

185
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,460
David. Here,
you gotta keep drinking this.

186
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,658
She was only 63.

187
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:43,587
That's so young.

188
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,461
Isn't that young?

189
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:50,139
Have you thought about what kind
of funeral you'd like for your mother?

190
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,817
It has to be beautiful.
It has to be beautiful.

191
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,378
Well, we can offer you a wide
variety of services ranging from...

192
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:09,424
...simple to more formal to...
To anything you might need.

193
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,578
Yes, anything at all.

194
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:26,026
It's a good thing
I was there, you know?

195
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:29,539
I mean, Gabe was so wrecked
I was the one who had to trash his weed.

196
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:33,264
Seriously, if the police found that shit,
it'd be way worse, you know?

197
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:34,988
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey.

198
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,148
- How's Gabe?
- He's okay, I guess.

199
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,669
- Well, have you talked to him?
- Not really.

200
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,102
Well, are you gonna see him later?

201
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,465
I don't know. It's real weird over there.

202
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,061
- The mother's, like, all freaked.
- Yeah, but what about Gabe?

203
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,020
Look, Morticia, I'm not interfering.
It's too much to get into, you know?

204
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,147
- I thought you were his friend.
- Why don't you fuck off, bitch?

205
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,189
If you're so worried, why don't you go
fuck him again? That'll cheer him up.

206
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,382
Nice, that's nice.

207
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,543
Yeah.

208
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,187
By the way, Parker told me
how one of your testicles is, like...

209
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,905
...freakishly small, like a peanut.

210
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:27,504
- Is that true?
- That's not true.

211
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,104
For later.

212
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:05,463
- You have a headache, dear?
- Yeah, I thought I did.

213
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,505
I'm throwing in a load of laundry
if you need some done.

214
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,710
By the way, I'm going camping
with Hiram this weekend.

215
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,631
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Great.

216
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,464
I'm doing whites first.

217
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:28,582
- Fuck. David, David.
- David. David?

218
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:32,501
David! David?

219
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,180
Are you all right? You look pale.

220
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:39,670
No, I'm fine.
It's just a headache, that's all.

221
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:50,111
Okay, you're in this, like, total
danger zone. Gabe Dimas is a dick.

222
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:54,192
I'm sorry his brother's dead, but
don't think that means he's not a dick.

223
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,425
I just haven't seen him around,
so I was worried.

224
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,785
If you hook up with him now,
it's gonna be like total emotional rape.

225
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:06,504
Whatever he feels for you is gonna be
wrapped up in some guilt-grief fuckfest.

226
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:11,150
You better stay away from that shit.
I'm not kidding.

227
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:21,787
So you failed a test.
Big whoop.

228
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:25,304
You want to be helpful to the people
that walk in through your door...

229
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,664
...so you have to be
one of those people.

230
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,067
Okay.

231
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:35,188
I chose three funeral homes
from the yellow pages at random.

232
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:39,353
I've always felt an uncontrolled sample
group provides more reliable data.

233
00:21:39,554 --> 00:21:43,024
What, you want us to pretend
to be purchasing a funeral?

234
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:46,385
Look up the first address.
I think it's in Sherman Oaks.

235
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:49,745
Come on, it'll be fun.

236
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:03,189
Hello? Gabe?

237
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:07,105
Is anybody home?

238
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:15,432
Oh, Mrs. Dimas, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

239
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,110
Is Gabe around?

240
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,872
- We can still leave.
- Why? What are you afraid of?

241
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:03,509
Humiliating myself,
wasting someone's valuable time.

242
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,229
Don't be so left-brained.

243
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:18,628
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

244
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:22,306
Now, how can I help?

245
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:26,665
It's my parents.

246
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:32,714
They were killed this morning
in an accident.

247
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:35,995
I'm terribly sorry.

248
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:40,587
It was a...
A helicopter...

249
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:44,266
...went down
and there was an explosion.

250
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:47,513
Oh, God.
I can't do this.

251
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:53,396
It's not right.
They were in the prime of their lives.

252
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:56,515
Everybody dies.
We all die.

253
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,787
Everything we ever care
about will disappear.

254
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:02,148
So, what's the fucking
point of living?

255
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:12,155
Can I suggest matching caskets?

256
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:16,426
That's it?

257
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:19,629
That's what you have to offer me
in my time of grief? Merchandise?

258
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,873
We have nothing
to learn here.

259
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,635
Water purifier.
Rope.

260
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,632
Bear bell.
Flashlight.

261
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:38,306
Toilet paper.
And, yes, it's biodegradable.

262
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,270
Bird caller.
Binoculars.

263
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:44,790
I'm sure you have everything. I know
you have everything. You always do.

264
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:49,549
It wouldn't be fun to get up there and
realize we forgot the matches, would it?

265
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:53,307
Or the champagne.

266
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,986
Hiram, that's just decadent.

267
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:58,837
Was it expensive?
We shouldn't waste it.

268
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:02,471
Waste it?
It's our anniversary.

269
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:08,756
Claire, you're home early.
You remember Hiram.

270
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:10,951
Hi.

271
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,755
- How was school?
- I have a headache.

272
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,833
Hiram and I are going camping.

273
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:32,515
Your dinner's in the refrigerator
and I'll be back tomorrow.

274
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,597
It's a very beautiful
time of the year.

275
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,550
Okay.
Well, you two have fun.

276
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:54,068
We should probably leave
if we want to beat the rush-hour traffic.

277
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,668
Ruth?
Honey, what's wrong?

278
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,677
My children don't
need me anymore.

279
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,391
Let's think of this as a celebration...

280
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,352
...of your uncle's life.

281
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,710
Now, the Titan is an excellent choice
for a distinguished gentleman.

282
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,438
It's solid mahogany. It's hand-finished.
Burlwood and nickel accents.

283
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,835
And Grace Field...

284
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,112
Grace Field
is a lovely place for interment.

285
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,709
It's serene.
It's pastoral.

286
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,829
How much?

287
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,112
Well, after you sign the contract,
we take care of everything.

288
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,110
There's no worry.
There's no pain.

289
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,991
How much?

290
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,714
It comes to just
under $20,000.

291
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:57,440
You're charging $ 12,000
for the Titan?

292
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,916
What is that,
like a 300 percent markup?

293
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,395
I could come down to 10.

294
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:07,553
And Grace Field is in between
a power station and a freeway.

295
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,833
There are nicer cemeteries.

296
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,635
But they're just a little
bit more expensive.

297
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,069
No, thanks.

298
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:22,431
We'll try and find somewhere that
doesn't just want to swindle us.

299
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,398
Nice tie.

300
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:35,670
- This business is a total racket.
- What business isn't?

301
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,192
You know, sometimes
I wish I could be this...

302
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:43,593
...completely selfish asshole
that didn't give a shit about anything...

303
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:47,477
...and I could just work at some mindless
job that paid me a fuckload of money.

304
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:50,839
- No, you don't.
- It would make my life a lot easier.

305
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,715
You don't want
your life to be easy.

306
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,481
Gabe?

307
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,081
Hi.

308
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,313
I didn't know if
anybody was home.

309
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:16,991
Did you ring the bell?

310
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:22,398
I just... I came by
to drop off this stuff.

311
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:25,640
Okay.

312
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:29,360
It's my brother's soccer clothes.

313
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:32,077
I thought that he might
like to get buried in them.

314
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:34,560
You think that's okay?

315
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:40,921
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's really nice.

316
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:45,000
I went to your house.

317
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:48,479
You see my mom?

318
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah.

319
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,675
Just like a zombie.
Just sits there.

320
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:03,115
I don't know why she blames herself.
It's my fault. I killed him.

321
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,922
Gabe, no.
It was an accident.

322
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:09,999
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been watching him.

323
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:15,873
My mom can't even find Anthony's dad
to tell him what happened.

324
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,996
Probably moved.
We haven't seen him in, like, two years.

325
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,479
Oh, that sucks.

326
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:26,633
He's a fucking drunken dipshit. He used
to kick my ass just to prove he could.

327
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,764
You know when people would call you
those things like...

328
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,960
..."cemetery girl" and "Vampira"?

329
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,002
Yeah.

330
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:40,554
I never thought that was funny.

331
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:50,724
I should go. Would you just
make sure your brother gets these?

332
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:52,522
Of course.

333
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:57,640
Hey, look. If you need
anything, like to talk...

334
00:29:57,885 --> 00:30:01,798
...or something,
you can call me.

335
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,438
All right.

336
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:18,082
- Where do you want to hang the food?
- Can't it wait till after dinner?

337
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:21,834
I've already taken out what we're
going to eat. I'd rather not risk it.

338
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:24,644
I'm sorry it's inconvenient...

339
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:27,723
...but would you prefer we were mauled
in our sleep by bears?

340
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,076
Ruth?
You need to relax.

341
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:44,357
Hello, I'm Rosemary.
How can I help you?

342
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:47,763
Hi. I need to make
arrangements for a funeral.

343
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,399
All right.

344
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:54,516
My wife's in the restroom.
She'll be out in a minute.

345
00:30:54,766 --> 00:31:00,124
- Can I ask who the funeral is for?
- It's for me.

346
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:07,557
Bet you don't get too many people
shopping for their own funeral.

347
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:12,078
It happens. Most people who know
they're going to die want to have a say.

348
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:18,166
Planning it with your husband could be
a meaningful process for you both.

349
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,555
- Is it cancer?
- Yeah.

350
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,998
It's everywhere.
Liver now.

351
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:33,037
- Brenda.
- My husband hates me doing this.

352
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:36,796
He wants me to spend this time
doing things I always dreamed of...

353
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:40,363
...but never gave
myself permission to...

354
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,478
Pardon me.

355
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:51,680
The coughing blood and pissing needles
thing kind of gets in the way.

356
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:57,924
- He just wants you to be happy.
- He just doesn't want me to die.

357
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:02,243
Okay, it's just too fucked up, Brenda.
I can't do it. I can't.

358
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,477
- He's not ready.
- It's hard for him.

359
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,606
Probably harder
than it is for you.

360
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:14,527
That was the most fucked up
thing you've ever done to me.

361
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,207
- Sorry.
- That was like the shit...

362
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,041
...you pulled on those doctors
to get a rise out of them.

363
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,324
- Are you gonna start barking at me?
- I might.

364
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:26,238
- What you did just now was not funny!
- Well, it wasn't meant to be.

365
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:30,960
You counsel people about
death every day, Nate...

366
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:33,164
...when death is what
you're most afraid of.

367
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,360
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Of course I'm afraid of it.

368
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:38,917
- What sane person isn't?
- I'm not.

369
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,961
Yeah, well, I said, what sane person.

370
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,165
- Hello.
- Hey.

371
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,805
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing, I just...

372
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,167
I just wanted to
talk to somebody.

373
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:28,004
- What are you doing tonight?
- I don't know. What are you doing?

374
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:29,648
You.

375
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:46,526
Shit. Fuck! Shit.

376
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,563
- What are you looking for?
- Aspirin.

377
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,443
I know there was a bottle
of aspirin in here.

378
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,362
Yeah, I took some earlier.

379
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,566
You did? Are you okay?

380
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,369
Yeah, why?

381
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,319
You found it, didn't you?
You found it and kept it for yourself.

382
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,082
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

383
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,328
You're wearing my shirt.

384
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,928
- Fuck!
- What is this, like a date?

385
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,161
Sort of.

386
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,726
No way, you're dating
the square-dancing guy?

387
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,566
- Weird.
- Weird why?

388
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,968
No, I get it. He's hot in a kind of
generic, Banana Republic kind of way.

389
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:36,847
- Claire, I really need that aspirin bottle.
- David, I really don't have it.

390
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,920
- What was in there?
- He gave me some pills.

391
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:45,487
Now I'll have to say, "Sorry, I lost
them because I'm this old-guy geek...

392
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:49,087
...and I'm completely uncool in this world
in which you seem to thrive...

393
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:52,328
...you perfect distillation
of human evolution."

394
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:56,242
Okay, is this split
personality thing...

395
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:59,841
...like, something that happens
when Mom goes out of town?

396
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:02,770
Because I like you
like this way better.

397
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:11,845
- Dinner was delicious.
- Food just tastes better outdoors.

398
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:14,361
Remember what we ate
the first time we went camping?

399
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,130
No.

400
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:20,166
- Pork chops with fire-roasted vegetables.
- Oh, yes.

401
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:24,888
The sky was so clear that night.
Just like tonight.

402
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:28,368
Did you know you're not supposed
to go camping if you're menstruating?

403
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,927
- What?
- It's true.

404
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,442
My husband buried
a young woman once.

405
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:36,366
She went on a camping trip.
She was menstruating.

406
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:39,245
A bear smelled the blood and
killed her in her sleeping bag.

407
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,847
Killed one of her friends too.

408
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:46,364
But we only buried her.
Not the friend.

409
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:54,731
I'm glad we're seeing
each other again.

410
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:58,042
Me too. It's nice.

411
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:03,973
- What's wrong?
- I've got a little bit of a headache.

412
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,882
I'm sorry I forgot those pills.

413
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,449
That's no big deal.
You can be my drug tonight.

414
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:29,448
So, what's with the guy who's been
staring at you since we got here?

415
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:38,806
Shit! That's Keith.
We dated.

416
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:42,489
- He's pretty hot. You guys still friends?
- Not really.

417
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:46,528
- Why not? I'm friends with my exes.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

418
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,292
He's coming over.
Is he into three-ways?

419
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:53,002
He's a cop, so don't mention
the drugs or anything.

420
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:56,328
- Sure, Dad.
- David.

421
00:36:57,334 --> 00:37:00,804
- Keith, hi. How's it going?
- Good. It's going good.

422
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:04,408
This is the last place
I'd ever expect to see you.

423
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:06,969
Yeah. Well, it was Kurt's idea.
Kurt, this is Keith.

424
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,324
- Hey.
- Hi.

425
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:13,173
Kurt teaches square dancing.

426
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:16,172
Tried to get David to go dancing
when we were together.

427
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,570
Told me he didn't
even like to dance.

428
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,043
Thanks.

429
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:26,483
- Eddie, this is David and...
- Kurt. Hi.

430
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,093
Hi.

431
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,207
Hi.

432
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:35,772
- So how'd you guys meet?
- Eddie's an EMT.

433
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,970
Met on the job.
Newlyweds in a car crash.

434
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,445
He saved the bride
right in front of me.

435
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:47,894
- What about the groom?
- Didn't make it.

436
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:51,650
The bride had eternity with the man
she loved right in front of her...

437
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,569
...then you go save her and
she ends up left behind, alone.

438
00:37:57,815 --> 00:37:59,453
That's one way
of looking at it.

439
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:05,443
Well, it's good to see you.

440
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:09,734
- Yeah, nice meeting you.
- You too.

441
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:18,695
Well, of course he's dating
Mr. Fucking Super Guy ER.

442
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,969
I bet they have great sex,
I mean, with the uniforms and all.

443
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:26,726
I dated a cop once. Total control freak.
Now, firemen on the other hand...

444
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:30,770
Is dating an excuse for you to figure out
who you wanna be when you grow up?

445
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,728
I don't know.
Is dating like an excuse...

446
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,246
...for you to see who you wished
you'd been when you were my age?

447
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:43,449
- Let's get out of here.
- Why?

448
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:44,891
Come on.

449
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:14,088
David. Wait, David.
Look...

450
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,816
- Who was that?
- Just a guy I know.

451
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,294
He wants to go home with us.

452
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,250
- I don't think so.
- Come on, you'll love him.

453
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,134
- I promise, he's a total fuck machine.
- I said, no.

454
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,974
Why not? Why are you
taking this so seriously?

455
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,371
Because I'm a serious guy.
I bury people for a living.

456
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,731
Well, that shit's in your head.

457
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,813
Yeah, you're right.
That shit is in my head.

458
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,858
Look, go. Have fun. I'm just too...

459
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,097
I'm sorry that I can't...

460
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,489
I'm sorry. Bye.

461
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:07,531
You really spooked me, Bren.

462
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:14,220
What?
The idea of me dying?

463
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:16,859
Well, yeah.

464
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:20,130
I will die someday.

465
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,171
We die, Nate.

466
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:33,332
We all die.

467
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:06,494
Hello?

468
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:56,412
You certainly took
your sweet time getting here.

469
00:43:56,703 --> 00:44:01,697
- You'll ruin that shirt.
- Who cares?

470
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:13,622
What, you're hitting on me now?
Two guys aren't enough, you slut?

471
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:17,452
Oh, dear.
I suppose I owe you an apology.

472
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:20,815
- Why? I'm dead.
- Yes, but I was seeing Hiram before you...

473
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:24,653
I was gone long before I died.

474
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:27,298
You'd like Hiram. He's kind.
He makes me laugh.

475
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:32,175
- I got my money on the florist.
- Oh, heavens no, Nathaniel.

476
00:44:32,384 --> 00:44:35,182
The man is a complete savage.

477
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:43,142
Oh, God. This is the hearse
that was always stalling, isn't it?

478
00:44:43,344 --> 00:44:46,541
Remember after that funeral in Malibu
for that jazz musician?

479
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:50,817
We broke down on the side of the PCH
and we made love in the back.

480
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,373
If this baby could talk.

481
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:59,977
Nathaniel, what happened to us?
We were so in love once.

482
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:02,334
Life happened to us.

483
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:07,502
I buried hundreds of people
and we watched each other grow old.

484
00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:10,654
- But we're not old.
- Well, technically speaking...

485
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:13,254
...I'm as old as
I'm ever gonna get.

486
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:16,897
We were such children
when we met.

487
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:20,017
Then we watched
those children disappear.

488
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:31,065
Damn it! Stalled again.
Won't go forward. Won't go back.

489
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,938
Well, these can't be helping.

490
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:56,625
No tears.

491
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:02,783
- I miss what we had.
- So find it again.

492
00:46:53,987 --> 00:46:57,900
What a beautiful day.
You should have woken me up.

493
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,780
I thought you could use the sleep
after the night we had.

494
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:04,263
You've never been that
passionate with me before.

495
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,379
Thank you for a wonderful night.

496
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:12,865
- Last night?
- You were spectacular.

497
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:16,940
What?

498
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:34,420
- Do I just sit anywhere?
- Wherever you'd like.

499
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:47,662
- Nice suit.
- Thank you. Bought it last week.

500
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:50,302
You need more than one suit
to be a funeral director.

501
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:52,738
No, you need
to pass a test first.

502
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:55,542
You just can't let
go of that, can you?

503
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:59,746
- I failed the first time I took it.
- You did not.

504
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:05,945
Yes, I did. I fuck up a lot more
than you might think. I fuck up a lot.

505
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:28,428
- Hey.
- Hi.

506
00:48:30,029 --> 00:48:34,819
- How are you holding up?
- Okay, I guess.

507
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:37,384
It's just weird.

508
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,502
Why are you being
so nice to me?

509
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:48,418
- You little bastard!
- Sam, we didn't think you'd show.

510
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,660
- Stop it!
- Stop! Leave him alone!

511
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,543
I'm gonna kill you,
you useless fuck!

512
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,308
Okay, everybody calm down.

513
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,820
Probably wasted out of your mind,
whacking off!

514
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,141
Let my kid shoot himself!

515
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,339
You're gonna blame him?

516
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,660
Where the fuck were you
for the past two years?

517
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,265
All right, just take it easy.

518
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,863
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

519
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,301
- Don't worry about it, I'll deal with it.
- Thank you.

520
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,987
Who the fuck
was that little bitch out there?

521
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,187
That's my sister.

522
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,663
You should warn her. Gabriel has
been a fuckup his whole life.

523
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:45,749
When I lived there, he used
to drive his mother nuts...

524
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:48,709
...with all the shit that he'd do.
Staying out all night.

525
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:51,620
No fucking responsibility.

526
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:56,066
- That's my kid who's dead.
- I know.

527
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:05,670
It was my gun.
I bought it for Vickie.

528
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,902
Because I was gonna leave for a while,
you know? Go up north for a job.

529
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,181
Make some extra money.

530
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,339
How could he let
something like this happen?

531
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:20,349
It's not right.
It's just not fucking right!

532
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,186
Jesus, he was 6!

533
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:26,743
Everybody dies.

534
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,343
Some of us live to be 100, some never
make it through the first day.

535
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:33,389
That's just a fucking
fact of nature, pal.

536
00:50:33,632 --> 00:50:35,224
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

537
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:37,223
You can punch as many
people as you want.

538
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:39,946
It's not gonna change
the fact that boy is dead.

539
00:50:40,152 --> 00:50:43,269
And your chance to be
in his life is over.

540
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:48,429
Did you use that time well
or did you just piss it away?

541
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:52,989
And your own fucking life
is a ticking clock too.

542
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,702
Everybody's is.

543
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:31,628
- Mom, you're home. I was worried.
- Worried, why?

544
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:36,788
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, David, you must go camping.

545
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,553
It's so spectacular
up there right now.

546
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:44,588
Spring is such a full time.
So much color, so much detail.

547
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:47,910
And the smells.
It's like nothing else.

548
00:51:48,113 --> 00:51:51,185
And you're okay?
No sickness, no headaches?

549
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:54,147
Oh, no.
I had one on the trip...

550
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:57,630
...but I took some aspirin
and it just disappeared.

551
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,550
Yes, well, aspirin is
damn good stuff.

552
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:03,665
How was the service?

553
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:07,150
There was a fight that broke out,
but I let Nate take care of it.

554
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,790
I'm glad you boys are working
so well together now.

555
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:16,312
Claire, you look terrible.
Are you not feeling well?

556
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:21,665
I'm just a little wrecked.
We buried my friend's brother today.

557
00:52:21,914 --> 00:52:24,667
He's your friend?
I had no idea.

558
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:27,707
Yeah.

559
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:31,825
He's the foot guy.

560
00:52:32,994 --> 00:52:35,064
Oh, my God.

561
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,228
Good night.

562
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:50,589
There's so much you wish you could
protect your children from.

563
00:52:58,035 --> 00:52:59,627
Night, Mom.

564
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,307
Night, dear.

565
00:53:54,758 --> 00:54:45,913
