1
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:11,443
She really looks like Nate.

2
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,886
Let me see.

3
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,329
Claire, they're in order.

4
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:19,165
Do vegans breastfeed?

5
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:20,891
You got butter on it.

6
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:24,124
Sorry, Mom, I know you only have
2,000 other ones just like it.

7
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,330
But this one was the first time
she ever smiled at me.

8
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,812
You sure it wasn't gas?

9
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:32,932
- No, I know gas. Nate...
- Was an extremely gassy baby. We know.

10
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,083
But David never made a peep.

11
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,846
And no one remembers
anything about Claire.

12
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:41,005
I'm starting to think
I walked in off the street when I was nine.

13
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,367
That's not true, dear.

14
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,809
David, Claire's graduation
is this Saturday at 3:00.

15
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:49,203
- Did you hear that, Nate? Saturday at 3:00.
- For what?

16
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,523
My idiotic graduation.
You don't have to come.

17
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:53,012
Of course he does.

18
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,290
- What's that?
- Just a few pictures of Maya.

19
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,808
Wait, you haven't even seen her?

20
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:12,212
It's weird that I can't have anything to do
with this kid, and you go take pictures.

21
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,012
Giving up custodial rights
doesn't mean you can't visit.

22
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,321
Lisa said that?

23
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:20,372
- I'm not getting in the middle of this.
- Well, then, don't. Stay out of it.

24
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:23,047
Whatever problems you and Lisa have,
I don't care.

25
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:27,092
But Maya is my granddaughter,
and I intend to be part of her life!

26
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:47,572
You okay?

27
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:50,407
Go away.

28
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,169
- Let me get someone for you.
- They can't help me.

29
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,127
I got it.

30
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,566
All right.

31
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,404
- I don't want you to see this shit.
- It's okay.

32
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:23,241
You can't wait for this to be over.

33
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,642
- I'm right here for you.
- So what?

34
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,963
I don't even know you.

35
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:33,812
Oh, fuck!

36
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:36,043
- It's okay.
- I can't breathe.

37
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:40,285
Nate, I'm not ready.

38
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,527
Help me.

39
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,451
It's gonna be okay.

40
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,285
Just try to let go.

41
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,244
Go into the light?

42
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,372
There's no fucking light.

43
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:00,125
Please, just...

44
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,089
- just try to let go.
- I don't want to.

45
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,686
Let it go.

46
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,123
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

47
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,772
It's okay.

48
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:17,572
It's okay.

49
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,289
Yes, I need to see Dr. DiPaolo
as soon as possible.

50
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:46,205
I can't wait two weeks.
This is an emergency.

51
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,761
I have to schedule an embolization.

52
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:51,452
No, but...

53
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:55,602
I think I waited too long already, all right?
I have to fucking do this.

54
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,206
Nate, this is John Gerson.

55
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,521
Thank you.

56
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,252
Tomorrow at 11:00. Yes, thank you.

57
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,248
Bitch.

58
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,482
From the DCA.

59
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,007
I'd like to look around, if you don't mind.

60
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,323
We don't have an inspection till February.

61
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,722
- We received a complaint.
- From who?

62
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,571
I'm not at liberty to say.

63
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,646
If I could use your little boys' room,
then we'll start with your billing records.

64
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,008
It's that door directly across.

65
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,486
I thought Kroehner folded.

66
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:29,168
This must be the final mindfuck
of Mitzi Dalton Huntley.

67
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,046
Claire Fisher.

68
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,245
Can I start again?

69
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,328
Fuck!

70
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:48,087
Claire?

71
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,961
Claire!

72
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,810
So I had this idea:
We should put a pool in the backyard.

73
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:06,212
Careful of the puddle.

74
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:07,772
That's nasty.

75
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:12,444
A little kidney-shaped pool. We can dip
in the summer. It's not even that expensive.

76
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,763
We're paying back your sister.

77
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:18,605
She doesn't need to be paid back.
She doesn't even want it.

78
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:23,130
You only don't want to be paid back when
you want to have something over someone.

79
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:27,764
Do you know much she's getting paid
to play that slutty neighbor on the WB?

80
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,163
- Where's my hot sauce?
- It's on there.

81
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,882
I don't see why we can't get
one thing nice for ourselves.

82
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,168
Don't talk about the money in front of him.

83
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,005
Get rid of the food!

84
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:45,204
I hope I didn't interrupt your lunch.

85
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,329
I'm sure they weren't eating.

86
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:50,246
This is our embalmer's wife.
She was just stopping by.

87
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,086
Does she have a license to be down here?

88
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,885
Shouldn't Mr. Buchbinder
be in the refrigerator?

89
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:13,490
I'm just about to take him
to the crematorium.

90
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,048
Really?

91
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:19,445
It looks to me like you've got yourself
a no-vacancy situation at the fridge motel.

92
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,205
He's not even staying here.

93
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,885
I'd love to let this slide...

94
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:27,125
but since Mr. Buchbinder paid for two days'
refrigeration in his pre-need contract...

95
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,967
I'm going to have to write you up
for a consumer disclosure citation.

96
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:41,373
And we are knee-deep in human waste.

97
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:54,089
Why did your grades take
such a plunge in the spring?

98
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:58,569
I don't know. I guess I sort of
stopped relating to high school.

99
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,928
Did something happen last year?

100
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:03,970
Well, bad boyfriend.

101
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,442
Okay.

102
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:12,928
That's it, unless you have any questions,
or anything else you'd like us to know.

103
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,965
Well, good luck, Claire,
it was nice to meet you.

104
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:26,205
Also, not that this is, whatever...

105
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,922
but my father died last year.

106
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:31,726
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:37,283
I don't think it had anything to do with
getting bad grades, but maybe it did a little.

108
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:40,683
It would if it were me.
Thank you for letting me know.

109
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,083
You know, I'm not like,
"Oh, poor me" or anything.

110
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,722
You know, I just thought of this.

111
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,050
But before that happened...

112
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,603
I always liked to make stuff for people,
like presents, or whatever...

113
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,491
and then, when my dad died, I couldn't...

114
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:03,447
I don't even know how to talk about it,
I mean, even now, you know.

115
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:07,082
But then I started to make stuff
that was sort of about that at first...

116
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:10,802
you know, and then stuff
that was about other things, too.

117
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,963
And I'm sorry that I'm rambling, now...

118
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:17,012
but, I guess, I just wanted you to know
that I feel like I have this...

119
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:20,492
way now of, like, dealing.

120
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,489
And it's so much better.

121
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,010
I'm sorry, excuse me.

122
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,930
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This is so queer.

123
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:40,289
It's fine.
I constantly cry at inappropriate moments.

124
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,364
Yeah, but I really don't.

125
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,246
Here, sweetie.

126
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,126
Thank you.

127
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:58,967
Thanks.

128
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,447
We'll have your ashes on Saturday.

129
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:20,163
He actually asked that I be here for it
to start the machine.

130
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,402
Can't do it today.

131
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,610
A pacemaker exploded in the retort,
so they're fixing the burners.

132
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:27,969
Come back tomorrow afternoon.
We'll torch him then.

133
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,404
Is Taylor in her room? I got her
an air purifier that's also a humidifier.

134
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:59,441
Taylor!

135
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:07,086
Where's all her stuff?

136
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:09,687
My parents came today
to take her down to San Diego.

137
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,729
- For how long?
- For good.

138
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:13,368
Why?

139
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,442
There's no way we could've kept her.
Not after what I did.

140
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,010
We could have tried.

141
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:27,804
- You could have told me...
- I got suspended today.

142
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:29,565
Oh, my God, until when?

143
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:32,565
It doesn't matter. I'm not going back there.

144
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:38,887
- You don't know how you'll feel...
- Don't tell me what I know!

145
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,085
<i>You know, it's summer.</i>

146
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:57,051
Maybe it's 'cause, when I was growing up,
there were seasons...

147
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:01,126
but it still gives me this charge.
And it's not just the nipples.

148
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:07,092
It's that the whole world's out there,
feeling sexy in their skin.

149
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,883
I can't sit with a beer in my hand
and watch the ass parade anymore.

150
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:16,124
Because it takes me out of my f-ing reality.

151
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,124
It's a drug.

152
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,928
That little shine of sweat.

153
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,370
Some chick in traffic.

154
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:31,847
I just want to jump in that car
and lick it right off of her.

155
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,846
On my wife, it makes me sick.

156
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,892
I can see the stains under her arms...

157
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:45,963
the red bumps where she shaves,
all the f-ing details.

158
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,448
But thanks to my higher power,
and this program...

159
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,445
I haven't crossed my bottom line
in three years.

160
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:58,762
And for me, that means no sex
outside my marriage.

161
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:03,371
No prostitutes, no strip clubs,
no masturbation.

162
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:08,529
And it also seems to mean
no sex in my marriage.

163
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,569
I stopped doing all the other stuff...

164
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:14,282
because I wanted to learn
how to be more intimate with my wife.

165
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,532
And I have.

166
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,092
I love her.

167
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,723
I love her more than anything.

168
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,970
I just can't touch her.

169
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:34,172
I couldn't even kiss her
any more than I could kiss my own mother.

170
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:38,769
The fact is, I have this f-ing disease,
and this is how it's showing up today.

171
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,128
So, thanks. Three years, right?

172
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:58,368
You really have to love someone
to have their face burned into your flesh.

173
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:00,409
Or just be really drunk.

174
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,843
The lowest I could get was 38.

175
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:07,170
Thousand? The lowest?

176
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:11,481
They have to dig up the whole foundation
of the house to replace those pipes.

177
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:13,803
We can try another contractor.

178
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,961
- Fuck!
- What is this?

179
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,732
We're going to have to shut down
the home for a while.

180
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,486
- What?
- This inspection just totally fucked us.

181
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,962
The maximum fine is $2,500 at a time...

182
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,329
We've two weeks to fix the drainage system.
We don't have the money.

183
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,768
And Kroehner
can't even buy us out anymore.

184
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,244
So what does this mean?

185
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,012
We hope you'll consider
taking something temporary...

186
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,402
so when we work things out,
you can come back.

187
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,688
You mean if you work things out.

188
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,809
We know it's a lot to ask.

189
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:57,447
Scott?

190
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,845
Candace Bouvard.

191
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:08,525
I am so sorry, Candace.
I had sex with like 200 women last year...

192
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:11,448
and all the faces are a blur.

193
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,767
Why are you only taking
50 milligrams of the Dilantin?

194
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:17,765
- That's what you prescribed.
- But you're still having seizures.

195
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,492
You were supposed to tell me
so I could adjust the dosage.

196
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,849
- Well, you didn't tell me that.
- I'm sure I did.

197
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,891
Now there's a bleed.
This was so unnecessary.

198
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:33,452
What's a bleed?

199
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,046
That's blood.

200
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,925
The AVM ruptured,
probably during your last seizure.

201
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,607
- Wouldn't I have felt that?
- Apparently not.

202
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,606
If I'd done the embolization last summer,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

203
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,161
AVM is very treatable, if you treat it.

204
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:49,891
Wait a minute, you didn't...

205
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:54,323
- Okay, I want to do it now.
- So would I, if I were you.

206
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:58,247
But, at this point, my only option is
immediate cranial surgery.

207
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,085
What does that mean?

208
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:04,689
It means it looks like this sucker
is bordering an eloquent area in the brain.

209
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:08,686
- Well, you said it wasn't last time.
- You must have misheard me.

210
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:11,129
It's a lot of information.

211
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:15,725
What does that mean?

212
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,771
I'm not gonna lie to you.
There's a high risk of paralysis...

213
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,447
Ioss of speech, vegetation, or death.

214
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:25,282
But I have a very strong record
with this kind of surgery.

215
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,289
- How many deaths?
- Not many.

216
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:33,052
I can't fit this in tomorrow.
I'm gonna have to come in Saturday for this.

217
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,249
But I need your blood work done today.

218
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,167
Connie will tell you
where to go for that when you check out.

219
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,927
I really don't like the idea that I'm sick.

220
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,482
Nobody does.

221
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,326
Come on.
It's a little self-indulgent, don't you think?

222
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,802
When there are people dying of leukemia,
or whatever.

223
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,212
These guys are like:

224
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:58,411
"It's not my fault I blew 25 guys last night.
I have a disease." I mean, deal with it.

225
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:02,042
When I tried to deal with it, I ended up
with a sexual harassment lawsuit...

226
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,966
filed against me
by half the female associates in my firm.

227
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,168
Fuck.

228
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,486
I'm really glad we didn't... You and I.

229
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,324
I was spreading gonorrhea
all over LA last summer.

230
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,848
So when did you admit you were powerless?

231
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,891
- I haven't yet, by the way.
- I can tell.

232
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,806
Five months, two weeks,
and three days ago.

233
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:39,563
And now your life is
just one long hot fuck with God?

234
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,442
- I'm an atheist, actually.
- Yeah?

235
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:47,003
And who do you
turn over your will and your life to?

236
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:49,726
I just pray to nothing.

237
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,125
I say, "Dear God,
who I don't believe in, help me...

238
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,170
"with whatever it is."

239
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:02,043
To stop thinking about...

240
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:07,002
undressing this incredibly sexy woman
who I am trying to have a real moment with.

241
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:10,004
Or something like that.

242
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,686
Does it work?

243
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,968
Unfortunately, yeah, it does.

244
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,404
Well, I'm not gonna stop drinking
or smoking pot.

245
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:26,407
All you can do
is just take it one day at a time.

246
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:29,769
All those fucking slogans
make me want to tear off my clothes...

247
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,242
and run screaming out of the room.

248
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,490
You know, I'm curious.

249
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:37,167
How does having compulsive sex
with strangers...

250
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:40,325
no close relationship
with friends, or family...

251
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,450
a job that you hate,
and a broken engagement...

252
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,044
feel manageable to you?

253
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,091
I didn't say
that my life wasn't unmanageable.

254
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:53,482
I just said that I hadn't admitted
that I was powerless.

255
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,165
I don't want to hate my parents
any more than I already do.

256
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:07,690
- You'll probably end up forgiving them.
- Well, I don't want to do that either.

257
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:13,847
I don't want to be one of those people
that walks around in pain all the time.

258
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,242
What about when you are in pain?

259
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,251
I choose not to be.

260
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,767
What's so bad about a little pain?

261
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,163
I feel like it'll kill me.

262
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,721
It won't.

263
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:37,924
I can't believe that guy blew up in the retort.

264
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:43,572
We usually check for the pacemaker,
but this guy was, like, 20.

265
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,532
Go ahead.

266
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,688
And built. He looked like
he worked out five hours a day.

267
00:21:56,093 --> 00:22:00,052
Vanity. These guys are out there
taking pills, getting implants.

268
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,330
Men are the new women.

269
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:04,768
- Yeah, no kidding.
- I hate gyms.

270
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,048
All those people on machines
staring at the TVs.

271
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:10,125
They looks like pod people
training to live among the humans.

272
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,602
Shit!

273
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,205
Hang on. I got to reposition him.

274
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:35,606
I've got to make sure the chest
is right under the main burner.

275
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:38,366
That's where
most of your mass and fluids are.

276
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,331
All that stuff that really fuels the burn.

277
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,962
We used to leave it chunky, so people
would know it was real cremains...

278
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:01,125
not just wood chips,
like that place in Georgia.

279
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,449
But then we did this baby...

280
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:12,129
and the dad saw a little tooth,
and he freaked, like, "This isn't my baby!"

281
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:17,163
We had to get a doctor to explain to him
that they have teeth embedded in their jaws.

282
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,925
Man, he was upset.

283
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:23,128
But, you know, when a baby goes,
it's a lot of dead hope.

284
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:37,446
You going to Lisa's?

285
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:41,321
- I have every right to see my granddaughter.
- I'm coming with you.

286
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,045
Did you talk to her?

287
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,492
You've got a key?

288
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:49,929
Sometimes I stay with the baby
when Lisa has to work.

289
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:52,164
They should be here soon.

290
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,084
See? I told you...

291
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,529
Granny was gonna be here.

292
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,446
Hi, Granny.

293
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,251
Hello, sweet pea.

294
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,166
Carole made me come with her
to this intuitive nutritionist...

295
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,972
who told her she's allergic to everything.

296
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,362
She squeezed Carole's fingers
for 10 minutes...

297
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,889
and I had to spend two hours
looking for burdock root.

298
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,243
I think Erewhon has burdock.

299
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,041
Thanks.

300
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:51,646
I'm sorry to show up like this.
I won't stay long.

301
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,928
I'm really happy you're here.

302
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,010
You know who this is?

303
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,051
This is your daddy.

304
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:11,445
This is where you get your little mouth from.

305
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:18,888
Hi.

306
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,407
Hi, Maya.

307
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,408
I know you're thinking "Maya"
is "illusion" in Buddhism...

308
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:33,372
but it's also another name for Durga,
the Mother, in Sanskrit.

309
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,168
And, in Greek, it's "messenger of the Gods."

310
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:39,051
And my mother was half-Greek,
so, you know...

311
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,089
My gosh, she's so small.

312
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,242
Mom, come on.

313
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,688
You'll thank me when you're old.

314
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:50,492
I'll get it.

315
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,564
Hi, Barbara, how are you?

316
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,962
I'm fine. Did you get the tape?

317
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,971
She's just as precious as precious can be.

318
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:04,284
Hold on. Lisa, it's Barb.

319
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,489
Tell her I'll call her back.

320
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,572
Who's Barb?

321
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,646
My sister.

322
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,526
Carole's movie?

323
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:16,208
No, I just don't enjoy films
about retarded people.

324
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,443
But Lisa went to the premiere.

325
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,410
She said it was great.

326
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:26,370
Sorry about my mom.
I guess she's been a little Ionely.

327
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,604
She's a godsend.
She's been such a help to me.

328
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,285
She looked wonderful.

329
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,366
We altered a purple chiffon caftan
I had in the closet from the '<i>7</i>0s.

330
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:38,047
She's just so loving and fun.

331
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:41,645
I just hope I can be
half as good a mother as she is.

332
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,007
I'm sure you can.

333
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:44,606
Okay, bye, now.

334
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:49,846
- Ruth, is this the blanket?
- That's the one I made for Nate.

335
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,082
I love it.

336
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,650
In certain ways,
Lisa really reminds me of myself.

337
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,482
Something about the way
you two are together...

338
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,848
reminds me of your father and me.

339
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:09,606
I was raised
with a very small-town mentality...

340
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:13,049
and getting married was really the only way
you could have sex at all.

341
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,170
So, I never tried to find
the perfect someone, you know?

342
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,926
But that doesn't matter
when there are children.

343
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,368
It becomes its own very real kind of love.

344
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:24,684
- Mom, I'm not marrying Lisa.
- Did I say you should?

345
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:30,848
I think you should consider the profound
effect a child can have on your life.

346
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:34,926
Mom, you should find some place
and pull over for a minute.

347
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:37,925
- Why, are you all right, dear?
- No, I'm not.

348
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,401
Saturday?

349
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:46,451
I kind of need to do it as soon as possible.

350
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:51,490
Have you told David?

351
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,282
Yeah.

352
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,442
Would you like me to tell Claire?

353
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:03,692
She knows.

354
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:08,930
She saw me have a seizure,
so I had to tell her.

355
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:14,966
I'm sorry, Mom.

356
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,850
I'll go to the hospital with Nate...

357
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:31,005
David will take Robbie's video camera
to Claire's graduation...

358
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:32,811
so we can all watch it later.

359
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,043
- Mom...
- It's fine. I already asked him.

360
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,682
And he's bringing it over later
to show you how it works.

361
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,732
We're not going to my lame-ass graduation
when Nate is having major surgery.

362
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:45,043
Claire, Nate is going to be just fine.

363
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:48,364
There is no reason for this procedure
to ruin your special day.

364
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,842
It's not even special. I'm just going for you.

365
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,003
It is special. It's a rite of passage.

366
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:56,847
I'm not going to let you get overshadowed
by your brothers, like you always do.

367
00:28:56,933 --> 00:29:00,050
If Claire doesn't care about this,
I'd like to be with Nate, too.

368
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,442
David, god damn it, I am the mother here!

369
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,321
And I am a good one, no matter what
you think from your limited point of view.

370
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,483
This is what we are doing!

371
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,930
Now, who wants milk?

372
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,929
So? Now you can
get them to make you a partner.

373
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,129
It's Fisher & Sons, remember?

374
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,169
It's not Fisher & Sons & Diaz.

375
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:28,051
That was before
you had $100,000 they need.

376
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,966
I want to put it
in a mutual fund, or something.

377
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:34,443
Some, okay, but nothing's worth
as much as being your own boss.

378
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,331
Julio, check the bath isn't running over.

379
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,612
I don't know.

380
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:41,729
The business isn't even going so great.

381
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,646
So? You go in there, you make it go great.

382
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,445
He didn't do it.

383
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,206
Julio, turn off the bath!

384
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:51,328
I'll do it.

385
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:54,803
No, he needs to learn
to do something when I tell him.

386
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:59,491
You'll let the whole house get flooded
so you can teach him something?

387
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,166
Thank you.

388
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:10,246
I want to be cremated.
I don't want to be embalmed. No viewing.

389
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:14,203
This is very difficult for me.

390
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,649
Do you want me to fill it out by myself?

391
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,768
Yes.

392
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:24,727
- I don't think we should do this now.
- We have to, all right?

393
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:29,085
I don't want you
to have to deal with the funeral.

394
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:31,129
You're not going to die.

395
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,203
I have to get ready for it.

396
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:40,689
And I think you should, too.

397
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,923
- What about a service?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,491
I want Ari...

399
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:55,527
the rabbi who did Jeffrey Shapiro.

400
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,928
A rabbi? Why not Father Jack?

401
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,487
Is Father Jack doing your service?

402
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:05,725
No, but that's just because
I don't want to give him the wrong idea.

403
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,885
What kind of idea is he going to get
when you're dead?

404
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:12,966
I don't know, I just don't want him
cruising me in the afterlife.

405
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:19,605
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

406
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:23,845
What do you think the afterlife is?
Some sex club that never closes?

407
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:28,363
Yeah, and no one ever tells you
if it's heaven or hell.

408
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:34,124
Fuck, I am really scared.

409
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,161
Me, too.

410
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:39,883
I wish you could come with me.

411
00:31:40,213 --> 00:31:43,285
Okay, I'm not going to Claire's graduation.
Mom is insane.

412
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:46,604
No, go to the graduation.
That's not what I meant.

413
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:00,528
Oh, God!

414
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:48,045
You're home early.

415
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,646
Where were you?

416
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:58,083
Just getting something to eat.

417
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:03,289
I was going to make dinner.

418
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:05,409
You can still make dinner.

419
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:07,325
You mean for myself?

420
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:10,925
Whatever. I might be kind of hungry later.

421
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,565
You sure you want to eat that?

422
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:20,362
I was going to make
a poached Chilean sea bass and polenta.

423
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,442
With a wild mushroom cassoulet.

424
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,765
You could've gotten me something.

425
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:40,923
I didn't know you'd be home.

426
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:48,289
Did you do anything today?

427
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,728
What's that supposed to mean?

428
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:52,811
Did you call that guy?

429
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:55,771
I don't need to pay
to learn I can get a job in security.

430
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:58,162
I'm sure there're options
you don't know about.

431
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,847
I know a lot of ex-cops.
They all work in security.

432
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:03,572
What's wrong with security?
It's a national obsession.

433
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,166
It's the new freedom.

434
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,131
You know what?
My career isn't your problem.

435
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,643
I have new pictures of Maya.

436
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,291
Yes, I have seen.

437
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,648
The new ones? I don't think so.

438
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,369
Is very cute. I have seen.

439
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:48,762
You haven't seen these. The smiling ones?
I just got these yesterday.

440
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,402
Ruth, is not my grandbaby.
I don't need every day to see.

441
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,411
I quit. Consider this my two-week notice.

442
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:09,242
Because I don't looking at your photos?

443
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,403
No, I'm not growing in this environment.

444
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:14,132
And I want to be available
to help watch my granddaughter.

445
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:18,889
And since I don't have the money to help
pay for a sitter, it's the least I can do.

446
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:20,401
You take other job?

447
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,202
Eventually, I suppose I'll have to,
under the circumstances.

448
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,769
Okay, then, Ruth. Is also better for me.

449
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:30,923
This way only have to pay Robbie.

450
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,287
Well, yes.

451
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:35,843
And also, you should know, you may be
losing Fisher & Sons as a client.

452
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:40,290
We may close the business because there's
no money to replace the septic system!

453
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:42,568
This is my fault? Is that what you're saying?

454
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:46,771
No. I just thought you should know
you might be losing the account.

455
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:51,971
- I will pay you back this money.
- I said it was a gift.

456
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,692
Even though you said it was gift,
I will pay back.

457
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:58,561
Well, that's very sweet,
but we both know that's not possible.

458
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:05,769
Here, every week, I pay some part of it.

459
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,162
Here, this is the first payment.

460
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:13,411
$62.

461
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:17,049
It was a very slow week.

462
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:44,967
I did knock.

463
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:47,203
I'm sorry. Was that too loud?

464
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:51,207
I just thought I'd stop by, say hi.

465
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,248
Okay.

466
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:59,005
I thought you were going to that art school.

467
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,084
I so blew the interview.

468
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:04,131
There's no way.

469
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:07,209
I totally started bawling.

470
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,404
What do you mean, why?

471
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:16,328
I started talking about Dad,
for some, like, insane reason.

472
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,203
And I just fucking lost it.

473
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,893
So is this operation really serious?

474
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,524
Nah, I just gotta, you know,
get rid of this thing.

475
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,170
It's so not a big deal.

476
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,292
Well, good.

477
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:41,687
Because...

478
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:46,206
Just good.

479
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:53,204
Okay, that was
before you talked to me, so...

480
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,925
Did you take these? These are amazing.

481
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:01,531
Well, they're okay.

482
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:05,293
This guy's a total fucking freak...

483
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:07,690
but the pictures are awesome.

484
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,001
Thanks.

485
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:13,486
I thought you were going to yell at me.

486
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,770
I didn't yell. I was just looking out for you.

487
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:21,841
Okay, don't take this the wrong way...

488
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,446
and I know...

489
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:27,485
I have a tendency
to fall for kind of insane boys...

490
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,768
but you have a tendency...

491
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:34,287
to dole out the wisdom
like you're the Dalai Lama, or whatever...

492
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:40,044
and it's not like you're incredibly together
that I'm just dying for your advice.

493
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:43,569
I never said I was incredibly together.
I'm just a lot older.

494
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,804
Yeah, and I don't think
you're that much better than I am...

495
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,612
at the relationship thing, like, at all.

496
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,365
Well, I disagree.

497
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:56,127
No one I dated ever attacked anybody
with a knife or a gun.

498
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:58,328
Okay.

499
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:03,003
And I don't know what goes on
between you and Lisa, or Brenda...

500
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,288
or the other million missing girlfriends.

501
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,603
There have not been a million.

502
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:12,322
I just get the sense
that you're not fully dealing.

503
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,686
All right.

504
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:27,606
- Fine, I'll never give you advice again.
- No, give me advice...

505
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:31,449
just don't try and act like
you really know anything.

506
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:38,123
- Wait, is he nude?
- No.

507
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,282
God!

508
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,291
$50,000.

509
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,773
Do you have any idea
how much this business is worth?

510
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,083
Not much when it's shut down.

511
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,970
And I want to be equal partner.

512
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,725
- Rico, you...
- Wait!

513
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:05,209
I'm sorry I have to say this now,
but I think you might want another partner.

514
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,325
Not equal, no way.

515
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,164
$<i>7</i>5,000 for 25%.

516
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:28,681
Done!

517
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,606
All right, okay.

518
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:45,123
So I just wanted to tell you that I think
a lot of what you had to say...

519
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,647
- I'm so sorry.
- Just let me finish.

520
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:51,608
A lot of what you said was true.

521
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,447
I didn't have the right
to say anything to you.

522
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:58,364
I'm the one that's fucked up.

523
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:00,205
I am so fucked up.

524
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:02,882
Okay.

525
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:04,842
Maybe.

526
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:12,332
But you were right when you said that...

527
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:16,402
being with you made it easier for me
to feel so together.

528
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:20,565
That I was ready for something real,
and you weren't...

529
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:23,008
and that is just not really true.

530
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:25,882
Nate, I have a serious problem.

531
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:28,971
I think I'm...

532
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:32,682
God, I so don't want to say this.

533
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:36,922
Here.

534
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,721
I've been going to these meetings.

535
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:47,723
I went to one of these meetings
once up in Seattle. It freaked me out.

536
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:50,885
- Why?
- Just the people. It seemed like a cult.

537
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,770
No. What made you go?

538
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,369
I thought it might apply.

539
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:07,132
Well, it says in the book
that once you realize what it is...

540
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,522
and you work really hard, you can...

541
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:13,605
People have
this whole new experience of love.

542
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,210
Some people, I mean.

543
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:21,487
So what?

544
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:29,651
I really love you.

545
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:37,042
And I don't think I would have done
what I did if I didn't really love you.

546
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,683
That's a very strange thing to say.

547
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,604
But I think it's true.

548
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:48,965
It was the fear of...

549
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,723
feeling something...

550
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:55,888
real.

551
00:42:58,693 --> 00:42:59,808
Okay.

552
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,771
I love you, too.

553
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:15,845
I just wanted you to know that
even though you really pissed me off.

554
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:22,686
I still get so angry
if I let myself think about it...

555
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:24,411
Of course you do.

556
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,961
But I felt like this was something.

557
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,122
Being with you made me feel more...

558
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:35,329
Just feel more, I guess.

559
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,728
More than I used to feel.
More than I felt with anyone.

560
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:43,089
Everything I was running away from,
I don't even know what it is.

561
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:45,368
Fear, I guess.

562
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:49,889
I felt all of that with you.

563
00:43:52,573 --> 00:43:55,690
I'm good at making people feel fear?

564
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:01,727
But I can't.

565
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:04,885
- I'm not saying now...
- I can't even think about the future.

566
00:44:04,973 --> 00:44:06,804
I'm just saying maybe.

567
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,729
I'm having surgery tomorrow.

568
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:14,769
It's an embolization. Totally routine.

569
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,405
Can I be with you?

570
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,442
No.

571
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,244
My mom's coming with me.

572
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:29,167
And it's really nothing.
I mean, I'm gonna be fine.

573
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:30,442
Nate.

574
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:33,445
- Look, I'm sorry. I got to go.
- Nate, please!

575
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:53,565
You know, I've been thinking...

576
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:58,044
it really could be good for you guys
to have a Latino point of view at the home.

577
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:02,248
Too bad it comes in the form of
a controlling homophobe.

578
00:45:02,893 --> 00:45:05,885
When we met,
you were a controlling homophobe.

579
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:09,290
And apparently that was
very attractive to you.

580
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:14,929
Will you come with me
to Claire's graduation tomorrow?

581
00:45:17,893 --> 00:45:20,407
- I'd really rather not.
- Why not?

582
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:23,530
It's not a good time for me
to be dealing with your family.

583
00:45:23,613 --> 00:45:27,208
It's not my family. It's me and Claire.
My mother's going to be with Nate.

584
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:30,205
- I really can't.
- You'd miss <i>The Young and the Restless?</i>

585
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,443
God, Keith, I ask you for one thing.

586
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:38,246
What do you think we are? Roommates?
It's like I don't even exist.

587
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,643
In case you haven't noticed,
I have a lot to deal with right now.

588
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:45,567
Not noticed? It defines my entire life.
Everything is about taking care of you.

589
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:50,363
For once. Which you can't deal with,
because you're the one who always needs it.

590
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:53,604
That is such bullshit!
Who were you taking care of...

591
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:56,890
when you sent Taylor away
without telling me? What am I, the dog?

592
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:59,282
I made a decision, and it was mine to make!

593
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:02,410
- Why was it your decision?
- It's my family.

594
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,610
- I thought I was your family.
- Well, you're not!

595
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:06,882
Yet.

596
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,122
David, you're not.

597
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:11,646
You just moved in
and now there's this pressure to be...

598
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,167
whatever family unit fantasy
you had in your head...

599
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:15,845
when you got engaged to Jennifer.

600
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:18,493
I care about Taylor.
She feels as close to me as...

601
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:21,246
That's not the point!
It's not always about what you want!

602
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,289
You are such an asshole!

603
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:25,532
I have been tiptoeing...

604
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:27,171
- Tiptoeing?
- Get off of me!

605
00:46:27,253 --> 00:46:30,643
Lying on the couch, crying about this,
and pretending everything's fine?

606
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:33,201
I was crying about my brother,
you selfish fuck!

607
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:39,202
My brother could die tomorrow.
Do you even think about how I feel?

608
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:41,853
- Not if you don't tell me.
- You could notice!

609
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:45,721
You could give a fuck for once in your life
about somebody besides yourself.

610
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,562
I'm really gonna miss high school.

611
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:04,565
So, why does Monty Pappas think...

612
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:08,248
getting into Williams has made him
into someone anyone would ever fuck?

613
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,801
As if the name of the college matters at all.

614
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:13,202
I don't even know
where Williams is. Virginia?

615
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:14,408
Vermont.

616
00:47:14,493 --> 00:47:18,566
It has that summer theatre program where
movie stars go to have sex and do Chekhov.

617
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:24,292
- Oh, my God, how did your interview go?
- It severely sucked.

618
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:29,527
- Are you suicidal?
- No.

619
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:31,532
East Valley will be fine.

620
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:36,252
They've got a darkroom. They've got paint.

621
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:40,805
And everyone says you get out of college
what you put into it, anyway, so...

622
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:43,282
Whatever.

623
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:48,851
I'm glad you're so delirious about it,
because it looks like I'm going there, too.

624
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:50,732
What do you mean?

625
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:55,844
Yale found out about my SATs.
That little Indian bitch turned herself in.

626
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,961
Hundreds of people are screwed
just so she won't come back as a rodent.

627
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:05,570
Okay, it isn't that funny.

628
00:48:06,893 --> 00:48:07,882
Cunt.

629
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,372
<i>Oh, God!</i>

630
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,252
You ready to go, Mom?

631
00:50:49,653 --> 00:50:51,928
- Is it time already?
- Yeah, just about.

632
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:54,567
- But you haven't even eaten.
- I'm not supposed to.

633
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,565
Of course, I'm such an idiot.

634
00:50:58,693 --> 00:50:59,808
No, you're not.

635
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:02,613
Clearly, there's something wrong with me...

636
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:06,442
that made you keep this from me
while your brother and sister knew.

637
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,764
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- But why? Why does this keep happening?

638
00:51:09,853 --> 00:51:12,083
I just didn't want to worry you.

639
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:16,086
You're not supposed to protect me.
I'm supposed to protect you.

640
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:17,408
But you can't.

641
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:23,449
- You can't protect me from this.
- But I can try. That's what a mother does.

642
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:26,366
She tries to protect you,
and most of the time, she fails...

643
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,808
but it's the trying that makes you feel loved.

644
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:31,612
How will you feel loved
if you don't ever let me try?

645
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:32,762
I do.

646
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:36,887
I do feel loved.

647
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:42,405
It was just so many months
I could have loved you better.

648
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:45,007
You loved me fine.

649
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,012
You're everything.

650
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:55,405
You don't even know.
You're everything to me.

651
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,290
God, I don't want to go.

652
00:51:57,533 --> 00:52:00,366
I won't go. I can't. I can't do this, I can't.

653
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:02,281
I don't want to go!

654
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:04,682
- I won't let you go.
- I don't wanna go.

655
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:06,206
I'll never let you go.

656
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:22,567
Almost ready?

657
00:52:25,173 --> 00:52:27,892
We caught up with
LA's hottest high school graduate...

658
00:52:27,973 --> 00:52:30,043
in a quiet moment at home.

659
00:52:31,573 --> 00:52:35,407
So, Claire, how does it feel
to be leaving your childhood behind?

660
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:38,087
All right, you can really stop that now.

661
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,406
For many young people, graduation
brings up feelings of anxiety and pissiness.

662
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:46,084
No, really. Cut!

663
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:53,683
- Are you smoking pot?
- You want some?

664
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:55,008
Yeah!

665
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,727
God! These dust balls are like tumbleweeds!

666
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:04,452
When was the last time
anyone swept under here?

667
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:07,963
I don't know.
When did Mom start working for Nikolai?

668
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,567
Your mother is a very good woman.

669
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:15,171
God have mercy.

670
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,452
How psyched are we
that we never have to call him "Daddy"?

671
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:28,285
Thank God she snapped out of it.

672
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,967
I think he's the one
who pulled the plug, actually.

673
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:36,003
Really? What a pig.
He thinks he can do better than Mom?

674
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,329
I'm guessing she was a little clingy.

675
00:53:40,853 --> 00:53:43,287
Did Nate ever tell you
what happened with Brenda?

676
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,928
No, he was strangely nonverbal about it.

677
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:49,767
He's usually so eager to regale us
with the details of his personal life.

678
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:51,848
Not always.

679
00:53:55,053 --> 00:53:56,486
I guess not.

680
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:05,282
- So, when did they go?
- Really early.

681
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:07,769
I guess it's like a two-part thing.

682
00:54:08,173 --> 00:54:10,767
Yeah, first they try to stop the bleeding
with glue.

683
00:54:10,853 --> 00:54:13,890
They put a catheter in through his groin
and thread it up...

684
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:16,487
It's okay. I don't need the details.

685
00:54:17,293 --> 00:54:18,442
Sorry.

686
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:23,848
That part must have happened already.
The cranial surgery is a few hours later.

687
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:26,322
So, like, now.

688
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:29,325
Soon, I guess.

689
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:38,331
There's no way
we're going to this stupid graduation.

690
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:41,047
- I know. Fuck it.
- Seriously.

691
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:43,922
- You're driving.
- Fine.

692
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:24,485
You're just going to feel
a slight sting, okay?

693
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:28,764
Count back from 10, please.

694
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:35,927
Ten, nine, eight...

695
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,647
seven, six...
