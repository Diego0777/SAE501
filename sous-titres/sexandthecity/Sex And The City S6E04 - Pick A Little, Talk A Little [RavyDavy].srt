Subtitles - Ripped (and Hacked)
by RavyDavy - Part of the [RL] Crew

1
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:02,801
In New York City, it is a statistical fact...

2
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:06,777
that once every seven minutes,
an unsuspecting woman...

3
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,608
Shut the fuck up!

4
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,978
...dates an actor.

5
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,542
Let me go.
My husband will be home any minute!

6
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,646
For Samantha,
one of the perks of dating Jerry the actor...

7
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:19,851
was getting to stage
full-scale fantasy productions.

8
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:22,952
Please don't hurt me. I'll do anything.

9
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:24,792
Just shut the fuck up!

10
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,292
You are really good.

11
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,064
I said, shut the fuck up.

12
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:36,206
No, you shut the fuck up,
and fuck me before my husband gets home.

13
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,504
Now!

14
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,313
And then he pretended
to tie my hands behind my back...

15
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,249
and the whole time he kept screaming,
"Shut the fuck up."

16
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,786
I tell you, it is so refreshing...

17
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:51,017
to be with someone
who likes to fuck outside the box.

18
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:56,128
- And this is my friend, Samantha.
- The wallflower. Right.

19
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,561
That is incredibly offensive.

20
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,032
Violence against women
is a very serious issue.

21
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,468
Please, it was a fantasy.
Fantasies can't be censored.

22
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:07,530
Actually, I think the Supreme Court
is working on that right now.

23
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:11,099
All fantasies are healthy and harmless.
Don't you agree?

24
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:14,509
You know, as a guy,
I've always been under the impression...

25
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,709
that rape, or anything in the rape family...

26
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,945
is just not a good idea.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,714
Can I go home now?

28
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:25,747
There is no greater sound than your friends
laughing at your new boyfriend's jokes.

29
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:28,260
That's not the only scenario we play.

30
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,661
Sometimes he's Senator Smith,
or Principal Smith.

31
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,900
- Cellmate Smith...
- Okay, moving on.

32
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:37,232
Miranda, how was your date
with the real estate guy?

33
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:41,638
Actually, it wasn't horrible.
He was kind of cute, and funny, and...

34
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,036
Hello?

35
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,940
Dr. Smith, thank you for returning my call.

36
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,218
Excuse me,
he thinks I may have the mumps.

37
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:53,916
Yes, I'm swollen.

38
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,313
Now, that's hot.

39
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,425
So how did the date end?

40
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,854
He walked me home...

41
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,658
- I'm sorry, are you maxed-out on girl talk?
- No, I'm good.

42
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,759
I'll let you know.

43
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,898
So he kissed me goodnight at the door,
I invited him up.

44
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,030
He couldn't
because he had an early meeting.

45
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,370
We kissed again. Then he said he'd call.

46
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,309
Two kisses. Very promising.

47
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,243
You think, even though he didn't come up?

48
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:24,340
Definitely. It means he likes you,
but he wants to take it slow. That's nice.

49
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,180
Berger, what do you think?

50
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,618
You really want to know?

51
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,385
Please, I would love to have a man's opinion
for a change.

52
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,019
All right. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.

53
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,029
He's just not that into you.

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,259
- That's not true!
- Don't listen to him.

55
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,865
No, I'm intrigued. Elaborate.

56
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,070
Look, I'm sorry,
but when a guy's really into you...

57
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:52,077
he's coming upstairs,
meeting or no meeting.

58
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,912
That is ludicrous!
What about extenuating circumstances?

59
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:59,474
What about you're stressed out,
you're on deadline, you have a migraine?

60
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:03,045
Or a lot of guys
are afraid of getting their feelings hurt...

61
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,114
and they don't want to ruin a friendship.

62
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,887
Or they're freaked out by their own feelings.

63
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,124
There's a lot of push-pull out there.
A lot of mixed messages.

64
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:15,257
Yeah, I have to say that's all coat for,
"He's just not that into you."

65
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,303
I'm sorry, but with guys it's very simple.

66
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,737
If we're into you, we're coming upstairs.
We're booking the next date.

67
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,638
There are no mixed messages.

68
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,910
No mixed messages? But...

69
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:28,141
I've spent my whole life
deciphering mixed messages.

70
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,273
I've made a whole career of it.

71
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,444
Wow. He's just not that into me.

72
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,921
Honey, ignore this person.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

73
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,462
You're fired.

74
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:47,066
Look, if he's not into you,
the guy's obviously a weenie, so...

75
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,725
No, I love it.

76
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,795
It is the most liberating thing
I have ever heard.

77
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:55,739
Think how much time and therapy
I could have saved over the last 20 years...

78
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,003
if I had known this.

79
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,841
I still think the real estate guy is gonna call.

80
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:03,178
I think you've got an uncomfortable e-mail
coming your way, you know?

81
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,410
Something like, "Sorry I haven't called.

82
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,454
"I'm in a place in the world
where they don't have phones."

83
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:10,750
I love him.

84
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,054
The best part of a night out
with your friends...

85
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:15,253
is talking about them all the way home.

86
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,923
Charlotte is a trip, Samantha's hilarious.
They all are.

87
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,196
- They thought you were hilarious.
- How do you not love Miranda?

88
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:26,432
I know. I love her.
And I love that you loved her.

89
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,236
God, she loved you. They all did.

90
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,032
And they're a tough crowd.

91
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:34,547
- I'm a tough crowd.
- Okay, your choice:

92
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,315
Fudgesicle or Nutty Buddy?

93
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:41,178
Oh, my God! I wanted this one.
We're perfect!

94
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,955
When you went to the men's room,
they were...

95
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,049
- Stop.
- What, am I talking too much?

96
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,721
No, I wanna say something and I don't want
you to say anything back, okay?

97
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,058
You promise?

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,765
I love you.

99
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,997
I love you, too. And I'm not saying it
because you said it to me. I promise.

100
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:02,803
I was gonna say it before.
I've been thinking it the whole night.

101
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:07,176
I love you.
I just wanted to say it again on my own.

102
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,913
In my euphoric state...

103
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:14,147
I knew there was only one kind of person
who could tolerate me.

104
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,983
I'm in love, too! I'm so happy for you.

105
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:21,050
It's the fastest I've ever said, "I love you,"
but I could not hold it in my mouth.

106
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,994
And why should you? There's no reason.
You're in love.

107
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:28,000
- I'm in love.
- I love Harry so much, it hurts.

108
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,128
Sometimes I look at Berger,
and he's so cute...

109
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,071
I just wanna squeeze his face off!

110
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:37,207
This Friday night
is my first official Shabbos.

111
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,974
So I am cooking a big, traditional dinner
for Harry.

112
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,813
- I'm so excited to finally be a real Jew.
- Here's your brisket, lady.

113
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,182
Listen, I said lean.

114
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,585
Just when I thought
my week couldn't get any better...

115
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,826
I came home to find
a little surprise from Berger.

116
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,344
From Berger's book to Samantha's books.

117
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm sorry, Ms. Jones...

118
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:25,524
but you owe the U.S. Government $300,000
in back taxes.

119
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:29,191
But, Auditor Smith,
I don't have that kind of money.

120
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:32,661
What are you going to do,
take the shirt off my back?

121
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,262
Take the shirt off my back.

122
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,139
Now this is what I call internal revenue.

123
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,572
In my fantasy,
Hurricane Pandora would be brilliant.

124
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,042
In reality...

125
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:56,849
it was.

126
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,031
If you're still not finished,
it's all over between us.

127
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,499
I just finished it, just this minute. I swear.

128
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,460
Did you stop for meals?

129
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:14,067
It's been two days. It's 400 pages.

130
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,166
- Well, I can't date a slow reader.
- Are you done?

131
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:18,505
The question is, are you done?

132
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:21,741
Yes, I'm done,
and if you would shut your trap...

133
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,778
I could tell you...

134
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:28,844
that I love, love, loved it.

135
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,756
I loved it!

136
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,523
Except for one huge problem.

137
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,924
You have your leading lady
running all over town wearing a scrunchy.

138
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,461
The hair thing? What's wrong with that?

139
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,335
Nothing, unless you're writing about
women in Manhattan.

140
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,773
In which case, where do I begin?

141
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,473
What are you talking about?
Many New York women wear scrunchies.

142
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,772
In the bathroom maybe,
when they're washing their faces.

143
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,147
You're full of shit.

144
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:02,211
I've seen women every single day
all over New York City wearing scrunchies.

145
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,882
But here's the thing. Here's my crucial point.

146
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,121
No woman who works at W magazine
and lives on Perry Street...

147
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:11,561
would be caught dead
at a hip, downtown restaurant...

148
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,528
wearing a scrunchy.

149
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,861
Man, it's a good thing I came along...

150
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,703
because you may know the fellows,
but I know the ladies.

151
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,401
Great.

152
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,010
Okay, can I read you my favorite part?

153
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,512
No, I'm done talking about the book.

154
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,345
Are we ordering in?

155
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:37,252
He completely shut down. Why?

156
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:40,986
Why did I have to get up on my sassy horse
and ruin everything?

157
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,891
Yeah, sass will bite you on the ass.

158
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,192
And the thing that kills me
is I love the book.

159
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,960
I could have gushed about it all night.

160
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:50,093
Why did I have to go straight to the negative
and just pick at it?

161
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,636
Because you're in a relationship.

162
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:56,266
I used to pick at Steve about everything:
The way he held his fork, his grammar...

163
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,572
- his dirty fingernails.
- Used to?

164
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,880
He has a new girlfriend for that now. Debbie.

165
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,115
- Do you think Debbie picks at Steve?
- Of course.

166
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:09,086
All women pick. It's in our DNA.
It's our little way of showing that we care.

167
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,885
I think I made it abundantly clear
just how much I care.

168
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,918
You have to work it out with him.
Berger has single-handedly changed my life.

169
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:21,695
I still haven't heard from the real estate guy,
but it's fine. He's just not that into me.

170
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,359
I think, right now,
Berger's just not that into me.

171
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,064
So talk to him about it.

172
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,903
You two seem like
you could laugh your way through anything.

173
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:32,934
Yeah, it's that kind of thinking
that got me into this in the first place.

174
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,342
One of the signs
that a female gorilla is in love...

175
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:42,249
is that she can be seen
picking nits off her male companion.

176
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,956
And yet, in humans, nit-picking can ruin
a perfectly good evening...

177
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,263
not to mention a relationship.

178
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,098
Women are known to be
more verbal than men.

179
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:03,972
But when does criticism that's constructive
become destructive?

180
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:08,577
Are there times when the ladies
should just shut the fuck up?

181
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,750
The next morning,
another woman was making too much noise.

182
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,325
What on earth is all that banging?

183
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:26,187
Good morning, Mrs. Collier. I'm a Jew now.
How are you?

184
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,769
I know he'll call eventually.

185
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,311
He's just going through
a really hard time right now.

186
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,971
His boss got laid off.

187
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,278
Later, on her lunch hour,
Miranda checked her Blackberry.

188
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,647
There it was.

189
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,653
The uncomfortable e-mail
Berger had predicted.

190
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:54,186
Then, when they get busy, it's like,
"I can't call. I'm so stressed."

191
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:55,894
But he's gonna call.

192
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,760
- And his kitchen's being rewired.
- It's all so complicated.

193
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,527
- That's a two-day process.
- At least.

194
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:05,969
Excuse me, I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation...

195
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,669
and I hope what I'm gonna say
will save you a lot of time and energy.

196
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,672
He's just not that into you.

197
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,806
So move on.

198
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,808
Have a great day.

199
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:22,218
Having passed on the gospel
to these New York women...

200
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:26,314
Miranda could only hope
they would spread the word far and wide.

201
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,494
- Bitch.
- Who the hell asked her?

202
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:29,721
Not me.

203
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,855
- I know you didn't.
- Crazy people in New York.

204
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,956
- He is so gonna call you.
- I know.

205
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,729
And as two women's fantasies
were being shattered...

206
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,067
another's were being brought to life.

207
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,573
Detective Smith, Department of Homicide.

208
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,073
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you some questions, ma'am.

209
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,711
Why, certainly, Detective.
Am I in some kind of trouble?

210
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,655
- Two martinis, please, straight up.
- Yes, ma'am.

211
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:02,751
- Actually, make mine a seltzer.
- Of course, you're working.

212
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,195
But, you know, Detective...

213
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,664
one little drink won't kill you.

214
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:12,071
- He'll have a martini.
- No, it's a seltzer.

215
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,862
Seriously, Samantha, I'm in AA.

216
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,738
That sobered Samantha right up.

217
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,142
Totally fucked up for eight years
in Seattle...

218
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:24,707
You know, I just realized. I have
a presentation first thing in the morning.

219
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:27,349
So, sorry.

220
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,586
Jerry had taken the fantasy
into dangerous territory.

221
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,422
Reality.

222
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,928
- Two martinis.
- No, dude, I said a seltzer.

223
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,328
Meanwhile, Charlotte was hard at work
on her fantasy role.'

224
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:45,631
Martha Jewart.

225
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:48,506
The kugel's in the oven,
the matzo balls are boiling.

226
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,771
It's three hours till Shabbos.
We should start braiding the challah.

227
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:55,245
Doesn't Shabbos mean "day of rest,"
i.e. Ordering in?

228
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,244
We're wearing aprons. Do you own aprons?

229
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:02,380
- The challah!
- Okay, you don't have to holler.

230
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,951
Miranda, like this.

231
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:10,892
I don't know what I'm doing.
Why did you call me over here?

232
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:15,423
Because I didn't want to spend the entire
week saying, "Guess you had to be there."

233
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,364
Did Harry's friend ever call you?

234
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,200
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I'm seeing him tonight.

235
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,298
You think I can get away with this outfit?

236
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,605
Definitely, the apron softens you.

237
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,737
Can you read me what's next,
after it's braided?

238
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,147
With her high school boyfriend,
Charlotte doodled.

239
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,154
With Harry, she Jew-dled.

240
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,414
I think it calls for...

241
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,551
two cups of Mrs. Harry York-Goldenblatt.

242
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,129
Did I miss something?
Did you get married while I was at work?

243
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,191
No, but that's where we're headed.

244
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,463
You forgot Charlotte Yorkenblatt.

245
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,165
Actually, I've been making some calls...

246
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,800
and I was wondering
how you both felt about November.

247
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,441
November? For what?

248
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:00,103
For our wedding.

249
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,641
Most of the synagogues are booked
through the fall.

250
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,549
- November works for me.
- Has Harry even proposed yet?

251
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,016
No, but he will.

252
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:13,751
Aren't you counting your matzo balls
before they rise?

253
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:16,090
Miranda, zip the lip.

254
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,153
We have an understanding about our future.

255
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,860
We don't have to talk about it all the time.
It's b'shert.

256
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,295
- I don't know what that means.
- It's meant to be.

257
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,974
I would never have gone through
all this trouble...

258
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,510
if I didn't know for sure
that we were getting married.

259
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:36,036
I'm sorry, I just don't want to see you
get hurt again.

260
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:44,047
And ever since her reality check with Jerry...

261
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,819
Samantha had no interest
in seeing him again.

262
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,459
However, when a certain
government official called...

263
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,328
she was more than happy to take a meeting.

264
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,300
Secret Service Agent Smith, if you're here...

265
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,969
who's protecting the President?

266
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,244
You know, I changed my mind.

267
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,077
I thought of something even hotter
for us to play.

268
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,713
Hotter than Secret Service sluts?

269
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm me, you're you.

270
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,380
Go.

271
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:24,754
You know, when I told you the other night
I was in AA, you bolted.

272
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,488
What's up with that?

273
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,932
It is Jerry, isn't it?

274
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:32,904
I'm afraid we want different things.

275
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,963
You want to tell me all about you...

276
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,204
and I don't want you to tell me
all about you.

277
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,938
It spoils the fantasy.

278
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:44,343
- That's harsh.
- Yeah, I am harsh.

279
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm also demanding, stubborn,
self-sufficient, and always right.

280
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,790
In bed, at the office, and everywhere else.

281
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:56,088
- I already knew that.
- And that's just a little bit about me.

282
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,419
All right, cool.

283
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,457
Let me tell you one little thing about me.

284
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:05,231
- See, this is exactly...
- At least let me tell you my last name.

285
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:07,104
It's Jerrod.

286
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:13,068
Your parents named you Jerry Jerrod?

287
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,137
- No wonder you drank.
- Right.

288
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:20,252
There would still be accountants
and undercover agents in their future.

289
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,187
But that night, Samantha and Jerry
got off on playing themselves.

290
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:30,318
Meanwhile, I was looking forward
to putting the scrunchy moment behind us.

291
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,334
Unfortunately, it was staring us in the face.

292
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:44,870
Okay, I'm sorry to have to do this...

293
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,675
but I do believe
we are in the presence of a scrunchy.

294
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:52,273
I also do believe,
and correct me if I'm wrong...

295
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,819
that we are in New York City proper.

296
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,185
This woman does not appear to be
washing her face.

297
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:02,353
She appears to be standing in line
at a hip, downtown restaurant.

298
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:06,488
So it kind of kills
your New York woman theory.

299
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,067
Tough break, Bradshaw.

300
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,004
- She's not from New York.
- What?

301
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:18,534
Doesn't matter. Did they say how long
the wait was gonna be?

302
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,205
Excuse me. Hi, I'm sorry to bother you.

303
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,249
We're just wondering
what part of New York you live in.

304
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,140
Me?

305
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,818
I am from Macon, Georgia.

306
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,124
But thanks, you made my whole day.

307
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:39,130
Honey, did you hear that?
These people think I live in New York.

308
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,230
I'm so hungry.
When are they gonna let us sit down?

309
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,400
Downtown, over curried lamb and chutney...

310
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:50,568
Miranda found herself pleasantly
surprised by Charlotte's matchmaking skills.

311
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,673
That was one spicy biryani!

312
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,880
I know, I've lost all feeling in my tongue.

313
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:01,944
Listen, I know a great place
around the corner if you wanna get coffee.

314
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:08,719
I wish I could,
but I really should call it a night.

315
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,454
It's fine, I understand.

316
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:16,030
You're just not that into me, and it's okay.
I get it.

317
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:18,302
No, I like you.

318
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,404
I just really have to go.

319
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:25,043
- Paul, come on, you can stop lying.
- I am not lying.

320
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,979
Come on, be a man. Tell the truth.

321
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,841
I have diarrhea.

322
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:36,346
Apparently there is one rare exception
to Berger's rule...

323
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,916
and it often involves curry.

324
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:43,154
After dinner, Berger ate banana cream pie
and I ate my words.

325
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,457
Another thing I loved...

326
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,523
was the way you used
the sister's phone calls as little landposts.

327
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,592
I mean, landmarks...

328
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,802
or mileposts.

329
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:56,501
Anyway I just loved
how those sort of punctuated the story.

330
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,907
It was just a really nice touch.

331
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,374
Oh, my God, the introduction... Brilliant!

332
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,280
You're instantly on this guy's side,
even though he's a complete mess.

333
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,583
You know, you really just nailed him.

334
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:22,064
While I was working overtime...

335
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,565
Charlotte's work
was finally coming to an end.

336
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,766
Harry, you can come on in now.
Sorry it's so late.

337
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:29,933
What's all this?

338
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:33,604
Since it's our first Shabbos together,
I wanted to make it a little special.

339
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,579
A little? This is phenomenal.

340
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:39,550
I just need to get the candles
and then we can say the bracha.

341
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,259
Come on.

342
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:58,361
Honey, please turn that off.
We're about to eat.

343
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,806
It smells incredible.

344
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:09,647
And you made brisket.
I cannot believe you made brisket.

345
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:49,414
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos, sweetie.

346
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,026
I cannot believe you made all this.

347
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:58,491
- What did I do to deserve you?
- I feel the same way.

348
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,789
I've been thinking about blessings...

349
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,092
and you are such a blessing to me.

350
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,229
What are you...

351
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,598
- Why is the TV on?
- It's on mute.

352
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,843
Mute? We're having Shabbos dinner.

353
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,277
It's a big game, honey.

354
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:18,316
Turn it off.
I want you to turn it off right this minute.

355
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,418
- But it's...
- Off now.

356
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,113
Let me just watch this one pitch.

357
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:25,350
I gave up Christ for you
and you can't give up the Mets?

358
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:28,120
It's gonna be a long life if you keep that up.

359
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,525
"I gave up Christ for you, take out the trash.

360
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:33,656
"I gave up Christ for you,
pick up your socks."

361
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:38,199
Do you have any idea how hard I worked
to prepare this meal for you?

362
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,137
I went to Zabar's every day this week...

363
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,232
I had to make 30 matzo balls...

364
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,904
just to get four
that were the right size and shape.

365
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,274
Not to mention the months
of studying and cramming like a maniac...

366
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:55,684
to convert to Judaism.
And what have you done for me?

367
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:57,244
Set the date.

368
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:00,324
What are you talking about?

369
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:03,054
You said you couldn't marry me
unless I was Jewish...

370
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:05,756
and now I'm Jewish. Set the date!

371
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,322
You're acting crazy! Do you hear yourself?

372
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,267
Do you know how lucky you are to have me?

373
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,637
Do you know how we look?

374
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:17,938
Do you know what people out there think
when they see us together? Do you?

375
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,638
Yeah, I know what people are thinking.

376
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,210
I just didn't think you were one of them.

377
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:27,046
Finally it was Charlotte who was on mute.

378
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,780
I don't need this.

379
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,253
I'm leaving.

380
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:37,252
To think I bought a ring.

381
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,597
The Mets won that night, 5 to 4.

382
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,571
But Charlotte lost
everything that mattered to her.

383
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,434
I just remembered another hilarious part.

384
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:54,343
And later,
on the corner of 73rd and mea culpa...

385
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,539
You know the scene
where the dishwasher guy...

386
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:00,813
is spooning up the Rice Chex
and he's putting them back in the box?

387
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,821
It's perfection.
How did you come up with that?

388
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,450
- It's so lame.
- No, it was not. It was hysterical.

389
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:11,656
I'm not talking about the book. I'm talking
about what you're doing right now.

390
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,188
I just wanted you to know
how much I loved your book...

391
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,524
because I did.

392
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,103
And I'm sorry I muddied it up
with the whole scrunchy thing.

393
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,107
It's not that big a deal.

394
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,046
I think I'm gonna call it a night.

395
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,472
I gotta get an early start tomorrow.

396
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,178
- Are you kidding?
- No. Thanks for dinner.

397
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,553
I'll call you tomorrow.

398
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:37,987
And then there are times...

399
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:41,184
when a New York woman
should not shut the fuck up.

400
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:53,099
You can't just pull that line on me
and walk away.

401
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,400
This time it's true.

402
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:57,203
You're obviously still pissed,
and I'm sorry...

403
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,334
but you can't just shut down like this.

404
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,675
We have to be able to say
what's on our minds.

405
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:05,183
If you thought
that I had made some kind of mistake...

406
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,377
I would want you to tell me.

407
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,083
Nice hat.

408
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,120
It's fabulous,
and you said that to hurt my feelings.

409
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:20,029
- That's how you made me feel that night.
- Fabulous.

410
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:22,933
- So, you could just walk away now?
- Yes, I can.

411
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,298
I'm sorry, all right?

412
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,803
What was I supposed to do
with that scrunchy comment?

413
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:30,035
Was I supposed to hop in my time machine
and fix my entire book?

414
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:33,976
I don't know what your problem is,
but it has nothing to do with a scrunchy.

415
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:37,447
Yeah, it's about the fact
that my book is a big, fat, fucking failure.

416
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:41,043
- Wait. What?
- It's just, I already feel like shit.

417
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:43,986
You trying to pump me up all night,
not helping.

418
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,422
I'm sure this is all very sexy.
You probably never really...

419
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:53,753
Stop.

420
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,530
I want to say something
and I want you to listen.

421
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,596
You're a beautiful writer...

422
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,566
and I loved your book.

423
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,375
And I love you.

424
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,244
And I still think...

425
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,443
you're very sexy.

426
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,544
And I'm not gonna let you
make a joke right now.

427
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,487
Then I got nothing.

428
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,326
Come on.

429
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:33,796
Saying "I love you" is easy.

430
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,299
What comes next is a little scrunchier.

431
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,340
Harry hadn't called in two days...

432
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:47,715
except to say he was sending someone over
to pick up his TV.

433
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:55,085
Just what New York needs.'
Another single Jewish girl.

434
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:01,889
Good morning.

435
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:07,697
- Mind if I get in there and wash my face?
- Not at all.

436
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:13,338
Oh, my God, where did you get that?

437
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,210
Macon, Georgia. Why, you wanna try it on?

438
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,644
You're gonna look so pretty
with this scrunchy on.

439
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,977
No, I hate you!

440
