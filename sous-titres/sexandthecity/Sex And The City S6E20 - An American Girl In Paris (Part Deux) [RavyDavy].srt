1
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,038
After two weeks in Paris...

2
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,775
it was time for the ultimate
in sophisticated French fare.

3
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:12,276
Meeting your lover
and his ex-wife for lunch.

4
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,323
Hello, I'm Juliet. Juliet Bellajoux.

5
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,695
Hello, I'm Carrie.
It's nice to finally meet you.

6
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,990
- Sit.
- Thank you.

7
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:33,266
Well, if I'm fashionably late,
then Alek is very fashionable.

8
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,740
Yes, he's always very fashionable.

9
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,773
What a beautiful bag.

10
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:40,146
Thank you. It's vintage.

11
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,741
The silk lining's about
a hundred million years old...

12
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,512
but I'm so in love with it.

13
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:49,043
We'll get along perfectly.
I represent accessories for the collections.

14
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:52,114
Wow, Aleks never mentioned
what work you did.

15
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:57,889
Sorry.

16
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,223
Mr. Fashionable. Hello?

17
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,344
Sincere apologies. Crisis at the museum.

18
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:24,713
Some gigantic technical problem
with sculpture number something.

19
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:28,251
Nothing else exists when art does. Yes?

20
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:34,699
Wow, this is a fantastic restaurant.

21
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,530
Yes? It used to be, not so much anymore.

22
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:43,167
The chairs, they're hideous. Hideous.

23
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,146
Good morning, Chanel.

24
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,748
Chanello!

25
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:55,615
I'm going to shoplift,
just so he can feel me up.

26
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,386
I need something simple to wear
for when we meet the birth parents.

27
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,824
Where is this couple from again?

28
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,352
Charlotte, North Carolina.
I think it's a good sign.

29
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,661
Love it. Very TV-movie-of-the-week.

30
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,223
Stylish, socialite couple...

31
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:11,361
opens up their Park Avenue home
to the dumb, toothless yokels.

32
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,305
- They're not dumb or toothless.
- In my movie they are.

33
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:18,174
And you'd be played by Barbara Parkins,
circa Valley of the Dolls.

34
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,373
- Thank you.
- And I'd be played by Colin Farrell.

35
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,478
- Do you think you look like Colin Farrell?
- It's my movie!

36
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:31,656
So in your movie, how big is my part?
Bit or supporting?

37
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:32,984
What?

38
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,593
I'll still be in your life, right?

39
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,630
Because once people have the babies...

40
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:41,929
Stop. You will always be
in my life, Colin Farrell.

41
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,128
Good.

42
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,574
Can you believe this is finally happening?
I hope nothing goes wrong.

43
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:53,079
Well, if it does, I know some gays
that got a Guatemalan kid for $100.

44
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,811
A touch of this blonde
is going to be perfection.

45
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,351
It's called "ash."

46
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,049
Well, save a little for him,
because he is one hot piece of ash.

47
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,318
Right.

48
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:10,155
Well?

49
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:12,590
Sexy.

50
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,264
Very sexy.

51
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,759
Come here, you.

52
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,032
Please, sir, my hair.

53
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,646
Are we ever going to talk about the fact
that we haven't had sex in a long time?

54
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,117
And you're bringing this up here?

55
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:35,347
My therapist said not to mention it in bed.

56
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:39,586
Therapist? Since when have you
been seeing a therapist?

57
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:44,094
I just thought I should get some help
to deal with all this cancer stuff.

58
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:47,793
I'm not complaining.
I just think we should talk about it.

59
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,328
Well, I have absolutely no sex drive.
You're leaving town to do a movie.

60
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,498
What's the point
of talking about it right now?

61
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:59,511
Samantha, I see two pairs of feet in there.
You had better not be doing it.

62
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,670
We're not.

63
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:04,179
Yeah, right. That'd be a first.

64
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,558
I must admit, I have been dying to meet you.

65
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,295
I begged Aleks
to organize a dinner with us...

66
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:26,362
but he said, "As soon as the exhibit opens,
we'll all sit down."

67
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:30,637
"As soon as."
If I hear this phrase one more time...

68
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,377
So how is my beloved?

69
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,078
He's wonderful. He's a bit stressed, but...

70
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,483
Well, yes. He is very sensitive.

71
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:44,849
Can I just say, I think it's lovely...

72
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:48,553
that you both
think so highly of one another.

73
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,190
Why not?

74
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:53,164
We had a wonderful marriage,
while it lasted.

75
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,331
But I believe a relationship is like couture.

76
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:59,429
If it doesn't fit perfectly, it's a disaster.

77
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:04,410
And I couldn't quite get used to
always coming second.

78
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,006
It was not for me.

79
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,508
Would you like a cigarette?

80
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,353
Well, yes, I would. Thank you.

81
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,548
I thought you might be
one of those Americans who didn't smoke...

82
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,024
and I would be, how do you say...

83
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:22,493
guilty of killing you over lunch.

84
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,734
Chloe tells me
you were a writer in New York?

85
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,464
No, I am a writer.

86
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,405
Until recently,
I had a weekly column in New York.

87
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:38,433
It became a book.
It's even been published here.

88
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,276
Brilliant.

89
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:45,546
- And Aleks is comfortable with that?
- God, yes, he's very supportive.

90
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,549
Then people change.

91
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,294
- It's good.
- Can you hold this?

92
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,563
Aren't you going to say anything
about the fact that I'm smoking?

93
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,664
Everybody smokes in Paris.

94
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,010
Someone got a rave review.

95
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:15,709
- Your reviews are out already?
- No, and please don't remind me.

96
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,882
I'm referring to you. Juliet was impressed.

97
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:22,888
She said you're beautiful, smart, and chic.

98
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:49,071
- Sorry. The museum. I have to go.
- Again? It's been like this all week.

99
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,276
I thought we at least had
the morning together.

100
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,875
I have to go.

101
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,351
Is this going to be every day?

102
00:07:55,421 --> 00:08:00,290
Carrie, I am under so much pressure.
Don't make me feel worse than I do.

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,351
I'm not trying to make you feel worse.

104
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:05,795
I said nothing
when you left me alone with your wife.

105
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:10,230
I know it's inconvenient for you right now,
but I promise...

106
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:14,637
there will be more time for us
as soon as this exhibit opens. Okay?

107
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:26,017
That's better.
Look, we are in Paris. It's so beautiful.

108
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:29,316
Go and walk around.
Take the driver, go everywhere.

109
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,883
No, you take the driver. I'll walk around
and do French things, be very Parisian.

110
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,152
Okay.

111
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,357
See you.

112
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,995
I like the smoking, it's very sexy.

113
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,694
It's killing me!

114
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,346
Oh, God!

115
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,421
Isn't it amazing, Ma?

116
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,084
The whole house is coming together.

117
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,827
What's little Stevie doing over there?

118
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:07,338
What? That's Brady. I'm right here.
What are you talking about?

119
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,782
Does my mother seem odd to you?

120
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,581
You might want to rephrase that.

121
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,647
No, I'm serious. She looks all loopy,
and she's disoriented.

122
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,421
Steve, it's called
the one-too-many-beer syndrome.

123
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:31,463
No, her eyes aren't focusing or something.

124
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,562
- I'm worried.
- Really?

125
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,833
Ma, you want some ice cream?

126
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,934
Don't let little Stevie have any strawberry.

127
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,142
Mary, that's Brady.

128
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,543
What are you talking about?
I know that's Brady.

129
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,114
But who the hell are you?

130
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,361
I'm going to run her down
to the emergency room and check it out.

131
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,229
It can't hurt, right?

132
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:11,600
Want to go for a walk?

133
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,545
If it's a movie about Attila the Hun,
why are they filming in Canada?

134
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,811
Cheaper.

135
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:28,643
And it's pretty much just open space.

136
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:33,087
Which means nowhere to go,
and nothing to do for the next eight weeks.

137
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:39,025
Listen to me.
The operative word being "listen."

138
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:43,669
I want you to feel free to have sex
while you're on location.

139
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:48,268
- Are we here again? After everything?
- No, we are not here again.

140
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,139
I'm not trying to push you away,
I'm trying to keep you.

141
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,839
If anyone knows how important
sex is to a person, it's me.

142
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,448
- Correction. Was me.
- It's the chemo.

143
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,412
Your body just needs time to heal itself.
It'll be back.

144
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,452
It's like winter.

145
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,494
Just because the trees are bare
doesn't mean they're dead.

146
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,429
- Along comes spring, and bam!
- I want you to have sex.

147
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,432
I'm serious.

148
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,594
I know what we have. Sex is just sex.
I understand that.

149
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,870
I don't want to just have sex.

150
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,101
You say that now.

151
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,978
But when you're riding a horse all day,
wearing animal fur...

152
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,211
and you see some sexy Canadian extra...

153
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,276
in a slave-girl outfit...

154
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,015
feel free to pillage her.

155
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:41,088
- Samantha.
- Don't be so provincial!

156
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,296
You're playing a barbarian, for fuck's sake.

157
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:50,396
Step up there, Ma, come on.
There you go, all right.

158
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,537
- You want to watch some TV?
- Yeah.

159
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,537
- I'll be in there in a minute.
- It's cold outside.

160
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,637
So it was nothing, right?

161
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,410
The doctor said she had a small stroke.

162
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,951
She's got significant memory loss.

163
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,477
God, when did it happen?

164
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,386
Best he can tell, maybe a week ago.

165
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,451
But nobody knows,
'cause she's been home alone.

166
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,125
I want her to stay here with us tonight.

167
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,760
So I'm going to run
and grab her nightgown and stuff.

168
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,827
She wants her own stuff.

169
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:28,867
I'll go with you.

170
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:31,606
Magda can stay here with them.

171
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,873
I'm so sorry.

172
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,783
Magda!

173
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,659
Jesus Christ.

174
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:59,362
What's been going on here?

175
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:01,467
Didn't you notice?

176
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,237
No, she's always waiting for me
to pick her up downstairs.

177
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,176
Fucking cockroach!

178
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,477
Okay, well, this stops right now.

179
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,455
My ma can't live like this.

180
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:22,551
I'll get a maid or a nurse or something.
Someone to live with her full-time.

181
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:26,325
Nurses do that, right?
You can hire them to do that, right?

182
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,960
My ma can't live like this.

183
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,376
Your mother can come live with us.

184
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,674
She can?

185
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,474
Sure.

186
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,009
Why else do we have that big house?

187
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:34,294
Carrie Bradshaw!
You are Sex and the City writer?

188
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,296
I love Sex and the City!

189
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,863
I am, how you say, the single girl.

190
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,640
Sex and the City!

191
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:00,483
I have the sex, she has the sex.
We all have the sex.

192
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:07,359
We want to make a party for you.
Saturday night.

193
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:15,501
Apparently, I fell right into
my French fan base.

194
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,634
Both of them.
And they were so fun and silly.

195
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,874
And they insisted
on throwing a party in my honor.

196
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:25,439
They want me to meet their friends,
who supposedly love the book as well.

197
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,043
Anyway, it's nothing terribly fancy.

198
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,819
Just a cozy dinner in a quaint hotel in Paris,
with my ten new French friends.

199
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:36,826
This is what I love about Paris.
You never know where the day will lead you.

200
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:40,024
I know. Anyway, the party's Saturday night...

201
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,927
at La Petite Auberge
on the Rue St. -André-Des-Arts.

202
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:47,234
- Very good.
- Are you up for it?

203
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,637
I can't, darling.

204
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:53,007
That's the night I unveil my show
to the museum curator and staff.

205
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:55,806
But you go and have a wonderful time...

206
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,406
with the throngs of screaming fans.

207
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:02,113
Well, I don't mind if I do.
Do you think they'll really be screaming?

208
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,656
- I hope so.
- So do I!

209
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,492
And we'd turn the office back there
into the baby's room.

210
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,655
Would anyone like more lox?

211
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,093
Is that the fish?

212
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:23,005
We're within blocks
of the best grammar schools in Manhattan.

213
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,476
Not that we would ever let him
or her go alone.

214
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:27,637
Her.

215
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,413
- It's a her. We just found out.
- It's a girl?

216
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,780
Honey, it's a girl!

217
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,387
I always wanted a girl.

218
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,618
We weren't going to ask,
'cause I didn't want to know about it...

219
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,661
but then I was there,
and they asked me if I wanted to know...

220
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,252
and I said yes.

221
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:48,561
Ever since then,
I've been thinking about little girl names.

222
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,163
I like Tiffany, Brittany.

223
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,871
Wayne says I like any name
with a "ny" on the end.

224
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,001
We're not getting the baby, are we?

225
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,648
We changed our minds.

226
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,215
We're awful sorry.

227
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,985
If you knew this before...

228
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:19,258
why did you come here
and put us through all this?

229
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,623
We'd never seen New York.

230
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,239
What are you doing in here all this time?

231
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:32,368
I'm writing an angry e-mail
to our baby lawyer.

232
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,244
She warned us about this kind of thing.

233
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,282
How much more can we take?

234
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,421
It's okay.

235
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,523
That's not our baby.

236
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,197
Our baby's still coming.

237
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,762
I'm beginning to think God lost our address.

238
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,693
Come on, honey.

239
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,070
We're Jews.

240
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,931
We've been through worse than this.

241
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,347
And someone got some flowers delivered.

242
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:13,808
Samantha Jones.

243
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,745
I'll tell her you called.

244
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,299
What's up, babe?

245
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:39,270
I just got your flowers. They're so beautiful.

246
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:40,502
Did you get the card?

247
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:41,971
Yes.

248
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,807
And you know how I said
you could have sex...

249
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,147
with someone else? Well...

250
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,486
if it would be okay with you, try not to.

251
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:54,154
Unless you already have,
and then that's fine.

252
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,418
I didn't. I won't.

253
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,888
I don't mean to be a wet blanket...

254
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,064
but how about don't?

255
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:05,295
Cool.

256
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,398
Cool.

257
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,615
Okay, you gorgeous Russian, I'm off!

258
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,277
Good luck at the museum...

259
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,888
What's wrong?

260
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:28,416
It's the cufflink,
and it's something with my hands.

261
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:33,261
It's just, I think I'm having an anxiety attack
or something.

262
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:34,697
I don't know.

263
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:36,524
Breathe. Here.

264
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,970
Put your head between your legs
and breathe.

265
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,837
I can't go, I can't.

266
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,115
Why? What brought this on?

267
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,017
What if they think...

268
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:59,881
I'm the old man
with the silly light machines?

269
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:02,387
Here, let me do this for you.

270
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:06,429
The curator's 27 years old.
Can you believe it?

271
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:07,590
Stop.

272
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,865
Look at me.

273
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,299
You will be fine.

274
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,639
Will you go with me?

275
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:22,841
But...

276
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:25,308
I have my party.

277
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:28,376
Please, I need you there.

278
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:34,152
I don't have anybody's telephone number
to call and cancel.

279
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,319
No, you go.

280
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,889
You're right, I'll be okay, I'll be fine.

281
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:42,297
I'll be fine, yeah.

282
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,502
No, I'll go.

283
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,040
- You will?
- It's important to you.

284
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:57,248
Thank you, my darling.
And promise not to let go all night.

285
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,048
Yes, that's a train.

286
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,816
I want to take little Stevie to the zoo.

287
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:15,257
This is not Steve, this is Brady.
Steve's all grown up.

288
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,896
Some days she's perfectly clear...

289
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:23,628
and then she'll have
a bad couple days, like now.

290
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,796
- How are you handling all this?
- Not very well.

291
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,597
Steve is amazing.

292
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,576
He gets home from the bar late,
and then he's with her all day.

293
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:36,236
- Let's get ready to go to the zoo!
- This is the zoo.

294
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,548
I think you're amazing.

295
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,919
I think you're amazing.

296
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,112
Mama.

297
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,554
And I think you're amazing! Yes, I do.

298
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,324
Why was her coat on?

299
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:55,625
Shit!

300
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:57,657
Mary!

301
00:25:58,737 --> 00:25:59,829
Shit.

302
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:03,341
- Where did she go?
- I don't know. The Bronx Zoo?

303
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,241
Shit, stay with the baby. Shit!

304
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,076
Oh, fuck.

305
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:37,369
The one place in Paris you can't smoke.

306
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,850
Perfect. A hole in my Dior.

307
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,550
What?

308
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,290
Tell that man that I had to go!

309
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:00,416
Taxi!

310
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,845
Mary!

311
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,921
This pizza tastes like garbage.

312
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,690
Yeah, it's bad.

313
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:48,559
It's cold. We're going to go. Go home.

314
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,726
I'm still hungry, you know.

315
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,406
That feels good.

316
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:21,191
Where did you go?

317
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,662
I went to my party.

318
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,129
I thought as much.

319
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,898
- How was it?
- Over.

320
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,405
It was over.

321
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:31,406
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:37,077
How could you just abandon me like that,
when I gave up my party to be with you?

323
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,776
I didn't abandon you.

324
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,308
I sat on a bench, alone, in a museum.

325
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:48,256
Let's not do this now.
I'm tired. I had a stressful day.

326
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,556
I'm in this relationship, too!

327
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,160
I am a person in this relationship!

328
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:58,297
Have you any idea
what it's been like for me here?

329
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,398
Eating alone and waiting for my boyfriend...

330
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:05,375
who would rather spend time
with a light installation?

331
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:09,512
That's what I do. That's who I am.

332
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:12,479
You always knew this.

333
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,150
I had a life in New York.

334
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:19,055
I had a job and friends.

335
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:24,061
I didn't give all of that up to come here
and wander the streets of Paris alone!

336
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:30,198
Okay. I'm taking a shower, and then to bed.

337
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,903
We'll talk more as soon as you...

338
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,565
- No, not as soon as...
- Please, Carrie!

339
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,106
It was an accident. I didn't mean to.

340
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,676
Oh, my necklace.

341
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,590
I'm so sorry.

342
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,427
I thought I was clear all along...

343
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,356
about who I am.

344
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,806
Maybe it's time to be clear about who I am.

345
00:32:11,276 --> 00:32:14,712
I am someone who is looking for love.

346
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:17,444
Real love.

347
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,651
Ridiculous...

348
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:23,077
inconvenient...

349
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:25,622
consuming...

350
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:30,451
can't-live-without-each-other love.

351
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:33,558
And...

352
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,962
I don't think...

353
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,794
that love is here...

354
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,906
in this expensive suite...

355
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:48,838
in this lovely hotel in Paris.

356
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,110
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

357
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,183
I shouldn't have come here.

358
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,836
Please, don't.

359
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,636
I'm fine.

360
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:37,358
Thank you.

361
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:01,281
I'm sorry, mademoiselle,
but we have only double rooms available.

362
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:05,617
Well, I'm a single, and it will be fine.

363
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,290
Let me see, just a minute.

364
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:28,937
Hi.

365
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:36,843
Why the tears?

366
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:39,985
Paris is a mess.

367
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,089
I never should have come here.

368
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,261
Everything fell apart.

369
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:49,529
We had a big fight...

370
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,368
and then I got slapped.

371
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:53,996
You got what?

372
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,905
No, he didn't mean it. It was an accident.

373
00:34:57,175 --> 00:35:00,542
- He slapped you?
- What? No. It's not like that.

374
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:02,204
I'll kick his ass.

375
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,111
What? No!

376
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,776
- What room are you in?
- I'm not telling you that.

377
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,910
I see you were in room 625.

378
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,750
Room 625? Thank you.

379
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,416
Wait, stop! What are you...

380
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,023
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

381
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:20,792
I think I'm kicking some Russian ass.

382
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,732
What? No, it's not like that!

383
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:27,260
- You've got it completely wrong.
- We'll see about that.

384
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,732
I don't need you to do this.

385
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:32,841
Stop! This is totally unnecessary.

386
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,807
What do you think you're doing?

387
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:39,873
Stop, slow down.
You're going to have a heart attack.

388
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:44,650
I mean it, I took care of this myself.
I don't need you to rescue me!

389
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:48,954
Listen, I'm clocking this foreigner,
and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

390
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,015
I've got to hand it to you, kid.

391
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,322
Most people come to Paris to fall in love.
You came and got slapped.

392
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:28,726
Why is that funny?

393
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,874
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm still in shock.

394
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,741
This is so surreal.

395
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,175
How did you even get here?

396
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,622
It took me a really long time to get here.

397
00:36:57,996 --> 00:36:59,463
But I'm here.

398
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,903
Carrie, you're the one.

399
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,104
Kiss me, you big crybaby.

400
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,804
I miss New York. Take me home.

401
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,153
Hi, honey.

402
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,889
I'm a bad wife. I ordered Chinese.

403
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,695
I got something from China, too.

404
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:12,033
- They're giving us a baby.
- What?

405
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,162
How?

406
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:19,340
I guess God remembered our address.
We get her in six months.

407
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:24,046
Here she is.

408
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:32,781
That's our baby.

409
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:36,624
I know it.

410
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,762
That's really our baby.

411
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,871
What you did...

412
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,650
that is love.

413
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,319
You love.

414
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:18,901
Let's not make a big deal of it to Steve.
It'd just upset him.

415
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:00,875
Hey, babe.

416
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,346
I flew back.

417
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,751
You flew all night? Why?

418
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:11,821
I forgot to tell you something on the phone.

419
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,855
I love you.

420
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,557
You flew back to tell me that?

421
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,330
Can you think of a better reason?

422
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,568
No, I can't.

423
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,463
You have meant more to me
than any man I've ever known.

424
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:04,030
Thank you. Thanks.

425
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,319
You know, I don't live here anymore...

426
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:21,054
and the Four Seasons
won't check you in until 1:00.

427
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,195
Did you want to come up?

428
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,793
Abso-fucking-lutely.

429
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:55,987
Oh, my God!

430
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,667
Later that day,
I got to thinking about relationships.

431
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:07,929
There are those that open you up
to something new and exotic...

432
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,680
those that are old and familiar...

433
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:26,015
those that bring up lots of questions...

434
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,758
those that bring you
somewhere unexpected...

435
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,594
those that bring you far
from where you started...

436
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,706
and those that bring you back.

437
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:57,545
But the most exciting, challenging,
and significant relationship of all...

438
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:01,023
is the one you have with yourself.

439
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:05,625
And if you find someone
to love the "you" you love...

440
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,761
- What's shaking, baby?
- How's Napa?

441
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,495
The house is on the market.
Look out, New York, I'm a-coming.

442
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:14,470
...well, that's just fabulous.
