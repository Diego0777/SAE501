1
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,903
If you've lived in New York for ten years,
you can call yourself a New Yorker.

2
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,241
But the trained eye can always
spot the ones who were born here.

3
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:01,495
I want it all, I want it now,
and I want you to get it for me.

4
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,039
After firing her last two publicists,

5
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:06,792
Jenny Brier,
the daughter of a restaurateur,

6
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,878
had decided that Samantha

7
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,839
would handle
the PR for her upcoming party.

8
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,884
I want "Vanity Fair", Carson Daly,

9
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,720
"People", "Teen People", NSYNC...

10
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:23,267
Jenny, sweetie. Don't take this
the wrong way, but how old are you?

11
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:27,771
- Hello, it's my Bat Mitzvah party. I'm 13.
- You're 13?

12
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,940
What are you, 45?

13
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:33,027
Just like that, the meeting was over.

14
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,572
I'm sorry, I don't do kids parties.

15
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,950
Sweetie, my father has invited over 300

16
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:41,827
of his powerful friends.

17
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:45,331
They are not all coming.
The Clintons can't make it.

18
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:48,709
I told daddy we'll be lucky
if we can swing this for under a mill.

19
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,921
What do I know, I'm just a kid.

20
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:56,133
We'll never get NSYNC.

21
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:01,430
After meeting her new client,
Samantha met us

22
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:04,016
for the latest trend in power lunching -

23
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:06,227
haute cafeteria cuisine.

24
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:11,524
Coming in for a landing, sister?

25
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,402
Cute guy. Thought he was
checking me out for a second.

26
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,613
Where?

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,114
Don't turn...

28
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:24,161
- He's a cutie all right.
- Definitely looking.

29
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:27,206
Looking at you looking at him,
like I asked you not to.

30
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:29,583
- Take your tray over there.
- No.

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,168
Why not?

32
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:35,297
This isn't PS 147,
we're adults now. She's married.

33
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,842
We have to at least pretend to know better.

34
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:42,096
- I went to the doctor about my headaches.
- Still looking.

35
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,306
Which you're not helping.

36
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:47,226
I've been trying
to diagnose myself on the Internet.

37
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,477
You can do that?

38
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:53,023
Type in your symptoms
and wait for the word "cancer" to appear.

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,151
Anyway, turns out I'm a tongue-thruster.

40
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,238
If you were a man,
that would be a good thing.

41
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,367
My tongue pushes against my front teeth,
so my bite is all off.

42
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,662
- My dentist thinks I have TMJ.
- You have to do something.

43
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,666
- I'm going to the orthodontist tomorrow.
- No, I mean he's really cute.

44
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,461
- She could write him a note.
- Even cuter.

45
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,922
Guys, I'm not writing him a note.

46
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,842
- Dear Mr Cutie-Cute...
- You did not write that.

47
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,596
- Just your phone number.
- I'm not giving him my number.

48
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,682
Relax, TMJ. You don't have to.

49
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,894
- I'll do it for you.
- Carrie.

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,021
- Go, girl.
- Oh, my God.

51
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:39,820
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you,
but my friend Miranda over there...

52
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:43,824
- Oh, my God.
- She thinks you're cute.

53
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:48,204
Please tell your friend Miranda to call me.

54
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,713
On the way home,
I decided to brave the afternoon heat

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,760
to see if my shoe repair guy
could do anything about my old soles.

56
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,057
But when I got there,
there was no "there" there.

57
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:26,617
- What happened to Artie?
- Artie?

58
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:31,622
My guy, my shoe guy.
He fixed these the last time.

59
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:36,126
He moved back to Williamsburg.
Brooklyn, not Colonial.

60
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:38,921
He couldn't afford the place
once they destabilised the rent.

61
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:43,092
If the comic business keeps going
the way it is, I won't be able to either.

62
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,638
- Comics aren't selling, huh?
- No, especially mine.

63
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,727
Power Lad, by Wade Adams.

64
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,647
Is this you? Did you draw this?

65
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,235
What's so powerful about him?

66
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:05,823
He's a superhero, or he wants to be.
His parents were superheroes.

67
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,993
He's trying to find his super-powers.
They haven't kicked in yet.

68
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,120
It's stupid.
What do you do?

69
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,582
- I'm a writer.
- That's cool. What do you write?

70
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,126
Turn to page seven of your newspaper.

71
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,176
Yes, I thought you looked familiar.

72
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:28,470
- Do you ever think about writing comics?
- Aren't they a boy thing?

73
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:33,142
No way. There are woman superheroes -
Batgirl, Supergirl, Black Canary...

74
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,394
You've heard of Wonder Woman.

75
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:39,190
With the bracelets and the tiara.

76
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:43,068
I used to love that even her accessories
had super-powers.

77
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,529
Oh, man.

78
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,204
What's wrong with them?

79
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,873
To them, you are Wonder Woman.

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,418
- All right, stop. I'll buy some.
- All right.

81
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:12,556
I never did get my shoes fixed.
But the following week, I got new boots.

82
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,686
I don't know what came over me,
but I felt compelled to thank him.

83
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:22,566
Even as a superhero,
I was powerless to resist.

84
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,570
That evening,
inspired by Miranda's digital diagnosis,

85
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:30,533
Charlotte went surfing
for a cure for Trey's condition.

86
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:35,037
There it was,
in both the on- and off-positions.

87
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:40,042
$8,000 worth of hydraulics
that could turn Trey into the Bionic Man.

88
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:43,504
Ordinarily, this was something
Charlotte would shy away from,

89
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,549
but since her marriage was shy of wood...

90
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:51,220
That night, I met Wade Adams
alias Power Lad at Bar Code,

91
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:55,516
the Times Square bar that specialised
in real drinks and virtual reality.

92
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,477
I can't believe this place,
it's like ten bucks a game.

93
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,646
Yeah, but games come with beer.

94
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,983
They want you to play
half as well and twice as much.

95
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:08,612
Sounds good to me. What will it be -
Bloodburst or Terrorfright II?

96
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,156
Whatever happened
to Frogger and Miss Pacman?

97
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:15,619
- She got married.
- No! To Pacman?

98
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,747
Good for them. Man, where have I been?

99
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:21,083
I don't know, but wanna go to Mars?

100
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,503
- For ten bucks? It's a bargain.
- Let's go.

101
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,714
Without leaving the building,

102
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,967
Power Lad took me
to the furthest reaches of the galaxy

103
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,803
and right back to seventh grade.

104
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,974
- There we go.
- Oh, God.

105
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,143
It was maddening.

106
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,814
Bram and Pippin favoured the '78 Lafite,
which was entirely acceptable.

107
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:47,818
The implant's on/off-switch
had Charlotte thinking about Trey's.

108
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:52,323
She desperately wanted to turn his on,
but didn't know where to find it.

109
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,242
The joke was on him. We ordered both.

110
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,163
How was your day?

111
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:06,337
I went to the gallery in the morning
and the framer's in the afternoon.

112
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:10,341
Then I found this on the internet. See?

113
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:19,600
What on earth is this?
What are you getting at?

114
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,644
Just that...

115
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,816
We've tried everything else and we still...

116
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:32,780
You haven't...in my...ever...

117
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,449
So I thought...

118
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,577
You can't be serious.

119
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,664
What other options do we have?

120
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:55,970
Five beers, four video games,
102 degrees outside later...

121
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,855
- You gotta be kidding.
- What? This is fun.

122
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:10,526
It's cheaper than taking cabs.
Besides, all the kids got them.

123
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:13,153
- Wanna try it?
- It's too hot to scoot.

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,159
We could go to my place. I have
a great view. The breeze is even better.

125
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,997
I'm not the kind of girl who scoots
to a guy's terrace on the first date.

126
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,625
I respect that.

127
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,295
- I have central air.
- Give me that scooter.

128
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,380
- Ever been on one?
- No.

129
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,883
- That's great.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:37,595
I'm scooting in heels.

131
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,944
You said you had a view, not the view.

132
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:58,365
And this breeze -
it's like there's different air up here.

133
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,744
- How do you have all this?
- Why don't I get us some beers?

134
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:04,997
Then we can talk
adventures and real estate.

135
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:09,793
How was it possible
that mild mannered Power Lad

136
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,715
could afford a classic six on the
Upper East Side with a view of the park?

137
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:20,471
Was he merely Power Lad by day
and secretly a millionaire playboy by night?

138
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,640
Hello?

139
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,893
You scared me.

140
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,271
- I heard voices outside and...
- You're up.

141
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:33,984
- Did we wake you?
- You know me, always keeping the watch.

142
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,153
Did you meet Carrie?

143
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,906
Carrie, I'd like you to meet my mother.

144
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:44,537
- Hello. It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:48,123
I'm off to bed.

146
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,251
You two have fun.

147
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,839
But don't stay up too late, dear.
Good night.

148
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,091
- Night.
- It's lovely to meet you.

149
00:10:57,258 --> 00:11:01,929
Lovely to meet you too, Mrs Adams.

150
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:08,644
- He lives with his parents?
- It's their apartment.

151
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,814
The next day at Commune,
daddy Brier's latest restaurant,

152
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,316
I asked Samantha
about my prospects with Power Lad.

153
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:18,279
Not sexy. Dump him immediately.
Use my cell phone.

154
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,282
He put his money in the comic book store.

155
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,035
- Still not sexy. What's his number?
- He's saving up for his own place.

156
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:29,874
You know how tough the market is.
Plus he's fun and funny.

157
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,876
Stop while you're still sexy.

158
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:36,839
There's no way you'd go out with a guy
who lived with his family?

159
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:39,049
Maybe Prince William.

160
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,468
I'm sorry I'm late.

161
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:45,764
This happens to tongue-thrusters.

162
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,893
I have to wear them for a year.
Am I hideous?

163
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:54,064
No. Hey, no.
No, they don't look so bad.

164
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:57,234
- Do you mean it?
- I'm sticking to my story.

165
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,196
Are you in pain?
I'm in pain looking at you.

166
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:03,991
I'm a 34-year-old with braces,
and I'm on a liquid diet.

167
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,826
Pain doesn't begin to cover it.

168
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:09,413
- Look, lunch.
- We didn't order champagne.

169
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,375
- Compliments of Jenny Brier.
- You always get the nicest compliments.

170
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:18,797
Do you realise, a 13-year-old girl
bought us a $200 bottle of Dom Perignon?

171
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:22,176
Do you know what I was buying
when I was 13? Nothing.

172
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:25,596
I couldn't afford anything.
I was serving Dilly Bars at Dairy Queen.

173
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,849
Where is she?
Where is that little Brat Mitzvah beast?

174
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:35,397
- Is everything fabulous?
- It is now. I didn't know you were here.

175
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:39,735
I didn't know you knew Carrie Bradshaw.
You are fucking fabulous.

176
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:43,447
Your column about secret sex -
hello, my life.

177
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,117
Seriously. My ex was so completely
about the sex when we were alone,

178
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,703
but at school, I didn't exist.

179
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,457
- They're all like that.
- Or worse. Men suck.

180
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,795
What?

181
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,005
I'm sorry, are your braces blue?

182
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,592
No, they're sapphire.
Oh my God, look.

183
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,596
You have the old-fashioned kind.
I didn't know they made those any more.

184
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:11,058
I'll be there. We have to dash.
Enjoy your meal, ladies.

185
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:14,019
You are so fucking fabulous.

186
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,319
Her braces are sapphire.
I'm a 34-year-old nerd.

187
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:26,031
- How old are they?
- 13.

188
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:28,200
- They sound...
- I know.

189
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,369
- They're dressed...
- I know.

190
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,538
Just like us.

191
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:38,460
Were Jenny Brier and her friends
dressed like 30-something-year-olds,

192
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:41,505
or were we trying to look like teenagers?

193
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:46,260
One of us was sending Dom Perignon,
another was touring around on a scooter.

194
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:48,929
When you're a teenager,
all you want to do is buy beer.

195
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,391
Once you hit 30,
all you want to do is get carded.

196
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,144
I wondered,
in today's youth obsessed culture,

197
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:59,648
are the women of my generation
growing into mature, responsible adults,

198
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:03,485
or are we 34 going on 13?

199
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,780
After a week of self-imposed seclusion,

200
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,201
Miranda felt strong enough
for solid food and table service

201
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,745
with Lance Bloom,
a senior editor at Knopf.

202
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,706
I started out wanting to be a writer,

203
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:19,960
but it's a solitary life.
I'm more interested in collaborating.

204
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,005
What are you working on now?

205
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:26,008
You have a little...

206
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,889
I just got these. They're going to
take some getting used to.

207
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,849
Oh my God.

208
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:39,146
What's it like to kiss somebody
with those things?

209
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,317
The doctor said it should be fine.

210
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,403
But a blow job is out of the question, right?

211
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:54,453
I was kidding.
That was a joke. I'm sorry.

212
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,916
He didn't want your hardware
getting too close to his software.

213
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,793
It's everybody.

214
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,381
I can't open my mouth without the whole
world looking at me like I'm a freak.

215
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:09,510
It's like I'm back in Junior High.
I was lucky to get out alive the first time.

216
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:13,180
You should think of it as mouth jewellery.
Your tooth bracelet.

217
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,266
I'm never dating again.

218
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:19,353
Of course you are. The guys worth dating
is not gonna care about your braces.

219
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,231
That was so After-School Special of you.

220
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:25,359
In the After-School Special,
you'd see him across the cafeteria.

221
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:28,529
He'd smile, and he'd have braces too.

222
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:33,742
Yeah, but the sick thing is, I would never
date a guy with braces. Even now.

223
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:37,037
Are you kidding me?
Don't you think that's childish?

224
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,291
- More lemonade, Carrie?
- Yes, please, Mrs Adams.

225
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:44,545
How about some nice,
homemade Toll House cookies?

226
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:46,714
Yes, please, Mrs Adams.

227
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:51,886
On closer inspection,
living with the parents wasn't so bad.

228
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,264
It was like having servants
you didn't have to pay.

229
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:58,142
Oh, and Carrie, can you stay for dinner?

230
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:06,233
Faced with the idea of having
hydraulic cylinders placed in his shaft,

231
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,653
Trey decided to pursue
the less physically demanding option

232
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,949
of couples counselling with a therapist
he'd found through his college alumni.

233
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:19,413
I sense you're both having difficulty
verbalising your sexual issues.

234
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:24,877
With some clients it often helps

235
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:30,007
to create your own non-threatening
language with which to talk about sex.

236
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:33,469
I'm not sure that I understand.

237
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:41,101
One client rather whimsically
dubbed his anus The Chocolate Starfish.

238
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,437
Are you sure you went to Yale?

239
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:49,652
Charlotte, if you could rename your vagina,

240
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:55,866
something non-sexual, something that
didn't feel threatening to you or Trey,

241
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,618
how would you call it?

242
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,497
Rebecca.

243
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,209
Rebecca? Why on earth would you...

244
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:08,921
It sounds nice,
and I've always liked the name.

245
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,048
How do you name yours?

246
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:15,845
- This is preposterous.
- Something with positive associations.

247
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:22,852
Trey loves to sail. Don't you, Trey?

248
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:25,062
I do love to sail.

249
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:28,148
How about something like Canoe?

250
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,483
Canoe?

251
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,906
- Canoe doesn't go with Rebecca.
- What then?

252
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:38,200
How about...

253
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,872
- ...Schooner.
- Schooner's good.

254
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,332
Rebecca and Schooner.
Schooner's good, isn't it?

255
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:51,463
It's very good.
This is a wonderful beginning.

256
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,010
There's still a lot of work ahead,
some here and some at home.

257
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:59,013
Tonight, as homework,

258
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,185
I want you to lie down together,
side by side, without touching,

259
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,856
and share a sexual fantasy.

260
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,526
I'm a fairy princess in a forest.

261
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,446
I'm riding on a unicorn.

262
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:20,784
Suddenly I see a pirate in buckskins.

263
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:23,871
A prince in disguise.

264
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,332
That's when you pull me off my unicorn.

265
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:29,418
You tear away my gossamer petticoats,

266
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:33,631
and you put your Schooner
deep inside my Rebecca.

267
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,720
Now you. Where are you?

268
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,932
I'm in hell.

269
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:46,977
I'm sorry, Charlotte. I can't do this.

270
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:52,358
- I'm a respected surgeon. I can't.
- Yes, you can. I know you can.

271
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:57,363
We've been dealing with this for weeks.
Accept that I'm not that sexual a person.

272
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,325
But we love each other and...

273
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,787
we're married now.

274
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:09,166
Rebecca and Schooner belong together.
They need each other. Please.

275
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,253
You are a fairy princess.

276
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,215
I don't deserve you. I'm sorry.

277
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:18,092
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:31,689
That night, Wade and I
had our first sleep-over, at my place.

279
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:34,817
I finally figured out what made
Power Lad so powerful.

280
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:39,697
He had the soul of a teenage boy
in the body of a very grown-up man.

281
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:41,949
The machine will get it.

282
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,243
Hi. Leave a message.

283
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:50,207
Hi, Carrie.
This is Mrs Adams, Wade's mother.

284
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:51,709
How are you?

285
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,295
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry to bother you.

286
00:19:54,461 --> 00:20:00,426
We never heard from Wade tonight
about whether he fed the dog his medicine.

287
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:04,346
Wade's father
was just about to give it to the dog,

288
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:09,143
but if he's already had it,
that would be bad.

289
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,980
If you speak to Wade, please tell him,

290
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:16,775
I won't go to bed until I hear from him.

291
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:20,196
Yes, mom, I gave the dog his medicine.

292
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,574
No, mom, I'm not mad, I just...

293
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:26,535
I told you not to call me here.

294
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,580
Don't call me here.

295
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,750
I love you too.

296
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,714
- She wants to talk to you.
- What?

297
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,726
Hi, Mrs Adams. How are you?

298
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,939
Several blocks south,
Charlotte's night was interrupted as well -

299
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:58,484
by odd noises coming from her bathroom.

300
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:12,873
Charlotte felt terrible.
She hadn't meant to make Trey cry.

301
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,591
Honey?

302
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:50,244
- He told me he wasn't a sexual person.
- It wasn't sexual.

303
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:52,830
It was tension release.
It helps me sleep.

304
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:57,793
I understand.
This may be difficult, Trey,

305
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,300
but I want you to tell me specifically
which magazine you were using.

306
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,261
"Juggs".

307
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:12,474
All right. We can try and see this
as a positive thing.

308
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,686
How? How is this a positive thing?

309
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:22,818
Trey was masturbating to Juggs.
At least we know he isn't gay.

310
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:26,322
Excuse me,
what exactly is the problem here?

311
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:30,618
It was tension release with a magazine,
it had nothing to do with my wife.

312
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,662
Interesting choice of words, Trey.

313
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:36,624
Maybe that's the problem.

314
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,838
We have to find a way to integrate
your wife into your sexual routine.

315
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,468
How are we supposed to do that?

316
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,678
Charlotte had no idea.

317
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:54,517
She wished they were 13, before sex
had made everything so complicated.

318
00:22:54,683 --> 00:23:00,064
When holding hands and a good-night-kiss
would have been everything she needed.

319
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:03,943
To pierce the corporate veil,
the courts look at five factors -

320
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,363
whether the subsidiary
is wholly-owned or...

321
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:12,451
The 13-year-old girl inside Miranda
wanted to disappear,

322
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:17,414
but the 34-year-old partner in this law firm
decided she wasn't going anywhere.

323
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:22,211
You think that I'm funny? You think
the fact that I have braces is hilarious?

324
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,172
Let's take a moment
and have a good laugh.

325
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:29,385
Let's get it out of our systems
so we can get back to work like adults.

326
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:32,680
We were laughing
at the typo on page three.

327
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:40,813
Miranda decided that TMJ was a lot
less painful than a second adolescence.

328
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,649
The next day,
she had her braces removed

329
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:46,443
and resumed her life
as a 34-year-old tongue-thruster.

330
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,530
Trey resumed his own brand of thrusting

331
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:53,409
and discovered
that tension release could be a turn-on.

332
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:07,298
Charlotte discovered a way
to include herself in Trey's sex life.

333
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:14,889
She also figured out what to do with those
wedding proofs not suitable for framing.

334
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:18,642
The following weekend
at the Brier Bat Mitzvah party...

335
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,939
I'm not sure if I have your name.
Let's see, Goldman, Goldstein...

336
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:25,900
I don't see it.

337
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,694
I'm sure I'm on the list.

338
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:45,252
I can't believe you still have actual albums.

339
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,424
Oh my God, Styx. I love Styx.

340
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:54,929
- I had this album.
- Yeah, I loved "Renegade". Hated "Babe".

341
00:24:57,181 --> 00:25:01,477
- How do you have this?
- Are you kidding? This is a classic.

342
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:06,649
This song is so me driving my parents'
Oldsmobile without them knowing about it.

343
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:09,527
- You know what would go great with this?
- Roller skates?

344
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:11,737
No.

345
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,322
Canadian super grass.

346
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:16,617
Six times stronger than pot
and 400 bucks an ounce.

347
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:22,498
It became obvious Wade was in no hurry
to save up for his own apartment.

348
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:26,460
- And what is that?
- My bong. I made it.

349
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:31,841
- At Camp Takotoke.
- I'm sorry, Camp Takotoke?

350
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:37,763
I hadn't smoked pot out of a homemade
bong since my eighth grade boyfriend

351
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:42,059
made one out of tin foil, a BIC pen,
and a bottle of his mother's Pepsi Light.

352
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:45,396
I didn't even know if I'd remember how.

353
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:49,984
Turns out it was like riding a bike...
a ten speed.

354
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,988
Back at the Bat Mitzvah bash,

355
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:57,408
Samantha heard some girl talk
not suitable for little ladies.

356
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,995
I'm gonna fuck at least three of those
NSYNC guys after the after party.

357
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,997
The other two are gay.

358
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:07,084
I'd fuck them and their gay boyfriends.

359
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:10,212
Aren't you a little young
for that kind of talk?

360
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:15,092
I'm serious.
You have your whole lives to talk that way.

361
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:21,015
You should enjoy being children, at least
until you turn 15, and start having sex.

362
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:25,060
- I've given blow jobs since I'm twelve.
- Really?

363
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:28,898
- It's the only way to get guys to like you.
- That isn't true.

364
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:31,442
Talk to the hand, grandma.

365
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:36,113
Samantha had been resenting Jenny Brier
because of everything she had.

366
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,699
But then she realised,
she'd had something

367
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:42,536
that no amount of money could buy -
a childhood.

368
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:46,582
Suddenly,
the Dairy Queen wasn't looking so bad.

369
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:56,383
I'm thirsty.

370
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,428
There's bong water.

371
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,931
Bong water!

372
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:19,615
Hold this.

373
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:31,418
What are you doing? That's wet.

374
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:40,135
Attack of the spicy chicken wings.

375
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:44,682
Shit!

376
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,644
That looks like my parents' car.

377
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:52,940
Oh, shit.

378
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:58,737
- Shit, shit, shit.
- It's OK.

379
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:02,116
My parents said,
if they caught me smoking pot again,

380
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:05,369
- I'd have to sleep in the comic book store.
- Wait.

381
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:06,620
What?

382
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,081
If they see billions of chicken wings,

383
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:12,293
they're gonna know...

384
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:16,589
...we've been smoking pot.

385
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:20,843
Fuck the chicken wings.
Where did we put the fucking pot?

386
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,308
You're home. Early.

387
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,771
Is that marijuana I smell?

388
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,193
- No, ma'am.
- God, no.

389
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:41,322
Then what is this?

390
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:48,162
Your father and I told you, if you ever
brought marijuana into this house again...

391
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,955
Carrie brought it.

392
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:54,585
I couldn't believe it. Power Lad
would never have ratted me out like that.

393
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:58,672
Is that true, Carrie?
Did you bring marijuana into this house?

394
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,177
There comes a time when you
have to take responsibility for yourself.

395
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:08,349
A time when l, like Jenny Brier,
had to stand up and say to the world,

396
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,476
"Today, I am a woman."

397
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,689
Yes, Mrs Adams,
I brought the marijuana into the house.

398
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:19,944
And I'm taking it with me when I go.

399
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:29,703
Oh, baby!

400
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:33,165
There she is.

401
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:37,920
In the end, I decided
I was definitely 34 going on 35,

402
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:41,090
but in a city like New York
with its pace and pressures,

403
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:43,968
sometimes it's important
to have a 13-year-old moment,

404
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:47,888
to remember a simpler time
when the best thing in life was hanging out,

405
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:54,228
listening to records, and having fun
with your friends - in your own apartment.
