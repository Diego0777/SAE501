1
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:56,907
LA - land of perpetual sun and sun bathing,
which also makes it

2
00:00:57,074 --> 00:01:00,661
land of the perpetual bikini wax.

3
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:06,041
After a week, I made an appointment
with the city's premier waxer to the stars -

4
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,543
Alicia.

5
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,256
She was known for her artful work,
her lightning-quick hands...

6
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:16,260
...and her indecipherable accent.

7
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,596
Excuse me?

8
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:26,353
All done. Beautiful. You look.

9
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:33,319
She took everything I've got.

10
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,487
It's called "The Brazilian Wax."

11
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,489
Why didn't you tell her to stop.

12
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:40,534
I feel like one of those hairless dogs.

13
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,787
It's an aesthetic thing. They all do it here.

14
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,373
LA men are too lazy to search for anything.

15
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,627
You can't hide your light under a bush.

16
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,296
Didn't she leave a triangle, a landing strip?

17
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:56,675
No, I am totally bald and freezing.

18
00:01:56,842 --> 00:02:00,596
- I would have killed her.
- I'm so aware of down there now.

19
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:03,307
I feel like I'm nothing but walking sex.

20
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,602
The Brazilian makes you do crazy things.

21
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,854
Be careful who you invite to Brazil.

22
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:12,483
- I'm officially RSVP'ing: no.
- Where are you going?

23
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,653
- I'm meeting Lew.
- Letterman Lew?

24
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,948
He doesn't work for him any more.
He's writing that New York sitcom.

25
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:22,201
The one about the kids who live in a loft.

26
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:26,163
- Yeah, one's a feisty waitress.
- What are you and Lew gonna do?

27
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,960
We'll have drinks and bitch about LA.
I can't believe he lives here now.

28
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:35,840
- You should tell him to move to Brazil.
- You're on your own tonight.

29
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,676
- We'll go to that movie premier.
- What's the movie?

30
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:42,805
No one sees it. We'll use my press pass,
and get into the after party.

31
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:47,351
- I love LA.
- You two should get out of the sun.

32
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:55,568
Lew asked Miranda
to meet him at The Flowing Tree.

33
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:59,029
Surrounded by all these tanned,
fit, happy people,

34
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:03,409
she knew she would recognise pale,
chubby, unhappy Lew immediately.

35
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,578
Miranda.

36
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:09,874
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,879
- Do I look that different?
- It's a good thing you still wear that hat.

38
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,090
- If you ever see me in a Lakers hat...
- ...shoot you.

39
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:21,886
- Exactly. Do you want to sit?
- You look amazing.

40
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,972
- Thanks. Wanna grab a drink?
- Please.

41
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,517
Yes, let's go. The sight
of all these bleached teeth is blinding.

42
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:32,479
No, here. This place is known
for its green tea infusions.

43
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,066
Please - infusions?
Could LA be any worse?

44
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,278
Take off that hat,
I'm gonna shoot you right now.

45
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,072
I really like it here.

46
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,328
What happened to the guy I used to share
beers with and make fun of happy people?

47
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:51,707
I know. The thing is, I think I'm one
of those happy people now.

48
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:55,836
- Good for you!
- I know it sounds crazy.

49
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,547
I was supremely unhappy in New York.

50
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:02,885
I came here, and I let
a lot of that old toxic anger go.

51
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:08,098
I take things slowly, get outside...
LA agrees with me.

52
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:11,143
Miranda realised,
she was the one standing out.

53
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,813
She was the only angry
New Yorker for miles.

54
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,234
Let's go for a hike.

55
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,495
Later that night,
two very happy New Yorkers prepared

56
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:32,456
to hike up their first LA red carpet.

57
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,753
- Carrie Bradshaw of the New York Star.
- Are you on the list?

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,216
- I'm a columnist. That's me.
- Press room is to the left.

59
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:46,011
Crinkle-cut cheese and fat reporters,
I don't think so.

60
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:49,014
- Let me see your passes from the movie.
- No one goes to the movie.

61
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,435
Everyone goes to the movie.
Could you step off the red carpet?

62
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:57,147
- Do you know who she is?
- She's not on the list.

63
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,651
OK, OK. Let's just go.

64
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:04,780
This wouldn't happen in New York.
People know you in New York.

65
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:07,575
- No one goes to the movie.
- We're out of here.

66
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,618
I'm getting the car.

67
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:17,126
There I was, a Hollywood nobody,

68
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:23,465
cast off the red carpet and standing
in my proper place on a parking lot.

69
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:27,636
I'm talking in circles here. That's right.

70
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:31,182
I understand.
I heard you. OK, sure.

71
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:40,482
Tell her that when she's ready to deal,
she can call me herself.

72
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,279
- Please tell me you have another one.
- I thought I had a problem.

73
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:48,908
Got a light for me?
Thanks.

74
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:55,956
Whole tars, very nice.
I thought they'd banned these here.

75
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,459
I taped them to my body on the plane.

76
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,377
- New Yorker?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:06,717
- Keith Travers, representing Matt Damon.
- Carrie Bradshaw, representing myself.

78
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,887
- Actress?
- No, no. Writer.

79
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,223
Too pretty to be a writer.

80
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,059
That's too cheesy for you to be a writer.

81
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:20,356
- It will take an hour to get the car.
- Samantha Jones, meet Keith Travers.

82
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,150
He's representing Matt Damon.

83
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,070
- You aren't going anywhere.
- If you say so.

84
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:29,031
We go inside, just enjoy our evening.

85
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:32,868
Once we got inside,
our magic carpet ride really began.

86
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:36,080
I can't believe they wouldn't let you in.
That's a disconnect.

87
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:40,960
- A disconnect?
- Yeah. It's like a fuck-up.

88
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,045
A disconnect!

89
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:48,092
Yeah. You writers are word Nazis.
You're gonna ride me with that.

90
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,637
Someone's ass is ringing,
and it ain't mine.

91
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:54,306
Yours would if it could.
It would ring.

92
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:59,103
Excuse me, I'll just be one second.
Enjoy yourself.

93
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,650
That is one tall drink of water.

94
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,119
Samantha had worshipped Hugh Hefner
since she was old enough

95
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:19,707
to steal her father's Playboys.
To her, this wasn't a celebrity sighting.

96
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,209
This was the celebrity sighting.

97
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,420
I'll be back.

98
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:32,469
Hugh, hi. I'm Samantha Jones.

99
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:35,639
- Hello.
- I'm a huge fan.

100
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,601
- In that case, join us for a drink.
- A drink?

101
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,145
- That would be great.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,731
Seriously?

103
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:51,780
Drinking with three blondes -
I guess that's a regular day for you.

104
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,533
A slow one, yes.

105
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,955
I'm pretty crazed this week,
but I have a lunch opening on Wednesday.

106
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:03,292
Can I take you out?
Linc, great table.

107
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,670
I had been trying
to get into Linc for a week.

108
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:11,342
He seemed smart and sexy, and this
outsider liked the view from the inside.

109
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,178
- Yeah, OK. Sure.
- Great.

110
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,639
Hey, Keith.
There's a VIP room.

111
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:21,644
- Do you want to go there?
- Yeah, I want to go to the VIP room.

112
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,854
- Let's go.
- All right.

113
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,943
Back home,
Charlotte had never felt more inside.

114
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,446
She had just attended
her first black tie doctors' benefit.

115
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,789
- Damn, we make a fine looking couple.
- Yes, we do.

116
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:46,961
So, how did I do?

117
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,755
Mrs MacDougal, you did quite well.

118
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,508
Thank you, Dr MacDougal.

119
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:58,764
You know, doctor, I have an itch.
I was hoping you could help me out with it.

120
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,560
Trey?

121
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:10,860
Maybe it's time we thought
about some options, like Viagra.

122
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:18,117
Are you aware that Viagra
is a killer for men with heart problems?

123
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:23,080
My father died of a heart attack.
It runs in my family.

124
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,708
Trey wasn't the only one
with heart problems.

125
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,586
I'm just trying to help.

126
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,130
Now I'm tense.
I'm going for a run.

127
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:35,968
It was the fifth time Trey had gone running
at bedtime in the last two weeks.

128
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:40,181
The next day, Samantha decided
to get some exercise as well.

129
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,475
Her pocketbook was getting
most of the workout.

130
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:45,686
Fendi, 150.

131
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,985
She decided
to give her old pocketbook a rest.

132
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,830
As Charlotte picked up my mail,
she realised,

133
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:10,669
she missed a lot more than her sex life.
She missed her single life.

134
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:15,925
If Trey could run away from their problems,
so could she.

135
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:23,432
- I can't deal with Trey.
- Calling me might be more economical.

136
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,853
And I really missed you guys.

137
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,940
We missed you too.

138
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:34,652
- Trey is...
- It's not working.

139
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,696
He refuses to even talk about it.

140
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:42,451
- I take it from the bag you'll be staying?
- I need a vacation.

141
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:46,705
You came to the right place.
I gotta meet this Keith guy.

142
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,959
Miranda and Samantha
are down by the pool.

143
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,093
Charlotte glanced at the glistening pool,

144
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,847
and just like that,
her marriage and Trey seemed far away.

145
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:12,231
Before lunch, I agreed to go with Keith
to see a house he was interested in.

146
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:19,697
This is not a house. This is an airport.

147
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:23,868
It's Lorenzo Lamas'.
He's asking 3.4, but it'll go for 3.2.

148
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,036
There's a bargain!

149
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:30,958
In New York,
a first date is dinner and a movie.

150
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,337
In LA, it's lunch
and seeing a 3.4 million dollar house.

151
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,464
What do you think?

152
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:41,635
- I should work in syndicated television.
- It's good, right?

153
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,388
It's really good.

154
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:48,100
But does a single guy like you
need this much space?

155
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:51,395
Probably not.
But come on, it looks good.

156
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,606
So did he.

157
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:07,244
And in the South American's living room,
my Brazilian made me kiss him.

158
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,999
Wait till you see the hot tub.

159
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,129
- We should check out the hot tub.
- Okey-dokey.

160
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:24,720
I'll have the omelette with no cheese,
but tomatoes and mushrooms.

161
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:30,559
Instead of the fries a side of fruit
with no grapes, and a half decaf skim.

162
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,062
You should get the mushrooms steamed.

163
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,981
It lightens the calories
but retains the flavour.

164
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:37,900
Great, thanks.

165
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,653
- I really like LA.
- Who wouldn't?

166
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,822
Keith wants a $3.4 m house,
and I can't afford new curtains.

167
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:47,952
That's where the guys here have
New York men beat - real estate.

168
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:51,038
- Lew may be the perfect guy.
- Letterman Lew?

169
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,416
Yeah. He's an ideal combination
of the two coasts.

170
00:12:54,583 --> 00:13:00,673
He's still a New Yorker at heart, but he's
lost all his neuroses and 30 pounds.

171
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,510
We're New Yorkers.
Aren't we supposed to like neurotic guys?

172
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:07,012
The Woody Allen thing is so over.

173
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,850
He's a changed man.
He's spiritual and happy.

174
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:13,936
- He met the Dalai Lama.
- I met Hugh Hefner.

175
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:17,439
One woman's pornographer
is another woman's spiritual leader.

176
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:21,944
Maybe he's on to something.
Maybe it's time I stopped being so angry.

177
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:27,116
- What would you do with your free time?
- I'll tell you what you could do.

178
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:29,702
- Shop.
- Jesus!

179
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,955
- No, you didn't!
- That's like $3,000.

180
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:35,708
Or 150. Fake.

181
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,918
- No.
- It looks so real.

182
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,171
- I know.
- Give me that.

183
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:43,007
You'd never know it wasn't real
unless you looked at the lining.

184
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:45,885
I don't have that luxury.
All my insides are on the outside now.

185
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:49,221
- I don't like fakes.
- All that matters is what it looks like.

186
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:50,681
It's good.

187
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:55,394
We could get more. I've got the guy's card.
He lives in the "Valley".

188
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:59,148
- Could you have more condoms?
- I did.

189
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:04,236
I am so happy
to be out of that condom stage of life.

190
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,572
I thought it was called "my thirties".

191
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,866
It's nice to go to bed
with the same man every night.

192
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:14,038
Please tell me you didn't come to LA
to tell us how much sex you're having now.

193
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:18,250
Charlotte didn't tell them
her conjugal bliss was a conjugal miss.

194
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,587
What should I do first in LA?

195
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:26,967
The first thing you'll need is
a good bikini wax.

196
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,678
You should try Alicia.

197
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:44,318
That night, after hours of stress-free
pool time, I realised something startling.

198
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,404
I was actually starting to like LA.

199
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:51,867
New Yorkers are trained
to hate Los Angeles,

200
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,370
where, supposedly,
intellect is ridiculed

201
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,373
and who you date
and what you look like is revered.

202
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,917
Yet, we were having the time of our lives.

203
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:03,379
The men were happy, the homes
were huge, the bags looked great.

204
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:07,675
Maybe that was enough.
The weather moves from west to east.

205
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:11,804
Was it a just matter of time
before the truth blew across Manhattan?

206
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:17,726
When it comes to bags, men and cities,
is it really what's outside that counts?

207
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:21,897
The next day, Samantha and I
went to the Valley for Fendi bags.

208
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,400
This is it, 45386.

209
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,986
- Is that an address or a zip code?
- I don't know.

210
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,613
I miss Lorenzo Lamas' neighbourhood.

211
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:37,496
- My God.
- Oh, there he is.

212
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:42,459
We had found it. Fake Fendi paradise.

213
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,755
He should work on his display area.

214
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,967
Seven for 1,000. You like?

215
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:55,806
I should have liked them. But staring into
that trunk, they no longer looked elegant,

216
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,560
they looked cheap.
Even if everyone else thought it was real,

217
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:04,440
I'd always know, my bag came
from a trunk deep in the Valley.

218
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,318
You know what? I don't think so.

219
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:11,655
- You don't want a bag now?
- I'm sorry. They're very nice. It's just...

220
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,825
Please, don't smoke near the bags.

221
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,455
We drove for two hours in the Valley...

222
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:25,002
That's it. I'm going back to the hotel.

223
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,965
They looked so sad
staring up at me from that trunk.

224
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,176
They were waiting to be adopted.

225
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:35,888
I was almost eaten by dogs. The least
you could've done was buy a bag.

226
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:42,144
It's better to wait for the real thing.
Then at least you know it's special.

227
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,482
- My marriage is a fake Fendi.
- Excuse me?

228
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,319
Trey and I look like
the perfect couple from the outside,

229
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:54,698
but on the inside it's all fake.
It's not special.

230
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,159
- He can't get it up.
- What?

231
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,621
- We've never had sex.
- You've never had sex?

232
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,915
- You've been married for...
- ...over a month.

233
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:07,127
- You've never had sex?
- It's not physical, it's emotional.

234
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:10,589
- You know about this?
- She told me at the wedding.

235
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:17,096
I was afraid you'd say you'd told me so
and I shouldn't have married so quickly.

236
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:23,060
Who am I to judge you?
We all have our own paths in life.

237
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:26,105
Three days with Lew
had changed Miranda

238
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:29,859
from deeply sarcastic to Deepak Chopra.

239
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:34,029
- What am I gonna do?
- You've never had sex?

240
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:37,449
- She's never had sex.
- It's only been a month.

241
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:42,371
- He hasn't seen Brazil.
- A second honeymoon to South America.

242
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,499
- That might do the trick.
- I know how to cheer you up.

243
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,835
A trip to the Playboy mansion.

244
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:51,797
Hef invited us for one of those
Playmate pool parties.

245
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,924
Did you say, "Hef"?

246
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,303
Why would that cheer her up?
Does she look like a frat boy?

247
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:59,930
No, but it wouldn't hurt to meet some.

248
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:03,392
- Sorry, not going.
- Come on, it would be fun.

249
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,477
We're in LA.

250
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:08,397
All right, fine,
but I better be on the guest list.

251
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:12,735
Later that night,
I was a guest at Keith's amazing house.

252
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:16,488
He made sizzling scallops,
and after dinner things got even hotter.

253
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:22,494
I like hot tubs. New York should have
more hot tubs like on roofs and stuff.

254
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,164
Well, if you like that...

255
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,029
While I was going native with Keith,
Miranda and Lew went back to New York.

256
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,281
At least to the New York strip steak.

257
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,576
- This looks great.
- God, do I miss this smell!

258
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:05,329
So, you were saying?

259
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:08,040
Read "Zen And The Art Of Modern Living".

260
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,168
I'm still trying to get used to bath beans.

261
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:15,005
- You are so New York.
- Come on, don't you miss it?

262
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,551
- Just a little?
- No, I write about it every day.

263
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,970
That's not New York, it's a sound stage.

264
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:26,767
20-somethings with tiny salaries don't live
in huge SoHo lofts. It's totally fake.

265
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,771
40 million viewers
would disagree with you on that one.

266
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:41,490
- Is something wrong with your steak?
- No, it's great.

267
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,670
- What are you doing?
- I'm tasting my food.

268
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:59,842
- Why aren't you swallowing your food?
- Do you think I look this good by eating?

269
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:04,221
Lew hadn't found inner peace,
he'd found an eating disorder.

270
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:07,683
- Are you serious?
- Don't put your toxic shit on me.

271
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,395
This is LA. You have no idea
what pressure I'm under.

272
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,606
Who cares what you look like.
You're a writer.

273
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:17,526
For a hit show.
No one wants to hire a fat story editor.

274
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:20,362
Miranda wanted
to rip that Knicks hat off his head.

275
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:25,117
No self-respecting New Yorker
would spit out that good a steak.

276
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:29,246
Jesus fucking Christ.
Now I've lost my appetite.

277
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:35,961
Waking up in Keith's sun filled bedroom,
I felt like 3.4 million myself.

278
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:38,380
I like what you have going on down there.

279
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:43,219
- That would be a whole lot of nothing.
- Yeah.

280
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:46,222
- Don't you work?
- I don't have anything till eleven.

281
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,849
- Nice life.
- Yeah.

282
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:54,563
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

283
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,067
I told you, no prostitutes
when you're house-sitting.

284
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:03,155
- You're a house-sitter?
- Personal assistant.

285
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,909
- I thought you were an agent.
- I wish my agent would water my plants.

286
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:11,330
The life I was coveting wasn't Keith's,
it was Carrie Fisher's.

287
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:15,876
- You're so fired. Wait till I tell Penny.
- Am I going to have to return her car?

288
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,586
And Penny Marshall's.

289
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:19,630
I'm going to...

290
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:22,466
- You might need these.
- Thank you.

291
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:27,388
Are you going to bring prostitutes
to Ben's new three million dollar home?

292
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,306
And Ben Affleck's.

293
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:32,643
I'm not a prostitute.
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.

294
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:38,399
I'm a writer too.
I have a column in New York.

295
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:42,194
I'm Carrie, you're Carrie.
I write, you write.

296
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:45,781
I have a child. I really can't do this.

297
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,159
Have you been smoking in here?

298
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,961
This was always on.

299
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:02,339
The dry cleaning and the cat food,
that's all done.

300
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:06,260
It was the perfect ending
to my week of make-believe -

301
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:10,181
a visit to the Playboy mansion
and the Playmate pool party.

302
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,978
- Could our lives get any weirder?
- Nothing surprises me any more.

303
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:20,107
In LA, house-sitters are somebodies
and writers are prostitutes.

304
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:23,569
- You're at least a high class escort.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,821
- Carrie Fisher!
- Now we're angry again?

306
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:28,199
- Yeah.
- I blame the wax.

307
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:30,618
That's it. Blame it on Rio.

308
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,291
After the sun went down,
the party really started heating up.

309
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,711
Where are the girls
in the satin outfits and the Bunny ears?

310
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:43,714
Yeah, I want to see some Bunny ears.

311
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,388
Somewhere between
the ltalian grotto and the petting zoo,

312
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:54,475
Charlotte found something real.
His name was lan.

313
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:58,646
- That's when I started collecting Hockney.
- I love Hockney.

314
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:02,274
The colours in his pool series are so LA.

315
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:05,236
The blues and those deep greens.

316
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:09,865
God, it is such a pleasure
talking to an intelligent woman for once.

317
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,201
I love talking to you too.

318
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:17,581
It's so nice to be with a man who talks.
I love LA.

319
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:23,045
I guess that third welcome drink
has finally kicked in?

320
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,924
This is bad of me.
Is this bad of me? I'm drunk.

321
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:29,468
I'm lying here with a man I hardly know.

322
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,638
It's the Playboy mansion.
Things could be worse.

323
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,478
- You're nice, lan. You're really nice.
- You're nice too.

324
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:46,652
- Let me buy you some boobs.
- Pardon me?

325
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,614
- It's a gift.
- I don't need any breasts.

326
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:55,077
Charlotte had forgotten
how awful single life could be.

327
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:59,081
Suddenly, marriage with all its problems
wasn't looking so bad.

328
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,296
- Someone stole my fake Fendi.
- Are you sure?

329
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:08,424
I put it beside me.
When I got up, it was gone.

330
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,804
Oh my God, that Bunny's got my bag.

331
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,020
Give me my bag.

332
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:23,898
- You stole my bag.
- This is my bag.

333
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,903
- Are we having a problem?
- Yes. This Bunny stole my bag.

334
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,656
- It's my bag.
- She says it's her bag.

335
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:35,910
Look on the inside.
There's a label that says "made in China"

336
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,954
and there's a bunch
of condoms in there.

337
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,625
Fendi.

338
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:47,630
Samantha was mortified. She assumed
everything on the Bunny was fake.

339
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,302
OK then. Innocent mistake.

340
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:57,056
Apparently, one nod from Hef,
and the pool party was over.

341
00:24:57,223 --> 00:25:02,645
- I'm not leaving without my friends.
- I'm so sorry.

342
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:06,440
The fake Fendi ended up
costing 150 for the bag,

343
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:12,947
2,000 in stolen credit card charges,
and unspecified costs to Samantha's ego.

344
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:20,496
Across the compound, Miranda and I
took a wrong turn on the way to the buffet.

345
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:29,338
Look at that - tit soup.

346
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,174
It's time to go home.

347
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,510
There you are.

348
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:36,720
- We have to leave.
- We are.

349
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:38,389
Right now.

350
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:41,559
Relax. We're going, we're going.

351
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:45,479
- What did she do?
- I don't know.

352
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:50,860
What happened?
OK. All right.

353
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:54,905
The next day,
four New Yorkers left LA a little lighter.

354
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:59,159
Some of us had lost our hair,
and all of us had lost a little dignity.

355
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:03,247
Samantha couldn't wait to get back
to the crime free streets of Manhattan.

356
00:26:03,414 --> 00:26:05,791
Miranda couldn't wait
to get back to men who swallowed.

357
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,294
Charlotte couldn't wait to get back to Trey.

358
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,921
And as for me, I couldn't wait.

359
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,633
- You can't smoke in here.
- Relax, we're going.

360
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,146
Six hours later, I was home.

361
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:30,566
It looked even better on the inside
than I remembered it,

362
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:35,237
because inside it was all real.

363
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:42,244
I was starting to feel like myself again.

364
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:48,042
The rest of me
would grow back eventually.
