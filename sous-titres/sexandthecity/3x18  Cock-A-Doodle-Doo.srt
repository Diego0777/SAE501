1
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,004
What?

2
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,848
In life, there are all sorts of wake-up calls.

3
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,893
But crowing on East 73rd Street

4
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:26,562
was one I was not prepared for.

5
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:34,653
It was my own fault.

6
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,532
I'd let my frenzy for a rent-controlled
apartment near Barneys,

7
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,494
override the fact that it was
animal hospital adjacent.

8
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,042
That's the thing about New York - you
never know what's just around the corner.

9
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:53,714
Or, in Samantha's case,
just outside your window.

10
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:17,404
There they were - Samantha's
neighbourhood, transsexual hookers.

11
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,699
Half man, half woman, totally annoying.

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,452
Girl, she got herself
a handful with that one!

13
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:26,914
He was all up in my stuff once.

14
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:31,502
I told him to get that thing
out of my ass or I'll shit on it.

15
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,717
"Get that out my ass, or I'll shit on it."
Is that the dirtiest thing you've ever heard?

16
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,928
Let's hope so!

17
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,056
I am paying to live in a neighbourhood

18
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,433
that's trendy by day, and tranny by night.

19
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:49,603
Transsexuals. Chicks with dicks.

20
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,814
Boobs on top, balls down below.

21
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,110
- I don't get the appeal there.
- It's the other white meat.

22
00:02:56,277 --> 00:03:01,532
I understand that pseudo-straight men
have to get laid, but not on my block.

23
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,951
I thought my chickens were bad.

24
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:08,289
Every morning at 4:00 am they start up.
It's like they're putting on a show.

25
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,792
The "Up-my-ass Players".

26
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,215
Too early for tranny talk?

27
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,303
It's so weird to be sitting here
eating omelette again

28
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,388
like nothing ever happened.

29
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:27,057
It was our first Saturday morning breakfast

30
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:31,270
since Charlotte had left Trey,
her husband of three months.

31
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:35,566
I was married.
And now, what? I'm single again?

32
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:40,321
- You're not single, you're just separated.
- That's right.

33
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,450
I'll never be single again... I'll be divorced.

34
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:49,371
The only thing worse than being 34
and single is being 34 and divorced.

35
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:50,998
Nice.

36
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:55,628
I think it's worse to be 34 and trapped
in a marriage that doesn't work.

37
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,964
- Didn't I try hard enough?
- "Hard" is the word.

38
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:02,510
Sweetie, Trey has an impotence problem...

39
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:07,932
I am so sick of talking about Trey.
I think and talk about Trey all the time.

40
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:13,270
Change the subject, please.
Talk about the "up my ass" stuff.

41
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,190
OK, here's the plan.

42
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:20,736
Sunday night, we all come over,
have an unpacking party and no Trey-talk.

43
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,655
I'll bring the cocktails.

44
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,991
I'll bring the food.
How about roof-chicken?

45
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,832
Can I help you?

46
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,836
I live around the corner and my window

47
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,923
looks over the roof
with the chickens and the crowing...

48
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,967
- Roosters.
- Excuse me?

49
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,511
They are roosters.
Roosters crow.

50
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,765
Yes, they do.
And very loudly.

51
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:54,895
I'm so sorry. We just got them.
Rescued from a cockfight in the Bronx.

52
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,565
- My God.
- I'll have them moved to the basement.

53
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,652
You don't have to do that.
They had all that fight-trauma.

54
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,947
They need fresh air.
I don't want them to be miserable.

55
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,409
Don't worry.
They have a very lovely life.

56
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,370
That's all right. I'll get over it.

57
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,998
Thank you for being so nice.

58
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,254
Just gonna take one of these
for my friend. She has a cat.

59
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,221
Are you hungry?

60
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,641
Yeah?
I'm hungry too.

61
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:56,707
- Shanghai Garden. May I help you?
- I'd like to order some take-out.

62
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:02,463
- Address, please.
- 331 West 78th Street. Apartment 4F.

63
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,716
I'd like to order some chicken
with broccoli in a brown...

64
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:09,011
Brown sauce, with brown rice.
Cold noodles.

65
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,431
I know. Every night the same.

66
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,683
Right.

67
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,687
The Chinese take-out lady
thinks I'm pathetic.

68
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:21,565
She said: "Every night, the same thing."

69
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,984
That's a tad bitchy for a take-out lady.

70
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,529
- Do you think I'm in a rut?
- A food-rut?

71
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:30,407
I'm sitting home with my cat, ordering
the same thing almost every night.

72
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:35,120
The only thing sadder would be to have
a Cathy Comic on my refrigerator door.

73
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,873
Never say Cathy Comic to me again.

74
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,709
She giggled at me. The take-out lady.

75
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:45,047
Order from someplace else. There is like
600 Chinese places on your block.

76
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:49,718
This place is my favourite. It's easier
than figuring out where else to go.

77
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:52,346
Then bear the take-out food shame.

78
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,767
There they were.
Our ex-boyfriends.

79
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:03,524
What are they doing together?
Are they friends now?

80
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,568
Apparently. This is bad.

81
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:09,572
What do you think
they are talking about? Their dogs?

82
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:13,075
Yeah, here's their conversation:
"How's your dog? Good, yours?

83
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,870
Was that the bitches
who ruined our lives?"

84
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,080
They didn't see us.

85
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,799
We have a choice. We can either run
the other way or move into this building.

86
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,469
We can't run.

87
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,930
Your shoe-straps will break.

88
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,810
- How do I look?
- Good. Great!

89
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:41,937
You look great too.

90
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:45,274
Thank God I didn't wear
my drawstring pants.

91
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,164
Look who it is!

92
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:06,837
That's another thing about New York.
You never know who is around the corner.

93
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:10,341
This is what I like about New York.
Street-traffic.

94
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,888
Well, look at you.

95
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,267
Look who it is, Pete.

96
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,525
My God!
Look how big he got.

97
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,735
He starts college next year.

98
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,863
You must be very proud.

99
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,743
Two beers at a time. Did Miranda and I
give you guys a drinking problem?

100
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,080
They are not just for us.

101
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:45,960
I'll have nightmares
about that ladies room for weeks.

102
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,380
Carrie and Miranda,
this is Jessica and Susan.

103
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:50,923
Hello.

104
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,134
Honey, do you still wanna see
the movie or just crash?

105
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,594
I don't care.

106
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,310
- We have to go.
- Yeah, we gotta go.

107
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,480
It was good to see you, Aidan.

108
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,364
Come on, this way.

109
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:22,830
That night at Charlotte's, some light
unpacking and some heavy realisations.

110
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,749
Well, they are over us.

111
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,085
It's just so hilarious.

112
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,337
I'm haemorrhaging inside.

113
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:36,010
We thought they were sitting there, pining,
and they have new girlfriends already!

114
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:39,305
- Were they cute?
- The point is not if they were cute.

115
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:42,057
The point is, they were there.

116
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:45,019
- They were cute.
- Very cute.

117
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,271
How can they have new relationships?

118
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:50,149
I'm still in the "I just broke up
with someone" phase.

119
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:55,321
It's infuriating. Women sit around
obsessing about what went wrong.

120
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,449
Men just say "all righty" and move on.

121
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:03,120
I take offence at that generalisation. Not all
women sit around and obsess about men.

122
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:06,373
As soon as my relationships
are over, I move on.

123
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,335
- Relationships?
- You know, dates.

124
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:16,091
I do try to figure out what went wrong.
But I don't think that I obsess.

125
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,637
You are Miss Obsess. Big?

126
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,975
Big was tricky.
I still don't know what happened there.

127
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,103
You should have a relationship
rear-view mirror.

128
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,524
Relationships may appear closer
than they actually are.

129
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,153
I didn't obsess about Aidan.
Aidan was clear. He moved on.

130
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,990
- It's much easier for men to move on.
- Is it?

131
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:44,328
Oh, please! The ratio of women to men
in this city is huge.

132
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:46,872
They can sit outside, have a beer

133
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,084
and wait for the Jessicas
and Susans to come to them.

134
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,171
Maybe we only obsess over
relationships that feel unfinished.

135
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:58,259
I can guarantee that Trey
isn't sitting around with his friends,

136
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,469
obsessing about what went wrong.

137
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:03,138
Men never think anything is their fault.

138
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,182
I wish there were no men.

139
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,644
Call someone, she's gone insane.

140
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,772
If there were no men,
then we wouldn't feel hurt.

141
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,692
And we wouldn't be disappointed.

142
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,988
And we wouldn't be spending
our entire night obsessing about them.

143
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:21,115
I'm so over men.

144
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,953
What?
I am.

145
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,249
Later that night I got to thinking
about men and women and relationships.

146
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:34,753
Or more to the point, how women feel men
disappoint them in relationships.

147
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,300
Then a radical, almost earth-shattering
thought popped into my head.

148
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,386
What if everything isn't the man's fault?

149
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:45,723
After a certain age and a certain
number of relationships,

150
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,102
if it still isn't working and the ex's
seem to be moving on and we don't,

151
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,730
perhaps the problem
isn't the last boyfriend,

152
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,941
or the one before him
or even the one before him.

153
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:59,445
Could it be,
that the problem isn't them,

154
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:03,240
but horror of horrors,
is it us?

155
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:10,998
Downtown, the "Up-my-ass Players" were
in the middle of their late night repertory.

156
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:15,127
"Much Ado About Up My Ass"
and "Long Day's Journey Up My Ass".

157
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:22,301
Samantha decided
if she was gonna get a good night's sleep,

158
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:26,931
she'd have to test how effective
a PR professional she was.

159
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:28,849
Ladies, hello.

160
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,939
I live right up there,
the loft within earshot.

161
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:37,983
As much as I respect a woman's right

162
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,695
for a little something
with certain New Jersey gentlemen,

163
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,822
I have a request.

164
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:46,492
I have a very early business meeting.

165
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,827
And I think we all know,

166
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:54,333
there are certain dark circles
even the best make-up tricks can't cover.

167
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,126
Am I right?

168
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:59,255
Sorry to wake you, baby.
We'll take it down here.

169
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:03,801
I appreciate it.
By the way, I'm Samantha.

170
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:06,637
- Destiny.
- Chyna.

171
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:10,599
- Jo.
- No "e". She got the "e" cut off.

172
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,354
Those heels are fierce, Miss Girl.

173
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,441
Don't I know it.

174
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:24,738
Samantha always knew how to get her way
with men, even if they were half women.

175
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,957
What?

176
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,251
Rough night?

177
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,670
- Who is this?
- It's me.

178
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:46,719
I didn't recognise your voice.
You sounded different.

179
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:49,471
Did I wake you?
It's only 11:30.

180
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:53,267
No, I was up late working.

181
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:57,938
And there were these goddamn chickens
that crow on the roof next door.

182
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:01,066
Roosters. Roosters crow.

183
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,820
The "Fun On The Farm" fact
everyone seems to be aware of but me.

184
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:09,450
- So tell me, is red a mistake?
- In what way?

185
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,536
I'm repainting my bedroom.

186
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:15,623
- A red bedroom?
- Just one wall.

187
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:19,710
But I think it's too red.

188
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,172
It's like sleeping in communist China.

189
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:30,513
She left... We ended it.

190
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:36,393
- I heard.
- You did? How?

191
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,064
I think it was on the news.

192
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,861
Could we have lunch sometime?

193
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,156
I really need to talk to you.

194
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,993
- Please?
- Where?

195
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,499
The Boathouse restaurant, Central Park.
How about Saturday at 2:00?

196
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,753
- Carrie?
- I'm nodding.

197
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,090
- So I'll see you at 2:00 then.
- Bye.

198
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,681
Later that day, I met Miranda
at my favourite thrift store,

199
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,724
to dig for buried treasure.

200
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,062
Do you think I can get away with
a "hang in there, baby" halter top?

201
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:24,483
Nobody gets away with
a "hang in there, baby" halter top.

202
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,404
Do you wanna go to the
Hopper exhibit Saturday afternoon?

203
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:30,614
I can't. I have to work.

204
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,039
I lied.
I don't have to work.

205
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:42,543
I'm meeting Big for lunch
and I didn't think you'd approve.

206
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,546
- You're meeting Big?
- He called.

207
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:50,176
- He sounded upset and needed to talk.
- Since when does Big talk?

208
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,636
What does that mean?

209
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,642
He's upset about Natasha leaving...

210
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,104
I'm not holding your hand
through this again.

211
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:05,858
I'm not asking you to hold my anything.
We're just having lunch.

212
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,985
It's a huge mistake.

213
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:11,071
It's not a huge mistake, it's lunch.

214
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:16,035
How many more times are you gonna
go through this? He is bad for you.

215
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:21,081
Every time you get near him
you turn into this pathetic, needy victim.

216
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:25,002
What pisses me off is that you are more
than willing to go back for more.

217
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,881
I am not going back for more
and I can't even believe...

218
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:31,634
I can't believe
you would say that to me.

219
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,095
- If you start up with Big again...
- I am not starting up with Big again.

220
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,765
If you do, I don't wanna know
anything about it.

221
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,975
No calls. No crying.

222
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:43,062
Are you gonna cut me out of your life
like you did to Steve?

223
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:44,522
What?

224
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:49,735
First sign of any little weakness or flaw
and you just write people off.

225
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:52,655
My God, Miranda.
You are so judgmental.

226
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:58,744
You can say that I'm pathetic and needy
and I can't say anything to you?

227
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:02,039
Everybody is not as tough
as you, Miranda.

228
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:05,751
People... Some of us make mistakes.

229
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,799
That's just perfect.
Walk away.

230
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,844
It's all my fault.

231
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,305
Right there,
next to the 2 for $5 bin,

232
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,891
Miranda and I had our first big fight.

233
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,439
You have no messages.

234
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:36,365
I thought by the time I got home, she would
have left an apology on my machine.

235
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:43,163
I was gonna call her,
but wasn't quite sure of what to say.

236
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,499
Or whose fault it really was.

237
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:50,504
And at the exact
same moment across town,

238
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:54,592
Miranda was preparing to make the call
she'd been dreading all day.

239
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,847
Shanghai Garden.
May I help you?

240
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,932
I'd like to order some take out.

241
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,934
Address, please.

242
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:08,689
331 West 78th Street, Apartment 4F.
I'd like some...

243
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:13,819
Chicken with broccoli, brown sauce,
brown rice and cold noodles, right?

244
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:17,239
You know what?
I don't need this. Never mind.

245
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,991
OK. Bye-bye.

246
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:22,786
After she hung up, Miranda couldn't get
the giggle out of her head.

247
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:26,749
She decided to walk the two blocks
to confront the woman

248
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,920
with the judgmental giggle
who thought she was better than her.

249
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,840
Shanghai Garden.
May I help you?

250
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,012
OK. Address, please.

251
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:47,311
224 West 78th... Sorry, 73.

252
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:56,028
Miranda realised the giggle wasn't about
her at all. It wasn't about anything.

253
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:06,622
It wasn't the noodles that kept her coming
back to this particular restaurant.

254
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,126
It was the fact that this had been their place
and it was filled with happy memories.

255
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,843
Twice in one week.
Am I lucky or what?

256
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:24,431
- I thought I got custody of this place.
- I like their hot and sour soup.

257
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:29,186
Are you here by yourself?
Me too. Sit down.

258
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:33,440
I've got this bowl of crunchies
that I'll never get through.

259
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,736
How are you?

260
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:41,031
Not good.
Carrie and I had a huge fight.

261
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,075
About what?

262
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:48,622
Me, her, you, Big... Me.

263
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:56,630
My judgmental stuff.
How bad was it?

264
00:19:56,797 --> 00:20:01,135
- It wasn't good.
- Steve, I didn't throw you away. Did I?

265
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:04,138
- No.
- She said I did.

266
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:10,144
Miranda... Only you and I can ever really
know what happened between you and I.

267
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:13,189
It's nobody else's business.

268
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:20,487
But she said that, huh?
Must've been pretty mad.

269
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:26,660
I didn't say nice things to her either.
I just don't want her to get hurt again.

270
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,246
So you yelled at her?

271
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:31,874
Yeah.

272
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,003
Sounds about par.

273
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,214
I guess your new girlfriend doesn't yell.

274
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,757
No.

275
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:41,967
How's that going?

276
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,637
It's OK.

277
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:49,642
- Like to order?
- Yes, I'd like the chicken with broccoli...

278
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:55,773
Let me see the menu.
I should try something new.

279
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,859
You should.
Go ahead. Live a little.

280
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:02,321
There is so much.

281
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:09,954
You're so fucking hot.

282
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:14,333
I can't believe they go away
for one night and then back three in a row.

283
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,794
Forget them. Look at me.

284
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:20,422
I'm sorry. I'm here.

285
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:28,472
Where are those cops?
I called them half an hour ago.

286
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:31,851
Look at me.
Let's bring it on home.

287
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,979
I can't.

288
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:38,065
- I'm close.
- Well, I'm not.

289
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,320
The idea that she'd miss a night's sleep,
pissed Samantha off.

290
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:47,616
The idea that she'd miss an orgasm,
was more than she could bear.

291
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:51,537
Shut up, you bitches!
I've called the cops.

292
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,581
Suck my cock!

293
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:57,042
Keep talking and I'll come down there
and cut it off for you.

294
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:03,048
I'd like to see you try, motherfucker.
You think we want that BS? No way!

295
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,305
Are you gonna pull a Lorena Bobbit?

296
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:14,059
$7,000 a month and I have to put up
with this, talking to fucking trannies?

297
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,812
I don't fucking think so!

298
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:21,108
I am a taxpayer and a member of the
Young Women's Business Association.

299
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:25,070
- I don't have to put up with this shit!
- Forget them and come back to bed.

300
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:29,241
There was nothing anyone could do
to stop her. Samantha was obsessed.

301
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:33,746
She had a date with Destiny,
Chyna and Jo, no "e".

302
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:35,956
Take this, ladies!

303
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,879
I'm gonna come up there
and kick your ass, bitch!

304
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:48,010
Get off my hair now!

305
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,973
Move it along, girls.

306
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:57,645
You heard the man, move it along.

307
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,815
Hey, where are you going?

308
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,735
Home. You freak me out.

309
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:10,074
And Uptown, Charlotte was
a bit freaked out as well.

310
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,368
Unable to sleep
and unable to unpack,

311
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:17,206
she was spending time with the only man
she could tolerate - The Dalai Lama.

312
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,544
- Charlotte? It's me.
- Trey?

313
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,175
What are you doing here?
It's 4:00 am.

314
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:32,513
I saw your light on from the street.
I figured you'd still be up.

315
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,723
What do you want?

316
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,977
Ever since you left,
I can't stop thinking about you.

317
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:43,774
- Honey, we're separated.
- I know.

318
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:50,489
It seems, once Charlotte swore off men,
this man couldn't get enough of her.

319
00:23:56,704 --> 00:24:00,624
He wasn't a rooster and it wasn't the
Bronx, but from somewhere deep inside,

320
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,085
Trey's cock began to crow.

321
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:10,384
Across town, I was still wide awake.

322
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,679
I couldn't get my fight with Miranda
out of my head.

323
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:19,268
Turns out, I was not only capable
of obsessing about relationships with men,

324
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:23,689
I was capable of obsessing about
relationships with women.

325
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:39,622
East Side Animal Shelter.
Please leave a message.

326
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:43,167
This is your neighbour
who complained about the chickens.

327
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:47,755
I'm leaving a message 'cause I can't take it
any more. Move them in. Thanks.

328
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:52,593
I figured if they had a lovely life,
I was entitled to the same thing.

329
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:58,599
Well...

330
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:02,478
All righty.

331
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:05,272
I knew that was in me somewhere.

332
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,316
You did?

333
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,612
I just hadn't felt it since before...

334
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:17,117
Why did you stop yourself?
Before what?

335
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,828
Since before we got engaged.

336
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:22,373
Oh.

337
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,959
Yeah. Oh.

338
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:29,922
Do you think our whole problem
had to do with the fact that...

339
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:34,426
What?

340
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,387
Say it.

341
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:40,641
- You didn't really wanna marry me.
- No.

342
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:47,940
I think it may be due to the fact that
I didn't want to get married to anybody.

343
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:52,611
- Then why did you?
- I guess I thought it was time.

344
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:57,741
I'm of a certain age,
people expect you to get married.

345
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:01,662
Yes, well... That sounds familiar.

346
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:05,833
- One other thing...
- What?

347
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:12,131
I married you because I knew I'd never find
anyone as wonderful as you to marry.

348
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:47,541
He may have gone away,
the transsexual,

349
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,461
but he came back, loaded with eggs.

350
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,422
Now who's laughing, bitch?

351
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,262
Samantha knew this was one relationship
with a man she couldn't walk away from.

352
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:03,307
Because this man was half woman.

353
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,314
- Good, you're there.
- I was just gonna call you.

354
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,650
Do you really think I'm pathetic?

355
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:16,570
No, I'm so sorry.
I don't think you're pathetic at all.

356
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,698
I'm outside the restaurant,
hiding in some bushes.

357
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:21,992
Do you still not think I'm pathetic?

358
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,788
I know you think it's a huge mistake.

359
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:29,208
It's just something I feel
I need to do to move on.

360
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:33,212
Don't listen to me. I have no idea
what's right for you and Big.

361
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:38,384
But if I'm wrong and it is a huge mistake,
I need to know you'll be there for me.

362
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,052
I'm there.

363
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:43,931
I'm going in.
Any last minute advice?

364
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:48,102
Don't let him kiss you. That seems to be
where you get into trouble.

365
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:52,439
- Carrie?
- I'm nodding.

366
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:11,166
Hello, you.

367
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,003
Hello, you.

368
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,800
It's good to see you.

369
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,901
Are you OK?

370
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,198
My hair is in a duck pond.

371
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:44,200
My Dior purse.

372
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,993
I'll get it.

373
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,250
Oh, my God! What is that?

374
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:04,386
- How was your shower?
- I no longer smell of pond.

375
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:12,520
Exactly how many
terry-cloth robes do you have?

376
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:16,190
- Three or four.
- Oh, three or four.

377
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:21,445
I swore I would never be in this room
with you again.

378
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:25,783
You said to take you
to the nearest shower.

379
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,956
That is one red wall.

380
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,959
Yes, it's red.

381
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:42,299
I gotta ask you a question.

382
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:49,473
- Was it all my fault?
- No.

383
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:53,352
It wasn't all your fault.

384
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,439
We really screwed that up.
What were we thinking?

385
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,068
I have no idea.

386
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:05,573
Fuck. I was counting on you
for answers.

387
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:14,915
- How are you doing, kid?
- Pretty good. How are you doing?

388
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,584
Good.

389
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,129
Beside for the fact
I feel like I've been through a war.

390
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,552
We really were war buddies.
War buddies in Calvin Klein robes.

391
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:36,020
I hate to admit this,
but I kind of like living alone again.

392
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:42,234
Why doesn't that surprise me?

393
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:55,039
- I should go.
- Don't you want to stay a while?

394
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:57,082
I can't.

395
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:59,251
Why?

396
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,548
Because, sweet friend,

397
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:08,302
you and I are like that red wall.

398
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:14,683
It's a good idea in theory.
But somehow, it doesn't quite work.

399
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:23,567
And just like that, I realised
Big and I weren't "us" any more.

400
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:29,240
We had become something else.
What it was, I had no idea.

401
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:50,052
You have one new message.

402
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:54,640
It's me. I'm just wondering how it went.
Call me when you get home.

403
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:12,032
I had no idea where the chickens had
gone, but I hoped it wasn't the Bronx.

404
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,201
And I hoped they were happy.

405
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,627
Who wants a wiener?

406
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:25,838
Girl, I'm trying to get rid of one.

407
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:30,593
The next Saturday, Samantha decided
to throw a kiss and make up party

408
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,928
for the "Up-my-ass Players".

409
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:36,265
Trey called me three times last week.
He's dying to get back together.

410
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,810
But I don't know.
Is that wise?

411
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:44,190
- I'm obsessing again, aren't I?
- A bit.

412
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,358
So, what are we all drinking?

413
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:49,737
"Flirtinis." Vodka, pineapple
and champagne.

414
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:51,780
Flirtinis.

415
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:56,285
- Destiny made them.
- I'm way past a Flirtini. I need a "Fucktini".

416
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,913
Watch your language.
There are ladies present.

417
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,372
Where?

418
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:06,420
- You with the flower.
- Are you talking to me?

419
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:09,507
It's you, girl. Come on.

420
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:15,054
- What do you want?
- I want you to give me a swirl.

421
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,765
I need to see you spin first, sister.

422
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:26,232
- Is that good enough?
- Give me the shake.

423
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:30,611
Don't mind the weight.
Eat something.

424
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:44,291
Don't worry,
they have a very lovely life.
