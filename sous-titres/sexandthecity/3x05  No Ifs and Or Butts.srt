1
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,142
One reason why people still risk

2
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,443
the possible horror of a first date,

3
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,851
is the possible magic of
the good-night kiss at the front door.

4
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,857
I had a great time.

5
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,323
So did I.

6
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,621
The world slows down for a second

7
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:08,666
as some people take that hopeful lean
into a possible future together.

8
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,847
All around my mouth.

9
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,849
How do you think I felt?

10
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,920
His tongue licked my teeth.

11
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,319
Did he wanna fuck you or floss you?

12
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,549
Bad kissers are the worst.

13
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,354
The worst. The top of the worst.

14
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,056
He has sweet lips.
I thought he'd be a good kisser.

15
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,724
You can never tell. They look normal.

16
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,768
Until their pointy tongue
darts in and out.

17
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,896
Pointy tongue, the worst of the worst.

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,406
The worst is when they expect you

19
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,010
to do the work.

20
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,113
Their tongue lays in your mouth

21
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,714
like a clam.

22
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,610
Clam-mouth. That's the worst.

23
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,379
I'd say, "Get it out, put it in a cab
and take its lazy ass home."

24
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,582
- You'd dump a guy for a bad kiss?
- You have to.

25
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,388
If their tongue just lays there,
what is their dick gonna do?

26
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,893
Point taken.

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,055
Maybe we can work on it.

28
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,202
A bad kisser is a non-negotiable.

29
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,567
I'm not dumping Brad because of that.

30
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,366
Then change his name

31
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,305
from Brad to Bad.

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,310
I like him. Well, I did until...

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,175
Until his tongue
was in your stomach?

34
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,176
Can you ladies hold it down?
This is a respectable restaurant.

35
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,289
Adeena Williams was my newspaper's
former food editor.

36
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,618
And the chef and owner of Fusion,

37
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,751
whose specialty was a mingling
of trendy food with soul food.

38
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,922
Martha Stewart meets
Puff Daddy on a plate.

39
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,933
Poached salmon with okra...

40
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,196
Heaven.

41
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,398
This time next year,
okra will be so fashionable.

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,478
We are leaving.
Come and say goodbye.

43
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:06,142
This is my brother, who brings me
tons of music industry business.

44
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,155
I gotta go, but I'm sending dessert.

45
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,587
- No.
- Pecan and praline pie.

46
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,748
Yes!

47
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,230
Didn't we meet at the Columbia
Records party for Jennifer Lopez?

48
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:23,995
I don't think so. My PR firm handled it.
I'm sure I'd have remembered you.

49
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,333
I guess I just saw you.
Chivon Williams, I used to rep for...

50
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,999
Tommy Boy Records.
I remember from the guest list.

51
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:36,012
- You're good.
- Samantha Jones, if you need me...

52
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,083
for a party.

53
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,547
Ladies, I apologize for interrupting.
Have a pleasant evening.

54
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,161
Could he any be cuter?

55
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,594
Gotta love a fella
who loves jewellery.

56
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,599
That is one fine-Iooking man.
I'd like some of that.

57
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,102
- Don't talk like that.
- Like what?

58
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:05,711
Relax with the liberal reaction.
That's not black talk. It's sex talk.

59
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,713
First of all, it isn't black talk.
It's African-American talk.

60
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:15,013
You shouldn't be talking like that.
It's rude and politically incorrect.

61
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,816
Samantha is rude
and politically incorrect.

62
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,858
- She's an equal opportunity offender.
- Precisely.

63
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,552
I don't see color. I see conquests.

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,789
Talk about affirmative action.

65
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,636
The next day I had just settled down
with a cup of fresh coffee

66
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,139
and a coffee table
full of fashion magazines, when...

67
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,676
- Who is it?
- Mr Right.

68
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,080
Have you seen
"The New York Times" style section?

69
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,410
I can't handle hard news before noon.

70
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,544
There's a beautiful man downtown,
selling furniture. We're going.

71
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,953
I got a whole afternoon planned
with Australian "Vogue".

72
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,960
I'm not gonna drop everything
to go to see some cute guy.

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,223
- He's straight.
- I'll get my purse.

74
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,993
People with nothing better to do
than ogle some craftsman. Pathetic.

75
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,163
Look at this place.
Nothing but baguettes and faggots.

76
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:16,615
If you see anything you like, say
you're a designer. You get a discount.

77
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:21,345
- I got $50 off my end table.
- You're a classy guy.

78
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,016
His name was Aidan Shaw.

79
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:32,028
He was warm, masculine and
classic American. Like his furniture.

80
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,133
The dog is overkill.

81
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,894
- Go get him.
- Excuse me?

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,166
He's perfect for you. I'll visit you
and the kids at your cabin up state.

83
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,865
We're staring. Look away.

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,978
His name was Marty Mendleson.

85
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,081
He was warm, stylish and classic gay.
Like his outfit.

86
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,547
He's a designer.
And single.

87
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,156
Go get him. I'll come visit you
in your cabin up state.

88
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,291
Hey, doggie. Hi.

89
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,828
Bad doggie. Down.

90
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,207
Pete, there you go.

91
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,411
You should get him a chew toy.

92
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,916
To his credit,
he picks the best-Iooking ladies.

93
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,451
You can't imagine how flattered I am.

94
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,851
- I'm Aidan.
- I'm humiliated.

95
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,514
I shouldn't let him run loose
in the store.

96
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,152
This is your store?
I had no idea.

97
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:43,234
When I heard the lie come out
of my mouth, I knew I was interested.

98
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,433
- This is a beautiful chair.
- This is my favorite piece.

99
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,443
You say that about every piece, right?

100
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,807
Not really.
This leather is about 100 years old.

101
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,420
I stripped it off
an old railroad car seat. Feel this.

102
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,421
- Soft?
- I'll take it.

103
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,723
I wasn't really in the market
for a leather chair.

104
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,528
But I had to have
whatever it was I just felt.

105
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:23,265
I'm a designer. Carrie Bradshaw.
Carrie Bradshaw Designs.

106
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:31,045
Let's see. With the designer discount
and dog humiliation factor...

107
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,344
How's that?

108
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,956
- How soon can it be delivered?
- End of the week.

109
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,994
In New York City retail lingo,
that meant "I like you too".

110
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,633
Where do you want it delivered
and can I take you out for dinner?

111
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,830
Will you knock another $10 off?

112
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,375
The dog humping aside, it was one of
those perfect New York Saturdays.

113
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,943
I'm back!

114
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,139
At Miranda's, Steve was having
an even better Saturday.

115
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,979
- Guess what happened? It's so great!
- What?

116
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,178
You know at the Knicks game,

117
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,415
somebody makes a half-court shot
for a million dollars?

118
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:17,757
- Kind of, but go ahead.
- Next Tuesday, it's me.

119
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,388
They picked my name from
the contest I entered at Sam Goodies.

120
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,192
Great!

121
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:29,330
It's not great.
A million dollars. It's fucking great.

122
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,035
It is fucking great.

123
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,943
But don't get your hopes up.
It's a tough shot, isn't it?

124
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,279
For other guys,
but they don't have my moves.

125
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,882
The problem is
you don't know how good I am.

126
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,356
Don't let these legs fool you.
I'm great.

127
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,393
I like your little legs.

128
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,555
Let's go to the playground.
I'll show you.

129
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,224
No, please. I believe you.
You've got the moves.

130
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,736
I don't want no charity.
Seeing is believing.

131
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,934
Next week, come to the playground
and watch me shoot. Promise?

132
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,375
Promise?

133
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,953
- That's Ralph Lauren paint.
- I'll buy you more. I'm a millionaire.

134
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,153
I have a crush.

135
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,225
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,057
You haven't had a crush in a while.
Not since Big.

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,461
Big wasn't a crush, he was a crash.

138
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:36,070
His name is Aidan.
And I believe him to be very cute.

139
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,471
So cute, I bought a chair I couldn't
afford just because he made it.

140
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,944
Did he ask you out?

141
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,346
So the chair is a write-off.

142
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,487
I haven't had a crush
since Sean Cassidy.

143
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,644
No way.

144
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,452
At this age I'd have to say
I'm crush-proof.

145
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,561
What about Steve?

146
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:01,359
I forgot about my boyfriend.
Is that normal?

147
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,229
You're asking me?

148
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,064
Steve thinks he's gonna win
a million dollars.

149
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,833
- You told me.
- I have to repeat it until I believe it.

150
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,307
It's totally illogical
and he wants me to be supportive.

151
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:18,041
It's a half-court shot.
There are Knicks who can't make it.

152
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:24,486
I would support a real dream,
like opening his own bar. This is silly.

153
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,854
Isn't that what you couples do,
support each other's silly dreams?

154
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,053
You're asking me?

155
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,391
That week, Chivon invited Samantha
to go uptown

156
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,003
and hear an artist
he was thinking of signing.

157
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,833
Back in the line, motherfucker.

158
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,209
Although Samantha
had been in the club scene for years,

159
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:58,847
she'd never been asked to spread
without being offered a cocktail.

160
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,093
This is DJ Oldman.

161
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:09,564
In a matter of minutes, Samantha
felt at home in Chivon's world.

162
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,602
Hi, guys. I'm Samantha.

163
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,076
In a matter of hours, Chivon was
at home in Samantha's home.

164
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,680
Do you like this groove?
It's the new kid.

165
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,442
It's so soft.
I thought all rap had a harder edge.

166
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,179
They can be hard or soft, like you.

167
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,589
You have so much attitude up front.

168
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:38,094
Look at you now. Soft, sweet...

169
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,993
Sweet, me?

170
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,525
Who do you think you're fooling?

171
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:54,171
I don't usually sleep with men
who have nicer accessories than me.

172
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,577
Where did you get
these fabulous earrings?

173
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,047
Tiffany.

174
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,243
Where else?

175
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,352
I hope you can sleep in a little.

176
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,290
Sleep?

177
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,291
Samantha rarely asked a man
to stay over,

178
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,299
but she couldn't resist
having breakfast with his Tiffanies.

179
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,639
One reason some people still risk
the possible horror of a first date,

180
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,868
is the possible magic of
the good-night kiss at the front door.

181
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,809
My dog is obsessed with you.

182
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,179
He kept me up talking all night.
"Her leg, man."

183
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:39,181
I had to say,
"Pete, let her go. It's over."

184
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,362
I have a confession to make...

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,026
I'm not a designer. I'm a writer.

186
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,839
What was that?
Fiction?

187
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,671
I wanted the discount.
It's shameful, but true.

188
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,418
But don't worry,
I only lie about furniture, nothing else.

189
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,351
Are you upset?

190
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,351
You smoke?

191
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,956
Just a little.

192
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,464
When the lie came out of my mouth,
I realised how much I liked him.

193
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,660
If it bothers you, I'll just...

194
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,774
I had a great time.

195
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,451
- I can taste that cigarette.
- I'm sorry, I have an Altoid.

196
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,424
I think you're...

197
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:56,397
I totally get it. I have a mint here.
They are curiously strong.

198
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,967
- Can you just hold that?
- Sure.

199
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,770
I don't wanna be a jerk,
but I can't date a smoker.

200
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,242
So... Really?

201
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,855
It's a thing I have.

202
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:22,460
I couldn't believe what my crush
was saying. I was crushed.

203
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,823
Later that night, I wondered...

204
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,592
When did dating become
so dump-friendly?

205
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,099
What happened to the time
when a bad kiss or a cigarette

206
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,637
or a ridiculous dream
was part of a person's portfolio?

207
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,368
In today's dating market,
is it wise to liquidate certain stocks,

208
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,842
the first sign they might not perform
as well as expected?

209
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,006
Or are there things
one should try and negotiate?

210
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,120
In relationships,
what are the "deal breakers"?

211
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:54,422
I think it's really sexy when you
lightly touch your lips to mine.

212
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,653
Never one to trade a stock
before it had matured,

213
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,130
a determined and patient Charlotte
tried to teach Bad how to kiss good.

214
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,963
You like that?

215
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,730
And I like it when you
slowly open your mouth...

216
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,073
and just tickle my lips
with the tip of your tongue.

217
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,254
You like that?

218
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,587
With just a little negotiating,
Brad's stock suddenly began to rise.

219
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,304
Stop it!

220
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,636
You're sucking too hard.
And my mouth is up here.

221
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,976
- Is there a problem?
- I can't do this. You're a bad kisser.

222
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,209
It's my thing.

223
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,953
Where are you going?

224
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,523
Downtown at Marty Mendleson's,

225
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,595
others were experiencing
a much more successful first kiss.

226
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,788
Let's move it to the bedroom.

227
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,405
These are my dolls.
I've been collecting them for years.

228
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,606
I had no idea.

229
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,581
This... is the Queen of Siam.

230
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,085
She's my favorite.

231
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,989
Bisque china face.
She's a real collector's item.

232
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,825
And this... is Mary, Queen of Scots.

233
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,901
- Are they all queens?
- The ones from Madame Alexander's.

234
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,738
Help me clear the bed?

235
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,147
No, the Southern Belle
sits on the table.

236
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:11,594
Was Stanford enough of a queen to
sleep with one who collected queens?

237
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,265
Uptown at Fusion, Samantha felt
a bit like a queen herself.

238
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,927
Did I tell you
how beautiful you look tonight?

239
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,265
Thank you.

240
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,136
What's up, genius?

241
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,440
Genius' over-tired ass
is dragging all over this restaurant.

242
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,813
Aunt Alice and her friends are leaving,
if you want to pay your respects.

243
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,046
Favorite aunt. I'll introduce you.

244
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:42,785
Aunt Alice is out of the door already.
You go and I'll talk with Samantha.

245
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,301
How is everything?

246
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,305
Chivon is right, you are a genius.

247
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,409
Thank you.

248
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:03,310
A non-food related question. What's
going on between you and Chivon?

249
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,974
- What do you mean?
- You've been in here three times.

250
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,712
Well, we're dating. Why?

251
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,822
You're not just fucking?

252
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,226
Not that's any of your business,
but no, we're not just fucking.

253
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,421
We actually really like each other.

254
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,360
I don't want you seeing my brother.

255
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,231
- Excuse me?
- I don't approve.

256
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,238
- You don't know me...
- Let's not get personal.

257
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,367
I'm sure you're a nice person,
but you're white.

258
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,743
I have a problem with my brother
getting serious with a white woman.

259
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,283
To Adeena, Samantha's skin
was a non-negotiable.

260
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,718
- How can you say that?
- That's how I feel.

261
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,293
I'm never going to approve and my
approval means a lot to my brother.

262
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:56,401
Just save us the time and trouble
and get out before anybody gets hurt.

263
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,702
I'll send over some
Mississippi mud pie.

264
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:09,837
The only place Adeena was interested
in fusion was on a plate.

265
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:15,042
- She can't dis me just cos I'm white.
- Please tell me you didn't say dis.

266
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,417
Maybe you should stop seeing him.
Race is a big issue.

267
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,751
There is no reason
to bring race into this.

268
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,895
Chivon is a sweet man.
We have great sex.

269
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,792
He happens to have the biggest...

270
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,956
Black cock.
We know he has a big black cock.

271
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,762
I was about to say the biggest heart.

272
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,667
But, yes, he does have
a big black cock.

273
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,604
It's big African-American cock.

274
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,075
- Don't make fun of me. My chin hurts.
- What happened?

275
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,804
He raped my face.
I'm never seeing him again.

276
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,974
To Charlotte, a black and blue chin
was a deal breaker.

277
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,553
I'm not backing down to her.
That's not who I am.

278
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:55,557
She shouldn't sacrifice who she is
because somebody has a problem.

279
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,823
Like me and smoking.
Too bad Aidan had a problem with it.

280
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,466
But you have to accept people
for who they are.

281
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,831
- You choose cigarettes over a guy?
- He's not that cute.

282
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,165
You bought furniture, he was so cute.

283
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,309
For him to dump me
over a little thing like smoking.

284
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:16,004
Smoking is not a little thing.
It's dirty and you're killing yourself.

285
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:22,211
We hate it. We put up with it cos we
love you. You have a reason to quit.

286
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,084
- I don't like being ganged up on.
- Who's ganging up on you?

287
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,193
Smoking is a part of who I am.

288
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,229
I'll quit when I want to,
not cos a cute guy told me to.

289
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,388
- Right, Samantha?
- No.

290
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:40,334
Fighting for Chivon is one thing.
Holding on to cigarettes is just wack.

291
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,530
Tell me she didn't say "wack".

292
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,835
It's all total bullshit.

293
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,240
What is wrong with cigarettes?

294
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,676
Nothing, they're fabulous.

295
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,045
It's not like you have
a hideous doll-collection.

296
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,619
You think that's an overreaction
to a repressed childhood?

297
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,222
Who cares? It's freaky.

298
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:05,954
I could overlook his receding hair.
But the dollies? No.

299
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,192
So, it's "Goodbye, Dolly"?

300
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,496
It's too bad. I kind of liked him.

301
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:17,631
Well, Stannie, if I may call you that.
Maybe you should reconsider?

302
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,973
When was the last time someone
you had a crush on asked you out?

303
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,843
You're no one to talk,
Miss Marlboro Lights.

304
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,680
You're right. I am no one to talk.

305
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,384
Maybe I could quit, just a little.
Till I see what's up.

306
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,692
- Et tu?
- Fine.

307
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,990
I can't see myself getting excited

308
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:45,364
because my boyfriend's three-foot
Lady Di doll is arriving from QVC.

309
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,608
Let's go.
Time to go shoot hoops.

310
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:56,146
- I can't. I got behind on this file.
- No, you don't. You promised.

311
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:01,150
This has to be ready Monday. I don't
have time to watch you shoot hoops.

312
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,280
I ask you to do one thing for me
and you can't. What is that?

313
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,153
What's with the attitude?

314
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,490
You know how many times
I do what you want?

315
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,029
Why are you getting so upset?
It's just a stupid shot.

316
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,033
Not to me it's not.

317
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,967
Why are you always pessimistic?
"You can't make that shot."

318
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,269
Steve, come on.

319
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,903
It's not just the shot. It's everything.
"We can't move in together."

320
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,848
If this is ever gonna work,
I need you to believe in us.

321
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,787
I need you to believe in me,
even if you think it's fucking stupid.

322
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,632
All right, hot shot.
Show me what you got.

323
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,037
Nice legs! Very nice!

324
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,048
This is for the big money!

325
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,061
Steve never did win the big money
at Madison Square Garden.

326
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,863
But having Miranda show up,
made him feel like a million bucks.

327
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,232
You were robbed!

328
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,875
- Do over!
- OK.

329
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,186
- Don't get any ideas.
- Pete. Let's go.

330
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,549
This isn't fair.
He was just starting to get over you.

331
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,465
Since you negotiated
such a good price for me on the chair,

332
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:59,661
maybe I can negotiate a little deal
for you on the smoking.

333
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,839
What kind of deal?

334
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,943
I've been thinking
about quitting anyway. Why not now?

335
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,674
No cigarettes.

336
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,379
Can you do that?

337
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,748
Maybe you think
I'm more of a smoker than I am.

338
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,221
I only have like a cigarette
with cocktails.

339
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,255
I'm done here.
Do you wanna get some coffee?

340
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,400
The second he said coffee,
I knew I wanted a cigarette.

341
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,593
I'd love it.

342
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,467
It was one of those dates
when you have so much to say

343
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,007
that coffee turns into a movie,
a movie into a long walk

344
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,045
and a long walk turns into
the beginning of cold turkey rehab.

345
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,775
Would you like to eat some dinner?

346
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,817
I was completely ready
to trade in my crush...

347
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,311
Hi.

348
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,984
...when it dawned on me how much
I was willing to give up for a cigarette.

349
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,459
Maybe a quick bite.

350
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,881
Her name is Sheeba.
She's French.

351
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,484
Meanwhile,
back in the "Valley of the Dolls",

352
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:26,147
Stanford thought there was something
more rare than a porcelain face...

353
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,019
his passion.

354
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,861
Wait, the dolls.

355
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,613
To Marty Mendleson,
a broken face was a deal breaker.

356
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,750
Adeena!

357
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,389
Samantha was about to come
face to face with her deal breaker.

358
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,331
- What's up?
- You tell me. I just got here.

359
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,562
You know Samantha.

360
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,071
What's my favorite girl drinking?

361
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,676
- Champagne.
- Marguerita.

362
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,005
Coming right up.

363
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,783
What are you doing here?
I don't want you dating my brother.

364
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,013
I'm a lovely person.
Get to know me, then hate me.

365
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,556
This is not a game.
This is my brother we're talking about.

366
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,559
For a woman with such
a progressive view of world food...

367
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,028
- That's business, this is family.
- I don't understand...

368
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,999
I'll say it to you plain. I don't care
how many Jennifer Lopez dresses

369
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,005
you have hanging in your closet,
you don't belong in here.

370
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:54,210
You'll never understand what I'm
talking about. This is a black thing.

371
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,406
Please go
and leave my brother alone.

372
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,987
As Samantha turned to leave,
she realised this wasn't a black thing.

373
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,055
It was a Samantha thing.

374
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:10,217
She'd never backed down to a bitch
and she wasn't about to start.

375
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,458
No woman, no matter what color,
has the right to tell me who I fuck.

376
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,728
Get your little white pussy
away from my brother!

377
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,428
Get your big, black ass
out of my face!

378
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,541
And your okra wasn't all that!

379
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,674
Get off me!

380
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,883
Keep it real.

381
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,216
I'm trying to keep it real.

382
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,828
Seven hours into the world's
longest date, all I could think was,

383
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,900
"Five more minutes and I can smoke
the cigarette hidden in my purse."

384
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,165
- Would you like a dessert menu?
- I'll take a look.

385
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,342
I forgot, I have a deadline.
I have to go.

386
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,774
- I'll walk with you.
- No!

387
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,914
Stay and enjoy your dessert.
I'm fine.

388
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:46,415
Carrie...
We've got a little problem.

389
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,360
What can I say?
Adeena has always been there for me.

390
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,903
Ever since Mom died,
it's only been the two of us.

391
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:07,804
Adeena has her issues,
but you didn't have to insult her food.

392
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,339
You mean the world to me.

393
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,853
But Adeena, she's my blood.

394
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,921
Samantha knew the real problem
wasn't her white pussy.

395
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,934
It was that Chivon was a black pussy
who wouldn't stand up to his sister.

396
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:40,241
And for Samantha Jones,
that was the deal breaker.

397
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:45,405
It was too bad we had to end.
But that's the way it goes, I guess.

398
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:50,543
We had some good times together
and I'm sure we could have had more.

399
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,053
But, it's over.

400
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,892
In the end, I really did it for me.
I just hope he's worth it.
