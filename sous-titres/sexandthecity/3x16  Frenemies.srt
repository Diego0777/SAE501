1
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:50,860
In a city where cynicism
is as prevalent as pashmina,

2
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:55,239
there is nothing more hopeful than
the getting ready for the first date routine.

3
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,701
Will O'Connor was a cute urban planner,

4
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:00,911
Miranda had met at Starbucks.

5
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,581
He mistook her latte for his double-caff

6
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:05,624
and offered to make it up

7
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,835
by buying her a drink that Saturday.

8
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:11,213
Samantha preferred to say "good night"
to the first date routine.

9
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,257
His name was Sebastian Wise.

10
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,593
For Sam, it was a very good night.

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,345
Meanwhile, Trey and Charlotte

12
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,556
were practising their new routine.

13
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:21,974
All righty.

14
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,895
- Someone's got the sails up.
- Yes, I can feel it.

15
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:28,606
All righty, I'm bringing it into the harbour.

16
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,774
Bring it in.

17
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:36,071
All right. Here I come.

18
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,158
Come.

19
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:44,205
Honey?

20
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,959
The wind died. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,299
After a week of the same routine,

22
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:59,220
the only thing getting up
in their bed was Charlotte's libido.

23
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,390
As for me, my routine
had become very routine.

24
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,353
I was spending almost every night working.

25
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:12,233
My date is three hours late.

26
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,568
I'm being stood up, right?

27
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,695
- Maybe he got lost.
- Carrie.

28
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,906
Doesn't look good.

29
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,660
And I'm wearing a new dress.
And I'm eating out of plastic.

30
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,703
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,291
The least he could do is
get to know me before he rejects me.

32
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,086
Yeah, that's illegal dumping.

33
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,256
It's crazy. This hasn't happened
to me since I'm 27.

34
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:40,719
I'm older, I should know better. I thought
I'd got smarter about picking them now.

35
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:43,264
I can't believe guys still stand girls up.

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,975
I can't believe I'm eating a frozen dinner.

37
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,228
I'm such a cliché.
Do you wanna grab a drink?

38
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,313
I can't. I have to work.

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,608
I agreed to teach
these stupid Learning Annex classes.

40
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,528
They're calling it "Bright Lights Date City".

41
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:01,782
- I'm so embarrassed for you.
- They're paying 300 bucks a pop.

42
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,452
It's a seminar on where to meet men.
Apparently, I'm an expert.

43
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,623
- Tell them to steer clear of Starbucks.
- Who would pay for this?

44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,251
Now? Maybe me.

45
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:17,965
OK, gotta go.
This dress is making a mockery of me.

46
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,428
- I'm sorry, sweetie. Bye.
- Please. Bye.

47
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,389
Stood up at 27, Miranda had done nothing.

48
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:30,936
At 34, she decided she wasn't going
to take this stand-up lying down.

49
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:36,150
Will may have given her the cold shoulder,
but also his home number.

50
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,986
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Will there?

51
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,697
- Who's speaking, please?
- Miranda Hobbes.

52
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:44,241
Miranda, this is Will's mother.

53
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,285
Well, Will's mother.

54
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:50,831
I don't know how you raised your son,
but he just stood me up for a date.

55
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,125
Will died today.

56
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,172
They're starting to die on us.

57
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,300
- At least you weren't stood up.
- 35 and they're dying.

58
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:05,638
- We should give up now.
- It could explain why they don't call back.

59
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,807
- How did he...
- Heart attack at the gym.

60
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:12,520
- This is why I don't work out.
- Do you wanna hear the worst part?

61
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,147
I felt so bad, I told his mother
I would go to the wake.

62
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:19,068
- You don't even know him.
- And she never will.

63
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:23,864
I'm far from being dead.
I got us reservations at Samba next week.

64
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,076
- Fancy.
- I could only get us a four-top.

65
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,662
Do you think
Trey would mind staying home?

66
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:33,207
No. He doesn't seem up for
much these days.

67
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,046
Charlotte, is everything OK?

68
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,969
We've been trying to...

69
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,345
Fuck?

70
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:49,557
Whatever. It's just not...

71
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,977
- Getting big and hard?
- Is this dirty mad libs?

72
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:56,689
I love him, and he's trying,
but this is so frustrating.

73
00:04:56,856 --> 00:05:01,944
- Of course it is.
- Last night I got so turned on, I almost...

74
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:07,700
You almost masturbated, he almost
got it up, together you almost had sex.

75
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:12,288
- Next to my husband. I feel so ashamed.
- Everybody masturbates.

76
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,416
- I did it this morning.
- That's why I got your voicemail.

77
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:20,171
He masturbates and reads porn.
When it comes to dealing with me, nothing.

78
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,631
- Madonna whore.
- You think?

79
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:26,844
Trey sees you as his virginal wife,
not a sexual plaything.

80
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:31,140
You're not going to get anywhere
until you change how he sees you.

81
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:34,059
- I don't know if I can do that.
- Yes, you can.

82
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:38,063
You're sexy. He should see you.
You're something to see.

83
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:47,364
The next night, I realised how many
desperate New York women there were.

84
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,377
I'm flattered that so many of you
showed up to hear me talk.

85
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,550
The fact is,
I have had a lot of experience with men.

86
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:10,262
Some of it good,
some of it bad, some of it very ugly.

87
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:17,102
There are
two million single men in this city.

88
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:20,773
I have dated about a million of them.

89
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,026
All these men are right outside your door.

90
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:30,157
The next time you step out with your shoes
and your travelling cappuccino,

91
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:35,287
take a look around.
Our little metropolis is stacked with men.

92
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:38,624
You never know who you'll run into.
You can turn a corner,

93
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,669
and boom - bright lights, date city.

94
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,758
Could you be more specific?

95
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:51,011
Do you mean places to meet men?

96
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,098
Sure.

97
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:56,642
Let's see. Samba.

98
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,063
Any sporting...
Sports bars - Mickey Mantle's.

99
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,149
I've gone there. All the men were married.

100
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:05,317
Really?

101
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:13,534
Let's see. I once met this fellow
on the Hampton Jitney.

102
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,205
It turned out he couldn't drive,
and he was on a parole programme.

103
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,999
That's a bad example.

104
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,543
Suddenly, I felt like the bad example.

105
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,212
Yes, you.

106
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,048
- Are you married?
- No.

107
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,676
Yes, you there.

108
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:34,805
- Have you ever been married?
- No, not that I'm aware of.

109
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,724
Yes, you in the back.

110
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,727
How old are you?

111
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm really not an expert on men.
I just write about this stuff.

112
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:49,862
Then why are we paying
to hear you talk about it?

113
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,698
Be quiet.

114
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:55,367
She's older than us.
We can learn something.

115
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:02,958
The only thing I learned that night was
that maybe I should have stayed home.

116
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,920
- Can I smoke in here?
- No.

117
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,341
If you stay single long enough,
you're supposed to get wiser about dating.

118
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:15,471
What men to pick, where to meet them...
But what made us experts?

119
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:19,099
Wasn't our single status
a neon sign that we couldn't get it right?

120
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:24,647
What if all these years have only
made us older, more confused or dead?

121
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:27,983
Are we getting wiser or just older?

122
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:33,155
If they'd been holding tomatoes
instead of Louis Vuitton bags, I'd be dead.

123
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:38,077
- Or at least gazpacho.
- Do you know there are no available men?

124
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:41,080
We're at my date's wake, so yes.

125
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:44,834
- They were so hostile.
- Fuck 'em.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,630
What do I know about men.
All I have is a bunch of failed relationships.

127
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,341
- And one affair.
- Thanks.

128
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,803
As if being dead person adjacent
isn't bad enough.

129
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,056
I'm supposed to teach another class.
What am I going to do?

130
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,433
Hire a bodyguard.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,936
This is my first wake.

132
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:06,730
Don't expect a goodie bag.

133
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,569
Oh, my God, open casket.
I've never seen a dead body before.

134
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:15,155
- Let's get out of here.
- We can't. People are looking at us.

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,004
He's cute.

136
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,589
Was.

137
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,216
Damn.

138
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:43,601
This would have helped me.
A place to meet men: an after wake party.

139
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,937
- He had money set aside for this.
- It's nice.

140
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:50,441
- I'm dead, you're not. Enjoy the buffet.
- I like him even more now.

141
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:54,111
- He was organised enough to have a will.
- And attractive friends.

142
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,073
- This place is full of men.
- Look how freaked out they look.

143
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,243
They know any minute they're out of here.

144
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,620
Carrie?

145
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:05,414
It's me, Jim.

146
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,210
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,461
Jim.

148
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,467
- Your hair.
- I cut it for a real job. I'm an engineer now.

149
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,136
- On the railroad?
- Civil.

150
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:23,390
- What happened to the band?
- Turns out I wasn't talented.

151
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:27,311
Miranda, sorry, this is Jim.

152
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:31,232
- We dated a grillion years ago.
- Or eight.

153
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,026
Miranda. Nice to meet you.

154
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:37,196
I'd ask if you're having fun,
but that seems inappropriate.

155
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:39,114
It is, and we are. Thanks.

156
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,493
- You were friends with Will?
- May he rest.

157
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,373
Roommates in college.
We were friends, but really competitive.

158
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,042
We were always
fighting it out for everything.

159
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,420
He even died first,
just to beat me to the punch.

160
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,173
- Bad.
- But you laughed.

161
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,553
- You were the classic frenemies.
- Frenemies. Nice word.

162
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,596
- I'm a writer.
- I know.

163
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,307
- I'm a lawyer.
- And I'm not drunk enough.

164
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,726
- Can I get you anything?
- Martini.

165
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:10,437
- No.
- Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.

166
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,481
He's kind of cute.

167
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,944
- He's kind of an asshole.
- Really?

168
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,989
- Yes, indeedy.
- He seems great.

169
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:22,449
That's what I thought when I dated him.

170
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:27,037
When it wasn't working,
and I broke up with him - Hello, asshole.

171
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:31,083
Snide comments,
rumour spreading, the works.

172
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,960
He's so cute.

173
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,046
- Incoming.
- Outgoing.

174
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,591
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

175
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:44,013
I would love to chat inappropriately,
but I'm giving a toast in the other room.

176
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,557
So this is a working wake for you.

177
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:50,811
I'd love to get together with you sometime.

178
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:56,734
Here's my card. My e-mail address
is on the back, and my cell.

179
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:00,446
Will's death had turned Miranda
into my target audience -

180
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,656
a desperate woman.

181
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,243
Downtown, Samantha was getting wise,

182
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,330
Sebastian Wise, again.

183
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:13,834
While, uptown,
Charlotte was getting nothing at all.

184
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,755
- We almost broke the bed.
- You can't break a bed.

185
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:21,634
- What does this stallion do?
- I'm not sure.

186
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,929
- Does he go to Mickey Mantle's?
- You got me.

187
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,556
How can you not know?
You slept with him.

188
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:30,476
I fucked him. He made me come six times.

189
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,478
It's good enough for me.

190
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,355
Stop it.

191
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,858
Why do you always
talk about sex like that?

192
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,735
Because I can.

193
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,363
Simmer down,
mommy hasn't had her caffeine yet.

194
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,532
I can't take this any more.

195
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,866
Frittata.

196
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:52,248
Sex is something special that happens
between two people who love each other.

197
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,792
- Or two people who love sex.
- You're such a...

198
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,336
A what? What am I?

199
00:12:57,503 --> 00:13:01,382
You can't just sleep
with everything that comes along.

200
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,009
Hey, Mrs Softie, at least I'm getting laid.

201
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,720
You can forget Samba.

202
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:12,059
She needs a stick out of her ass
and a dick in her coochie pronto.

203
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:15,980
- Not getting involved.
- I'm with her.

204
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:19,233
You know what? I don't need this.

205
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,777
Maybe you should forget Samba too.

206
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:30,536
- We knew this was coming.
- It's so sad and petty.

207
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:36,083
- I'm staying way out of this one.
- Way out. New Jersey out.

208
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,547
Speaking of petty, how upset would you be
if I went out with Jim?

209
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:45,092
- Jim, Old Boyfriend Jim?
- He called me.

210
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,472
Miranda, no.
He needs to be voted off the island.

211
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,894
I know how you feel,
but he was so sweet on the phone.

212
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,897
It was eight years ago.
Maybe he's learned something.

213
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,859
- Haven't you learned anything?
- Apparently not.

214
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:05,988
He's alive, and he asked me out.
I'm fragile right now.

215
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,073
Fine, go.

216
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,618
One woman's asshole
is another woman's...

217
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,161
A-hole.

218
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:15,581
As long as you're OK with it.

219
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,666
Later that week,
Charlotte decided,

220
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:22,171
if she was to get Trey to see the sexual
part of her, she'd have to dress the part.

221
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:25,090
I'm going to get him to notice me. I have to.

222
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:28,385
That's a bottom.

223
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,721
If you're going to go the lingerie route,

224
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:35,017
why not go a little more
upscale and less flammable?

225
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,603
I don't wanna be me.
I wanna be someone else.

226
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,315
- That's the basis for a healthy relationship.
- What do these say?

227
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,275
Read my lips.

228
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:47,363
I want to be call girl-meets-Park-Avenue.

229
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,241
Then you have to pair that with a cardigan.

230
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,994
This is important to me.
I need him to see me sexually.

231
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,456
I know you do. I'm just not sure I need to.

232
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,793
This is much more a Samantha job.

233
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,462
Please. I need a break from her.

234
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,174
You shouldn't be so hard on her.
She doesn't mean to be hurtful.

235
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,176
She was.

236
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,929
There were two of you
ruining my breakfast.

237
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:17,393
I have enough problems right now.
I don't need any lectures.

238
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:22,648
It was my second lecture that week
that was a failure.

239
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:26,110
Across town, Samantha decided,
the wise thing to do was

240
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:29,363
to take a break from all of us
and go shopping.

241
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:35,870
- I'm sorry.
- Let it go, no one gets hurt.

242
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,165
- I was holding it first.
- I know Tae Kwon Do.

243
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:42,710
I know the manager.

244
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:48,174
You're spunky. I like spunky women.

245
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,051
- We're a dying breed.
- No kiddin'.

246
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:55,139
I'm Claire Anne.
Don't let the southern accent fool you.

247
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:58,142
I'm Samantha. Nothing fools me.

248
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,521
I'll let you have this scarf

249
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:07,276
if you show me where a girl can
have a drink in a dark bar around here.

250
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,112
Done and done.

251
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,075
My last date died. The fact that you're
still breathing makes this a success.

252
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:18,120
Low standards. I like that.

253
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,546
- This was really nice.
- Yeah, it was.

254
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,591
Carrie wasn't sure that we would get along.

255
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:34,011
She knew me a long time ago.
I've changed.

256
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:38,224
Back then, I was in a band
called Uncle Ted's Ass.

257
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,061
- And I could sit on my hair.
- That's impressive.

258
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:45,022
You didn't hear us play.

259
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,659
- I'd like to see you again.
- I'd like that.

260
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,537
- Night.
- Night.

261
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:08,754
The next morning, Miranda called with
the post mortem on her last date with Jim.

262
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,299
- Hello?
- It's me.

263
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:16,095
I thought it was the Learning Annex
bugging me about my class.

264
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,681
- When's that?
- 12th of Never Gonna Happen.

265
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,684
People asked for refunds
after my first class.

266
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:24,562
- What do they know?
- More than I do.

267
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:26,772
I feel like a total sham.

268
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,733
Easy. That's my friend
you're talking about.

269
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:36,574
- I went out with Jim.
- Don't make me say, "I told you so."

270
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,994
It was great. He was fun and romantic.

271
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,788
We talked till they closed the restaurant.
You're wrong about him.

272
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:46,792
- This could be good.
- Are we talking about Asshole Jim?

273
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:50,004
- He's not an asshole.
- Not till you break up with him.

274
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:53,257
- He says the greatest things about you.
- He does?

275
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:56,844
- I'm going out with him again on Friday.
- Go, God's speed.

276
00:17:57,011 --> 00:18:01,515
I feel weird dating a guy that you don't like.

277
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:05,978
We should all go out
have a drink sometime. One drink.

278
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:09,607
What do you know about this guy?
You've been on one date.

279
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:13,319
What do you know? It's been eight years.
Think about the drink.

280
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:18,240
Charlotte decided, this would be
a good time to spend with her old friends,

281
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,492
the sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

282
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,871
Oh, my Goodness.
Has it been forever or what?

283
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,125
- It has.
- It's great to see you. We've missed you.

284
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,878
And I have missed you. You have no idea.

285
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:35,382
Congratulations on your wedding.
Welcome to the married old girls club.

286
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,886
He is so handsome.

287
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,723
I would like to trade
my husband in for him, please.

288
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,810
They would understand her.
After all, they were married too.

289
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,898
I remember being a newly-wed.
We hardly ever got out of bed.

290
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,568
- Sydney.
- What? It's just us girls.

291
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,780
My husband can't get it up.

292
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:02,535
It would have been wiser to have had
a cappuccino instead of that third martini.

293
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,829
- I'm so frustrated.
- Charlotte?

294
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:09,375
Don't you ever
just want to be pounded hard?

295
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:13,838
Like when the bed is moving all around,
and it's all sweaty,

296
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:18,801
your head is knocking up against the
headboard, and you feel it might blow off?

297
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:24,849
Dammit, I just really want to be fucked.
Just really fucked.

298
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:29,228
The only heads blowing off
were those of Kappa Kappa Grandma.

299
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,899
- This is really inappropriate.
- Yeah, we're eating.

300
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:39,154
- What's wrong with you? You're such a...
- What? What am I?

301
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:45,327
Charlotte realised how much
they'd all changed since college.

302
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,539
Her friends had become frenemies.

303
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:51,917
And to them, she had become Samantha.

304
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:58,507
- Here's to new friends.
- And gorgeous New York men.

305
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:05,472
Would you like to join me
at Samba on Friday night?

306
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:09,393
Two hot broads at a hot restaurant.
I love it.

307
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,812
The reservation is for four.

308
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:20,279
Done and done.

309
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:25,951
Samantha couldn't believe
how much fun she was having.

310
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:30,122
She had found a woman who was
as open about her sexuality as she was.

311
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,291
I call the blondes.

312
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,794
You are too cute.

313
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,797
I could just eat you up.

314
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,258
Yes, I could.

315
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,677
I'm gonna eat you up.

316
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,765
Claire Anne?

317
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:56,315
- Oh, my God.
- Excellent.

318
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,362
I'm going.

319
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,156
Wait I'll come with you.

320
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:12,248
- You can forget Samba.
- Where are you going?

321
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,709
Samantha learned
she had a little Charlotte in her.

322
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:22,007
She too had a line that could be crossed.
Hers was just more to the left.

323
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:25,594
The next night, I agreed
to meet Jim and Miranda for drinks.

324
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:28,222
Jim took me to a poetry reading last night.

325
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,516
The Unpublished Works
Of Robert Lowell.

326
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:33,352
- He wrote his thesis on Lowell.
- I didn't know that.

327
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,857
There's a lot you never knew about me.
Another Chardonnay for the beautiful lady.

328
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:39,400
Thank you.

329
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:44,071
I lost track of you,
but I always read your column.

330
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,407
- It's really good.
- Thank you.

331
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:51,245
Maybe I'd been wrong.
Jim seemed kind, funny, attentive.

332
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:55,916
- There's a lot of sex in there.
- It creeps in.

333
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,170
You didn't know too much about sex
when we were dating.

334
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,213
Still an asshole.

335
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,591
- Good to see you.
- Don't leave.

336
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,428
I was joking. Stay.
I have really bad timing.

337
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:10,973
- Did you ever hear his band play?
- No.

338
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,519
- She was too busy shopping for shoes.
- I do like my shoes.

339
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:19,732
They come in handy
when you're walking all over people.

340
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,444
- Come on.
- I'm reliving happy memories.

341
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,614
- Carrie doesn't walk all over people.
- She did with me.

342
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,200
Maybe that's because you're an asshole.

343
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:33,621
She's the asshole. She never called me
once after we broke up.

344
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:37,041
- That's because you're an asshole.
- She's the asshole.

345
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,418
- She's not.
- Thank you.

346
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:42,421
You know what? Never call me again.

347
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:45,341
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Yeah.

348
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:49,470
The fancy lawyer lady
is breaking up with me, like I give a shit.

349
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:52,056
Jim hadn't gotten older or wiser.

350
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,767
Once dumped,
he still dumped on everyone.

351
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:57,811
You are such assholes.

352
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:06,570
- OK, say it.
- I told you so.

353
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,865
- What an asshole.
- I told you so.

354
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,535
Is it bad that it makes you
feel good to say that?

355
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:15,996
No. I can't believe
I fell for that asshole.

356
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,332
Your date died. You panicked.

357
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:20,334
You know me too well.

358
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,712
There are plenty of other asses out there.

359
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,049
- You think?
- I know. And I'm an expert.

360
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:29,969
You're such an asshole.

361
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:36,350
Meanwhile, uptown, the Samantha
in Charlotte was finally ready to come out.

362
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:44,275
What in God's name are you wearing?

363
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,986
It's supposed to be sexy.

364
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,532
Come on, you're my wife.

365
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,617
That's not you.
Take it off.

366
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:56,036
Fine.

367
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:08,007
Look at me.

368
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,555
This is me.

369
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:19,226
I'm not a madonna, and I'm not a whore.

370
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:24,481
I'm your wife.
I'm sexual, and I love you.

371
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:38,037
What are you doing?

372
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:41,540
I'm touching myself.

373
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,004
I can... I can see that.

374
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,049
Good.

375
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:02,728
Trey?

376
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,358
I think we have a stiff breeze.

377
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:10,778
That night,
Trey successfully screwed his wife

378
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:14,740
for a full minute and a half
before the wind died.

379
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:19,620
After Charlotte's night of love,
she called the one person she knew

380
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,747
who would appreciate it the most.

381
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,749
Hello?

382
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,668
He fucked me.

383
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:29,129
Honey, that's great.
I knew you could do it.

384
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:32,800
- Thanks.
- Don't forget Samba Friday night.

385
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:34,301
I'll be there.

386
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:35,928
Did you come?

387
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,224
Having spent time with their frenemies,

388
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:44,645
Charlotte and Samantha forgot they were
enemies and went back to being friends.

389
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:47,857
I realised I had become
my own worst frenemy.

390
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:51,610
I had let 300 desperate women
and one asshole convince me

391
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:55,531
that I didn't know anything.
They were wrong. I was older and wiser.

392
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:58,784
I decided to keep
my second date with the Learning Annex.

393
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:02,121
Unfortunately,
my reputation had preceded me.

394
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:03,831
Is this it?

395
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,007
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.

396
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:17,553
You've paid good money
to find out how to meet men.

397
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,513
I don't know a lot about it,

398
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,058
but you're not going to
meet them in a Learning Annex class.

399
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:25,144
So, grab your bags.

400
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:29,523
Come on, we're not getting any younger.

401
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:36,155
That's right. Just trying
to give you your money's worth.

402
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:41,744
I took them around the corner to a bar,
took my $300 and bought them drinks.

403
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:45,289
Anne, the guy over there
is checking you out.

404
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,583
Twelve o'clock.

405
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,002
Not everybody, just Anne.

406
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:54,089
- Go and ask him for a light.
- I'm already lit.

407
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,511
Go.

408
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:04,725
- Hi, got a light?
- Sure.

409
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,186
Oh, yeah. See?

410
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,730
OK, one down, five to go.

411
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,984
- What about him?
- It's cool with me. It's fine.

412
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:18,948
Excuse me?
Hi, have you met Liz? She works in TV.

413
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:22,701
- I love TV.
- Something in common.

414
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,954
That night, I made three matches.

415
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,958
I didn't look for myself.
I try not to date while at work.

416
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:33,671
The old and wise adage is true -
those who can't do, teach.

417
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:36,131
Those who can't teach, do.

418
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,717
Here's a lifeline.
Go, get him, tiger. Go.

419
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:41,011
Run like the wind.
