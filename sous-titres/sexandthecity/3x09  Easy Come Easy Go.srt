1
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,540
OK, I gotta go.

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,550
Have a good day. Give me a kiss.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,347
Bye-bye.

4
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,285
One unfortunate thing

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,392
about ending a relationship

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,289
in a city like New York

7
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,261
is while you can emotionally
move away from each other,

8
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,399
you physically can't.

9
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,143
Going to work?

10
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,777
Yeah, work.

11
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,881
- Sorry about waking you.
- What time is it?

12
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,883
- 6:30.
- Jesus. Why so early?

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,351
I got a brief due, so...

14
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,457
There was nothing brief about it.

15
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,560
Steve and Miranda had been doing
the polite avoid-each-other

16
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,491
break-up-dance for three weeks.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,899
I'm sorry it's taking me so long

18
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,660
to find a place.

19
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,769
I got a lead on one, though.

20
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,598
OK.

21
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,435
Hey, do you... Never mind.

22
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,974
What?

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,739
I was gonna ask if you'd look at it
with me,

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,314
but that's weird, right?

25
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,419
- I don't know. We could do that.
- Yeah?

26
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,357
When you find that place to move,

27
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,495
you need to fill it with furniture.

28
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,960
That's why smart New Yorkers

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,727
frequent the opening day
of the New Designer showcase.

30
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,234
I'm like your roady.

31
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,306
I don't have a road.
I just have this booth.

32
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:27,310
- At best, you're my booth-bitch.
- Yeah, I'm your booth-bitch.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,345
I wax your wood.

34
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,313
You wax it real good.

35
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,511
That's because I'm your booth-bitch.

36
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,053
You watch the booth.
I'm going to get us some coffee.

37
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,720
Whatever you say.
I'm your booth-bitch.

38
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,129
That's sexy. I like it.

39
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,901
I didn't need
a blue-ribbon panel to decide -

40
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:57,202
he was the finest new designer
in the whole place.

41
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,085
I'd often fantasized
about running into my ex and his wife,

42
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:12,122
but in those fantasies
I was running into them with a truck.

43
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,729
I don't know how you could like
this clunky wood. It's oppressive.

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,092
- What the fuck?
- Hi.

45
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,498
Hi. I'm working here.

46
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:33,442
I mean, I'm not working.
This is my boyfriend's booth.

47
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,342
I'm his booth-bitch.

48
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:40,714
- That's a joke. Guess it's an in-joke.
- I get it.

49
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,587
So. Can I show you something
in a hutch?

50
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,194
His pieces are fantastic.
It's just not really our style.

51
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,921
No. We only like teeny-tiny furniture.

52
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,308
This is the designer.
This is Aidan Shaw.

53
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,673
Great stuff.

54
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,508
Thanks, man.

55
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,411
- Oak?
- It's mostly maple.

56
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,352
There we were. Mostly maple
and incredibly uncomfortable.

57
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,720
- Sorry, I didn't get your names.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,555
These are my friends.

59
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,358
This is Natasha, and this is...

60
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,362
Shit. Sorry, is that hot?

61
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,003
It ain't cold.

62
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,797
- Here.
- No, I'II...

63
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,637
- We should put cold water on this.
- OK.

64
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,143
It was nice meeting you.

65
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,839
Thanks for the coffee.

66
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,686
- They seem nice.
- Yeah, don't they?

67
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,756
- Where do you know them from?
- From around.

68
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,658
Like 100 years ago.

69
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,853
It's a past life.

70
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,130
Two hours later,
it was time for the opening-day party.

71
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:10,174
It was lovely. Caviar, silent auctions,
and landmines.

72
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,937
Where's Paul Bunyan?

73
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,980
If you're referring to my boyfriend -
he's doing business.

74
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,416
Ooh, he's a big 'un!
Where did he learn to whittle like that?

75
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,521
How many drinks
have you had?

76
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,885
Not nearly enough.

77
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,196
So... How are you?

78
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,736
I'm great.

79
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,034
And Daniel Boone, is he a nice guy?

80
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,541
His name is Aidan.

81
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,777
- Where is your sense of humor?
- Where is your wife?

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,387
Guarding her bid on the silent auction.
She's got her eye on a beige chair.

83
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,251
Everything in my apartment
is now beige.

84
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,892
Beige is bullshit.

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,085
I thought you wanted beige.

86
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,926
Yeah, well... It doesn't quite fit.

87
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,763
- Have you got a smoke?
- I quit.

88
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,167
We always used to share
a cigarette together.

89
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,775
We did a lot of things
that were bad for me together.

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,104
I have a secret
to tell you.

91
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:27,585
It's not working.
I'm getting out.

92
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,918
If you know anyone
who's interested...

93
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,723
You should keep that to yourself.
No one wants that information.

94
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,097
- Big's leaving his wife.
- No!

95
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,504
- He told me at the furniture show.
- What was he doing there?

96
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,906
- Drinking and leaving his wife.
- Oh, my God.

97
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,741
- Let's just say it. You won.
- Was there a contest?

98
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,749
There's always a contest with an ex.
It's called "Who'll Die Miserable?".

99
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,116
- What did he say?
- He said, "It's not working out."

100
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,885
Then he leaned in and said, "If you
know anyone who's interested..."

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,861
You don't know anyone
who is interested. He's married.

102
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,557
- I'm aware of that.
- Why is he telling you?

103
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,293
To save postage on his newsletter?

104
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,166
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,672
- She's not gonna do anything.
- You're starting to bug me.

106
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,903
How dare he say that to you?
Married men never leave their wives.

107
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,276
Even if he did, I have no intention
of doing anything for two reasons -

108
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,611
I have a great boyfriend,
and I'm not insane.

109
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,483
Let's order. What do winners order?

110
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:42,356
- Didn't you feel like punching him?
- No. It was too sad or something.

111
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,861
- I would have punched him.
- No, it is sad.

112
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,625
How long has he been married?
Seven months?

113
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,564
The seven-month itch.

114
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:55,036
That's what happens when people
jump into relationships too quickly.

115
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,338
I resent that. Trey and I
are nothing like Big and Natasha.

116
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,776
Don't listen to her.
She's mid-break-up.

117
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,475
- Thanks for the update.
- Trey and I really love each other.

118
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,312
Who wants to split a Rubin?

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,514
I'm meeting his mother this week,
and if all goes well...

120
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,523
If all goes well what?

121
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,663
Trey is this close to proposing.
I can feel it.

122
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,559
Oh, my God. Really?

123
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,166
You've just met.
I've had pairs of pantyhose longer.

124
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,361
It's not logical. This is love.

125
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,871
It's not logical.
It's right, in my heart. I feel it's right.

126
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,976
OK, whatever.

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,549
So, how did he look?

128
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,559
OK. I'll take it.

129
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,457
As Miranda looked around,
she realized the contest was over.

130
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,124
Steve was the ex that was
going to die alone and miserable.

131
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,068
- You can't live here.
- It's not that bad.

132
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,368
It's not that bad?
It's the doorway to hell.

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,536
There's gotta be a better place.
I'll help you look.

134
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,910
- Guilt?
- Probably.

135
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:16,578
I broke up with him, and he's got
no money, no savings, no nothing.

136
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:21,350
There should be a city-funded
break-up housing for those in need.

137
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,789
Really?

138
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:28,298
A big orphanage where old boyfriends
could think about what they did wrong

139
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:33,461
and cry themselves to sleep
in a clean, safe environment.

140
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,971
You think you don't really
want him to move away?

141
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,973
It's not that simple.

142
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,477
My head tells me it's time
for him to leave, but the idea of him

143
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:47,085
moving into a basement apartment
in West Shit Street breaks my heart.

144
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,122
It's a common belief that women use
the left, emotional side of their brain

145
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,124
and men the right, more logical side.

146
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,387
But is it really that cut and dry?

147
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,827
When it comes to affairs of the heart,

148
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,968
there's a battle between
what we know and what we feel.

149
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,433
What do you do in a situation

150
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,574
that leaps back and forth
between the left and right side?

151
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:13,974
In relationships, is it smarter
to follow your heart or your head?

152
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,047
This is Trey when he graduated
from medical school.

153
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,515
Later that week, Charlotte met
the head and heart of Trey's family -

154
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,176
his mother,
Bunny MacDougal.

155
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,222
Trey, you look so cute
in a cap and gown!

156
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:31,193
That was before we jumped
in the fountain and hell broke loose.

157
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,729
What's next -
boy scout snaps?

158
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,833
Count your blessings I didn't bring
the one on the bearskin rug.

159
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,869
You'll have to excuse her.
She's a bit of a camera nazi.

160
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,940
If you insist on dragging us
down memory lane,

161
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:47,102
I'm getting a real drink.
Excuse me, a Glenlivet rocks, please.

162
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,147
Maybe you should have a red wine
instead. Better for the heart.

163
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,546
- All righty.
- Red wine.

164
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,156
Thomas, we'd love some more
nibbly cheese things.

165
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,554
- Very good, ma'am.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,719
He's older than water,
but never forgets a martini.

167
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,701
- Do you play tennis?
- Mm-hm.

168
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,894
I like her.

169
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,004
Join the club.

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:19,042
- What are you two doing tonight?
- We've got reservations at Cloche.

171
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:25,013
I was there last week. Disappointing
crab and the host was rude.

172
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,918
Maybe you should go
to Côte Basque instead.

173
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,556
All righty.

174
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,021
Charlotte was impressed
with Bunny's technique.

175
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,787
Trey had been looking forward
to Cloche all week.

176
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:42,525
Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha was
entertaining Adam Ball, a film editor

177
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:47,503
who made a living cutting coming
attractions for film companies.

178
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,697
Coming.

179
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,341
I'm coming.

180
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,508
Oh, man!

181
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,149
You give good head.

182
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,414
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest tasting spunk.

183
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,163
And she's never coming back.

184
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,826
Sorry, but who else
can I talk to about this?

185
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,235
- Might I suggest, no one?
- You're my girlfriends. Help me.

186
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,205
- Have you ever had this problem?
- Not really.

187
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,313
But I have to admit it's never been
a trip to Baskin-Robins.

188
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,350
This guy is very sour. Like asparagus
gone bad or something.

189
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,510
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

190
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,555
Beautiful guy, great in bed,
it's so disappointing.

191
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,751
It's like a bad bottle of Beaujolais
Nouveau the first day of season.

192
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,898
It's to do with nutrition. I once dated
a smoker. It affected how his tasted.

193
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,933
They should put that
on the pack to cut back sales.

194
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,468
Maybe there's something he could eat
to make it sweeter.

195
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,801
- You should write to Martha Stewart.
- Dear Martha, funky spunk, help!

196
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,707
Dear funky spunk, try a hint of mint.

197
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,475
It's not just asparagus.
It's asparagus and something else.

198
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,777
I know: Clorox.

199
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,353
- At least it'll get your whites whiter.
- This is serious. I almost gagged.

200
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,320
- That is serious.
- What am I gonna do?

201
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,427
- Just don't give him head again.
- I never even thought of that.

202
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,722
Casual head is back now?

203
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,560
It's fine. He's healthy,
and I don't swallow.

204
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,568
As long as you and the center
for disease control are fine with it.

205
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,366
He loves getting head,
but what man doesn't?

206
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:33,444
If the come-situation were reversed,
do you think men would go near it?

207
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,807
Maybe.
If it tasted like beer.

208
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,051
Miranda came home to something
that was even harder to swallow.

209
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,247
You have one new message.

210
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,692
Hi. If this is Steve's number...

211
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,924
This is Barbara. We met last night.
I'm the advertising exec.

212
00:13:54,099 --> 00:14:00,060
Steve, if this is you, call me.
I'd love to go to a movie sometime.

213
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,504
Today, 12:22 pm.

214
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,968
And on an answering machine
across town...

215
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,216
You have one new message.

216
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:17,083
Hi, it's me. I need to talk to you
about what I said the other day.

217
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,020
It's important.
You know my cell number.

218
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,286
The right side of my brain
told me to delete it.

219
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,293
But I left it.

220
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,556
It's important.
You know my cell number.

221
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,702
Seven playbacks later,
I invited an impartial judge.

222
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,599
- Well?
- You should have punched him.

223
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,968
He wants to get back together, right?
That's the tone.

224
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,939
The "Hi" and the "It's important".
Is that what it means?

225
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:43,604
We will never know. They still
don't know who killed Kennedy.

226
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,078
- What should I do?
- It's obvious what you want to do

227
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:53,317
or you wouldn't listen to it and what
happened to the sane part of you?

228
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,053
I don't know. After the fifth playback
he got in a little.

229
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,463
- I hate my machine.
- Yeah.

230
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,861
I hate mine too.

231
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:07,267
Steve got a message from a girl
desperate for him to go to a movie.

232
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,307
- Already? He's still on your couch.
- I know. It's amazing.

233
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,503
A 34-year-old guy
with no money and no place to live

234
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,807
because he's single,
he's a catch.

235
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,576
But a 34-year-old woman
with a job and a great home

236
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,879
because she's single,
is considered tragic.

237
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,078
Depressing.

238
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,952
Let's listen to that message again.

239
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,787
I'm deleting it.

240
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,825
But it wasn't that simple.

241
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:35,365
As soon as Miranda left, my emotions
overruled both sides of my brain.

242
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,632
- Hello?
- It's Carrie.

243
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,502
Oh, hey. Thanks for calling.

244
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,109
It's about getting out of my marriage.

245
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,305
I didn't know why I called
or what I wanted,

246
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,416
but suddenly my heart was racing.

247
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,516
I thought about it,
and it's going to cost me a lot.

248
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,022
You should forget about what I said.

249
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,355
I made my bed, I should lie in it.

250
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,798
You do that.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,699
It was what I needed. A shock
treatment to jolt me back to sanity.

252
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,701
- You have cracks.
- Excuse me?

253
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,904
The ceiling.

254
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,776
How long have they been there?

255
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,353
- Just three years.
- Oh, just three years?

256
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,927
Don't take this the wrong way,
but this place could use a little work.

257
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,723
I can't afford it.

258
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:43,197
- You got 8,000 bucks worth of shoes.
- I needed those.

259
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,963
You could do little things -
plaster, strip the floors...

260
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,873
You have no idea how beautiful
it would be if we took it down a level.

261
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,314
I don't know how to do that stuff.

262
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,347
I do.

263
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,748
- Let me strip your floors.
- Isn't that a lot of work?

264
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,889
No. It'll just take a day.
You won't know I'm here.

265
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,287
Sure? Really?

266
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,950
A special lady needs a special home.

267
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,501
Here am I with a guy
who wanted to make my home better.

268
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,106
Somewhere out there was a guy
who wanted to pull it apart.

269
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,242
It wasn't a left or right-brainer,
it was a no-brainer.

270
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,743
- Tell me why we're here again.
- I'm making an effort to eat better.

271
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,715
After a browse
on the healthysperm.com web page,

272
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,787
Samantha invited Adam Ball to dinner.

273
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:41,119
OK, here are your wheat grass shots.

274
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,854
I'll be right back with the menus.

275
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,934
- I can't drink that.
- Try it. It's very good for you.

276
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,132
Bottoms up.

277
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,191
That shit is funky!

278
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,126
Samantha fought the urge not to tell
Adam Ball he didn't know from funky.

279
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:25,168
How long does it take for wheat grass
to work into your system?

280
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,805
- Hard to say.
- Ballpark.

281
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,135
An hour and a half.

282
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,005
We should order.

283
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,146
An hour and a half,
two wheat grass shots

284
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,305
and a ginger-melon smoothie later,

285
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,710
I'm coming.

286
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,784
I'm coming.

287
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,989
Man, man, man, you give good head.

288
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,130
Oh, babe.

289
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,596
What? You don't like your salad?

290
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,968
No. The dressing's a tad... something.

291
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,908
Excuse me, I'd like to change this
for the rucola and endive.

292
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,711
You should try the tomato basil.
It's sweeter.

293
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,408
All righty.

294
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,752
- Mom was quite taken with you.
- She is?

295
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,827
Why wouldn't she be?
You're exquisite.

296
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,932
You are a dream come true.

297
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,432
Charlotte knew this was the moment,

298
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:35,630
that magic moment where Trey
was going to ask her to be his wife.

299
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,934
- Charlotte.
- Yes?

300
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,908
- Tomato and basil?
- Yes.

301
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,411
Enjoy.

302
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,750
Doesn't this look
like a little plate of heaven?

303
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,449
This basil is perfection.

304
00:19:54,693 --> 00:20:00,757
What is it about you Charlotte?
You always know just what I want.

305
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:07,133
- Maybe we should get married.
- All righty.

306
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,479
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, my God. Really?

307
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,585
- That's wonderful, sweetie.
- I proposed to myself.

308
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,550
- What?
- Yes.

309
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,988
I suggested he have a tomato salad,
then I suggested we get married.

310
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,627
What did he say?

311
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,819
"All righty."

312
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,892
"All righty"?
He said, "All righty"?

313
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,505
The upsetting thing is proposing
to a guy who says "all righty".

314
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,003
Stop.

315
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,632
- All righty.
- I was the one supposed to say yes.

316
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,144
- Who cares about those stupid rules?
- I do.

317
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,374
You're overreacting.
You love Trey, right?

318
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,816
And you want to marry him, right?

319
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,583
Yes, but there was no kneeling.

320
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,591
There was no ring, no nothing.

321
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,993
This is an awful engagement story.
What am I supposed to tell my kids?

322
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:12,330
Mommy really wanted to get married,
so Daddy said, "All righty".

323
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,132
So unromantic.

324
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,486
Steve? The dog!

325
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,164
Steve. It's 4:00 am.

326
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,002
Miranda realized
he was with the girl executive.

327
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:55,306
It was officially over.
She finally got it into her head.

328
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,851
- Morning.
- Morning.

329
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,623
- I took the dog out already.
- Thanks. I was...

330
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,930
There's coffee, and I circled a bunch
of apartments that sound good.

331
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:24,269
I'll get out of here today. Thanks for
letting me sleep on your couch.

332
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,774
You're welcome.

333
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,416
I think we did pretty good.

334
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,656
We did us proud.

335
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,888
Steve...

336
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,727
- Never mind.
- What?

337
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:54,600
I was gonna say, "Keep in touch",
but that would be weird.

338
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,767
I guess we could do that.

339
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,371
Aidan.

340
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,243
You said I wouldn't be bothered.
I'm bothered.

341
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,183
- It's too loud?
- Yeah. I've got a deadline.

342
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,255
- Go to my house.
- No, I can't write there.

343
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,360
Pete's jumping all over me.
He's deleting things.

344
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,497
I'm leaving.
I'll be at the Stanhope Hotel.

345
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,600
- At least let me pay for it.
- No, I got it.

346
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:01,136
This is why I don't do home repairs.
Unforeseen costs.

347
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,637
You'll love these floors.

348
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,336
Mom was beside herself.
She demanded your address...

349
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,571
...so she could send flowers.
- That's nice.

350
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,841
Charlotte had done the impossible
in New York.

351
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,508
She was engaged
to her heart's desire.

352
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,587
Unfortunately, she couldn't get
the way it happened out of her head.

353
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,916
Wait.

354
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,921
I think we should
stop here for a minute.

355
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:30,464
Maybe we should go in and find you
the most beautiful ring they have.

356
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,865
All righty.

357
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,405
From that moment on,
Charlotte would tell everyone

358
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:40,978
that in front of Tiffany's, out of
nowhere, Trey popped the question.

359
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,014
And she said, "All righty".

360
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,788
I'm not really in the mood
for that tonight.

361
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,595
Come on, baby,
you give the greatest head. Please.

362
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,432
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why? What's the problem?

363
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,567
Well, Adam...

364
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,203
- You've got funky tasting spunk.
- What?

365
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,373
You heard me.
Your spunk is funky.

366
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:25,321
- My spunk?
- Come, spooge, jiz, joy juice. Funky.

367
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,982
I've heard bad excuses for not giving
head, but this one takes the cake.

368
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,221
- Excuse me?
- You're a two blow job chick.

369
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,834
They're in the coming attractions
but I'll never see them in the movie.

370
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,994
I resent that. I love giving head.

371
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:44,471
Then give me a little BJ. Up and down
a couple of times, it's easy.

372
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,579
You men have no idea
what we're dealing with down there.

373
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,342
Teeth placement, jaw stress,
suction, and gag reflex,

374
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:57,011
all the while bobbing up and down,
moaning and trying to breathe. Easy?

375
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,316
Honey, they don't call it
a job for nothin'.

376
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,090
Now, having said all that,

377
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,596
with the right man it can be fabulous.

378
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:15,503
That is, unless the man has spunk
that's like the rotten egg buffet.

379
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,905
Come on, it can't be that bad.

380
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,979
I'll make a deal with you.

381
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,208
You try it.

382
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,753
If you're fine with it, I'll be fine with it.

383
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,914
I can't do that. It's gay.

384
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,457
It's not gay, if it's you.

385
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,325
Take it or leave it.

386
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:45,197
Ten minutes later, Samantha learnt
how far men would go for a blow job.

387
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,538
I'm fine with it.

388
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,071
Samantha kept her word.

389
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,545
She gave him head,
but her heart wasn't in it.

390
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,917
- Hello?
- It's me.

391
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,824
- I'm in the lobby.
- How did you know I was here?

392
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,489
- That guy at your place...
- You called my house again?

393
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,831
- I have to talk to you.
- I have to talk to you too. Stay there.

394
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,000
Shit.

395
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,021
- This is not the lobby.
- Have a drink.

396
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,387
What are you doing, calling my house,
following me to hotels?

397
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,121
Could you sit down for one minute
and listen to me?

398
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,060
Please. One minute.

399
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,863
I don't have time.
I have a boyfriend and a deadline,

400
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,336
and you have a wife
and a drinking problem.

401
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,373
- I'm not drunk.
- Then what is your excuse?

402
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,535
Slow down, I can't think.

403
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,084
- I was an asshole the other day.
- Yes.

404
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,019
When I said I was leaving, you didn't
say anything. I got nervous, so...

405
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,092
So, what?

406
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,093
I don't know.

407
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:24,793
This has to stop - flirting, jerking me
around, calling my boyfriend.

408
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,904
He doesn't know about you,
and I don't want him to.

409
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,438
Why?

410
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,599
Go, lie in your beige bed.

411
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,211
Carrie, wait, wait.

412
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,381
I haven't explained this very well.
Wait a minute. Listen.

413
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,084
The thing is, fuck, I miss you.

414
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,195
Too bad.

415
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,356
- Do not come in here.
- I have to talk to you.

416
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,366
What? What is it you have to say?

417
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,096
I made a mistake.

418
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,673
Fuck you.

419
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,543
I love you.

420
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,943
Fuck you.

421
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:21,125
My mind was yelling how angry I was,
but my heart...

422
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,090
Fuck me.

423
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:46,609
And just like that I lost my head.
