1
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:51,550
New York city. Home to one million
exciting, eligible, single men...

2
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,929
and four cold and slightly cranky
single women.

3
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:59,892
Well, this is good. We're actually
crossing water to meet men.

4
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,187
Reminder, I am not going
to Staten lsland to meet men.

5
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:05,647
I am going to judge them.

6
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,776
One of the perk's of being a minor
New York celebrity

7
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:11,236
is that you get invited to major events.

8
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,572
Like the fire department of New York's

9
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,407
annual calendar competition.

10
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,993
This it's an awfully long way to go to watch

11
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:19,912
some firemen take their shirts off.

12
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,207
I'm on the fuckin' ferry.
I better see more than just packs.

13
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,668
I'm freezing!

14
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,003
I don't understand

15
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,255
why they couldn't hold the competition

16
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:31,882
in a bar in Manhattan.

17
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,634
They have firemen

18
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,761
on the Upper East side too.

19
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:38,722
And they only put out top-notch fires.

20
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:41,308
Look at how small it looks.

21
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,520
Who would have thought
an island that tiny

22
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,898
would be big enough
to hold all our old boyfriends.

23
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:01,537
He loves to cook
and can whip up a great baked ziti.

24
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,499
He's from engine 275, ladder 133,

25
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,543
way out there in Queens.

26
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,060
- Is he hot?
- He's a six.

27
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,771
on a scale of how many?

28
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:31,734
His name was Bill Kelley.
He was a divorced politician,

29
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,653
campaigning for New York city
controller.

30
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,572
And the token male judge.

31
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:44,455
- Watch the firemen.
- I'm more into cops.

32
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,293
He's a dancer and married.
sorry, ladies.

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,340
His wife Maria said he's a good guy
but he works too hard.

34
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,468
Work that belly!

35
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:04,475
Ladies, over here.

36
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:10,147
oK, they don't make cosmopolitans,
it's a staten lsland iced tea.

37
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:13,942
- Is that like a Long lsland iced tea?
- I think so.

38
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,529
Hello, I'm drunk.

39
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,199
Do we have to be this close?
It's embarrassing.

40
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,161
- You gotta be in it to win it.
- I'm moving back.

41
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:28,415
I can't see the cute firemen
from back there without my glasses.

42
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,001
Why do you even care?
You have Steve.

43
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:36,215
I do not have Steve. There is no
having of the Steve, we're just friends.

44
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,801
We're just friends.
I don't put my dick in you.

45
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,178
Another one of these
and I might let you.

46
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,348
There are no datable men here.

47
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:49,395
What was your first clue? The plether
jackets or smell of "Hai Karate"?

48
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,106
Ladies, this is Ricky Fantucchi.
He's a capricorn.

49
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,316
His uncles are firefighters.

50
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,903
Yes, ladies,
that's a cheetah on his arm.

51
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:06,036
Ricky represents engine 53
in Lower Manhattan.

52
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,666
I'd like to show him
my Lower Manhattan.

53
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:17,047
- Look at his arms, they're huge.
- You know what they say.

54
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:20,509
Big arms...big arms.

55
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,471
Hello, 911. I'm on fire.

56
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,282
After the contest,
I began to realize that staten lsland

57
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,951
was like a quaint European country.

58
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,412
The American music
was 20 years behind

59
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,206
and you could smoke
wherever you wanted.

60
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:19,193
Hi. You know if those shirts are for sale?
I'd like to get one for my nephew.

61
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,112
Yeah, you could buy'em.
But I don't know if you can buy them here or not.

62
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,450
I got this one at work, but I'm sure you
could buy 'em at other places.

63
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,244
- I've seen them in those shops...
- Samantha.

64
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,873
- Ricky, how are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

65
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,959
- I saw you up there.
- I saw you too.

66
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,796
- You looked fantastic.
- Yeah?

67
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:42,049
I never did anything like that.
My sisters said, "Do it, Ricky".

68
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:45,302
And I said,
"l never did anything like that before".

69
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,304
You did it very well.

70
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:52,685
- I wonder what month you'll be.
- Maybe october.

71
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:57,147
- My birthday is in october.
- I bet July, or any month that's hot.

72
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,903
Two songs later, it was time for this
dancing queen to take a breather.

73
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,739
Hello. Can I bum a smoke?

74
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,908
- sure.
- Thanks.

75
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,119
There you go.

76
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,667
- That's good. I quit three years ago.
- How's that working out for you?

77
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,463
- Good. I allow myself one a week.
- You live right on the edge, don't you?

78
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,717
- can I buy you a beer?
- No, I got it.

79
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,386
It's on me.
For helping me out during the contest.

80
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,682
sure. And by the way,
you have the worst taste in men...

81
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,727
-...ever.
- No way.

82
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:37,479
You gave that guy from Midtown a 7.

83
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:41,025
I like a firefighter with love handles
to hold on to

84
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,776
when escaping a burning building.

85
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:46,113
- You got a point there.
- But you were tough.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,324
And what's with the half-points?
6.5, 8.5?

87
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,746
What can I say?
sometimes a girl needs a half.

88
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:58,876
so, which district do you vote in?

89
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,837
Whichever one is near Barneys.

90
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,173
You've never voted
in New York city?

91
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,467
You're correct, Mr. President.

92
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,386
What's your address?
Official government purposes.

93
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:12,973
- I can tell you your district.
- Officially?

94
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,392
It's 245 East 73rd street.

95
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,730
District 23. Same as mine.
I'm at Madison and 82nd.

96
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:23,859
Fancy. I thought all honest politicians
lived in samll studios

97
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,652
and ate beans out of a can.

98
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
I'm not a fan of beans.

99
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:32,326
Can I get your phone number?
Government purposes only.

100
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,204
I'm just here with my friends
having a good time.

101
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,291
- I'm not into dating right now.
- What, bad break-up?

102
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,558
That was a long silence.

103
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,894
Actually, it was a silence and a half.

104
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,105
Have dinner with me.

105
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,275
Would it help if I took my shirt off?

106
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,655
Time to go.
Politician's hitting on me.

107
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:13,951
- And is that a bad thing?
- He's just way too "I,m the guy".

108
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,328
Are you sure? He's pretty cute.

109
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,666
I don't want to have to tell you this.
I saw him give someone a thumbs up.

110
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:24,712
We're out of here. Samantha
went home with that firefighter.

111
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:29,174
- Toot toot, beep beep.
- And Charlotte's around somewhere.

112
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:35,264
- How many cocktails did she have?
- A couple, why?

113
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,885
And so, three girls headed home,

114
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:18,349
taking only fond memories of staten
lsland and its infamous iced teas.

115
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,103
Honey, close up, it's cold.

116
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,402
- Are you gonna help?
- I held her head in the taxi.

117
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,658
You're so nice, Carrie.

118
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,745
- I'm nice too, aren't l?
- Yes, you're nice.

119
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,706
I'm nice...

120
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,752
I'm pretty and I'm smart.
I'm a catch.

121
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,796
Yes, you're a catch.

122
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,923
I hate you.

123
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,929
You knowwhat? I'm gonna meet
the perfect guy and get married.

124
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,515
Yes, you're getting married.

125
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,146
Did you hear that New York?
I'm getting married this year.

126
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,983
I'm getting married and here I come!

127
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,861
If she falls over
I will never stop laughing.

128
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,197
I wasn't quite sure
if it was the ice teas

129
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,242
or the staten lsland dating pool
that broke the camel's back.

130
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,744
But something set Charlotte on fire.

131
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:26,834
And uptown on dry land, Samantha
and Mr. July had their own fire going.

132
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,546
You're so big and strong.

133
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,220
I believe the official fire department
count is "a four alarmer".

134
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,307
The next morning at breakfast,
Miranda and I wanted poached eggs,

135
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,560
Samantha wanted to give us
the juicy details

136
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,646
and Charlotte wanted to keep
her head from exploding

137
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,565
all over her burberry raincoat.

138
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,109
I'm telling you, i don't think
a guy has ever gotten me that wet.

139
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,112
- Pass the salt. - Milk ?
- Let me tell you about his cock.

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,408
Will you be quiet? The people
at the next table have a child.

141
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,120
- That's their choice.
- Little Miss Hangover's right.

142
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,789
can we spare the cock talk
till cocktail time?

143
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,627
I wanted you to know my fireman was
every bit the fantasy I had in mind.

144
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:11,795
New York's finest.

145
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,173
- That's cops.
- Whatever.

146
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:18,010
I think it's wrong to sleep with a man
just to fulfill a certain fantasy.

147
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:20,971
All the men we sleep with
fulfill a certain fantasy.

148
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,264
or nightmare.

149
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,851
You fantasize of a man with a Park Avenue
apartment and a nice big stock portfolio.

150
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,062
For me, it's a fireman with a big hose.

151
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,230
Why are firemen so fuckin' cute?

152
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,859
Even when they're not that cute...
they're still cute.

153
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,738
First, there's a weight limit.
second, it's the hero thing.

154
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,532
- You see him on that truck...
- That truck is hot.

155
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:43,035
...hurrying to save someone trapped.

156
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:47,331
They've got that
"I'm a good guy" look in their eyes.

157
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,209
It's because women really
just want to be rescued.

158
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:54,046
There it was, the sentence
independent single women in their thirties

159
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,965
are never supposed to think,
let alone say out loud.

160
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:02,346
It's true. I've been dating since I was
15, I'm exhausted. Where is he?

161
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,350
- Who? The white knight?
- That only happens in fairytales.

162
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,936
My hair hurts.

163
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,189
Did you ever think
that maybe we're the white knights

164
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,275
and we're the ones
that have to save ourselves?

165
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,739
- That is so depressing.
- Is it?

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,785
Later that day I got to thinking
about fairytales.

167
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,038
What if Prince Charming
had never showed up?

168
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,375
Would Snowwhite have slept
in that glass coffin forever?

169
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,587
or would she have eventually woken
up, spit out the apple, gotten a job,

170
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,675
a healthcare package and a baby
from her local neighbourhoud sperm bank?

171
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,346
I couldn't help but wonder. Inside
every confident driven, single woman

172
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:49,101
is there a delicate, fragile princess
just waiting to be saved?

173
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,978
Was Charlotte right?

174
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,231
Do women just wanna be rescued?

175
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,027
And after your laser surgery
on saturday

176
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:03,115
you'll need a significant other
or a friend to help get you home.

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,825
sign here.

178
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,328
While for some women the idea
of rescue was a life raft,

179
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,205
for Miranda it was an insult.

180
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,375
I don't need anybody to help me.
I'll be fine.

181
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,253
You'll be sedated
and your vision will be blurred.

182
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,007
You will need someone
to get you home and to bed.

183
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,177
Then take two sleeping pills,
sleep for 12 hours.

184
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,221
Wake up and you'll be able
to see perfectly.

185
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,391
I can't believe I'm gonna wake up
and see clearly

186
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,728
without glasses or contacts
for the first time.

187
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,980
BelieVe it.

188
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,942
They slit your eyeball open
and flip up the top.

189
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,946
- Gross.
- It just flips right up. Flip, my eye.

190
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,825
- oK, stop.
- This little blade cuts it. Just...

191
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,287
...Iike the top of a grape.

192
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,291
It sounds pretty bad.

193
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,961
You want me to come down
and hold your hand?

194
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,131
I'm fine. I do not need anyone
to hold my hand.

195
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm not saying you need anyone.

196
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,180
I'd just like to be there.
To help you, whatever.

197
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,391
You'll need help getting home.

198
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,727
Yeah, I'm gonna ask Carrie.

199
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,773
Why do you have to ask Carrie
when I'm offering?

200
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,943
Because, you know,
Carrie is my friend.

201
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,656
- oK, and what am l?
- We haven't established that yet.

202
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:33,622
- Are you coming up?
- We haven't established that yet.

203
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,837
What are we doing here?
I mean, are we...

204
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,008
Steve, after they flip the eye up,
these jets...

205
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,848
And over on the East side
at a more Charlotte-friendly bar,

206
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,727
the ice tea princess began her quest
for a white knight.

207
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,439
oh, my God. He's so cute.
cute, right?

208
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,400
very cute.
And I'm a professional.

209
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,905
I have to meet him.
How am I gonna meet him?

210
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,742
We got here ten minutes ago.
Pace yourself.

211
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,037
Hey beautiful. I'm J.J.
can I buy those sweet lips a drink?

212
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,791
I'm sorry. We were just leaving.

213
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,587
Charlotte was a firm believer
in the laws of dating feng shui.

214
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,131
change location, change luck.

215
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,633
Why is it always a guy like that?
Is it me?

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,637
No, it's not you.
Into every life a little J.J. must fall.

217
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:35,225
I just want a nice, sweet,
handsome, funny, great guy,

218
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,436
who doesn't say things
like sweet lips.

219
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,605
Is that too much to ask?

220
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,858
Hey, you didn't leave.
You're just over here now.

221
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,778
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I'm not interested.

222
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,322
one drink.
I'll even buy blondie here one.

223
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,368
- one little drink.
- Excuse me. she's not interested.

224
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,329
Am I talking to you?
No. come on...

225
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,956
- You're not listening. The lady said...
- Hey, fuck you.

226
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,007
- I'm sorry about that.
- Did you hurt your hand?

227
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,217
No.

228
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,177
His name was Arthur.

229
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,972
He was a nice, sweet, handsome,
great investment banker

230
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,809
who lived between Madison and Fifth.

231
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,144
so, maybe there
really were white knights.

232
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,903
The day after Charlotte met her knight,
I met my credit card limit.

233
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,031
With no man in sight,
I decided to rescue my ankles

234
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,783
from a life of boredom

235
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,245
by purchasing too many pairs
of Jimmy choo shoes.

236
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,374
Hello, my name is Bill Kelley and
I'm gonna be your city comptroller.

237
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,003
- You're not seriously here.
- I assure you I am.

238
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,340
I brought some voter registration
forms. I filled out your name.

239
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,803
Under occupation I put heartbreaker.
I really did. Look.

240
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,432
You're like a Jehovah's Witness
with a good suit.

241
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,102
- How long have you been here?
- Your number is not listed.

242
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,187
- What did you buy?
- shoes.

243
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,357
Let me see.
sit down and show me.

244
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,861
- God, you are...
- I know.

245
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,117
I'm not showing you a shoe.

246
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,036
sexy.

247
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,622
- Hey, I need a favor.
- You do?

248
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,793
It's for the city of New York.
I really am one of the good guys.

249
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,088
I'm carrying all the boroughs
but I need help with staten lsland.

250
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,342
- You want one?
- No, I had one on Thursday.

251
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,803
Here's the thing.
I gotta go back out there

252
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,431
to do a schmooze
at the capri restaurant

253
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,517
on sunday night
and I want you to go with me.

254
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,897
- And why is that?
- Because they have great ltalian.

255
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:50,861
And also, for the record...
I can't stop thinking about you.

256
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,157
I'll pick you up at 7.:00.

257
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,327
- No.
- Don't answer now. Think about it.

258
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,915
I'll drive by at 7.:00. I'll wait in the car.
If you come, you come.

259
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,043
If you don't, no pressure.
Wear the shoes.

260
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,047
These. pass them.

261
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,469
That saturday, when I was unable to
take Miranda to her laser surgery

262
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,139
due to a looming column deadline,
she didn't call Steve.

263
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,226
she decided to take things
into her own hands.

264
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,437
Who needs a man to hold your hand,
when you have cab fare

265
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,607
and a black marker
to write down emergency numbers?

266
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,276
And while Miranda
was under the knife,

267
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,905
Charlotte was having her first glass
of white wine with her white knight.

268
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,492
I did the Hasty Pudding show
a couple of times, to blow off steam.

269
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,744
My friend Tom
says that Harvard is still

270
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,206
the most aggressive place he's seen.
And he's a trader.

271
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,376
- Not Tom Kennedy?
- Yes, do you know Tom?

272
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:52,381
He's a great guy. And his wife.
That's my idea of a perfect marriage.

273
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,716
Totally.

274
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,302
Charlotte nodded, thinking what
a nice, sweet, handsome,

275
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,221
funny, great couple they made.

276
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,182
Excuse me,
you just bumped into her chair.

277
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,020
- A little crowded.
- Yes, but you bumped her chair.

278
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,230
You should say you're sorry.

279
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,774
- It's Ok.
- No, it's not ok.

280
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,362
- That's no way to treat a lady.
- Lighten up. It's brunch.

281
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:26,373
Charlotte realized that her date wasn't
a man who came to women's rescue,

282
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,376
he was a man who liked to start fights.

283
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,004
- Excuse me, sir...
- You want a piece of me?

284
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,673
And just like that,

285
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,843
Charlotte's white knight
changed into a white nightmare.

286
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,348
Miss Hobbes, your friend is here.

287
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,893
- Carrie?
- Actually no, it's me.

288
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,687
Carrie thought you might need
some help. oK?

289
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm on valium, everything's oK.

290
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,695
- Here, give me your hand.
- I'm good.

291
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,493
Just don't let me hit the door frame
and never mention these goggles.

292
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,666
one cab ride and two sleeping pills
later, Steve put Miranda to bed.

293
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,294
All right. Give me your leg.

294
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,589
No, this leg. I want this leg.

295
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,634
stop! No rescue.

296
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:23,138
Fine, oK. All right!
Put your feet in, sleeping Beauty.

297
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:33,148
The next morning, after what felt like
a hundred years, Miranda awoke.

298
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,661
And for the first time in her life,
she sawthings clearly.

299
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,388
That night, Mr. July invited Samantha
to come down and hang with him

300
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,598
while he worked the sunday shift.

301
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,478
Hello? Where is everyone?

302
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:16,025
The idea being in a firehouse
filled with a calendar hot firemen,

303
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,695
was a fantasy, Samantha felt,
whose time had definitely come.

304
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,904
Boys!

305
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,124
This was not the firehouse fantasy
Samantha had in mind.

306
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,592
Samantha. I just put a pot of chilli on.
come on, sit down.

307
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,762
come on, get up.
Make a move for sam.

308
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,974
I'll be right back.

309
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,102
Samantha's rescue fantasy
was suddenly something

310
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,438
she needed to be rescued from.

311
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:04,865
- It's me, leave a message.
- Hey, I'm still down here in the car.

312
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,411
I'll wait ten more seconds
and then I'll go alone.

313
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:16,710
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, poor me...

314
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:23,550
five, four, three, two...

315
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:29,306
...one. one and a half,
sometimes a girl needs a half.

316
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,269
oK, that was my best shot,
you're not coming.

317
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,649
so long... vote!

318
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,250
- I don't knowwhat I'm doing.
- oK.

319
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:02,006
I'm standing here, fully dressed,
watching that politician guy

320
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,883
drive off to staten lsland
without me. Why?

321
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,804
- You hate staten lsland?
- Don't think so. Any other ideas?

322
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,934
Just say it.

323
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,022
Big. You're terrified
of getting hurt again.

324
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,650
There it was. The phrase single,
independent women in their thirties

325
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,903
are never supposed to think.
Let alone say out loud.

326
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,281
oK, gotta go.

327
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,783
Miranda was right.

328
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,953
I was like a woman frozen
on the ledge of a building on fire.

329
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,956
I'd been so burned
in my last relationship,

330
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,293
I was afraid to leap off
into the next one.

331
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,810
Excuse me for a second.

332
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,814
- Hey. How did you get here?
- Ferry.

333
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,734
- All alone?
- I'm very independent.

334
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:08,489
- I can see that.
- And this isn't a date.

335
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,324
I'm a concerned citizen.

336
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,160
A woman on my block
won't pick up after her poodle.

337
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,122
I'll see what I can do.
can I take your coat?

338
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:24,171
And, Mr. President,
it was a bad break-up.

339
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,675
so I need to take this slow.

340
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,889
somewhere between
the chilli and half-time,

341
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,393
Samantha decided if she wanted
her firehouse fantasy to happen,

342
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,311
she'd have to make it happen.

343
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,355
Up here.

344
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,946
Nice pole.
Wanna see it again?

345
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,072
Yeah.

346
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,205
Samantha rode the pole
a couple of times that night.

347
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,421
Why are these boots set up like this?

348
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,506
so we'll be ready
at a moment's notice.

349
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:13,846
Well, I should be a fireman,
because I am always ready to go.

350
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,934
We've got a job.

351
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,481
Get out of my gear.
Get the fuck out of my gear!

352
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,027
Let's go!
Move, lady, it's a fuckin' fire!

353
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,366
I'm coming.

354
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,174
Samantha learned there's
quite a difference

355
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,552
between a rescue fantasy
and a rescue reality.

356
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,018
It's getting late.
Are you sure I can't give you a ride?

357
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,146
No, I'm good.

358
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,526
You go...
You go and do your thing.

359
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,737
Do I get your vote?

360
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,661
Too fast?

361
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,292
My God, you're so sexy.
come home with me.

362
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,503
Kissing is enough.

363
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,713
It's enough for tonight, really.

364
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,269
oh, shit. It's almost 12:00,
I'm gonna miss the last ferry.

365
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,326
Wait!

366
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,665
Wait!

367
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,420
I lost my choo.

368
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,565
Need a ride?

369
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,945
He didn't have a white horse,

370
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,866
but he did have a BMW
with a working heater.

371
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:43,245
so I guess, sometimes a woman
absolutely has to be rescued.

372
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:48,917
- You're taking me home and that's it.
- That's it...for tonight.

373
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,759
Now, any idea
how we get the fuck off this island?

374
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,677
Ok, make a right.

375
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:03,223
And sometimes, a woman absolutely
has to rescue a man.

376
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,853
At least, that's how it ends
in this staten lsland fairytale.
