1
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:47,439
Good luck, Charles.

2
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,567
Two months into her marriage,

3
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,319
Charlotte's life seemed to be a bed of roses.

4
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,531
That's what it looked like to an onlooker.

5
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:58,158
My boys have been playing each other

6
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,035
since prep school.

7
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,246
They're still not tired of it.

8
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:04,331
Let the girls play.

9
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:08,294
She's wearing pastels. It's whites only.

10
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,256
We can make an exception this one time.

11
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,301
Your father would roll over in his grave

12
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,553
if he heard you talking like that.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,889
Charlotte hasn't been issued

14
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,099
a copy of the MacDougal house rules.

15
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,310
No, but it's time I got one.

16
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:27,813
It's next to the bible, on your bed stand.

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,190
Funny.

18
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,859
Tradition is a very undervalued virtue.

19
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:36,363
Marrying a MacDougal is marrying history.

20
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,700
Yes. I guess I better go change.

21
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,913
Charlotte had no interest in hearing
any more about the family history.

22
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,749
Her history with Trey
was depressing enough.

23
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,879
After a few half-baked attempts at
a fulfilling sex life, Trey seemed to give up.

24
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,758
The only place he even tried to score
was on the tennis court.

25
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,849
- Good morning.
- Morning.

26
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,853
Beautiful roses.

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,980
Thank you.

28
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:28,624
I don't know what it is.
I'm strangely drawn to him.

29
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:33,045
- You know the man can plough.
- He had the most intoxicating scent.

30
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:38,592
Like sweat mixed with something else,
something sweet yet pungent.

31
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,513
- Manure?
- And these full, sensuous lips.

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,767
- Does he water plants in Manhattan?
- I can't be looking at gardeners.

33
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:51,146
What's the point of being in the suburbs,
if you're not gonna fuck a gardener?

34
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:54,149
He was so tanned and muscular.

35
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:59,655
The sweat ran down from his chest
onto his perfectly defined stomach.

36
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:05,202
You read Harlequin Romances in high
school, haunts you the rest of your life.

37
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:08,747
Whatever you do, don't look up.

38
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,308
Oh, my God, did you see
the way she looked at me?

39
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,727
Did you see the look her friend shot us?

40
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:33,522
- Contempt, like I was Pol Pot.
- He's dead.

41
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,359
- She wishes I was.
- Who does she think she is?

42
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,944
Big's wife.

43
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,407
That was awful. I can't believe
that there is a person in New York

44
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:46,035
who could hate me that much.

45
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,829
Oh, God.

46
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,625
I was so devastated
by Natasha's withering look

47
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,337
that I decided
my only recourse was to go shopping.

48
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,215
I took a wrong turn
looking for the right shoes,

49
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:03,844
and south of Houston Street
I literally lost my direction.

50
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:09,225
Excuse me, I know this sounds ridiculous.

51
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,186
Can you tell me
which way is West Broadway?

52
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,313
- Give me your bag.
- What?

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,814
Your bag.

54
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,027
- It's a baguette.
- Let me have it.

55
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,905
I couldn't believe it.
15 years in New York,

56
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,783
and when the city was getting safe,
I got mugged.

57
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,202
- Is this for real?
- Your watch and your ring.

58
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,246
Jesus.

59
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,831
- This won't...
- Come on.

60
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,503
- And your Manolo Blahniks.
- What?

61
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,006
- No.
- Give me your Blahniks.

62
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:45,219
They weren't just after money any more.
They were after fashion.

63
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,930
Please, sir, they're my favourite pair.

64
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:52,685
I got them half price at a sample sale.

65
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,061
Thanks.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,443
Somebody stop him,
he took my strappy sandals.

67
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,404
Somebody...

68
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:05,573
Gross!

69
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:10,119
I've been robbed!

70
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,876
I've been robbed.

71
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:24,508
He said, "Give me your Blahniks",
which I thought was a joke.

72
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:30,347
The next thing I know, I'm barefoot
on a sidewalk in the middle of summer.

73
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:35,186
Is there anything other than the watch,
the bag, the ring, and the shoes?

74
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,146
My dignity.

75
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:43,444
- God, are you all right?
- I'm fine. Thanks for coming.

76
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,113
- I can't believe he took your shoes.
- I know.

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,241
- Probably got trichinosis.
- You only get that from pork.

78
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,870
I'm sure I stepped
on a piece of it somewhere.

79
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:59,293
Detective Stevens, this is my friend,
my lawyer, Miranda Hobbes.

80
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,296
Nice to meet you.
Any chance of catching this guy?

81
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,839
We hope so.

82
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:08,677
Maybe you can come with me
and read him his Miranda rights.

83
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:12,681
- Sorry, that was lame.
- No, it was funny. A little cop humour.

84
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:16,477
- Are you Irish?
- No. Why?

85
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,854
You have beautiful red hair.

86
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,442
Anybody can be Irish
with the right colourist.

87
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:28,322
Very funny. A sense of humour,
I like that in a lawyer. It's very rare.

88
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:34,119
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have something.

89
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:37,122
- Can I have your card?
- Sure.

90
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,750
- Just in case.
- Sure.

91
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,045
Thanks.

92
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,381
I can't wear these.

93
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:47,174
I'll call you.

94
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,599
I don't understand.
I get mugged, and you get him?

95
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,810
I guess that's my karma.

96
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:00,896
He said he'll call.
It doesn't mean he will.

97
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:04,567
What are you talking about?
The man was smitten with you.

98
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:10,197
He probably wants free legal advice.
That's generally my karma.

99
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,785
Samantha discovered that her number
had been passed around as well.

100
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:18,122
This is a message for Sam Jones.
If you're getting this, it's Brian.

101
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,501
I'll see you tomorrow around 10:00.
Can't wait. Later.

102
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:27,548
Sam, are you there?
This is Rob, Mike's friend.

103
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:33,053
You don't know me, but I'll be there
tomorrow with some fine party favourites.

104
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,149
- Sam?
- Yes, this is Sam.

105
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,444
- Sam Jones?
- Yes. Who is this?

106
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:52,531
The Sam Jones who's having
the big party tomorrow night?

107
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:55,534
Exactly who is this Sam Jones?

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,038
And where is this fabulous party?

109
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:02,875
The next evening,
Miranda had a date with my detective.

110
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,471
I'm having an anxiety attack.

111
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,933
The most gorgeous man I've met
is in my living room.

112
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,852
- I can't figure out what to wear.
- Breathe.

113
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,522
Shut your eyes,
and go with your first instinct.

114
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:30,069
I've been in here for 20 minutes.
By now he thinks I'm a freak.

115
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,076
I'll be right there.

116
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,788
What are you so worked up about?

117
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:45,209
He's too good-looking for me.
I don't have any outfits that go with Hunk.

118
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,711
Wait. Maybe this is karma.

119
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:51,674
- You're finally getting what you deserve.
- Right.

120
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:55,719
Maybe after years of odd men,
the universe is throwing me a bone.

121
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,930
If you're lucky, a boner as well.

122
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:03,143
- OK, I can do this.
- Now go and have fun.

123
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,438
Tell Detective Stevens,
if he sees a woman

124
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:12,194
wearing last year's pink Blahnik sandals,
bring her in for questioning immediately.

125
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:23,581
While I ascribed thoughts about karma
to the fortune cookie school of psychology,

126
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:28,586
I wondered, does a string of bad dates
equal one good one?

127
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:32,089
And will treating someone badly
in one relationship ensure

128
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:34,967
that you'll be treated badly in the next?

129
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,803
Does everything that goes around
come around?

130
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,849
If so, will it come around
to bite you in the ass?

131
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,769
Is there such a thing as
relationship karma?

132
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:53,277
Later, I accompanied Samantha to a party
thrown by the mysterious Sam Jones.

133
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:56,113
I can't believe we're going
to the party of a total stranger.

134
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,158
It's not a total stranger,
we do share the same name.

135
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,452
Why are you walking so slow?

136
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,747
I keep waiting for someone
to jump out and steal my bra.

137
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:09,251
If the guy's a loser, I'll tell him
to stop having his friends call me,

138
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:13,214
and we'll go for dinner. If not, who knows.
His friend sounded cute.

139
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,925
- How can you tell over the phone?
- I can.

140
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,720
Besides, Washington Square -
very money address.

141
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,766
I feel like there's
some cosmic purpose to all this.

142
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,727
It's too much of a coincidence.

143
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:31,357
What was the cosmic purpose
of my getting snubbed by Natasha?

144
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:36,153
If I told you I had a piece of information
about Big and Natasha,

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,949
would you consider it a cosmic connection
or a random act of gossip?

146
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,034
I'd have to hear it first.

147
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:49,375
Natasha left Big. Their marriage is over.
She's back to working for Ralph Lauren.

148
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:53,212
Oh, my God. Who told you that?

149
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,133
- A little bird I fucked at Ralph Lauren.
- You waited 15 blocks to tell me that?

150
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,052
I wanted you to have fun.

151
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:03,472
I can't believe I'm responsible
for breaking up their marriage.

152
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,726
You're not. It probably wouldn't
have worked anyway.

153
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:12,064
- I don't think I could feel any worse.
- Here we are.

154
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:17,778
- It's a dorm.
- Look at that, I feel worse.

155
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:28,247
Do you think
these cute boys are still in college?

156
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,957
Yes.

157
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:35,754
I'm going to find Sam Jones,
and then we're outta here.

158
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:41,051
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I can find Sam Jones?

159
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,439
- Sam Jones?
- Yeah. Who are you?

160
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,901
- Sam Jones.
- Excuse me?

161
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:00,112
It appears that we have a problem here.

162
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,784
We have the same name,
and I'm getting all your fucking calls.

163
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,539
If you're getting all my "fucking" calls,
that explains why I'm still a virgin.

164
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,711
While Samantha was wondering what
message the universe was sending her,

165
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,838
Miranda had no doubt.

166
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,341
This was fun, and I would invite you in,

167
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,385
but you've been in,
and I have a huge day tomorrow,

168
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:29,308
which isn't to say that I wouldn't like to see
you again. I would, if you'd like to see me...

169
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,984
I'll call you.

170
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:52,498
She felt like she had
just hit the cosmic jackpot.

171
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,795
Please don't tell anyone we were here.

172
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,005
Some of those boys were cute.

173
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,551
- Some of them were young enough to...
- Don't you dare say it.

174
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,846
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Excuse me, mom.

175
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,727
Cab!

176
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:18,148
Natasha fell down the stairs,
now I fall down the stairs.

177
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:21,443
This is an open and shut case
of karmic retribution.

178
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,822
- It was an accident.
- This was not an accident.

179
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,032
Yesterday, I get mugged,

180
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,579
and now I can't even get a taxi - and I can
always get a taxi. My karma is shot.

181
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:35,499
If everything happens for a reason,
why am I getting calls for Sam Jones?

182
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,461
- What's the karmic connection?
- I only know about my own karma.

183
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,922
Maybe I should fuck that virgin

184
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,467
and give him the great first-time
experience that I never had.

185
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,971
That's not karma,
that's statutory rape.

186
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,641
Here, here.

187
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,351
Come on.

188
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:55,895
What's up?

189
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:01,442
Meanwhile, across town, Charlotte was
getting a message of her own.

190
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,272
Wake up.

191
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,444
You had a nightmare.

192
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,703
You're all wet.

193
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:01,919
Later that week, my knee still hurting
from my trip down the stairs,

194
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:04,755
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

195
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:09,510
- Ralph Lauren, Natasha's desk.
- I'd like to speak to Natasha, please.

196
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:13,472
- It's Carrie Bradshaw calling.
- What's this regarding?

197
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,600
- It's personal.
- Hold.

198
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,563
I didn't know how to tell an assistant
it was of cosmic significance.

199
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,940
- She's in a meeting.
- I'll hold.

200
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,694
I don't mean to be rude,
but you'll be holding forever.

201
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,822
OK then, I'll hold forever.

202
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,534
This wasn't gonna be easy.
I had tough karma to overcome.

203
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:41,417
The next week,
Charlotte flirted with her own karma.

204
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,963
Where did you get such a green thumb?

205
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,551
Runs in the family.
We're gardeners for three generations.

206
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,596
What a wonderful tradition.

207
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:57,933
I'm Charlotte, by the way. Trey's wife.

208
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,978
I know. I'm Burt.

209
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:06,775
These roses are so beautiful.
What kind are they?

210
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:11,155
A special hybrid of American Beauty.

211
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:13,574
They're very fragrant.

212
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:20,664
Charlotte's karma flirted back
in a most unexpected way.

213
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:40,351
Downtown, Samantha was working out
some karmic issues of her own.

214
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,437
I came over to apologise for all those calls.

215
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:48,567
Thank you.
Anything else?

216
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,820
I've been waiting
for a woman like you my whole life.

217
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:54,782
You are the hottest thing I've ever seen.

218
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:25,437
Oh, Lord. Oh, my Lord!

219
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,981
Here we go.

220
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,043
That was awesome.

221
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,129
Yes, it was.

222
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:54,133
Sam?

223
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,053
- Yes, Sam?
- I think I love you.

224
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:03,309
Honey, that wasn't love.

225
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:05,728
That was sex.

226
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,023
No, ma'am. I...

227
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,192
I love you.

228
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,655
Time to move.

229
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:24,371
- Do I have to?
- Oh, yes. I've got stuff to do.

230
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,586
Goodbye to the sweetest lips
I've ever kissed.

231
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,174
Bye-bye.

232
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:40,221
Later, the MacDougals
were enjoying their cocktail hour,

233
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,599
which generally lasted
from 5:00 pm to last man standing.

234
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:47,603
- I beat you three sets in a row.
- We didn't finish.

235
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,023
- It was getting dark as you recall.
- Stop bickering.

236
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,192
- Sandwiches, ma'am?
- No.

237
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,902
No, thank you.

238
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,405
I certainly had an interesting day.

239
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:03,452
I went riding. In the afternoon,
I took a walk around the property

240
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,664
and saw Charlotte kissing the gardener.

241
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:13,546
Charlotte, you're a MacDougal now.

242
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:25,891
Samantha discovered that the universe
had sent her many messages.

243
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,061
You have 35 new messages.

244
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:33,274
It's Sam Jones. Call me.
I can't stop thinking about you.

245
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:40,030
I have to see you tonight.
It's really important.

246
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:46,328
Sam, it's Sam. I don't think
I can live without you, OK?

247
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:54,920
Are you there, babe? I have to see
you tonight. It's really important.

248
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,675
OK, Sam. It's Sam.

249
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:04,138
Across town, Miranda met
her karmic treasure for dinner.

250
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,849
After ten years,
I made partner two months ago.

251
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:09,768
Or was it three? I'm losing track.

252
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,687
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

253
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:16,150
- Can I get you another drink?
- Another double vodka martini, please.

254
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:20,196
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

255
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,533
- Would you care to order?
- Could we have a minute?

256
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,870
Take your time.

257
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:32,708
I thought about law school.
I loved Columbo so much as a kid...

258
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:37,463
Miranda realised that every woman
was staring at her date.

259
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,966
Your friend is the typical case
that I see on the job.

260
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,720
It's not as exciting as you might think.
It's not homicide...

261
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:51,435
She knew what they were thinking -
what is that attractive man doing with her?

262
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:54,688
If your friend hadn't lost her shoes,
I wouldn't be here.

263
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:58,025
There you go.

264
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,027
Thank you.

265
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:04,740
She drank to feel better about herself.

266
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,961
Six vodka martinis later,
she was feeling pretty damn good.

267
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,130
- You're hot.
- And you're a little drunk.

268
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,133
I'm fine. I'm great.

269
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,846
Hot, hot, hot.

270
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,516
You may be the most beautiful man
that I've ever been with.

271
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,726
You're not bad yourself.

272
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:37,523
I'm no Mena Suvari,
but I'm great in bed.

273
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:47,867
When Trey didn't come to bed that night,
Charlotte went looking for him.

274
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:01,130
- What are you doing out here?
- lmproving my serve.

275
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:06,886
Stop. You're upset,
and what I did was so wrong.

276
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:09,430
- I'm sorry.
- What can I say?

277
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,516
I'm unable to meet your needs,
so from time to time,

278
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:17,813
as much as I detest it,
I'm going to have to look the other way.

279
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,441
I don't want a husband
who looks the other way.

280
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:24,320
I want a husband who makes me
not want to kiss the gardener.

281
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,417
No marriage is perfect.

282
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,922
So much of what we have is wonderful.

283
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:47,551
We can have separate lives
and still be together.

284
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:50,429
It's totally acceptable.

285
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:56,936
As Charlotte looked at her perfect husband
at their family's perfect country house,

286
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:59,355
she realised,
the one thing that was missing

287
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:03,400
was that perfect connection
with an imperfect person.

288
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:10,950
When we get back to the city,
I think we should separate for a while.

289
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,913
All righty.

290
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,924
Seven unreturned phone calls,
and still no response from Natasha.

291
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:30,970
The Buddhists believe you pay for
what you do wrong in this life in the next.

292
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:35,266
I knew what I'd done. I just didn't think
I could wait a lifetime to be forgiven.

293
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:48,362
The next morning, Miranda woke up
with the worst hangover of her life.

294
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:55,286
Detective Stevens?

295
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,463
On her hall table, she discovered
that Detective Stevens had left a number...

296
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:10,009
...for her local AA chapter.

297
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,888
Samantha got her karmic retribution.

298
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:16,974
I love you, Sam Jones.

299
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:20,811
In screwing Sam Jones,
she wound up screwing herself.

300
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,230
I love you, Sam Jones.

301
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:31,530
A couple of days later,
Charlotte came home to her old apartment.

302
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:37,077
It was good fortune that she had only
sublet it, not to mention good sense.

303
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,501
Not wanting to come back
in my next life as a dung beetle,

304
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,754
I asked Samantha's assistant
to pump Natasha's assistant

305
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,882
to find out where she was having lunch.

306
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:03,187
I need to talk to you.

307
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,398
- I'm gonna scream.
- I'm only gonna stay a minute.

308
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:08,734
I tried to call you at work, but...

309
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:12,238
Anyway, it's not important.

310
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,951
Can I have a sip of this?

311
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,087
Thanks.

312
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:36,345
I heard about your marriage.

313
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,142
It's just so terrible.

314
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:45,813
I never meant for any of this to happen.

315
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,359
If there was something
I could do to take it away, I would.

316
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,819
But I can't.

317
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:58,117
I came here today
because I needed to say how sorry I am.

318
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:02,788
I am deeply sorry for what I did to you.

319
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,457
It was wrong.

320
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,335
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:15,050
Are you through?

322
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:19,138
Yes. Thank you for listening.

323
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:24,894
Wait.

324
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,897
I'm sorry too.

325
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:31,150
You are?

326
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:35,321
Yes. I'm sorry about it all.

327
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:41,744
I'm sorry he moved to Paris
and fell in love with me.

328
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:44,622
I'm sorry that we ever got married.

329
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:49,168
I'm sorry he cheated on me with you,

330
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:53,506
and I'm sorry that I pretended
to ignore it for as long as I did.

331
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:57,843
I'm sorry I found you in my apartment,

332
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,763
fell down the stairs and broke my tooth.

333
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:05,851
I'm very sorry
that after much painful dental surgery

334
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:09,480
this tooth is still
a different colour than this tooth.

335
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:15,986
Finally, I'm sorry that you felt
the need to come down here.

336
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:20,449
Not only have you ruined my marriage,

337
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:23,410
you've ruined my lunch.

338
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:30,209
That's just what I had to say.

339
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,547
I was just leaving.

340
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:43,389
I realised, my actions had set into motion
a karmic chain of events

341
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:46,559
that put Natasha
back on the singles market.

342
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:49,520
As if single women
didn't have it hard enough.

343
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:04,660
Somewhere out there,
Big was alone again.

344
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:07,288
The universe may not always play fair,

345
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,958
but at least it's got
a hell of a sense of humour.
