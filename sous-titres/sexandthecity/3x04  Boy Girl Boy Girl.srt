1
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,137
It's been said that New Yorkers

2
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,680
are the most jaded people
in the world.

3
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,081
The fact is we've done and seen it all.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,621
It takes quite a bit to shock us.

5
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,053
So when Charlotte
said that her new show

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,164
at the gallery would blow us away,

7
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,028
we took it with the proverbial grain
of salt.

8
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,864
Seriously, that's a woman?

9
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,201
It was the latest installation
from photographer Baird Johnson,

10
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,865
entitled "Drag Kings -

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,705
"The collision of illusion and reality".

12
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,313
Yep, that's a woman.

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,513
Look at that bulge, it's shocking.

14
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,779
Hurry up and look
before Giuliani shuts it down.

15
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,446
- What do you think?
- It's amazing.

16
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,057
Congratulations.

17
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,492
Women dressed as men are popular.

18
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,687
I thought it was "Pokémon".

19
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:43,359
All it takes is stick-on
sideburns and a sock in your pants.

20
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,403
That's some sock.

21
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,631
I've always had a thing for cowboys.

22
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,776
Reminder, John Wayne is a Jane.

23
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,641
I'm attracted to her.
Maybe I'm a lesbian.

24
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,749
I dated a guy who liked to wear
my underwear.

25
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,817
But I've never gone the other way.

26
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,819
If you're gay you can wear
everyone's underwear.

27
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,182
That's hygienic?

28
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,450
Being a drag king would be fun.

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,756
I have enough trouble trying to be
a woman in a man's world,

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,229
without being a woman
pretending to be a man.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,595
You wouldn't have to wax.

32
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,600
If you change your mind,

33
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,864
you've got cop written all over you.

34
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,171
- Am I rich yet?
- Getting there.

35
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,074
Everyone. This is Baird, the artist.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,770
These are my friends.

37
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,916
What inspired you to do this?

38
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,451
I feel we have dual powers
within each of us.

39
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,887
Men can be very female,
and women can be very male.

40
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:43,722
Gender's an illusion.
Sometimes a very beautiful illusion.

41
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,362
You know,
I'm gonna go and get a canapé.

42
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,402
Because, I'm starved, so...

43
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,268
Not that a canapé is a meal.
But, you know... in a pinch.

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,272
Excuse us.

45
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,352
What was that about?
Nobody loves canapés that much.

46
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,148
He makes me nervous.
I think he is...

47
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,293
- Ask him out.
- I can never make the first move.

48
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,430
Sounds like someone needs
a sock in the pants.

49
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,624
I'll drag myself home.
You wanna share a cab?

50
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,632
No, I'm meeting Sean.

51
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,465
- The young guy?
- He's not that young.

52
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,370
He's 26. His generation
has a different letter than ours.

53
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,171
Who cares? Age is an illusion.

54
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,712
- Good night.
- Good night.

55
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,876
Later, Miranda found her apartment

56
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,044
had undergone
its own gender transformation.

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,588
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,386
I got a key from when I fed your cat.
I ordered us Chinese.

59
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,121
I didn't think
we were seeing each other tonight.

60
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:55,563
- Planning on seeing the other boy?
- Now you've ruined that...

61
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,361
This is what we're watching?

62
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,403
Give me that.

63
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,336
Easy, you're making my brain hurt.

64
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,538
Don't you have to work tonight?

65
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,049
Not until 10:00.
I've got stuff here I can change into.

66
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,777
Right.

67
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,649
But I got till 10:00.

68
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,959
Miranda loved the man inside of her.

69
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,597
She just didn't love him inside
her apartment all the time.

70
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,189
Come on, the ice waits for no woman.

71
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,196
I'm practicing my triple salchow
in my head.

72
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,367
I was dragged around by Sean,
my "generation-something-else" date.

73
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,668
We met at a party, celebrating a new
Internet magazine Sean was running

74
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,334
that I still couldn't find
on my computer.

75
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,210
Seriously, stop!

76
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,214
It's easier to balance
when you're not smoking.

77
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,354
Smoking is the only thing
that keeps me balanced.

78
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,448
Doesn't this place rock?

79
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,626
You have to give me credit
for an original date.

80
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,822
It's not officially a date
without cocktails.

81
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,495
My coach is gonna kill me.

82
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:52,515
Half a flask later, Sean and I had
broken the ice... at least my ass had.

83
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:57,622
- That last fall was at least a 9.2.
- You and the Russian judge... tough.

84
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,786
There was something about him.
He was sexy, charming... coordinated.

85
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,194
Nothing about him
or our third date felt typical.

86
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,360
When was your last
serious relationship?

87
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:16,133
Until then... there it was.
The inevitable third-date question.

88
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,402
Bad question?

89
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,007
You wanna take another spin
around the death rink?

90
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
No, it's fine. It's fine.

91
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,147
I ended something a while ago.

92
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,349
Two years of a lot of back and forths.
We weren't Y2K compatible.

93
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,958
What about you?

94
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,097
Before you there was Kayla.
Neurotic. Lasted a year.

95
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,701
Before her, Lesley, couldn't commit.
Before Lesley there was Mark.

96
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,596
Is that a problem?

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,309
He's a bisexual.

98
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,242
I could have told you that.
He took you ice-skating.

99
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,316
The weird thing is he was so open.

100
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:03,251
"Hi. I'm a bisexual."
Like, "Hi, I'm from Colorado".

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,653
You're not allowed
to be bisexual in Colorado.

102
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,261
"Is that a problem?"
What kind of question is that?

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,954
- Of course!
- What did you say?

104
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,659
That it wasn't a problem.
He's such a good kisser.

105
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,328
That generation
is all about sexual experimentation.

106
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,633
All the kids are going bi.

107
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,004
If they all jump off a bridge,
you will too?

108
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,873
I'm a "try-sexual".
I'll try anything once.

109
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,778
When did this happen?
When did the sexes get all confused?

110
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,751
Somewhere between Gen X and Y,
they blended and made XY.

111
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:40,382
I did the "date the bisexual guy"
thing in college.

112
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,792
- They all ended up with men.
- So did the bisexual women.

113
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,127
Which is why there
are no men left for us.

114
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:54,570
Maybe I do have a problem
with this. I'm an old fart.

115
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,208
Correction: A hot old fart.

116
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,844
I'm not even sure bisexuality exists.

117
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,106
It's just a layover
on the way to Gaytown.

118
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,046
Isn't that next to Ricky Martinville?

119
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:11,655
It's great. He's open to all sexual
experiences. He's evolved. It's hot.

120
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,725
It's greedy.
He's double-dipping.

121
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,127
You're not marrying him, you're
making out with him. Forget the label.

122
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,629
You're right.

123
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,067
I'm very into labels. Gay. Straight.
Pick a side and stay there.

124
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,400
Where are you going?

125
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,737
Home. I've got a date
with my remote control.

126
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:37,315
Steve's playing basketball.
That's three hours of alone time.

127
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:42,045
- What about my problem?
- Stop kissing him.

128
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,252
Easy for her to say.

129
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,187
That night, I couldn't get
Samantha's words out of my head.

130
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,797
Was Sean's generation
on to something?

131
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,456
Was sexual flipping
the wave of the future?

132
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,469
If it was, could I play that game
or was I over the hill?

133
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,802
If women can transform into men,
and men into women

134
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,967
and we can sleep with everyone,

135
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,908
then maybe gender
doesn't exist anymore.

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,676
If we can take the best
of the other sex and make it our own,

137
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,821
has the opposite sex
become obsolete?

138
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:21,085
Don't bust my balls. If you're a
head-hunter, get me a good assistant.

139
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,821
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a Mrs. Jones.

140
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,194
- It's Miss.
- I'm here for the assistant job.

141
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,996
Please, come in.

142
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,872
Samantha hired Matt
five minutes later.

143
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,843
She was the man of the office,
but she could fit one more.

144
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,074
Meanwhile downtown, Charlotte
could have used some help herself.

145
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,617
Someone is being industrious.

146
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,083
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

147
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,159
I thought I'd come by
and scare the shit out of you.

148
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,455
Pick up my cheque
for the pieces I sold.

149
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,368
- Here.
- Thanks.

150
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,631
There's something else.
I've been thinking about this.

151
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,174
I would love you to pose for me.

152
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,210
- As a man?
- Yeah, you'd be great.

153
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,910
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?

154
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,883
- I'm not...
- A model?

155
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,853
No, butch.

156
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,518
You'd be surprised.
Every woman has a male inside.

157
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,525
Even you.

158
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,594
No, not me.

159
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,566
I'm really bad at math and I can't
change a tire to save my life.

160
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,639
Pose for me.
I'll get it out of you.

161
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,535
Come on, be a man.

162
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,885
The next night, Sean and I went to a
club so new, even I hadn't heard of it.

163
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,781
- What's the name of this place?
- "Hair".

164
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,394
- Like the musical.
- Like the stuff on your head.

165
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,498
- You're too cool for me.
- You're too cute for me.

166
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,333
Ten seconds of kissing and I almost
forgot his lack of sexual orientation.

167
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,168
Until we stopped kissing.

168
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,040
Who are you checking out,
the guy or the girl?

169
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,412
I was looking for the bathroom.

170
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,447
Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.

171
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:37,554
Sorry, this whole bisexual thing
is throwing me for a loop.

172
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,663
You've been with men and women...

173
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,902
Were you just looking at that guy?

174
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,506
I'm looking at you.

175
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,370
I'm with you. I dig you.

176
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,174
- "Dig" is in again?
- So is "groovy". You're that too.

177
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,010
So, you're not gay?

178
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:03,212
I've been in three major relationships.
One was a guy. That's just me.

179
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,132
An hour later, Sean was in my bed.

180
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,433
That's just me.

181
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,636
- Nice floor.
- Thanks. It's a rental.

182
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,143
- What?
- Nothing.

183
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,288
Tell me or I'll make you
go skating again.

184
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:50,294
- Do I kiss better than a guy?
- Better than any I've kissed.

185
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,801
How about me?

186
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,640
- Top two per cent.
- I'll take that.

187
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,984
If there was this good-Iooking guy
walking towards you

188
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,723
and across the street
was a beautiful girl, which one...

189
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,867
Carrie, come on.

190
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,969
Could you stop making this
all about sex?

191
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,868
It's not. It's about the person... you.

192
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,009
I'm crazy about you.

193
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,202
The way you smell.

194
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,846
The way your upper lip tastes.

195
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:43,781
It may not have been all about sex,
but it was for the next two hours.

196
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,023
I wasn't the only one
with younger men on the brain.

197
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:54,030
Listen to me. We've called
your boss three times already.

198
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
Give him that message.

199
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,199
Hello.
What are you doing?

200
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,638
- That is not how I do business.
- She makes me crazy.

201
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,109
These are important clients.
Don't talk to them like that.

202
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,078
You want them to call you?

203
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,616
Let me remind you
that I am the boss here.

204
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:19,019
Fire me. I just think
you deserve some respect.

205
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,093
Put this file away.

206
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,164
Samantha found Matt's boyish
arrogance annoying,

207
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,634
unprofessional... and incredibly hot.

208
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:41,004
Miranda was having a problem
sharing a space with the other sex.

209
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,406
What?

210
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:51,050
- What's going on?
- You're on my side.

211
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,659
My pillow.
My guest pillow.

212
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,521
OK, I'll tell you what.

213
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:03,725
Tomorrow we'll buy some paint
and draw a line down the middle.

214
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,271
Go to sleep.

215
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,382
That pile. Your stuff.
You have to keep it neater.

216
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,552
Maybe if you can spare a drawer
I can keep my things out of the way.

217
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,658
You want a drawer?

218
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,090
Actually...

219
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,633
I'd like to move in.

220
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,898
Most single women
dream of this moment.

221
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,474
Most single women but Miranda.

222
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,945
Wow! OK.

223
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,313
Where did that come from?

224
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,644
I've been thinking about it.

225
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,717
We have a great time.
We're practically live together...

226
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,823
Yeah, but we're not.

227
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,191
Look.

228
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,026
We just started dating again.

229
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,728
There is no need to go at warp speed.
Nobody's dying.

230
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,931
I'm sure every book
would say we're not ready.

231
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,201
You're here all the time.

232
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,847
No problem. I'll get out of your hair.
I'll leave the key.

233
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,246
No! Don't leave the key.
Take the key.

234
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,752
I just... I need my space.
I feel like I'm being suffocated.

235
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,826
Jesus, Miranda...

236
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,563
It's like you're the guy sometimes.

237
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,701
Faced with relationship problems,
some women turn to fried food.

238
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:51,332
Miranda turned to the latest fitness
craze - "The Goddess Workout".

239
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,913
Ladies, open up your chakras.
Let the inner goddess sing.

240
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,444
She's in there.
All you have to do is let her out.

241
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,920
- This helps you to be a woman?
- I must find my inner goddess.

242
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,719
And pop your hip. Pop your hip.

243
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,624
Open yourself like a lotus flower.

244
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,524
Come on, pop your hip.

245
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,200
Pop your hip.

246
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:24,666
- My hips don't pop, I'm a guy.
- You're insane.

247
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,576
This isn't helping me find my inner
goddess, only my inner humiliation.

248
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,615
And reach back.
Reach for the stars.

249
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,150
We're out of here.

250
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,057
I'm never gonna be a girly girl.
I never will.

251
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,328
- I'll never be a lotus flower.
- Thank God.

252
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,938
A girly girl would want
her boyfriend to move in.

253
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,199
She also wears make-up to the gym.

254
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,537
And makes little hearts
above her "i's".

255
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,013
I do love him... I do.

256
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,745
- I know.
- What's my problem?

257
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,152
In any relationship
one person is the alpha dog.

258
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,693
The one in charge... that's you.
You don't like sharing your water dish.

259
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,889
- I'm very free with the chew toys.
- That you are.

260
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,731
Miranda arrived home later
to an empty apartment.

261
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,502
And for the first time,
she really didn't like it.

262
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,173
While Miranda and I worked out
our inner goddesses,

263
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,147
Baird was working the male
out of Charlotte.

264
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,345
You look great.

265
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,955
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

266
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,389
Just relax. Let it go.
Forget Charlotte.

267
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,662
You're a man now. You're a hot guy.
You can get any woman you want.

268
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,365
You're rich, you're powerful.
You eat guys like me for lunch.

269
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,134
How are you feeling now?

270
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,210
I think I need a bigger sock.

271
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,309
I think you do, too.

272
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,761
Better?

273
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,140
Much.

274
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,802
Who knows whether it was the sock
or the suit or Baird.

275
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,976
Charlotte wasn't just a chick with
a dick, she was a chick with balls.

276
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,863
The two alpha dogs at Samantha's
were not getting along as well.

277
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,366
These invitations need to go
to the printers ASAP.

278
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,333
I'll get to it.

279
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,338
Now. Drop them at 72nd Street
then pick up lunch.

280
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,341
They're in opposite directions.
I'll get lunch first.

281
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,675
- Invitations first.
- Fine, then I'll be an hour late.

282
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,941
Do you realize you're my assistant?

283
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,813
Your job is to do what I say.

284
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,286
- I know what I'm doing.
- And I know better.

285
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,550
- Say's who?
- Me.

286
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,389
- Who do you think you are?
- Your boss.

287
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,558
Samantha Jones' PR.

288
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,431
I don't know when she will.
She's been busy.

289
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,974
You have a shitty attitude too.
And your parties suck.

290
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,413
The bad news is, you're fired.

291
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,039
The good news is...
now I can fuck you.

292
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:57,052
The only place Samantha and Matt
worked well together was in bed.

293
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,053
Fuck me on the desk.

294
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,622
- On the chair.
- No, on the desk.

295
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,060
With Sam on top, naturally.

296
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,961
That night,
Miranda invited Steve for pasta.

297
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,574
- Hi. I'm late. I know I'm late.
- It's OK.

298
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,336
I was gonna make you dinner,

299
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,378
and then this conference call
went over two hours.

300
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,950
I went to the market. I needed extra
virgin olive oil. They only had virgin.

301
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:32,419
I don't know the difference.
I don't cook. So I got the stuff in a jar.

302
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,155
Don't move. It's glass.

303
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,828
I can't. I can't do this.

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,596
- We'll order pizza, it's no big deal.
- It's a big fucking deal.

305
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:51,835
I just spilled Marinara sauce
and you saw that. I drop things, OK?

306
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,979
OK. So do I.

307
00:21:56,581 --> 00:22:00,540
I do love you. But I've never
lived with anybody before.

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,612
And I'm stubborn.
And I like the remote.

309
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,781
And I can't cook.

310
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:12,221
I don't do laundry sometimes for
two weeks. And my sponges smell.

311
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,798
You're gonna see all that.
I'm scared.

312
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,967
I don't know if I can move forward,
but I don't want to lose you.

313
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,840
OK.

314
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,977
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:44,195
I'm crying on your shoulder.
I guess I really am a woman.

316
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,798
A week later, Miranda's man
moved into her place.

317
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,493
The same day that Charlotte
moved her man into her place.

318
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,695
She never saw Baird again.

319
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,739
She was too embarrassed
at how forward she'd been.

320
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:02,209
She might have been that type
of guy but never that type of woman.

321
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:09,212
80 blocks downtown, five flights up,
Sean and I were almost at the party.

322
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,186
One more floor, I promise.

323
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,258
If there's no vodka, it's your head.

324
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,724
Take it easy, dude, we're here.

325
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,194
OK, dude.

326
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,730
- Who's party is this?
- Mark's.

327
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,374
Mark, ex-boyfriend Mark?

328
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,339
Is that a problem?

329
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,775
It's his boyfriend's birthday.

330
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,179
It was definitely a first.

331
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,582
I was attending a party
of my boyfriend's ex-boyfriend.

332
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,585
And his boyfriend.

333
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,119
Carrie, this is Mark
and his boyfriend Garth.

334
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,194
- Partner.
- This is our baby, Isabell.

335
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,727
Two "L's", no "E".

336
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,231
OK. Happy birthday.

337
00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:01,701
- This is Dawn and Grace.
- They just got married in Hawaii.

338
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,738
Congratulations.

339
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,837
- It was a spur of the moment.
- I didn't want another big wedding.

340
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:13,110
- It wasn't so bad.
- Being married to you sucked.

341
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,743
- You two were...
- Married. For a year.

342
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,857
We were high for most of it,
otherwise it would've been miserable.

343
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,823
Don't forget I gave you that egg.

344
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,963
This is our straight friend, Joel.

345
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,194
- Are you wearing pleather?
- Thank you for noticing.

346
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,827
An hour later,
I had almost got it straight.

347
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,134
Grace once dated Brett.

348
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,677
- And Brett used to live with Joel?
- Semi-platonically.

349
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,941
- You slept with Dawn.
- Before she was with Mark.

350
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,276
Naturally.

351
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:51,718
Gay, bi, straight. This party was
a platter of sexual orientation.

352
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,955
Time to play.

353
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,730
- Play what?
- Spin the bottle.

354
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,903
Seventh grade spin the bottle?

355
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,302
- Play. It's fun.
- Come on, it's fun.

356
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,921
Get a room.

357
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,563
Get a dental dam.

358
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,360
- It's a girl. Try again.
- It's OK.

359
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:09,296
Of course it was. I was in
Alice-In-Confused-Sexuality Land.

360
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:17,903
I had a choice. I could stand up,
walk out and prove I was an old fart.

361
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,600
Or I could fall down the rabbit hole.

362
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:53,201
So I fell. It wasn't bad.
Kind of like chicken.

363
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:02,479
- Where are you going? It's your spin.
- Just more cigarettes.

364
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,017
That was the last night I saw Sean.

365
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:13,221
They could do what they wanted,
but I was too old to play this game.

366
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,599
So I took my hot, old fart-ass home.

367
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,762
That's just me.
