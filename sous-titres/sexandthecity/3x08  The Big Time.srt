1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,710
Manhattan is a place

2
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,819
you can get anything anytime.

3
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,812
Cabs at 2:00 am.

4
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,427
Chinese food at 3:00.

5
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,366
But you can't get your dry-cleaning.

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,181
Charlotte was spending
her time with Trey,

7
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,250
a doctor from family money

8
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,012
who had it all.

9
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,147
AII, but all of Charlotte.

10
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,727
Apparently Trey was one New Yorker

11
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,694
not getting everything anytime.

12
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,402
Trey is so thoughtful.

13
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,436
I wasn't feeling well last night...

14
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,199
so he took me for some soup

15
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,467
on 7th street and then we went to 2nd.

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,576
Avenue?

17
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,836
Base.

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,880
Then did your physics homework with you?

19
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,880
No, I wanna take it slow.

20
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,882
He could be the one.

21
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,681
You've only known him for two weeks.

22
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,790
You can know his e-mail address,

23
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,892
but not that he's the one.

24
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,894
I just know. And it's really hard,
because he's very sexy.

25
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,056
But I don't want to
ruin it by having sex too early.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
Oh, so you're everything-but-girl.

27
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,737
I like to think of it as...
kissing with extras.

28
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,398
How very ninth grade of you.

29
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,673
I read that if you don't have sex
for a year you can be revirginized.

30
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,842
And probably quite frisky.

31
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,387
But isn't it great? You can erase
your sexual past and start again.

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,083
Who wants their virginity back?
It was bad enough the first time.

33
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,352
How old were you?

34
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,192
Eleventh grade. Seth Bateman.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,092
His smelly rec room.

36
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,226
Half a joint, three thrusts, finito.

37
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,203
And ps, it was on the ping-pong table.

38
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,706
Meanwhile, I was doing
everything plus with Aidan.

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,645
I couldn't get out of bed with him.

40
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:08,049
My bed was our restaurant,
our entertainment, our little New York.

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,122
Open 24 hours.

42
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,462
When will they send
a search party for us?

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,401
- I guess spring thaw.
- That's an awful long time, my friend.

44
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,338
Downtown another New Yorker
was enjoying her full life.

45
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,848
Samantha had a new apartment
in the ultra chic Meatpacking District

46
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,545
and a new admirer.

47
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,213
Well, there goes the neighborhood.

48
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,422
Len Schneider, 4A.

49
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,924
- I collect art.
- Samantha Jones, 2D.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,501
- I guess you collect compliments.
- Oh, Len. Stop.

51
00:03:55,635 --> 00:04:00,231
Really, Len. Stop.
If you'll excuse me.

52
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,139
Listen, I would love to have you
come up to my place tonight.

53
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,075
I make a mean wine spritzer.

54
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,841
I don't think so. Sorry.

55
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,282
Samantha said sorry
but what she really meant was...

56
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,216
Since when is it acceptable

57
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,324
for over-the-hill losers to ask out
hot women like her?

58
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,393
I'm keeping you
on neighborhood watch.

59
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,625
And just when Samantha thought
her day couldn't get any worse...

60
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,629
This is a catalogue
for pre-menopausal women.

61
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,467
"New Transitions."
Nice name.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,236
Why don't they call it what it is?
J. Crew for women who are drying up.

63
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,506
FYI, I'm not transitioning.
I'm happening.

64
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,343
You're on the wrong mailing list.

65
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,850
I shouldn't have signed up for that
"Mirabella" trial subscription.

66
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:51,514
I bought a back pillow on line and
ended up with catalogues for trusses.

67
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,185
- You got a back pillow?
- At I'm getting old. Com.

68
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,321
Maybe I could interest you
in vaginal lubrication suppositories?

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,467
Listen: "Ten years before menopause
you may have symptoms including:

70
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,006
"All month long PMS,

71
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:15,638
"fluid retention, insomnia, depression,
hot flushes or irregular periods."

72
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,741
But people give up their seats
for you on the bus.

73
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,582
Oh, my God! Vagina weights.

74
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,713
My vagina waits for no man.

75
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:29,021
- Look. The Kegel Master.
- What's a kegel muscle?

76
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,359
- It helps you sit tight.
- And I have one?

77
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:37,231
- You don't do your exercises.
- What exercises?

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,773
You have to tighten
and release it for ten minutes a day.

79
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:47,175
Kegel exercises...
I'm doing mine right now.

80
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,076
Man, she's good.

81
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,740
Well, I can't wait for menopause.

82
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,512
It will be freeing not to have periods.

83
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,122
I can't wait till flow stops
coming to town.

84
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,225
- No one calls it flow.
- My grandmother did.

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,590
No more mind-numbing cramps.

86
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,096
No kidding.
I've got mine right now. Big time.

87
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,633
- I hear that, sister.
- My God, I have my period too.

88
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:14,138
We're all synched up.
I've heard about that happening.

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,042
What?
I'll get mine in a few days.

90
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:23,376
If Samantha was running late,
I was running even later.

91
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,485
The "Gab Magazine" party
was in an hour

92
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,985
and my dress was at the cleaners.

93
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,789
Oh, please, sir!

94
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,223
Shit.

95
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,730
Apparently my fabulous party dress
would be staying in for the evening.

96
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,133
Miranda and Steve decided
instead of staying in, they'd go out.

97
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,905
Since when did it become appropriate
to bring babies to restaurants?

98
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,571
Oh, come on. He's cute.

99
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,810
Yeah. God invented baby-sitters
for a reason.

100
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,316
I don't think it's so bad.
It's nice to have babies around.

101
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,588
Don't get me wrong.
I love babies, but not with my soup.

102
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,688
Oh, my God.
Look at you. You're a mess!

103
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,666
- We should do it. Have a baby.
- Yeah, right.

104
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:28,475
I'm serious. We'd have a cute baby,
not one that looks like Khrushchev.

105
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,845
- We wouldn't have to get married.
- You're serious?

106
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,884
Yes. The timing is perfect.

107
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,390
The timing is not perfect. We've only
been living together for two months.

108
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:44,724
It's way too quick. We cannot
have a baby. You're insane.

109
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,860
Come on.
I want a baby. It'd be fun.

110
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,965
It's not like owning a foosball table.
Do you know how much work it is?

111
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,602
Yeah, I know. But I can
hang out with him during the day.

112
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,205
Watch "Sesame Street" while you're
at work, then I go to work at the bar.

113
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:10,015
And I'd be up all night with the baby,
alone and getting no sleep,

114
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:15,822
then have to get up the next day
and work 14 hours to make partner

115
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,921
so I can afford the apartment
you're watching "Sesame Street" in.

116
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,025
Let's hope the baby inherits
my positive attitude.

117
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,265
Can we please talk
about something else?

118
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,534
No problem.

119
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,876
While Miranda was left
contemplating diapers...

120
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,817
I was contemplating
McQueen versus Gucci.

121
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:46,789
It's your last chance to attend
a fabulous party with a fabulous girl.

122
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,384
- It's a party on a boat?
- Correction: Fancy boat.

123
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,591
And ps, the fabulous girl
is rumored to be easy.

124
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,965
- What's the party for?
- This new magazine, "Gab".

125
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,232
- Have you read it?
- No, I want the celebrity sightings.

126
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,070
I'd be stuck on this boat
with all these celebs.

127
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,405
And celebrity hangers-on.

128
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,448
It's tempting, but is it OK
if I stay on dry land?

129
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,849
- Of course.
- Will you still be easy later?

130
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,615
- Is that a proposition?
- Bon voyage.

131
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,290
Bye.

132
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,570
The "Gab" party was everything
they promised and more.

133
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,773
Regis Philbin, Madonna and
"New Yorker" ex-editors were there.

134
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,477
- Hey, thanks.
- So, where was I?

135
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,420
Unfortunately,
Trey was doing most of the gabbing.

136
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,617
- The part about the birthday present.
- That's right.

137
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,196
My mother gives me this awful
machine for sorting change...

138
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,431
He has a lot of change.

139
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,932
...for my birthday.
I lied to her and said I loved it.

140
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,596
I jumped into a cab
and drove that thing right back.

141
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,371
So there I was, on...
40th and Broadway.

142
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,004
- I hear a woman yell like a hyena.
- I did not!

143
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:21,279
The cab stops. I almost hit my head
on that plastic partition. I got out...

144
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,854
He told him to stop the meter.

145
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,188
And there was Charlotte, lying on
the street. That's how we met.

146
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,318
And that's how we met.

147
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,461
- That's very sweet.
- Oh, and the cabbie got mad.

148
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,264
- It's OK, cos I remember.
- Anyway, it was fate.

149
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,806
If my mother didn't give me bad gifts

150
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,503
this wonderful gift
would never have come into my life.

151
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,945
I'd heard the story
at least three times.

152
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:54,382
Another minute of Trey and we would
be in a man overboard situation.

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,616
- Hey, I'm gonna go to hit the buffet.
- OK.

154
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,555
Not too hard.

155
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,993
As I walked away, I realised I hadn't
seen Charlotte that happy in years

156
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,796
and with a man
she had known for five minutes.

157
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,297
And just when I thought I was safe...

158
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,341
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

159
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,477
Cheese.

160
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,236
Hello.

161
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,679
...I ran into the man
I'd been happy with for five minutes.

162
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,686
- Right. Well, hi.
- I thought I might see you here.

163
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,453
You did?

164
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:39,497
- Where's Natasha?
- She missed the boat.

165
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,891
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,762
Very crowded.

167
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,632
Well, I gotta...

168
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,138
Dominick Dunne is holding my place
in the bathroom line.

169
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,681
Big and I, trapped together on a boat
without dates.

170
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,718
We were two miles offshore.
There was no way off.

171
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,380
Children and women
with emotional baggage first.

172
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,358
Carrie. Look what Trey gave me.
Isn't it beautiful?

173
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,022
Wow. Cartier.

174
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:17,067
It was a surprise. He said
the last few weeks have been special.

175
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,400
And that he's smitten.
Look, it's inscribed.

176
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:27,243
Let's see. "To Charlotte.
It's about time I met you."

177
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,347
Sweetie, that's great.

178
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,973
- When does this boat dock?
- Around 10:00.

179
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,416
- What time is it?
- It's not set yet.

180
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:39,081
- It's pretty.
- Thanks. I better get back to Trey.

181
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,353
I think this is it, Carrie.
I can feel it.

182
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,430
One woman's "Titanic"
is another woman's "Love Boat".

183
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,303
- Boo.
- Jesus.

184
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,608
So what was that back there?

185
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,840
I... I don't know.

186
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:09,353
- Can't we have a conversation?
- I don't know. Can we?

187
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,483
Around Brooklyn
there's gonna be a mutiny. Pass it on.

188
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,590
- What a spiffy opener.
- I try.

189
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,566
So what are you? Are you...

190
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:29,264
- Are you seeing anyone?
- Yeah, I am.

191
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,603
He's great.
He's perfect, actually.

192
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,410
Where is he, Mr Perfect?

193
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,883
He's home. I didn't wanna subject him
to the slimy media leeches.

194
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,351
Good idea.

195
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,251
Present company excluded.

196
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,486
- That's some outfit, kid.
- Really? Do you think so?

197
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:54,531
If you like this, you'll love the one
being held hostage on 74th and Lex.

198
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,563
It's good to see you.

199
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,541
The next morning I recovered
from my see-Big sickness,

200
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,482
while downtown, Samantha realised
maybe her ship had sailed.

201
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,715
She was five days late.

202
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,587
Later we did brunch and bathroom
at Time Café.

203
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,230
- I'm in love with him.
- You're not in love with him.

204
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,128
You're in love with
the expensive watch he gave you.

205
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:33,364
- Do you have another?
- I'm not Tampax central. Buy them.

206
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,236
I have them at home. But they
won't fit in my Kate Spade purse.

207
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,436
Wow, Kate must have a tiny vagina.

208
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,641
The watch is a sign
that he's in love with me too.

209
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:49,447
- He's just in blue ball hell.
- Sometimes you just know.

210
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,556
We're the right match. It's fate.

211
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,591
It's not fate.
His light is on. That's all.

212
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,695
- What light?
- Men are like cabs.

213
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,322
When they're available,
their light goes on.

214
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:06,700
They wake up one day, decide
to settle down, and turn their light on.

215
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,037
The next woman they pick up
is the one they'll marry. It's not fate.

216
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:16,045
- It's dumb luck.
- I can't believe that love is random.

217
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,275
You gotta get them
when their light's on.

218
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,649
- Men I meet are flashing yellows.
- Or off duty.

219
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,019
They can drive around for years
and not be available.

220
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,126
They shouldn't be allowed
to get behind the wheel!

221
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,285
Most men don't stay lit long
before they take the plunge

222
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,627
versus most women who
have been lit pretty much since birth.

223
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,032
That was my last tampon.
Are you packing?

224
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,106
No, I don't have a tampon and
probably will never need one again.

225
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:47,208
- A "no" is good enough.
- I haven't had my period in 35 days.

226
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,339
- Are you...?
- No, I'm not pregnant. I'm...

227
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:55,920
- I'm drying up.
- Come on. You're overreacting.

228
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,453
- It was a stupid catalogue.
- I'm day-old bread. My time is up.

229
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,389
Enjoy your flows.

230
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,658
For someone with no period
you've got a mean case of PMS.

231
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,735
You have years of miserable cramps
ahead of you.

232
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,495
Ladies...

233
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,197
What I'm about to tell you...

234
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,401
may come as a shock.

235
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,607
I'm a little...

236
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,250
older than you.

237
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,657
That night I couldn't stop thinking
about time.

238
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,525
Was every second of our lives
controlled by fate?

239
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,069
Or is life a series
of random occurrences?

240
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,301
If I wasn't always ten minutes late,
would my life be totally different?

241
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,879
Would I never run into Big? Would
there ever be a good time to see him?

242
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,505
Was Miranda right?

243
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,048
Is timing everything?

244
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,192
Could you turn that down?
I'm working.

245
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,074
OK, not low enough.

246
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,910
You're gonna have to get used
to the noise with a baby around.

247
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,284
Look. I've been thinking
about this baby thing.

248
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,580
We're not in a great place right now.

249
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,217
Can we have this conversation
without "Scooby Doo"?

250
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,230
It's the one where they find the ghost
in the salt mine.

251
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:52,835
- I'm serious. Turn off the cartoons.
- But what about the ghost?

252
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:57,635
- You know what? Forget it.
- Miranda.

253
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,234
Then Miranda realised she may have
already had a baby in her house.

254
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,879
I wanna shelve
this baby thing for a while.

255
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,144
OK, you got it.

256
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,817
Put a coaster under that glass

257
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,583
and turn off the lights
before you come to bed.

258
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,529
We haven't had sex in over a week
and he wants a baby.

259
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,861
What's wrong with this picture?

260
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,027
You can always go
the Immaculate Conception route.

261
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,739
Seriously, we're in this shitty place.

262
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,709
We fight and I'm working long hours
for this partner thing.

263
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:39,045
And he's using a baby as a Band-Aid
for everything that's wrong with us.

264
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,551
- What is wrong with you guys?
- I don't know.

265
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:47,182
It's like he's a kid
and I end up nagging him all the time.

266
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm mean mommy and no one
wants to fuck mean mommy.

267
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,661
Oh, I believe you.

268
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,634
Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship
so I don't have to actually be happy.

269
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,397
Maybe the problem is me.

270
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,633
This baby is gonna need
a lot of therapy.

271
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,108
- There is no baby!
- OK, mean mommy.

272
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:12,210
But I do want one eventually
and my clock is running out.

273
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,911
I've only got a million viable eggs left.

274
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,251
300 of which we just killed
with those martinis at lunch.

275
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,860
That night, Samantha got drunk.

276
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,795
She had lost her spirit and no pill
in the catalogue could correct that.

277
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,560
And so she accepted a date with Len.

278
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,770
After all, day-old bread
needed to stick together.

279
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,931
- Ever been in a Cadillac Eldorado?
- No.

280
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,943
Oh, those babies are smooth.
They have buttons for everything.

281
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,948
There's even a button to adjust
your lumbar. Great for my hip.

282
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,180
Did I tell you I have an artificial hip?

283
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,620
- No.
- Hard to believe, baby?

284
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,919
Samantha couldn't listen
to one more minute of Len.

285
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,057
So she slept with him
and his hip to shut him up.

286
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,170
Yeah, baby.

287
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,997
Give it to daddy.

288
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,145
- Oh, Jesus.
- What.

289
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:23,911
Baby, either you're a virgin
or flow just came to town.

290
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,052
- My period?
- There's blood everywhere.

291
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,027
Oh, my God. That is so...

292
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,027
These sheets are two grand a set.

293
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,004
I'm sorry, really very sorry.

294
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,507
Samantha said sorry.
What she really meant was...

295
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:51,514
there are more young studs in this
pre-pre-menopausal woman's future.

296
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,676
This is embarrassing. I should go.

297
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,188
Thanks for dinner.

298
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:03,220
The next day, Miranda was putting in
time and a half at her firm when...

299
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,565
- Miranda Hobbes.
- Hey.

300
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm busy and can't talk.

301
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,929
Meet me in half an hour
at 56th and 3rd, OK?

302
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,768
- I can't, I got a meeting at 4:00.
- Come on, it will help.

303
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,604
- Please.
- OK.

304
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,444
- This is not gonna happen.
- Come on. Look at them.

305
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,611
How exactly would this help us?

306
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,349
Maybe we're not ready for a baby.

307
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:37,155
- This could be a test run.
- Who would take care of the test run?

308
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,388
Me.

309
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:47,167
Please, buyer lady.
Take me home and love me.

310
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,706
- You're insane.
- Not in front of the puppy!

311
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,207
Miranda had been backed
into a corner.

312
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,939
Even though she was surrounded
by bitches, she didn't wanna be one.

313
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,673
OK.

314
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,684
Charlotte and Trey
were performing their usual duet.

315
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,345
...and then I got out and found you.

316
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,390
Oh, really? I found you.

317
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,826
- I think I should come in.
- No, sweetie.

318
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:19,835
I have an early meeting. But thanks,
I had a lovely time. Really.

319
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,905
Me too.

320
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,505
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:45,626
- You're very persistent.
- I wanna tell you something.

322
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,530
- I love you, Charlotte.
- You do?

323
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,304
- Yeah.
- I love you too.

324
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,509
That night, Charlotte
got everything she wanted.

325
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,408
Trey got a hand job.

326
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,643
And at 3:00 am Miranda
was getting nothing but aggravated.

327
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,844
Please, go to sleep.

328
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,116
Please, I beg you.
Here. Look.

329
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:19,128
This is supposed to be your mom's
heart beating or... something.

330
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,233
- Are you happy?
- Not really.

331
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,407
We get this puppy.
I'm the only one taking care of it.

332
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,978
I've been up all night. You're asleep.
This was a huge mistake.

333
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,342
Come on, relax. It will be fine.

334
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,472
For you, because
you're not doing anything.

335
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,211
He's just getting used to us.

336
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,614
Poochie, poochie, puppy boy.

337
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,585
Give mommy a kiss.

338
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,868
This is it.
I'm so sick of you being the kid here.

339
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:02,065
I cannot be in charge all the time.
We're supposed to be equals.

340
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,176
You think we can have a baby?
We can't even have a puppy together.

341
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,802
- We're going through a rough patch.
- This isn't a patch.

342
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,314
This is it. All the time.
And it's not good.

343
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,283
Great. So you're just
gonna give up on us, just like that?

344
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,220
Not just like that.

345
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,522
I have been trying not to give up
on us for a long time.

346
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,627
- That's nice.
- I'm just being honest.

347
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,895
Then Miranda realised something.

348
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,006
All this time,
she thought the problem was her.

349
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,438
It wasn't. It was them.

350
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,636
And there was never a good time
to say what she had to say.

351
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:45,307
- This isn't gonna work, Steve.
- There's good stuff, here.

352
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,350
Not enough.

353
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,923
A baby would've been a quick fix
for something that can't be fixed.

354
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:57,954
- Because you don't want it to work.
- That's so unfair.

355
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,895
- I don't wanna fight you anymore.
- Do you think I do?

356
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,965
I don't know.

357
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,837
Steve...

358
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,973
I really tried.

359
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,041
That night, Miranda lost her partner.

360
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,109
The next day, she got a new one.

361
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,754
Fifteen of them.

362
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,166
Meanwhile,
I was still enjoying my one.

363
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,606
Do you wanna have a sleepover?

364
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,874
Let me set the timer.

365
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,578
I didn't know about Aidan
but my light was definitely on.

366
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,046
You have one new message.

367
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,953
Hey, Carrie, I'm...

368
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:02,082
I knew who it was. I couldn't stop Big
coming back into my life.

369
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,560
But I could stop him
from coming out of my machine.

370
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:09,656
Hey, you're out of filters.
I'm gonna run down to the Korean.

371
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,369
- Hey...
- Yeah?

372
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,572
You make me really happy.

373
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,075
- See you in a bit.
- OK.

374
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,456
Oh, that was very fast.

375
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,970
- What are you doing here?
- Didn't you get my message?

376
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,901
No, I paused it.

377
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,907
- What are you doing here?
- That was him, wasn't it?

378
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,002
- The perfect guy.
- Yes and he's coming back, so...

379
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,078
Please.

380
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,852
What do you want?

381
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,115
I don't know.

382
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,453
No, go home to your wife.

383
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,336
Go.

384
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,565
I'm so fucked up.

385
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:32,505
I had no idea
what else Big was gonna say.

386
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,516
And I'm not sure
what bugged me more.

387
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,317
That I didn't know or that I cared.

388
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,758
Hey, Carrie.
I'm here on your corner.

389
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,921
I know you're home. Pick up.

390
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,129
Jesus.

391
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:57,499
Well, I miss you.

392
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,707
I can't fucking stop thinking
about you. There you have it.

393
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,280
There it was.
Exactly what I had needed to hear...

394
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,116
a year too late.

395
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,417
I should have been happy,
but I wasn't.

396
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,119
It was the absolute worst timing of all.

397
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,463
Ten minutes later,
Aidan still hadn't come back.

398
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,159
Suddenly my life was all about timing.

399
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,635
All the right things
said at all the wrong times.

400
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,263
My past coming back way too fast.

401
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:35,377
And my future
taking way too long to come home.
