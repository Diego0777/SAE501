1
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,739
New York City - dreary, grey, miserable.

2
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,950
Or was that just me?

3
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,829
After a sordid affair with my ex-boyfriend,

4
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,707
and a break-up with my current one,

5
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:07,501
it was time for a change of scenery.

6
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,171
And I wasn't alone.

7
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,339
You're going to LA without me?!

8
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,009
You went on your honeymoon without us.

9
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,553
I have pictures.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,264
While we planned our escape,

11
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,600
Charlotte celebrated her return.

12
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:25,227
She and Trey had returned from Bermuda.

13
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:27,938
Here, Trey and I are playing golf.

14
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:31,358
Do you think the studio
will send a limo to pick us up?

15
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,612
- No, I do not.
- They're making your column into a movie.

16
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:39,158
It's a little company that's just
talking about optioning my columns.

17
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:42,620
I know. I was just practising my LA spin.

18
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:47,750
Look, here's one of Trey pretending
to get a hole in one. He loved that gag.

19
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,960
Who wouldn't?

20
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:53,088
Did you notice
we're both wearing Bermuda shorts?

21
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,550
Bermudas in Bermuda.
You kids were crazy down there!

22
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:00,179
I'd love to stay,
but I gotta take my cat to the kennel.

23
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:03,098
- Lovely.
- I gotta go too.

24
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,684
- The car's picking us up at one.
- We'll be there.

25
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,396
Welcome back, you old married lady.

26
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,401
- Bye. Have fun.
- All right.

27
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,656
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

28
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,074
Great.

29
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,119
I told Aidan about the affair.
He broke up with me.

30
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:27,998
- We never had sex on our honeymoon.
- You win.

31
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:32,294
Shall we get more coffee
or shall we get guns and kill ourselves?

32
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,880
He couldn't get it up.

33
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:39,218
We tried twice. It was so frustrating,
we started playing golf.

34
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:43,639
After many days on the golf course,
Charlotte's handicap had gone down twelve.

35
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,225
Trey's handicap had stayed the same.

36
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:51,188
- Well, impotence is a common problem.
- Oh, God.

37
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,525
Do you think he's impotent?

38
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,110
Well...

39
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,071
My husband can't be impotent.
He's gorgeous.

40
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,532
All right then. Glad you solved that.

41
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,955
Maybe he was nervous about the wedding,
the honeymoon and the golf.

42
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:12,710
- He played really badly one day.
- What do you want me to say?

43
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,922
- Let's change the subject.
- Right.

44
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:22,178
- What happened with Aidan?
- Nothing good.

45
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:27,224
I only agreed to this trip to get
away from Aidan and the whole mess.

46
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:33,981
Let's go to Barneys. I can't go to
Los Angeles without another pair of shoes.

47
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,361
No. You go, I'm gonna stay
and have another cup.

48
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:43,115
- Just go. Have fun.
- All right.

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,997
- Call me if you need me.
- OK.

50
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:03,427
Later that day, three single New Yorkers
arrived in the City of Angels.

51
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,181
I so needed this vacation.

52
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:11,852
- You and me both, sister.
- Hooray for Hollywood!

53
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:19,818
That's his job?
To sit in a fake fish tank in underwear?

54
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:23,322
- What do you think he's reading?
- The wanted ads?

55
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:26,408
- There's a problem.
- Words I'm never fond of hearing.

56
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:29,870
I have reservations for Ms Jones
and Ms Bradshaw, but not Ms Hobbes.

57
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:35,042
- That's just great.
- There should be three reservations.

58
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,796
The production company requested
two rooms, and we're booked up.

59
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:40,840
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

60
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,050
She's from New York.

61
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:46,929
I understand.
I'll have another room tomorrow.

62
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,765
Until then, could you stay
with one of your friends?

63
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:56,522
- I'll stay with her.
- Don't complain about my smoking.

64
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,941
They didn't request smoking rooms.

65
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,195
- Excuse me?
- You're on a non-smoking floor.

66
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:06,574
Words I'm even less fond of hearing.

67
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,620
Later, decked out
in our "New York goes to LA" finest,

68
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,582
we were ready for a night on the town.

69
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:24,884
- OK, I'm ready.
- Let's go.

70
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,389
Back in the hotel bar, we realised

71
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:35,060
the three hour time difference also
made us three hours late for cocktail hour.

72
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:39,440
- Welcome to LA. I'm Garth.
- How did you know I was from out of town?

73
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,318
If you lived here,
we would have met by now.

74
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:46,030
What do you do when you're not
a one-man welcome wagon?

75
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:50,326
- I'm a dildo model.
- You wouldn't tease a girl, would you?

76
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:53,662
I'm the number two model in the US.
Number one in Canada.

77
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,791
- My dick's bigger in Canada.
- You gotta love that metric system.

78
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:00,085
I gotta run.

79
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:02,880
Where?
A dildo emergency?

80
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,799
You think I'm yanking your chain,
but I'm not.

81
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,929
We're having a promotional party
at Hustler Store,

82
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:13,390
celebrating the launch
of a new line of toys and accessories.

83
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,310
Here's an invitation. Come.

84
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,523
I always do.

85
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,154
As Samantha said goodbye to Mr Dildo,

86
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,491
Miranda said hello to Mr Dique.
Mr Jason Dique.

87
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,662
It's spelled D-l-Q-U-E.
And yes, I've thought about changing it.

88
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,290
It would be worse
if your first name was Little.

89
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,251
What do you do?

90
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,628
- I'm a lawyer.
- I thought I had it bad.

91
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,881
- No.
- No, it's great. You look like a lawyer.

92
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:48,509
You look like a dick.

93
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:52,471
It is so great
to talk to a smart and funny woman.

94
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,060
What was I saying?

95
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:02,523
- It's great to talk to a smart woman.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,067
Could you excuse me for a second?

97
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:12,575
Across the bar, I was having drinks with
the most feared creature in Los Angeles -

98
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,869
the junior development executive.

99
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,455
I love your columns.
They're so relatable.

100
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:20,916
- Thanks. I try.
- It's like I'm you.

101
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,169
I will be when I turn 30.

102
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:27,882
You! You are such a loser.
You're a loser.

103
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,384
You are. Loser.

104
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,636
I'm kidding.

105
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,890
What a loser. Last year,
he pitched me nothing but shit 24-7.

106
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,684
- That's a lot of shit.
- No shit.

107
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,438
Seriously, I am you.

108
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:46,066
You've had your heart broken,
I've had my heart broken.

109
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,360
If I have,
that means other girls have.

110
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,322
If other girls have,
that means big opening weekend.

111
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,949
Not X-Men big, but chick flick big.

112
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,369
The guy who came up with that term
should have his balls cut off.

113
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:01,832
- Isn't that a little severe?
- Do I sound like an asshole? I hope not.

114
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,544
- I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks.

115
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:10,132
Big news.
I have a star interested. Guess who.

116
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,222
- Drew Barrymore?
- No. Guess.

117
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,726
- I'm not good with celebrity names.
- Guess.

118
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:26,607
- That Jennifer Love Something girl?
- No. Guess.

119
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,777
I'm done guessing.

120
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,115
Matthew McConaughey.

121
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,246
- Why would he wanna be involved?
- Because he's smart.

122
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,249
He's a producer as well,
and he took to the material.

123
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,876
We're meeting him tomorrow at 3:00.

124
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,712
Hot, hotty, hot.
What do you think?

125
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:58,973
Back in New York, Charlotte was dealing
with a bed that was still cold, coldy, cold.

126
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,477
- Trey, come to bed. It's late.
- In a minute.

127
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,480
I won't sleep until I've entered
all these wedding gifts.

128
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:11,318
Sleep was the last thing Charlotte hoped
Trey would do in bed that night.

129
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:16,907
I've listed the gifts,
who it's from, and the addresses.

130
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,785
Make it a breeze when you
send out the thank-you notes.

131
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:22,621
I can't wait till this wedding nonsense
is behind us.

132
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:27,751
Then we can relax
and just be a regular man and wife.

133
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,420
Wait.

134
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:35,092
The Jamesons for the crystal candlesticks,
and the Sullivans for the silver...

135
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,178
Hello there.

136
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,598
You know, since we've been home,

137
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:45,644
I've been feeling so much more relaxed.
Haven't you?

138
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:51,775
You've deleted Mr and Mrs Evan Handy
and their Steuben glass bowl. Hang on.

139
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:54,486
Trey...

140
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,157
We have a problem.

141
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,825
I know.

142
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:04,455
Somehow we've got two serving platters.
We only registered for one.

143
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:08,584
Charlotte walked back
to her big Park Avenue bed,

144
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:12,796
wishing she had remembered
to register for her sex life.

145
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:16,217
When visiting LA,
there are two things you must do -

146
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,469
one is rent a fabulous car,

147
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:20,846
two is learn how to drive it.

148
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:25,935
- You said you knew how to drive a stick.
- I did a few times in a parking lot.

149
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,437
Why didn't you get an automatic?

150
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,023
I love this car.
It goes with my outfit.

151
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,444
I believed that cars are to Los Angeles
what handbags are to New York.

152
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:40,824
What's with this hill?
A way is supposed to be flat.

153
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:43,327
- They mean culturally.
- The hotel's there.

154
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:45,996
To get there
we have to go up this hill.

155
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,380
That's enough. Stop.

156
00:10:56,674 --> 00:11:01,303
I'm not going to die in this tin can.
I have a date with a dildo.

157
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:06,100
- I'm sorry.
- All right. Come on, we're gonna do it.

158
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,439
Yeah, baby.

159
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,697
A little later,
freshly showered and freaked out,

160
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:23,993
I drove to the studio for my meeting
with Matthew McConaughey.

161
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,597
- Can I help you?
- Building five?

162
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,975
There aren't any hills in there, are there?

163
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:51,270
- Go down there, make a left.
- Thank you.

164
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,156
I do. I like all of it.
Your writing is brilliant.

165
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:06,368
I really do.
It's sharp, edgy, brutal at times.

166
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:09,538
It's always a little juicy.
It's very New York.

167
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,917
I do like it. I really do.

168
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:18,964
My God. Thank you,
Matthew McConaughey.

169
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,133
You're welcome,
Carrie Bradshaw.

170
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,470
Here's what I've been thinking about -

171
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:29,475
how do we get your column
to translate to the silver screen?

172
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,477
I think I've got the answer.

173
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:35,648
What if we flesh out
the central relationship?

174
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:42,488
- OK. The central relationship.
- Carrie and Mr Big.

175
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:45,157
I don't see why they couldn't make it work.

176
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:48,035
I couldn't believe it.
I flew 3,000 miles

177
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:52,414
to have Matthew McConaughey ask
what I've been asking myself for years?

178
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,459
Look at him.
He is such a great guy.

179
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:59,171
I don't know anybody
any cooler than Mr Big.

180
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:04,510
The only question is,
"What the fuck is Carrie's problem?"

181
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:06,804
What do you think?

182
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:12,059
Well...
I don't particularly think

183
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,895
it was just her problem.

184
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,984
He had some commitment issues.

185
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,028
That's bullshit, Carrie, and you know it.

186
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,323
Cut.

187
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,534
Kidding. I'm acting.

188
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:33,539
That's what I do.
See what I mean?

189
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:36,959
That's why I wanna develop
the story with you.

190
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,419
I'm Mr Big.

191
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:42,506
Oh, OK.
Well. Yeah. That's...

192
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,885
Excellent. You're in.
You know what else?

193
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,722
I really wanna fuck you, baby.

194
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,936
- Are you acting now?
- I'm Big, OK? You be Carrie.

195
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,189
- I am Carrie.
- We're animals.

196
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:04,320
Man, woman, walking the earth.
We're made of head, heart and loins.

197
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,780
We're talking about using them, am I right?

198
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,577
I have...

199
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:16,415
The girl said that we would
talk about the columns today.

200
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,710
Let's get down to the underbelly
of these two characters.

201
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:23,589
Let's figure out why they're so fucked up.

202
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:27,218
Well, I have a facial at four.

203
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:31,847
I love you. I don't understand
why we can't be together.

204
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:35,434
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- I don't think you should.

205
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,938
- What?
- I don't think Carrie should smoke.

206
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,358
That's all right.

207
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,653
Or in my office. OK?

208
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,531
After I left the meeting
I took a wrong turn

209
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:52,660
and somehow found myself
right back where I had started -

210
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:56,830
back in New York,
back wondering about Big.

211
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,959
I had come to LA for a vacation,

212
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,921
hoping to get away from Big, Aidan,
and most of all myself.

213
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:09,009
Sitting on the fake set,
all my issues felt more real than ever.

214
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:14,306
I couldn't help but wonder -
no matter how far you travel or run from it,

215
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,934
can you ever really escape your past?

216
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:21,313
Ma'am? No smoking.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,232
I'm outside.

218
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,777
And it's New York.

219
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:41,584
In New York, the release of a new book
is cause for celebration.

220
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,587
Here in LA, a new line
of sex toys will do the trick.

221
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,673
- Isn't this fun?
- The answer would be no.

222
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,468
- We want to go.
- What? We can't leave yet.

223
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:55,472
- They haven't cut the cock.
- What are the chances it's cream filled?

224
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,642
I am exhausted
from McConaughey mania.

225
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,730
I wanna get in the bed, go to sleep
and pretend this day never happened.

226
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:07,651
Stay a little longer. Garth is gonna
autograph some dildos. He's a big seller.

227
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,530
- He's the John Grisham of penises.
- I'm gonna get in line.

228
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:18,412
I can't believe how open
and "Hi. Have sex" this place is.

229
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,415
In New York
sex is bottom shelf, paper bag.

230
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:24,043
Exactly. It's all hidden, like me.

231
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,630
- What do you mean?
- Last night I talked to this cute guy.

232
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:31,467
We were having a great time.
Then a woman in a tight dress walked by,

233
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,303
with big breasts -
just boom, here they are.

234
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,723
- He totally went for it.
- Right.

235
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,811
I wanted to have sex too, but it was hidden
in my witty banter and my little looks.

236
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:47,691
- She put it out there and got the guy.
- But how long did she have him?

237
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,818
Who cares?
I wanna get laid.

238
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:54,031
I admire women who can put it out there
where you can see it.

239
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,367
Like her.

240
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:01,455
- You want to dress like her?
- You know what I mean.

241
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,250
Do you think there's any chance
she's not up for sex?

242
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,295
No, because she's a hooker.

243
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:12,675
- Hi. Have we met?
- No.

244
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:16,053
I was telling my friend
how much I admire what you're wearing.

245
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,721
Thank you.

246
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:22,601
- Are you in the porn industry?
- God, no. I'm a lawyer for Disney.

247
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,103
See?

248
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,940
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

249
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,359
You made it.

250
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:37,241
My opinion of Canadian consumers
just went up a notch.

251
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,119
Sign it, please.

252
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,997
- How shall I sign it?
- I don't know.

253
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:48,043
To Samantha,
who's staying at the standard room 324.

254
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,630
- Perfect. I'll deliver it personally.
- You're too kind.

255
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:58,304
That night,
Samantha took home the Deluxe Garth.

256
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,267
Next door, I learned
that not only could I not escape my past,

257
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:06,061
I couldn't escape my present.

258
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,777
What is it about California air?
It makes me sleep so well.

259
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,407
It's not the air. Your headboard
knocked you unconscious.

260
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,451
- You heard us?
- I didn't.

261
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,287
- No, Ms Snore, you wouldn't.
- Are you OK?

262
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:28,167
I'm cranky. I have another meeting
with McConaughey and his partners.

263
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:32,379
We're gonna brainstorm what goes wrong
with "Carrie" and the relationships.

264
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,006
Don't go.

265
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,759
I have to.
I'm their little writer monkey.

266
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:41,347
I've got something to make you feel better.

267
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,351
Dildos before 10:00 am. I'm all perked up.

268
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,937
They're autographed.
One for each.

269
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:51,357
My friend went to California,
and all I got was this lousy dildo.

270
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,610
Could you put these back?
People are staring.

271
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:58,697
It's LA. No one cares
if your egg whites have a sight of cock.

272
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,367
Wow! Nobody needs this much.

273
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,245
The average woman
is only five inches deep.

274
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,580
Is that written on your placemat?

275
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:10,584
- The mark of a fine penis is width.
- Couldn't agree more.

276
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,878
That's why you'll enjoy your presents.

277
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:17,216
Are you saying
that Garth has the perfect girth?

278
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,717
Exactly.

279
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:24,557
As much as I enjoy
the fine life-like craftsmanship,

280
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:27,226
I'm going to leave mine with you.

281
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:33,023
I'm holding on to mine. LA isn't
working out the way I had hoped.

282
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,152
Meanwhile, back in New York
and still no closer to being in-put by Trey,

283
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,489
Charlotte addressed thank you notes.

284
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:46,412
Every time she licked a love stamp,
she felt it made a mockery of her marriage.

285
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:57,047
It's me. It's been days and still nothing.
What if he really is impotent?

286
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:59,967
What kind of impotence do you think it is?

287
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:04,513
- The kind that makes it soft.
- No, no. Physical or emotional?

288
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,184
- I don't know.
- Have you asked him about it?

289
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,061
He's embarrassed.
He doesn't want to talk about it.

290
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:17,026
Here's how you find out: put a ring of paper
around his flaccid penis while he's asleep.

291
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:20,613
- I sound like a perverted Nancy Drew.
- What does that do?

292
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:26,243
If it rips during the night, he is capable of
an erection. The problem is not physical.

293
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,122
- This floor is non-smoking.
- I have an addiction, sir.

294
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,293
- A ring of paper.
- Yup.

295
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:41,800
Later that night, Samantha invited Mr Dildo
out for dim sum, and then some.

296
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:46,764
Samantha, tell me more about yourself.
What are your interests?

297
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:49,934
- That's pretty obvious.
- I'm serious.

298
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,522
Don't you wanna know
more about me, my interests?

299
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:58,776
- OK.
- I'm a poet.

300
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,153
I've been published in journals...

301
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:05,407
Garth wanted Samantha to know
that he was more than just a sex toy.

302
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,535
He had a soft side.

303
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,371
Do you want to hear one?

304
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:14,333
Far away, Charlotte was dealing
with Trey's soft side as well.

305
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,211
She was going to get some answers.

306
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:20,881
She came to bed armed with love.

307
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:34,144
She went to sleep
hoping her male had sufficient postage

308
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:37,189
to deliver his package into her box.

309
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:42,570
Back at the hotel, Samantha
was waiting for a delivery of her own.

310
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:48,534
Once again, the leaves bloomed forth
Some headed south, some headed north

311
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,372
That's beautiful.
Come here.

312
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:57,960
Blue as a baby bird

313
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:04,675
Winged and aloft
My eyes search your eyes

314
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:07,344
For something I've lost

315
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,682
Samantha, I was thinking.

316
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:16,061
- You were?
- We have this great connection.

317
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:19,690
And I've done LA.
How about I move to New York?

318
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:22,943
I could pursue my two passions,
poetry and porn.

319
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,905
- I...
- Wouldn't it be great?

320
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:28,282
We could keep seeing each other.

321
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,534
Having a fling in LA is one thing,

322
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:35,289
but introducing Mr Dildo to everyone
at a gala at the Met was quite another.

323
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:39,418
I don't think it would work. I know me.

324
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:44,089
I'm much too possessive a woman
to share your penis with the world.

325
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:48,010
Just like that,
Samantha escaped a life as Mrs Dildo.

326
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:51,388
She moved Garth
out of her present and into her past.

327
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:54,225
But she took the best part of him with her.

328
00:22:56,644 --> 00:23:00,022
I had finally found a place
to escape Miranda's snoring.

329
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:04,318
The ghosts of my relationships past
weren't so easy to shake.

330
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:08,656
I hadn't really moved on from Big
and Aidan. I'd just moved.

331
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,866
Excuse me.

332
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,035
I'll put it out, OK?

333
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:16,288
No, I was wondering if I could borrow one.

334
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:19,291
Sorry, it was my last one.

335
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:24,380
Do you want some company?

336
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:32,930
- Are you sure you wanna be alone?
- I am.

337
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:36,392
As soon as I said it out loud,
I knew that that was what I wanted...

338
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:41,188
...and needed.

339
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:49,655
The next day Charlotte woke up as excited
as a little girl on Christmas morning.

340
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:54,201
She couldn't wait to see
if Trey's package was unwrapped.

341
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,590
Morning, morning, morning.

342
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:11,594
Good morning.
What are you so excited about?

343
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,305
Nothing. I just love you.

344
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,558
I love you too.

345
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:21,604
For the first time in weeks,
Charlotte felt relieved.

346
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,774
Trey's problem wasn't physical.
Then she realised,

347
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:30,571
if it wasn't physical, she couldn't escape
the fact that it might be emotional.

348
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:34,617
There was no easy
love stamp solution to fix that.

349
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:39,455
I am totally digging this scene.

350
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:43,000
It's so urban cowboy circa 1982.

351
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:47,421
All the fabulous places in LA and we're
at the Saddle Ranch Chop House?

352
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,758
Don't complain, it's the closest bar
without a hill involved.

353
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,052
This is what I'm talking about.
Look at her.

354
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,514
She screams sex. It's so honest.

355
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,727
- I wish I could be more like that.
- Stop complaining. Do something about it.

356
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,567
OK, which lovely lady is gonna be next?

357
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:12,363
- I will.
- Miranda, no.

358
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,406
- She will.
- No.

359
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:34,093
Hold on.

360
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:42,101
We weren't sure if it was the California
climate or the five beers she drank,

361
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:47,273
but as soon as she got on that bull,
Miranda escaped Miranda.

362
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,912
Wow, I can see
she really did need a vacation.

363
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:10,254
The next day,
as I pulled up to the studio, I realised,

364
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:12,756
I was the one who held the key
to my escape.

365
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:17,553
I could drive in and have someone tell me
the mistakes I'd made in my past,

366
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,807
or I could drive on
and figure them out myself.

367
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:28,939
That's what I did.

368
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:32,985
If I could master a stick shift,

369
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:37,072
could a successful relationship
be that far behind?
