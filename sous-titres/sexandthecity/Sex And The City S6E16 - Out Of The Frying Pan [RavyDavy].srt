1
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,424
When you're dating someone new,
everything can seem foreign...

2
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,594
especially when you're
dating someone foreign.

3
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,766
My Russian had been taking me
around the world.

4
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,834
Greece in Astoria, Italy in the Bronx.

5
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:06,734
Tonight it was Korea, on West 32nd Street.

6
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:17,250
- Wow. You look...
- Why, thank you.

7
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:20,192
So where to tonight?

8
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,493
Very, very exotic place.

9
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:25,792
Really?

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,697
Well, just so you know, I'm fully vaccinated.

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,236
- Good.
- So should we get a cab?

12
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,375
I have not been to
this mysterious place before...

13
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,338
but I believe we can walk.

14
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,570
I'm intrigued. Continue.

15
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,949
Turn around, we are going to your place.

16
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,425
Art, shmart. The man can cook.

17
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:01,058
I have never made a risotto
in a frying pan before.

18
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:04,459
I'm sorry. I don't use my kitchen.

19
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,104
And I don't usually make my guests
sit on the floor...

20
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:11,201
next to my stack of Vogues,
which I ordinarily hide...

21
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,240
in the tub, for company.

22
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,038
And the walls are...

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,481
I love your house. It's so you.

24
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,717
- Small and artless?
- No, warm and lovely.

25
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,428
- Are you okay?
- My foot sleeps.

26
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,294
- Well, now we'll have espresso.
- Great, where?

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,830
I don't have an espresso machine.

28
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,871
And you call yourself a writer, yeah?

29
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:47,602
I may have an old Mr. Coffee one-cup...

30
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,172
but don't hold your breath.

31
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,080
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,323
Okay, we go out.

33
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,290
Okay.

34
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,332
That mouse is dead. Wow.

35
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:12,965
It was a rodent.
You don't want this in your house.

36
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,038
Maybe he was just crossing through...

37
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,669
to get to the much nicer apartment
next door.

38
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,838
They call this denial.

39
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:24,073
Where there is one, there will be more.

40
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,080
Yeah, we're going out.

41
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:37,554
At least it didn't happen in a room
I actually use, like my closet.

42
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,893
Good Humor me.

43
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:42,162
The next morning, we were determined
to use our good humors...

44
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:47,138
to make Samantha's chemo lounge
as close as possible to a cocktail lounge.

45
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,004
Look at Miranda working Mr. Grape there.

46
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,635
Steve is one lucky guy.

47
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,716
Well, you guys are having a good time.

48
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,978
You bet, cancer is hilarious.

49
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,646
- Are all of you as fun as Samantha?
- We try.

50
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,655
I'm her favorite patient.

51
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,281
- Any mouth sores, sweetie?
- No.

52
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,189
Great, just keep up the Popsicles.

53
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,696
- Samantha, I have to say, you are amazing.
- I am.

54
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:15,057
And if you love me in chemo, wait till you
see me at Smith's movie premiere.

55
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,763
I'm getting a hot dress, fantastic shoes...

56
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:21,101
I'm going to kick cancer,
and that red carpet's ass.

57
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,300
Hear, hear.

58
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,470
It's not at all what I expected.

59
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:31,745
They have these Barcaloungers
and videos and Popsicles.

60
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,878
You throw in shuffleboard,
it would be a vacation in Miami.

61
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,245
Here they are.

62
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:39,451
Later, the Russian took me somewhere else
I'd never been before...

63
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,255
the kitchen supplies department.

64
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,195
- She doesn't even look sick.
- But she is sick, yes?

65
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:48,560
Well, she was, but she's gonna be fine.

66
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,899
I had a friend who had breast cancer.

67
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,133
She died.

68
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,499
I think this one is you.

69
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,943
From kitchen supplies to a kitchen surprise.

70
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,293
Hi, Dr. Steiner.

71
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,395
None of them?

72
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:25,528
Sure, I understand.

73
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,670
Thanks for calling on a Saturday. Bye.

74
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,676
- None of my eggs were viable.
- Oh, baby.

75
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,414
Again.

76
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,652
What do you want to do?

77
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,628
- Try IVF again.
- You sure?

78
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,699
- We've already tried it twice.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

79
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:58,094
It'll work. I mean, it has to.

80
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:05,236
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm gonna go for a run.

81
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:15,221
In high school,
Charlotte was voted most popular...

82
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,813
head of the track team, and class president.

83
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,025
She had won everything...

84
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:24,128
except the baby race.

85
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:36,707
Meanwhile, across town,
a couple who had won the baby race...

86
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:39,368
had lost their bedroom to their baby.

87
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,571
Wait, we saw this one.

88
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,544
"Charming midtown two-bedroom."

89
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:48,849
Why don't they say what it really is?
Crack house on an air shaft.

90
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,717
Scout, off!

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,391
Listen to this one,
in our price range, "Three-bedroom."

92
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,728
- I'm putting my shoes on.
- "Outdoor space."

93
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,165
- I'm getting my bag.
- "Finished basement."

94
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,336
- It's a house?
- In Brooklyn.

95
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:05,801
Okay, shoes are off.

96
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,067
What did I tell you
about that side of the paper?

97
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,699
What? It's a good place.

98
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,573
Steve, we're not moving to Brooklyn.

99
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:14,704
I'm a Manhattan girl.
I don't like anything not Manhattan.

100
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,909
I'm Queens, and I'm pretty cute.
Let's just look at it.

101
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:21,745
Sleeping in the dining room isn't so bad.
We're near the kitchen.

102
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,181
Did you let Fatty out of the laundry room?

103
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,927
We don't even need this,
we can hear Brady through the wall!

104
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,523
Miranda, we can't keep living like this.

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,158
Scout, down!

106
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:41,168
Fine. I'll look at it.

107
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,408
Wow.

108
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,913
- What?
- That is some strong coffee.

109
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:57,122
- No wonder you work all night.
- That's the way I like it.

110
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,626
- I'm gonna need a little milk in this.
- Then it's not espresso.

111
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,688
Milk will ruin it. Keep sipping it. You'll see.

112
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:18,176
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Yes?

113
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,279
You know, the other day,
when I was talking about my friend?

114
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:24,248
- The one with cancer.
- Her name is Samantha.

115
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,513
I just felt like...

116
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,783
you weren't being very sensitive
about my feelings.

117
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:34,315
I mentioned her, and your first response...

118
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,761
- was to tell me about your friend.
- Who died, yeah.

119
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,797
Yes, see? Exactly.

120
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:48,164
I'm sorry about your friend,
but my friend is going to be fine.

121
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,936
And my friend died.

122
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,136
See? You're doing it again.

123
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,710
- Not everyone dies.
- Then they are lucky.

124
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,509
Okay.

125
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:03,813
Maybe I'm not being very clear.

126
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,849
No, you're being clear.
You don't want your friend to die.

127
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,452
Please stop saying "die."

128
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,728
But to be realistic,
you must acknowledge this possibility, yes?

129
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,825
No.

130
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:20,195
They caught it early, it's Stage One.
She's having the Cadillac of chemo.

131
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,241
No, she is going to be fine.

132
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,212
- And your scaring me isn't helping.
- All I am saying, when my friend died...

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,977
I don't know why,
but you are not listening to me.

134
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,516
You are not listening to me.

135
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:37,079
Are you kidding? All I've said is, "Please,
don't talk about your friend who died."

136
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,646
Her name was Sophie.

137
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,457
I'm leaving.

138
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,017
What are you talking about?
We're having espresso.

139
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,998
No, we're not having espresso.
We are not listening.

140
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:50,558
Sit down, finish your coffee. It's hot.

141
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,706
I'm leaving.

142
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:59,035
Excuse me.

143
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,978
You know, I asked you
not to mention your friend...

144
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,542
and now all I can think about is your friend.

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,112
And my friend
has nothing to do with your friend.

146
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,559
- I think you are acting like a child.
- And I think you're acting like an asshole.

147
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:18,460
- Maybe you should go for now.
- I'm already going!

148
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,705
It was my first fight with the Russian.

149
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,045
And I didn't know if it was
the strong espresso or the strong words...

150
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,716
but either way,
not even my feet slept that night.

151
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,219
My goodness,
look at you and your little coat.

152
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:53,396
- Did you go shopping?
- Princess Dandyridge Brandywine, come!

153
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,797
I got her.

154
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,501
My goodness, so cute.

155
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,199
Thank you.

156
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,403
That's a mighty big name
for such a little dog.

157
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:09,437
- It's her show name.
- My gosh, I love dog shows.

158
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:12,507
- Has she ever won?
- This one? Two-time loser.

159
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,018
She doesn't show anymore.

160
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:18,421
She was bred from two champion
Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

161
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,255
But when I tried to show her,
it turns out she has a defect.

162
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,262
- No.
- Yeah, one of her hind legs is too short.

163
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,491
Such a shame, she had so much promise.

164
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,261
She just isn't a winner.

165
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,869
Well, she's awfully cute anyway.

166
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,068
- I'm Charlotte York Goldenblatt.
- Trudy Stork.

167
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,201
All right, Princess, come on, that's enough.

168
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,744
That's enough, come on. There.

169
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,643
- Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

170
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,054
That was the day a King Charles
met an Upper East Side princess.

171
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,552
Taxi!

172
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,996
And an Upper West Sider
went to see a house in Brooklyn.

173
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,274
- Where to?
- Brooklyn, please.

174
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,537
I don't go to Brooklyn.

175
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,447
Yeah, neither do I.

176
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:25,890
Miranda tried to see her future in Brooklyn,
but she just couldn't get there.

177
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,387
Shit, yeah.

178
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,428
God, you're good.

179
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:34,824
Fuck.

180
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,003
What? Jesus!

181
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,699
- What do I...
- Just give it to me.

182
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:47,271
- Man, that's a lot of hair. Did that hurt?
- No, I'm fine, really.

183
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:50,678
So where were we?

184
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,917
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,521
I'm gonna take a bath.

186
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,525
Apparently, Samantha wasn't the only one
losing something that night.

187
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:10,434
- Samantha's not gonna die, right?
- Of course not, she'll be fine.

188
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,768
Her hair started falling out
at a really bad time.

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,432
God, was she at work?

190
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:19,501
No, but she was definitely doing a job.

191
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,247
- No.
- Yes, ma'am.

192
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:25,946
- She's a trouper, she'll be fine.
- Yeah, I know.

193
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:29,244
But according to my Russian friend,
we are all in denial.

194
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,052
- Why, what does he say?
- It went like this:

195
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,218
Him: "Your friend might die, yes?"

196
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,751
Me: "No, you're an asshole."

197
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:41,155
- We had our first fight.
- Yeah, I picked up on that.

198
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,863
I mean, this is a man who is so sensitive
about so much.

199
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,701
But then this: "Death, deal with it."

200
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,264
I know he's Russian, but Jesus, come on.

201
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,703
- Maybe it's the language barrier.
- Well, it's definitely a barrier for me.

202
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,545
Is this who I'm seeing,
a man who kills mice and optimism?

203
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:02,921
It's not denial.
They got it early, she's gonna be fine.

204
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:06,817
You are aware that you've said
she'll be fine three times in half a block?

205
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,327
Yeah, I just picked up on that, too.

206
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,595
Anyway, how's it helping her,
if we freak out about it?

207
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,032
- It is our job to think positive.
- Exactly.

208
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,461
Can you believe we're actually
having this conversation?

209
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,906
No, and here's another thing
I never thought I'd be saying:

210
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,768
Steve wants us to move to Brooklyn.

211
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,075
Okay, stop!

212
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:32,908
- Now that is information I can't handle.
- I know.

213
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:36,386
I can't move to Brooklyn.
Even cabs won't go there.

214
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,225
My conversation with Miranda
brought me back to reality.

215
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:51,668
Or, more specifically,
the people who want us to live in it.

216
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:55,032
The world tells us to get real.

217
00:14:55,274 --> 00:15:00,177
But what happens when living in reality
means living in pain, fear...

218
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,079
or Brooklyn?

219
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:07,249
If a defense mechanism can get us through
the difficult times, how bad can it be?

220
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:10,017
Maybe the reality is, we need denial.

221
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:22,197
Denial had become Charlotte's best friend,
next to Harry.

222
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,633
Going for a run?

223
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,564
- What are you looking at?
- Just doing some research.

224
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,131
- On what?
- Adoption.

225
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:37,548
It could be just a backup, you know.
If we put ourselves on some lists...

226
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:40,552
by the time we know what's what,
we'll have some choices.

227
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,019
What do you think?

228
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,253
That seems like the right thing to do.

229
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,559
- Hi, Trudy.
- Hi.

230
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,567
Hi, Dandyridge.

231
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,437
I brought you a present.

232
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,407
- It's turkey bacon. Is that all right?
- Sure, she's not a show dog.

233
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,816
Do you like that?

234
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,051
Well, she really loves you.

235
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:21,454
Who wouldn't love her? Look at that face.

236
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,596
You know...

237
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:31,103
just because somebody doesn't perform
the way that you want them to...

238
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,003
doesn't mean that you
should just give up on them.

239
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,138
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,810
I swore I wouldn't cry.

241
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,911
It's just that I'm trying to have a baby,
and it's just not going very well.

242
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,517
That day, thanks to a dog
with one short leg...

243
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:53,557
Charlotte stopped denying
her shortcomings.

244
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,889
I don't care for babies...

245
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,590
or Labs.

246
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:06,268
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you kidding me? This is gonna be fun.

247
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,935
I used to do this when I was 16, at the mall.
Without the cancer part.

248
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:19,846
I have a movie premiere, and I need
to look like myself at my most fabulous.

249
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,945
Would you like natural hair or acrylic?

250
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,547
Sweetheart, does it look like I do acrylic?

251
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:30,952
These are our best natural hair:
Sassy and Pretty Me.

252
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,060
- No, and no.
- Fine.

253
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,530
Let's try this.

254
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,669
It's from the Rene of Paris line.

255
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,602
This looks like you.

256
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:50,107
Carrie, how do I look?

257
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,241
You look like Florence Henderson.

258
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,582
Florence Henderson in a bad wig.

259
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:59,891
Listen, I can't be on the red carpet
in a bad rug, do you understand?

260
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,356
I know.

261
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,925
This is Candy.

262
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,258
She's very popular.

263
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,440
I don't think you're listening.

264
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:19,808
I don't want to look like Candy.
I just want to look like myself.

265
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,042
Ma'am, these are wigs.

266
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,078
They're not ever gonna look
exactly like you.

267
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:28,143
That is not acceptable.

268
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,053
- We could style the bangs...
- Don't touch my head.

269
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:34,058
I've worked with many women with cancer.

270
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,262
I don't have cancer, I have a premiere.

271
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,924
And I don't want some second-rate wig
named after a hooker.

272
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,831
My hair is my thing.

273
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,699
This is bullshit.

274
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,372
Carrie, we're going.

275
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm just so angry.

276
00:18:57,082 --> 00:19:00,779
The chemo I can handle,
but this hair thing, it's too much.

277
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,311
- We'll find you a better wig.
- I have left hair all over Manhattan.

278
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,019
Every time the wind blows,
I have to check to make sure I'm not bald.

279
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,118
It's only temporary, it'll grow back.

280
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:14,155
And until then, I have to look like
a sick person, and I don't do sick person.

281
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:17,600
Because you're not. You're someone
who had a little blip of bad luck...

282
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,230
- and now it's over.
- What if it's not over?

283
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,798
- It's over, so over.
- What if it comes back?

284
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,111
I could die, Carrie, with really bad hair.

285
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,379
You are not going anywhere.

286
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,120
Carrie, please...

287
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,918
let me talk about what I'm afraid of, please.

288
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,519
The denial part of me wanted to say,
"You'll be fine."

289
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,523
Instead I said.'

290
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:47,222
Okay, I'm here.

291
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,201
Maybe I should just shave it all off.

292
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:56,503
Yeah, you could be one of those fantastic
bald women, who's all about earrings.

293
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,839
I better not look like fucking Kojak.

294
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,408
Yeah, cancer.

295
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,374
Turns out, not so hilarious.

296
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:12,083
After Samantha lost control, she did
the only thing she knew to get it back.

297
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:30,500
Babe.

298
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,569
What are you doing here?

299
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:39,106
I got your message. What do you mean,
you're not coming to my premiere?

300
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,947
I'm very busy.

301
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,493
I'm shaving my head, all right?

302
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:54,624
It's scary and awful, and you can't handle it.

303
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,693
- Who says I can't handle it?
- You freaked out after just a few little hairs.

304
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,830
- You freaked out, too.
- You lost your hard-on.

305
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,373
Shit happens.

306
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,206
Let me be here for you.

307
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:13,381
Listen, this is very intense,
and you're being very sweet...

308
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:17,013
but there is no way that you can relate to
what I'm going though.

309
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,025
What are you doing?

310
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,594
No, you can't, your hair's your thing!

311
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,255
Chill out, I'm busy.

312
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,538
And when I'm done cue-balling here,
I'm moving right over to you.

313
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:44,179
That night, Smith gave Samantha
the very best head of her life.

314
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:50,321
The next day, Miranda endured
her first out-of-borough experience.

315
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,619
Broken.

316
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:56,720
Broken.

317
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:59,191
You mean Brooklyn.

318
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,628
Here, let me show you what we could do.

319
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:08,771
We tear out these closets,
we make this the dining room...

320
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,672
which we wouldn't have to sleep in.

321
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:14,509
Open up this fireplace.
Imagine all of our friends over here...

322
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,878
the fire's going, having some beers...

323
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:20,112
None of our friends are coming to Brooklyn,
but continue.

324
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,692
This isn't just about you anymore.

325
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,694
Brady is only gonna get bigger, God willing.

326
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,864
And look at all this space.

327
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:37,595
You owe it to all of us,
you, me, Brady, Scout, Fatty...

328
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,464
to really look at this place.

329
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,331
We're a family.

330
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,037
Oh, my God.

331
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,203
I'm married.

332
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,475
And that was the reality.

333
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,951
I'm gonna take Brady and the dog outside.

334
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,578
You let me know what you think.

335
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,626
Come on, let's go out back. Yeah!

336
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,811
Let's chase the dog around.

337
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:25,480
You wanna go get him?

338
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:32,689
That day, Miranda couldn't deny
what was best for her family.

339
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,087
So what do you think?

340
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,068
We're very interested,
but I'll want to bring in an engineer.

341
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:50,438
I'd require a long escrow, and if the furnace
isn't up to code, I'll need it replaced.

342
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:54,605
And so, she negotiated her way
into her future.

343
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,760
And Samantha realized
she couldn't deny cancer.

344
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,206
She would never be exactly
who she was again...

345
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:26,138
so for that night, she decided to be Lil' Kim.

346
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:45,094
It was a very special delivery
from Miss Stork.

347
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:51,766
Oh, my goodness, thank you!

348
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:59,142
It was a girl, eight pounds, two ounces.

349
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:04,705
My goodness!
Hello, are you hungry, precious?

350
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:09,179
- Who is that?
- She's a present, can we keep her?

351
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:13,084
Anything that makes you smile like that,
we'd be crazy not to.

352
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,992
- What's her name?
- Princess Dandyridge Brandywine.

353
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,292
That's impossible, you got to change it.

354
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:22,891
What should we name you, pretty girl?

355
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,700
Who's the prettiest girl in the world?

356
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,264
Elizabeth Taylor.

357
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:35,172
Elizabeth Taylor Goldenblatt.

358
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:39,248
That was the day Elizabeth Taylor
moved in with Harry and Charlotte.

359
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:45,084
And something far less glamorous
moved in with me.

360
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:51,828
Oh, my God!

361
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,307
He will stay at the fancy neighbors' now.

362
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:05,133
Thanks.

363
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,278
I didn't think I would hear from you.

364
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:11,844
I was upset.

365
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:16,081
I need you to not talk, so that...

366
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,115
I can say this without you confusing me.

367
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:23,723
Samantha is my friend.

368
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:27,088
She's my family...

369
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,264
my insides.

370
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:33,802
She will be fine, because she has to be fine.

371
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,007
That's how important she is to me.

372
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:41,706
So for you to say that she may not be...

373
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:45,777
it feels very hurtful...

374
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:49,447
and really unnecessary.

375
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:51,846
Let me explain.

376
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,492
- My friend, who died...
- Oh, my God!

377
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,027
Wait.

378
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,361
When she died...

379
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,657
I was surprised.

380
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,427
The amount of pain...

381
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:10,207
I didn't want you to be surprised, like I was.

382
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,876
- You could have just said that.
- We are different.

383
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:18,548
Yes, we are.

384
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,711
I need my relationship
with a little bit of milk.

385
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,118
It is clear who is the writer here.

386
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:31,519
Your friend will be fine.

387
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,161
Thank you.

388
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,493
And I'm sorry about Sophie.

389
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:40,335
Thank you.

390
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:47,808
That night, for the first time,
we spoke the same language.

391
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,212
So while Samantha's life and
my life with the Russian would continue...

392
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:58,188
it was clear that Miranda's life,
as we knew it, was over.

393
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,518
Brooklyn.

394
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:03,627
I can't even say it, let alone live in it.
You'll all come visit, right?

395
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,653
Talk about denial.

396
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,925
Stop. We'll all come, won't we?

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,730
Well, I won't, I have cancer.

398
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,134
How long are you gonna
play that cancer card?

399
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,400
As long as it takes for you to move back.

400
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,305
But it's just a subway ride away.

401
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,708
A subway that goes under water.
That's not normal.

402
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,177
Another Manhattan?

403
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,042
Please, for all of us.

404
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:29,486
That night, Miranda was determined
to drink in as much Manhattan as she could.

405
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:34,054
Do you remember that awful apartment
that I had on 17th Street?

406
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,855
The one with the water bugs?

407
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,794
What about your horrifying studio sublet
on Riverside Drive?

408
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:39,990
I blocked it.

409
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:43,523
Man, I have had some
really shitty apartments here.

410
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,636
Why do I think living in Manhattan
is so fantastic?

411
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,706
Because it is.

412
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:50,935
Here we go.

413
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:55,742
It would be childish of us to deny
that our lives weren't changing...

414
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:59,147
but for this night,
none of us were going anywhere.

415
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:04,580
That's the thing about really good friends,
and a really great Manhattan.
