1
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,945
There are few things
I love as much as Sunday brunch.

2
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,640
You can sleep till noon

3
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,150
and still get eggs
anywhere in the city.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,584
Alcohol is often included.

5
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,383
And it's the one day

6
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,822
you get the single woman's
sports' pages -

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,090
"The New York Times"
wedding section.

8
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,787
This is so depressing.

9
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,228
The oldest woman on this page is 27.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,231
Now I'm depressed

11
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,199
and I haven't had coffee yet.

12
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,236
At least you have a boyfriend.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,704
That only means I'm getting laid.

14
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,502
On a regular basis.

15
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,201
I'll drink to that.

16
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,779
Until recently, the bride, 24,

17
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,542
worked as a supervisor

18
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,980
at Ogilvy & Mather. 24!

19
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,710
No more reading aloud.

20
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,320
I love how they say "until recently".

21
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,116
Meaning she quit her job

22
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,283
once she found her soul
mate /investment banker.

23
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,988
It's so retro.
I've got a rock on my finger.

24
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,655
Now I can stop pretending
to care about my career.

25
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,292
Until recently, the bride had a life
of her own.

26
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,838
You know who they marry?
The roman numeral guys.

27
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,135
- Charles Duffy Anderson IV.
- Ding, ding, ding.

28
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,246
The higher the number,
the worse the sex.

29
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:59,875
- I dated a III. He couldn't get it up.
- How bad must Henry VIII have been!

30
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,420
You give him head, he cuts yours off!

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,421
This couple met on a bike tour.

32
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,823
I just make it through spinning.
All the men are gay.

33
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,295
It's amazing how upset women get
over the marital status of strangers.

34
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,799
- What was that?
- Nothing.

35
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,796
- Let me see.
- Nothing to see.

36
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,032
You're such a bad liar.

37
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,417
Then there's
the occasional familiar face.

38
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:38,717
Well, it's official. He's married.
Where are my fries?

39
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:50,234
It's fine, all right?
I was prepared for this.

40
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,338
They had an engagement party
at the Plaza.

41
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,409
- Sometimes they break off.
- This one didn't. Let's move on.

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:03,379
Why is their wedding like
a short story? What's next, a movie?

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,485
It's fluff, it's PR.
Anybody could be this story.

44
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,780
Anybody who's getting married.

45
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,480
This is what I hate
about "The Sunday Times".

46
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,252
This and the country houses
I can't afford.

47
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:24,001
- You want to rent a movie?
- It's OK. I'm not gonna slit my wrists.

48
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,468
I just thought
you might want some company.

49
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,107
You know what?
I think I want to be alone.

50
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,234
- OK, I'm just gonna take the paper.
- Would you stop?

51
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,678
I know what you're gonna do.
You can't not read it.

52
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:43,220
You'll cry and it'll be awful.
Let's read it now and get it over with.

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,085
The couple met in Paris,
on the Ile St-Louis.

54
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,955
How original, they fell in love in Paris.

55
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,690
"I was alone at a café when the waiter
brought over a bottle of Pinot Noir

56
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,803
"from a handsome man at the bar",
the bride said, her eyes sparkling.

57
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,865
"When we'd finished the wine,
I knew I wanted to marry him."

58
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:08,275
You were drunk and he was
rich. This is just bad journalism.

59
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,440
Marry they did, in Southampton
at the bride's parents' estate.

60
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,450
There were only 50 guests.

61
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,419
"We wanted it intimate.
Just family and close friends."

62
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,821
- And "The New York Times".
- How intimate is that?

63
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,088
I don't hear Big
anywhere in this article.

64
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,825
She's calling the shots
and he's just along for the ride.

65
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,435
The bride carried calla lilies,
tied with a red ribbon.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,333
That's nice.

67
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,337
As she walked down the aisle

68
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,137
a saxophone played
"When A Man Loves A Woman".

69
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,405
Well, that's tacky.

70
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,879
No, that's Big.

71
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,995
What I wouldn't give
for a working fireplace.

72
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,797
- He wasn't the right man for you.
- I know that.

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,837
I know, it's not him.
It's the whole wedding.

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,032
And it's her... her!

75
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,412
You know, she's just...

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,041
you know, shiny hair,
style section... Vera Wang.

77
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:25,657
And I'm the sex column they run
next to ads for penile implants.

78
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,399
Big wasn't the only one
taking the plunge.

79
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,568
After more than a decade
of domestic independence,

80
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,340
Miranda had opened up
to a relationship...

81
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,176
Good morning.

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,182
...with a cleaning lady.

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,617
Good morning, Magda.

84
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,186
Do you know where
the coffee mugs are?

85
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,054
I moved them here.

86
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:07,291
- Now all glasses are together.
- I guess that makes more sense.

87
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:14,967
You know what? I always drink coffee
out of my law school class of '90 mug,

88
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,578
because it's bigger, and...
It's just what I always use.

89
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,842
I bring you nice herbal teas.
Tea is better for you.

90
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,817
Oh, thank you very much,
but I prefer coffee.

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,817
Thank you.

92
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,584
- Why do I have a rolling pin?
- It's for you to make pies.

93
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,422
It's good for women to make pies.

94
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,701
- Do you have a rolling pin?
- On me?

95
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,033
- In your kitchen?
- I use my oven for storage.

96
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:52,542
My cleaning lady brought me one.
She couldn't believe I didn't have one.

97
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,737
I can't believe
you have a cleaning lady.

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,348
Don't even start.
I feel guilty enough.

99
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,180
I hate being home when she is.
I feel like if I'm home,

100
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,517
I should be cleaning or making pies.
She says that's what women do.

101
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,216
Where did you find her,
in a time capsule?

102
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,954
I know. I don't need to make pies.

103
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,227
I'm practically a partner in a major
law firm. If I want pie, I can buy it.

104
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,632
I think I need this in a smaller size.

105
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,408
I'll get it for you, just hand it out,
there's no need...

106
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,804
Carrie?

107
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,281
And there she was,
Mrs. Big, all five foot ten of her.

108
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,681
Hey... Hi, Natasha.

109
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,687
I heard... I read...

110
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,192
Congratulations on the thing,
on the wedding.

111
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,194
This is Miranda, we're shopping.

112
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,333
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,460
That looks nice,
what you have on there.

114
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,662
You think?

115
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,004
I need something for this "Women In
The Arts" luncheon I helped organize.

116
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,204
- I'm on the steering committee.
- Really? I'm a member.

117
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:07,318
You know, I write,
so I am a woman in the arts.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,978
I go to that lunch every year...

119
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,219
...in clothes.

120
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,251
- So, you're going then?
- Yeah, I'm going.

121
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,689
- Great, I'll see you there.
- All right.

122
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,072
Oh, my God.

123
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,267
- Now, I can't find the invitation.
- Why did you say you'd go?

124
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:38,213
I've talked to her twice, once in
a cowboy hat, and once in my bra.

125
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,511
Like freakin'
Annie-get-your-clothes-on.

126
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,087
I would just like her
to see me looking normal.

127
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,158
- Just normal?
- I would prefer to look amazing.

128
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,194
Not like I'm trying,
just effortlessly striking.

129
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,265
I see. And will Big be at this event?

130
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,597
It's a "Women In The Arts" luncheon.
It's not about Big, it's about Natasha.

131
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,205
It seems to be a lot of trouble
for a woman.

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,571
Can you help me find out
when and where it is?

133
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,212
I can do better than that,
I'm coming too.

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,644
So, you support women in the arts?

135
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:15,776
I support you, and these bitches need
to be put in their places.

136
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,991
That night I modeled my wardrobe
in my head and vetoed everything.

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,185
Why did I care so much?

138
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,799
What was it about Natasha that
made me feel like the charity case?

139
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,368
Was it just that she had Big,
or was this bigger than Big?

140
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,597
I started to wonder.
Are there women in New York

141
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,572
just there to make us feel bad
about ourselves?

142
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,804
For Miranda, that woman
was a certain Ukrainian housekeeper.

143
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,178
- You're early.
- Yes, good morning.

144
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,244
Did you bring me this?

145
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,913
It's gift, to make your bathroom nicer.

146
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,892
Thanks. Did you move my hairdryer?
It used to be under the sink.

147
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,190
In the middle drawer.
Last week I organize for you.

148
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,732
No, that drawer
doesn't need organizing.

149
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,837
Magda had discovered Miranda's
"goodie-drawer".

150
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:13,437
I have a boyfriend, so it's not like
I'm sleeping with lots of different men.

151
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,812
For a long time there was no guy
and that's why I have the other thing.

152
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,681
- OK.
- You like this boyfriend?

153
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,749
- Yes.
- You want to marry this man?

154
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,283
I don't know.

155
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,490
Everybody wants to get married.
I am married 28 years.

156
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:40,128
Well, we'll see.
I don't know if I want to get married.

157
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,533
God bless you.

158
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,178
I don't need you to bless me.

159
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:57,721
I don't need God to bless me.
I'm fine with my life as it is.

160
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,118
It's like I hired my mother.

161
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:09,457
Manhattan has spas, where a woman
can pay to feel good about herself.

162
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,933
I can't believe she opened
your goodie-drawer.

163
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,402
Everybody knows
the night-stand is private.

164
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:19,135
- What do you have in there?
- The usual, condoms, vibrator...

165
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,802
- Massage oil, cigarettes.
- Nipple clamps.

166
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,449
- Really?
- Not for me, for them.

167
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,448
That's freakish.

168
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,679
What's in your goodie-drawer,
Robert's "Rules Of Order"?

169
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,881
- I don't have a goodie-drawer.
- Everybody has one.

170
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,654
- I've got a goodie-closet.
- I don't need to know what's in it.

171
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,957
Ditto. Nipple clamps
will suffice for today.

172
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,701
I'm not in the mood for steam,
it's too hot.

173
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,866
Then take off your towel, relax.

174
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,535
I don't feel like being relaxed in here.

175
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,743
There goes a woman who desperately
needs a goodie-drawer.

176
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,758
Charlotte?

177
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,460
- What's wrong?
- I was just hot.

178
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,154
OK, and...

179
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,769
And... I'm just not comfortable
being naked in public.

180
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,673
This isn't really public,
it's a ladies' locker-room.

181
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,802
- I didn't grow up in a naked house.
- I didn't either.

182
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,212
I bet she grew up in a naked house.

183
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,791
She might still live in a naked house.

184
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,860
Sweetie, who cares how you look
to other women.

185
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,293
You have a perfect body.

186
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,433
You're deluded.

187
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:26,231
Charlotte, you have a beautiful figure.

188
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,202
- Really?
- Yes!

189
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:33,141
Why was that women looking at me
like my thighs were too big?

190
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,079
Samantha always felt
good about herself.

191
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,846
But after her 80-minute massage,
she felt even better.

192
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,386
I just had the most intense massage.
Kevin goes down on you.

193
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,030
Samantha's was good,
but not that good.

194
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,397
- Are you serious?
- He's incredible. You should try him.

195
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,401
Samantha smiled,

196
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,837
but a woman with a goodie-closet
doesn't need to pay for head.

197
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,997
Celia!

198
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,777
- Forgot your key.
- Thanks, Kevin.

199
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,084
Then again, you can never have
too many massages.

200
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,779
Samantha immediately
got on the wait list

201
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,084
for Kevin's
next available appointment.

202
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:28,722
That night, Steve wasn't available.
Miranda chose the next best thing.

203
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:41,512
Magda was not only cleaning,
she was performing an exorcism.

204
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:48,375
Later that week, I had a religious
experience at Manolo Blahnik.

205
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,251
I need your opinion.

206
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,325
You can't afford them?

207
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,428
Can I get you something?

208
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:01,829
I'll have that incredibly rich-Iooking,
flourless chocolate thing.

209
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,960
- And a café au lait.
- I'll have a fruit cup.

210
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,871
- Now you're making me feel bad.
- No, get what you want.

211
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,046
This place has the best desserts.
The point of coming is to splurge.

212
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,049
That was a splurge.
Fruit has a lot of carbs.

213
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,653
Is there a new "Zone" book out?

214
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,255
I hate my thighs.

215
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,383
The problem is not your thighs.
The problem is your head.

216
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,860
Now... About the shoes.

217
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,033
Hold on...

218
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,228
I need these for the WITA luncheon.

219
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:43,239
The heels are almost high enough
to put me face to face with Natasha,

220
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,402
if Natasha wears flats.
But why would she wear flats?

221
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,672
Do they make the right statement?

222
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,043
What statement
do you want to make?

223
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:57,655
I am beautiful, powerful and don't care
you're only 25, and married my ex.

224
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,758
I thought you didn't have a complex
about your looks.

225
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,418
It's not a complex.
It's a Natasha specific obsession,

226
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,192
which will be over when she sees me,
at the benefit, looking fabulous,

227
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,464
in these shoes and a dress from
Bergdorf's that'll cost a month's rent.

228
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,507
Listen to you.
You don't have to prove anything.

229
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:23,239
You are stunning, intelligent
and funny. And what is she?

230
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,282
Married, that's all.

231
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,319
You could go to that luncheon,
wearing that,

232
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,820
and still be the most
incredible woman in the room.

233
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,257
Wow!
Why can't you do that for yourself?

234
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,731
That afternoon,
Charlotte faced her fear.

235
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,357
I'd kill for your breasts.

236
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,940
Meanwhile, Samantha had spent
the last half hour face-down,

237
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,443
picturing Kevin's face down on her.

238
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:08,248
- Is this pressure OK?
- Oh, yes. That is just fine.

239
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,854
Ready to turn over now?

240
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,617
I most certainly am.

241
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,398
- Is this OK?
- Yes.

242
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:34,273
- Is this OK?
- Yes.

243
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,306
Is this OK?

244
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,576
Yes.

245
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,952
Since they were running out of time,
she took the matter in her own hands.

246
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,232
Is this OK?

247
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,336
Apparently, it wasn't.

248
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,065
What kind of person
does such a thing?

249
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:07,406
To molest a trained professional
while he is trying to do his job.

250
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,414
Helena Rubinstein is
a civilized place, for civilized people.

251
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,850
I'm sorry, I can't allow you
to come back here.

252
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,388
I have to protect my staff.

253
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,889
Clearly, she meant Kevin's staff.

254
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,994
This isn't my fault.

255
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,791
I know that Kevin
went down on another customer,

256
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,195
and that's why
I booked the appointment.

257
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,837
The following Monday, Samantha
and I were the definition of civilized.

258
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,878
We officially became
ladies who luncheon.

259
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,882
It was entrapment, false advertising
and blatant discrimination.

260
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,611
You can't go down on one
and not the other.

261
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,188
I paid good money,
expecting to be eaten out.

262
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,893
This is not the conversation I wish
to have as my most amazing self.

263
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,087
- Do you see her?
- No...

264
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,789
But I do see Wendy Wasserstein
and Gloria Steinem.

265
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:07,405
- Believe me, you look stunning.
- You know what? I believe you.

266
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:12,937
Hello Mimi, Ms Carrie Bradshaw,
and Ms Samantha Jones.

267
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,414
I'm a member,
I just haven't been to an event, ever.

268
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,712
It's Bradshaw.

269
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,691
Here you are.
Wear your name tags.

270
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:31,318
Last year we had an incident
with Joyce Carol Oates.

271
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,624
I'm not sure the "Hello, my name is"
goes with the ensemble.

272
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,631
Hello, my name is Fabulous.

273
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,895
Oh, Natasha's not here yet.

274
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,041
- Natasha's not coming.
- What?

275
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,507
She's got a cold,
and didn't want to get everybody sick.

276
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,839
Here are your drink tickets.

277
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,243
I can't believe that bitch
is a no-show.

278
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,651
I'm the one who's sick.
Charged another outfit I can't afford.

279
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,622
Maybe bounced a cheque to charity,
just to prove I'm amazing.

280
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,092
I've never felt less so.
Let's just go.

281
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,496
I've paid $85, we're having our drinks.
What do you feel like?

282
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:15,072
- Loser on the rocks?
- Give me those tickets.

283
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,810
Who is this and what's she doing
in my bedroom?

284
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,675
Virgin Mary.

285
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,748
- And where's my other thing?
- What thing?

286
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,820
You know, the thing.
Don't make me say it.

287
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,923
The thing you replaced with this lady.

288
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,151
Bathroom, middle drawer.
Next to hairdryer.

289
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,293
No man will marry you if that is by
your bed. It says you don't need him.

290
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,967
What I don't need is another mother.

291
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,199
I have one in Philadelphia,
and that's close enough.

292
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,003
I need a housekeeper,
who will clean my apartment

293
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:57,171
and stop judging because I'm a 34
year old, single woman in New York.

294
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:03,913
I drink coffee, have sex, buy pies
and enjoy battery-operated devices.

295
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,526
If you can't deal with that,
I will find a housekeeper who can.

296
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,401
I also head the committee to match
mentors with underprivileged children.

297
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:22,006
It'd be wonderful if you'd be willing
to work with kids who want to write.

298
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,107
I write about sex.

299
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:28,906
Is that something they'd like to learn?
Writing about blow jobs?

300
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,073
We can always use help
in fundraising.

301
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,118
Carrie, this is Jenna.

302
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,813
- Hi, Jenna.
- Nice to meet you.

303
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,256
Jenna went to college with Natasha.
Go ahead, tell her what you told me.

304
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:48,559
OK, well, Natasha lived in my dorm,
freshmen year at Tulane.

305
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:52,795
Once, she showered with a guy
in the community bathroom.

306
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,604
And...

307
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,778
And she gained like ten pounds,
sophomore year.

308
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,439
Wow.

309
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,847
Ten pounds.
Thanks, Jenna.

310
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,451
Merry Christmas.

311
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,086
That's supposed
to make me feel better?

312
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,624
Six years ago
she had a weight problem?

313
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,421
It's something.

314
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,530
You had to love her for trying.

315
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,691
Samantha tried to make me feel good
by making Natasha sound bad,

316
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,894
but it only made me feel worse.

317
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,939
- Another drink?
- Another one and I'll lose my lunch.

318
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:34,511
When you get home you'll smile
because she was a porker in college.

319
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,943
Ten pounds does not a porker make.

320
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:46,023
- You're Samantha Jones.
- Yes. We met at Helena Rubinstein.

321
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,627
Katy, Leisle, look who's here.
The woman who got Kevin fired.

322
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,219
Thanks a lot!

323
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,696
- Yeah, thanks.
- Who's gonna fuck me now?

324
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,868
Kevin fucked you?

325
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,870
Turns out I wasn't the kind of member
those women in the arts needed.

326
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,504
That night, in her spotless apartment,
Miranda knew she'd been right

327
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,112
to take a stand
because of her night-stand.

328
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,009
Magda realized that single women
in New York never make pies,

329
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,247
but they sometimes make guys.

330
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,582
A few weeks later, I got something
in the mail from Women In The Arts.

331
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,993
It was a "Thank you for attending",
signed by Natasha.

332
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,898
Game over. I had to accept that in life,
some women are simply better.

333
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:36,472
No amount of shoes, or lack of pastry
or making of pies will change that.

334
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,508
I will never be the woman
with the perfect hair,

335
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,646
who can wear white and not spill on it.

336
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,407
And chair committees,
and write thank you notes.

337
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,551
And I can't feel bad about that.

338
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,878
"Sorry I couldn't be their."

339
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,588
T-H-E-l-R.

340
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,293
But I could feel good about this.

341
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:09,066
Miranda, it's good she got married.
The woman's an idiot.
