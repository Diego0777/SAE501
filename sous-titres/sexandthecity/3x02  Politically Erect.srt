1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,595
Ihad been dating politician Bill Kelley

2
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:51,199
for three weeks.

3
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:55,737
Since most of our time was spent
campaigning, I dressed the part.

4
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,907
I found some vintage Halston

5
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,099
and did a spin on Jackie Kennedy.

6
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,176
The early years.

7
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:10,919
Who here knows

8
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:12,715
what a city comptroller does?

9
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,814
You do?

10
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,823
We made a good match.

11
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:20,759
I was adept at fashion, he at politics.

12
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,525
This city's populace's passion,

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,635
Iove and devotion to their home...

14
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:29,567
Really, they're both
about recycling ideas

15
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,867
and making them seem
fresh and inspiring.

16
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:38,878
It is this love affair, this symbiotic
relationship between citizens and city,

17
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:42,484
that I promise to cherish and protect.

18
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,984
Thank you.

19
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,644
Great guy!

20
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:48,654
Yes, he is.

21
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:00,399
can we talk about proposition 1 14?

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,597
- What is that?
- You and me in the bedroom.

23
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:08,801
- Is that on the ballot?
- It ought to be. I'd back it.

24
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:11,606
And that's
whatever position you want.

25
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,107
Which way is the bedroom?

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,545
Put me down.

27
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,463
That was the night I had
my political consciousness raised.

28
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,232
How about a movie
Wednesday night?

29
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,498
Wednesday? I'm not sure.
I might be working.

30
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,266
Thursday, then.

31
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,638
oK, maybe Thursday. I'll see.

32
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,871
Do you have plans?

33
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:49,314
Steve, you can't just assume
I'm gonna be free every night.

34
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:53,048
Is it a date?

35
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:58,524
It could be a date, so I wouldn't
necessarily share that with you.

36
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:03,064
- I'd like to know. Who are you dating?
- Nobody in particular.

37
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,894
- Anybody specific?
- Is this the third degree?

38
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,903
I'm trying to figure out
when I get to see you again.

39
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,041
I'm not dating anyone else.

40
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,905
I'm not planning on
dating anyone else.

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,978
- I just want to see you.
- I see.

42
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,517
Exclusively.

43
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,720
I got it.

44
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:33,851
That's very sweet. I just
hadn't thought about things that way.

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,023
- So, think about it.
- oK.

46
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:42,399
Because I think if we really want
to see if it can work between us,

47
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:46,440
this time we got to make
the commitment to be exclusive.

48
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:52,006
oK. I hear you.

49
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,004
oK.

50
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,885
The truth was, there were
no other candidates in sight.

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,396
But Miranda wasn't ready
to let Steve win by default.

52
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,932
You're dating a politician and
you're not even registered to vote.

53
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:18,404
- It's the undecideds they're after.
- He's good-looking, he's got power...

54
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,599
It's got to be a turn-on.

55
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:24,611
Yeah, I'm dating
a potential comptroller. It's hot.

56
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:30,743
- I want to help out.
- You're not interested in politics?

57
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,751
It's a great way to meet men.

58
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:37,359
With carrie, we can meet the inner
circle and the interesting donors.

59
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,360
By interesting men
she means single and rich.

60
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:45,591
- Guys, he's not running for president.
- I'd vote for him. He's cute.

61
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:50,068
- So?
- I always vote according to looks.

62
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,140
I base my decision
on the swimsuit competition.

63
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:56,937
The country runs better
with a good-looking man in charge

64
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:01,743
Look at Nixon. No one wanted
to fuck him, so he fucked everyone.

65
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,547
- I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
- We need a president in a hat.

66
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:11,421
No one wears a hat anymore.
FDR, good president, wore a hat.

67
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:15,496
So busy picking a hat,
he forgot to get in the war.

68
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:20,226
- I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
- We tried to ignore that the first time.

69
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,234
It was his crisp, white shirts.

70
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,000
- Reminded me of my father.
- So, you were voting for your father.

71
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:30,612
There was something homoerotic
about Quayle and Bush.

72
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,238
- very Batman and Robin.
- Based strictly on looks,

73
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:39,013
- no one was cuter than JFK.
- or quicker to jump in the sack.

74
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,521
I'm glad you three weren't around
during the original 13 colonies.

75
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:46,526
I don't think our founding fathers
were very fuckable.

76
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,132
I heard that Thomas Jefferson
was a real fox.

77
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:54,235
There we were.
Just four girls talking politics.

78
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:58,601
Meanwhile, Miranda was facing a day
at the polls earlier than she expected.

79
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:02,676
Last night as we were walking home,
Steve asked me to go steady.

80
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,870
How sweet. They still call it that?

81
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,072
I don't know if I can make
that commitment.

82
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,275
How many other guys are you dating?

83
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,545
That's not the point. I'm so ambivalent
about Steve and moving forward.

84
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:18,160
You did let him back in your life.
There must be something there.

85
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:22,423
There's plenty there. Flaws that make
me not want to stick my neck out.

86
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,623
But there's great stuff too.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,327
Maybe I should be honest
and tell him what I really feel which is..

88
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,131
what if somebody
better comes along?

89
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,298
You gotta put a better spin
on it than that.

90
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,637
You see...that's my problem.

91
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:39,006
I don't know how to be political
in relationships.

92
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:43,948
It's time for the list. Things you like
about him. Things you don't like.

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,112
- See which is longer.
- That's so judgmental.

94
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,748
You are judgmental.
Put it to good use.

95
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:54,795
oK, fine. I'll make a list.

96
00:06:56,132 --> 00:07:00,432
Politics were always as relevant to me
as a new Erica Jong novel.

97
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:03,663
But I did find it interesting
that a discussion about politics

98
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,399
ultimately became
a discussion about sex.

99
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:10,944
And a discussion about sex
became a question of politics.

100
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:17,245
Which led me to wonder, if the two
were inextricably linked, and if so...

101
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,253
can there be sex without politics?

102
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,288
That night, Samantha discovered
her own hot, new candidate.

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,623
Hey, Pink Lady.
can I buy that for you?

104
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,563
Maybe, if you promise never to use
a lame line like that again.

105
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,964
It worked didn't it?
Jeff Fenton.

106
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:35,228
Samantha Jones.

107
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:38,168
You are damn attractive.
And that is not a line.

108
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,774
How long have you been sitting here?

109
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,605
- My first drink.
- So, you're just naturally forward?

110
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm aggressive.
I run a successful hedge fund.

111
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,579
My life is about calculating risks.

112
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:54,314
Telling a beautiful lady she's attractive
is the safest bet I've made all day.

113
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,219
Thank you.

114
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,223
- You like to ski?
- I love it.

115
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,091
We have a house in Sun valley.
How long have you been skiing?

116
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:06,394
- on and off for years.
- I can tell. You've got the legs for it.

117
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,470
Got to run back to the office.

118
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,641
How about dinner this week?

119
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,868
I told you all about me
but I didn't hear about you.

120
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,946
Samantha never felt better.
There were gorgeous women

121
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,948
sitting on either side
and Jeff had elected her.

122
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,551
Fenton Partners.

123
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,984
That's right.
We're up 320 0%0 for the year.

124
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,486
Samantha Jones. Public Relations.
very nice.

125
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,187
You must do well.
Who's gonna say no to you?

126
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:39,095
- What about dinner? Friday night?
- I think that might work.

127
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,965
Just as her self-esteem
was soaring right off the charts...

128
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,041
Nice to meet you, Pink Lady.
I'll give you a call.

129
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,076
Bye.

130
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,450
Later that week,

131
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,918
I brought "the single ladies coalition
to elect Bill Kelley" to a fundraiser.

132
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,253
What is the height difference between
a short person and a little person?

133
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,452
- A little person?
- A midget.

134
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,689
- A midget or a dwarf?
- What's the difference?

135
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,926
Little person is the proper way
to refer to an adult under 5 feet.

136
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,401
I agreed to go on a date
with a very short person.

137
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,438
I didn't realize he was so short.

138
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:23,772
Sitting down he was proportional.
Standing, he barely clears my nipples.

139
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,971
That may be the perfect height.

140
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,946
I can't cancel
just because he's a munchkin.

141
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,451
This is a politically incorrect
conversation for a political fundraiser.

142
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,089
Less than five feet is unacceptable.

143
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:38,351
I have to go mingle.
There are a lot of cute guys here

144
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,155
and these things
never last beyond two martinis.

145
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,389
charlotte was running
her own campaign.

146
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:48,003
She wanted to be elected wife
before the year was out.

147
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,798
- There's Miranda.
- Give me that.

148
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:53,305
Hey, you made it.

149
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,705
Tell me,
why are we voting for this guy?

150
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,816
He wants an investigation into
the Board of Education for waste,

151
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:06,215
and he's against large corporations
wasting your tax dollars.

152
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,516
- I'm sleeping with him.
- Good enough for me.

153
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:12,056
come on, I'll introduce you.

154
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,263
Jesus christ,
he talks more than I do.

155
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:21,563
This is the lovely Miranda Hobbes.
And her friend Steve Brady.

156
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,535
- Hi.
- I've heard great things about you.

157
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,837
You must be reading my clippings.
I pay people a lot to say nice things.

158
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,344
If you win, maybe you can fix
a couple of parking tickets.

159
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:37,009
I owe New York city $500. I figured
I need the money more than they do.

160
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:41,213
It's a joke!
come on, he knows I'm kidding.

161
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,683
- I'll get us a drink. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

162
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,362
Excuse me.

163
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,024
The dumb jokes. con.

164
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,001
cute butt...pro.

165
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,870
I don't believe in the Republican Party
or Democratic Party.

166
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,511
I just believe in parties.

167
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,639
charlotte was stumping for her cause,
and making newfriends.

168
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:12,412
I love Liechtenstein.
But I loved comic books as a kid.

169
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,251
But that's great. His work
is accessible on so many levels.

170
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:21,562
Sweetheart, this is charlotte.
She runs a gallery downtown.

171
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,960
charlotte, this is
my fiancee catherine.

172
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,624
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

173
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,766
- Stanford!
- Hi.

174
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,172
I can only stay a few minutes, I have
tickets to the "vagina Monologues".

175
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,335
Why?

176
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,345
I don't eat at the restaurant,
but I can still hear the specials.

177
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:46,954
- carrie, give me a sip of your drink.
- This is my friend, Stanford Blatch.

178
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:50,250
- Bill Kelley.
- I represent the queer vote.

179
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,589
If you can carry chelsea,
you've got the city locked up.

180
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm not worried about chelsea.
Have you seen my ass?

181
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,196
Got my vote.

182
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,769
- 12 o'clock.
- Excuse me.

183
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:09,210
- Who's that guy?
- That's his campaign manager.

184
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:13,439
- Fix me up.
- How do you even know he's gay?

185
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:16,449
I've seen him rollerblading
on 8th Avenue.

186
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,744
That's enough.

187
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,320
Please?

188
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,157
Great, now I'm a first lady and a pimp.

189
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,996
Hey, excuse me.

190
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:37,400
This is awkward, so feel free
to stop me at any time, but...

191
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,235
there's a person here
who would like to meet you.

192
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,276
- oK.
- A guy.

193
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,539
Keep going.

194
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,616
It's the guy right over there.

195
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:58,990
You mean the blonde guy
with the great arms.

196
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:10,863
Actually, no. It's the bald guy,
with the great sense of humor.

197
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,641
- Do you knowthe blonde guy?
- No.

198
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,371
- He's really much more my type.
- oK.

199
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,744
Well... Go Kelley.

200
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:27,182
I wondered howto handle
this political hot potato.

201
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:33,021
- He's not gay.
- I could have sworn he was.

202
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,789
I realized
I was getting good at politics.

203
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:40,367
I'm just so at the place
where I'm ready to settle down.

204
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:45,735
It seems like a miracle when two nice
people like you can find each other.

205
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,933
We met in the most unusual way.

206
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,578
one of my girlfriends threw a party

207
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,977
where all the women brought a man
they weren't interested in.

208
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,677
- Somebody brought Bob.
- The rest is history.

209
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,788
I love that!

210
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:06,053
one woman's trash
is another woman's treasure.

211
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,187
Bill raised $6,000 that night.

212
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,333
It really got him in the mood.

213
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,597
You know, you're the first woman
in ages I've felt this intimate with.

214
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:20,502
You're so beautiful.
So funny...you're great.

215
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,301
Thank you.

216
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,537
I love making love to you.

217
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,045
The feeling is mutual.

218
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,912
Is there anything you want or need
that I'm not doing?

219
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,349
- No, it's great.
- 'cause I want to know.

220
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:36,252
- I want to make you happy.
- I am happy.

221
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:40,418
What about you? Is there anything
you want or need that I'm not doing?

222
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,585
No.

223
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,131
- Well...maybe one thing.
- What?

224
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,170
Well, I would love
to get you in the shower.

225
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,068
Get each other all fresh and clean.

226
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,969
That sounds nice.

227
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,140
And then...
I'd like you to pee on me.

228
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:10,783
I would be worried.
The pee could be foreplay.

229
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,792
- My God!
- Where there's smoke.

230
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:18,399
It's typical of men in power. They love
to be dominated. Humiliated.

231
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:19,829
What did you say?

232
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,130
I told him I'd just gone,
maybe another time.

233
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,331
I can't keep saying that forever.

234
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,342
I peed on a guy once during sex,
but it was an accident.

235
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,504
- What did he say?
- I don't think he noticed.

236
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,549
I once had to stop eating meat
for six months.

237
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:41,553
So this is what it's come down to...
ready, set, pee?

238
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,817
Sometimes with the right guy
you have to make concessions.

239
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:48,861
- There's always gonna be something.
- Are you advocating that I do this?

240
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,431
Why not?
He's a great-looking political prince.

241
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,367
Sure, it's practically a fairytale..
"The Princess And The Pee".

242
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:02,574
If you can't work it out with
Bill, bring him to my party on Friday.

243
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,372
Everyone is bringing a guy
they're no longer interested in.

244
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,948
That's a great idea,
I can bring my short guy.

245
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:12,917
You're dating a munchkin and
I'm following the yellow brick road.

246
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:17,684
A couple of nights later, and no closer
to a solution, I had a date with Bill.

247
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,986
We went to
his favorite lndian restaurant,

248
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,154
that boasted the hottest curry
in the city.

249
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,357
So I just got some new polls.

250
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,832
I'm ahead in Manhattan and Brooklyn
but I'm lagging in the Bronx.

251
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:33,134
I may have to spend another $15,000
to buy myself some voter turnout.

252
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,367
Pretty hot, isn't it?
Have some water.

253
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,842
No, I'm fine.

254
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,814
Excuse me, can I get another one?
You want a beer?

255
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:45,146
So, I read your column yesterday.

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,448
- You did?
- It's great. very funny.

257
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:52,458
Just one question. Who's
the handsome politico you refer to?

258
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,995
He's just some other fellow
I'm seeing in Washington.

259
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:01,459
- You don't mind, do you?
- My life is an open book. It has to be.

260
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,867
What I love about the column
is the way you feel about it.

261
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:12,445
It's mutual.
Even if I can't put it in print like you.

262
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,813
I am so crazy about you.

263
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,648
Me too.

264
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,150
I was hoping we could spend
the night together

265
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,452
but I have an early
meeting with the Brooklyn...

266
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,653
That's no problem.

267
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,696
Rain check?

268
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:39,238
That Friday night,
charlotte threw her "used date party".

269
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,639
Hi, you made it!

270
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,007
There are so many eligible men here.

271
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,208
Hi charlotte, nice apartment.
can I get you something to drink?

272
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,717
Yes, immediately, if not sooner.

273
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,447
You brought Stanford?

274
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,854
You said to bring a man
you're not interested in.

275
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,722
You're making a mockery
of this party.

276
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,330
- carrie, charlotte!
- Hi!

277
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:06,399
- This is Jeff Fenton.
- Ladies.

278
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,866
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.

279
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,198
- I'll take your coat.
- Take your time.

280
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:15,439
Mingle.

281
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,136
Is he the smallest man
you've ever seen?

282
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,544
If you'll excuse me
I have to meet my eligible guests.

283
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:24,618
I've got to get busy too.

284
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,153
- carrie!
- Hey, what are you doing here?

285
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:40,427
I figured, before I finalize the list,
I should see what's out there.

286
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:47,098
- How's that list going?
- Great, fine.

287
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:51,705
I'm guessing
that's Samantha's little friend.

288
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,872
You gotta go to cuba now.
Another year will be too late.

289
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,813
can't you get arrested for going?

290
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,419
Fly through canada.
They love Americans.

291
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,251
- I'll e-mail you some of my pictures.
- I'd love to see them.

292
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,690
- charlotte, right?
- Right, and...

293
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,457
- Greg Miller.
- very nice to meet you, Greg Miller.

294
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,773
- Having any luck?
- Excuse me?

295
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:24,605
- Meeting someone.
- I'm already here with somebody.

296
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:29,643
Yeah, an ex girlfriend, right?

297
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:32,082
What are you talking about?

298
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:34,485
Get a clue.

299
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,591
- You brought me here to dump me?
- Not exactly.

300
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,996
I thought, maybe you could meet
someone your own size.

301
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,162
Sweetheart, give me an hour in bed,
you'll swear I'm the Jolly Green Giant.

302
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:54,866
- Really?
- I'm the best you've ever had.

303
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,672
She felt so politically incorrect
about dumping a man for his height.

304
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,111
She felt she had to sleep with him.

305
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,116
Fine. Let's go.

306
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,060
oK, I'm ready to go.
There's nobody here for us.

307
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,659
Speak for yourself.

308
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:17,162
If these guys are in their thirties
and these women don't want them,

309
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,199
there might just be
a little something for me.

310
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,393
Talk to you tomorrow.

311
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,275
Hi.

312
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:34,814
I'm an adventure travel junkie. I took
the year off after business school.

313
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,178
Trekked the old spice trail in Asia.

314
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:41,288
Talking to Greg, charlotte felt
like she had unearthed a rare coin

315
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,788
that some other woman
had discarded.

316
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:48,453
This is my ex, Belinda Peters,
she hooked me up on this thing.

317
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,227
You must be a friend of Karen's.
Thanks for bringing this great man.

318
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,860
You're welcome.
can I talk to you for a minute?

319
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,098
Sure. Excuse me.

320
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,702
Bye. Thanks for coming.

321
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:12,348
once Melinda saw
Greg talking to another woman,

322
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,388
he suddenly looked
all shiny and new again.

323
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,195
That night, Jeff proved to Samantha

324
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,396
that he more than made up
for his shortcomings.

325
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:42,773
Samantha told us later it was like
having sex with a horny smurf.

326
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:49,288
Meanwhile, across town, Steve was
busy stuffing Miranda's ballot box.

327
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:04,197
You know, I'm not looking for a quick
answer in the monogamy thing.

328
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:07,864
It's probably something
that's got to happen on its own.

329
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:17,647
It's just that I wanted you
to know how I feel.

330
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:20,049
You're the best woman I've ever met.

331
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:26,160
I want you to know...to know that.

332
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:33,533
I love you, Miranda.
I really do.

333
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:43,202
Steve had just said the one big
pro that outweighed all the cons.

334
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:48,543
Later that week, Samantha put her
heels away and gave Jeff a chance.

335
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,845
Little boy's room.
I'll be right back.

336
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,864
Samantha was stunned.

337
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,300
It was one thing to date a man
who went to the little boy's room.

338
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:15,842
Another to date one who still shopped
at the little boy's department.

339
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,308
Samantha!

340
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:22,382
I'm not feeling very well.
I've got to go. Goodnight.

341
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,609
Wait, I'll take you.

342
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,148
I'm not really sick. Look, Jeff...

343
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,453
I can't do this. It's not a good idea.
I don't want to lead you on.

344
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:35,824
Lead me on?
You came five times the other night.

345
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,864
- It's not really that...
- Then, what?

346
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,366
What happened
in the past five minutes?

347
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,599
- You shop at the boy's department.
- So, what?

348
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,335
The clothes fit me better,
plus they're cheaper.

349
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,345
Where do you shop,
the big and tall whore store?

350
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,815
You're nothing but a big dick
with a little man attached.

351
00:23:57,986 --> 00:24:02,753
You're nothing but a big pair of tits,
with too much extra leg room.

352
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,093
Surprisingly, Samantha had found
what she was really looking for.

353
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,629
And it had nothing to do with size.

354
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,767
Somebody get me a booster chair.

355
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:17,337
She'd found a man who made
her laugh. They dated for two weeks.

356
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:21,373
Though he was short, it was
a long relationship for Samantha.

357
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:26,903
That night, parched and nervous,
I spent another night with Bill.

358
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,107
- Man, that was great.
- Yes, it was.

359
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,216
come on, let's take a shower.

360
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,187
come on, get in while it's hot.

361
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,220
- can I talk to you about something?
- oK.

362
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:24,501
I've been giving this peeing thing
a lot of thought,

363
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:29,302
and while I think it's totally fine
that that's what you're into, I just...

364
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:32,105
It's just never really been my thing.

365
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:33,903
oh, yeah?

366
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:39,145
Yeah, so I thought instead,
maybe you could close your eyes

367
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,552
and I could dribble warm tea on you.
That might feel good.

368
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,059
or...maybe...

369
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,725
...you might think it's fun

370
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:54,597
to hear the sound of running water
when we have sex.

371
00:25:56,037 --> 00:26:01,202
And, if things got really serious
between us, I could...

372
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:05,813
maybe, even, leave the bathroom door
open sometime.

373
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,283
Although, I'm really not sure how
comfortable I'd be with that either.

374
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,780
You know, there's something
I want to tell you too.

375
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,553
Some people connected
with the campaign read your column...

376
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:23,629
and they had a different take on it.

377
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:30,133
- What does that mean?
- They said it was funny and clever,

378
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:33,138
but that it was a lot about sex.

379
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:40,043
They don't think I should date
a sex columnist before the election.

380
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:43,249
They thought it was kind of seamy.

381
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:52,217
Wait a second, I may write about sex,
but you like people to pee on you.

382
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,395
Yeah, but nobody knows about that.

383
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:12,011
I realized that politics had entered
my bedroom as well as my bathroom.

384
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:17,742
I decided that my bravest political act
would be to tell the truth.

385
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:27,257
I didn't use his real name.
It was much more political not to.
