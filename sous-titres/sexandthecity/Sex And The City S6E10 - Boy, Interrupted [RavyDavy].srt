1
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:54,532
I didn't go to my high school reunion.

2
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:57,468
So when my high-school sweetheart
called me for a reunion...

3
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:58,765
I was curious to see...

4
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,400
if he looked like the boy I used to
make out with in front of my locker.

5
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,774
Can you tell me
how to get to Chemistry class?

6
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:07,075
Actually, he looked better.

7
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:10,209
My God, Jeremy!

8
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,619
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

9
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,883
Wow! You look great!

10
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:20,222
I knew you looked great
'cause I saw you on the cover of your book.

11
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,523
But I have to say, even better in person.

12
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,086
God, I'm so glad you called.

13
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,792
I'm going to be spending the month
in Connecticut, so...

14
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,027
I had to look you up.

15
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:32,294
How are you? I heard you married
somebody that you met in business school.

16
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:35,034
Yeah. I got divorced, like, two years ago.

17
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:37,269
Really miscalculated that one.

18
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,178
So I'm on my own again.

19
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,876
How about you?
Are you seeing anybody or...

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,113
- Nope. Wide open.
- How is that possible?

21
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:50,179
My high school boyfriend
spoiled me for life.

22
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,691
Right. Me and my AMC Pacer.

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,354
Oh, the Pacer! Oh, man!

24
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,990
- I put our names down for a table.
- Great.

25
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,194
Look, earlier you said
maybe you might have dinner plans.

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,134
Was that in case I turned out to be a...

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,573
Yeah, maybe.

28
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:12,442
But my fictional plans fell through...

29
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,911
so I'm available.

30
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,643
Miranda had no plans that night...

31
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,584
so she was thrilled
when her cute, new neighbor stopped by.

32
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,247
I didn't expect you home
on a Saturday night.

33
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,758
Motherhood.

34
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:29,356
So what's my excuse?

35
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,622
I just got Brady to sleep.

36
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,859
- Now, do you sing to him?
- Only if he's been bad.

37
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,595
Listen, I have these two courtside seats...

38
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:42,767
for the Knicks charity game
at the Garden next Friday night.

39
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,344
- Would you want to go?
- I would love to.

40
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:46,434
Great.

41
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:51,015
- Great. I'll look for you there.
- Okay.

42
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:55,379
- Thanks so much.
- Good night.

43
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:57,717
You, too.

44
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:02,126
Miranda wasn't sure if it was a charity game
or just charity.

45
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,622
I didn't even ask
what you were doing in Connecticut.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,225
Nothing, for a change.

47
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:13,295
I spent the last decade
working my ass off in Denver...

48
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,739
so I decided to take a month off.

49
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,273
Spend some time at sea level.

50
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:22,543
So I've just been relaxing in the country,
sorting through some things, you know.

51
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,750
Sometimes you need to get away.

52
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,655
Sometimes you wonder
why you stayed away so long.

53
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,931
Well, this is my place.

54
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:44,669
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah, I love it here.

55
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,670
I feel like I want to kiss you, but I...

56
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,942
- I don't know what...
- I know. It's very unclear.

57
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,416
I mean, this isn't a first date.
We've already dated.

58
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,248
- And we've kissed.
- Many times.

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,881
- Hours.
- We were in a lip-lock for most of 1982.

60
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,947
So...

61
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,651
what's one more kiss?

62
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,362
You mean business.

63
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,388
That's a lot better
without the gearshift sticking up my ass.

64
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:45,321
It was a romantic, hot summer night...

65
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,425
followed by a miserable, hot summer day...

66
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,630
which was the fourteenth miserable,
hot summer day in a row.

67
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:57,336
- Samantha Jones. How are you?
- Great, Phoebe. How are you?

68
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,515
Refreshed. We just dropped by
the Soho House for a dip.

69
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:05,551
I mean, what else can you possibly do
in this heat...

70
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:10,556
except sit by the pool and drink cocktails
while they mist you with Evian.

71
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,353
- Isn't it the best?
- It's fabulous.

72
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,657
I'm running to a lunch,
otherwise I'd be up there myself.

73
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,423
Toodles.

74
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,724
There's a pool a block from my apartment
and I can't get in.

75
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,735
- What pool?
- At the Soho House.

76
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:26,795
You have to be a member
and I'm on a bullshit wait list.

77
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:30,570
- Don't they know who you are?
- And, more importantly, who we are...

78
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:32,703
who need to be at the pool with you.

79
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,680
You know, in high school,
all you had to do was jump a fence...

80
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,944
and you could be in somebody's pool.

81
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,476
Speaking of high school,
I saw my high-school sweetheart...

82
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:45,748
and I think I might like him. Again.

83
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,884
- Is that crazy?
- No, I love this.

84
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,360
You could end up
with your high-school boyfriend.

85
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,989
Okay, let's not jump the gun.

86
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:57,560
It was the best date I've had in a long time
and I wasn't even thinking it was a date.

87
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,766
- When he kissed me good night...
- He kissed you good night?

88
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,707
It was wild.

89
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:08,714
Because I actually remembered
what it felt like to kiss him.

90
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:12,218
Imagine if you slept with him.
Talk about a homecoming.

91
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,684
No!

92
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,887
- We never went all the way.
- Why not?

93
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:18,549
Because we were kids. We wanted to wait.

94
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,992
And now, I think we've waited long enough.

95
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,557
You're marrying him.

96
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,861
Will you stop? He doesn't even
live in New York. He lives in Denver.

97
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,926
- People move. It would be so romantic.
- Or tragic. Seriously.

98
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,628
If I had the guy in high school...

99
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,642
what have I been doing
for the past 20 years?

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,234
Why did you two break up?

101
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:41,872
I broke up because I thought,
"There must be better guys out there."

102
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,314
Turns out, there aren't.

103
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:48,782
That night I started thinking
about my retro relationship.

104
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,948
Since high school, most women I know...

105
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,755
have acquired much better taste
in clothes, hairstyles, and food.

106
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,227
But what about in men?

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,136
Maybe we were better off
when we thought less and kissed more.

108
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:08,207
Have we graduated
past our ability to find true love?

109
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:13,102
When it comes to matters of the heart,
did we have it right in high school?

110
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,916
Samantha was too cool
to belong to any clubs in high school...

111
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:23,319
so she refused to believe
that any club was too cool for her now.

112
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,984
Especially since New York in August
is not cool at all.

113
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,823
- May I help you?
- I hope so.

114
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:31,455
I'd like to know
what's holding up my membership.

115
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,624
I've been on the wait list since June.

116
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,863
Yes, I'm sorry, but we are not
currently admitting any new members.

117
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:40,394
The pool is so fabulous,
we're at capacity every day.

118
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:46,679
- Do you know who I am?
- No, I don't.

119
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,044
But we can't accommodate you right now.

120
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:54,009
Can I at least use the restroom before I go,
or is there a wait list for that as well?

121
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,818
Down the corridor on your left,
the door marked "WC."

122
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,230
Miss, did you leave your card on the sink?

123
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:15,202
Oh, yes. Yes, I did. Thank you so much.

124
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,867
Since they didn't seem to know
who she was at the Soho House...

125
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,244
she figured she could be
Annabelle Bronstein.

126
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:33,789
The next day,
Samantha tested the waters with her fake ID.

127
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:38,327
Excuse me, can I get you
something to drink, Miss Bronstein?

128
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,501
Yes, but I'll just pay cash.

129
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,933
And please, call me Annabelle.

130
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,206
Meanwhile, a fight was about to break out
in the cafeteria.

131
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,715
But this time,
Cafeteria was a trendy restaurant in Chelsea.

132
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:01,120
- Thank you.
- God, I hate him.

133
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,146
Come on, we're going over there.

134
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,590
- Why?
- Because you're in a tank top.

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,054
Really.

136
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,589
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

137
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,790
You're here. What a small world.

138
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,235
That's Chelsea for you. Can't swing a dick
without running into someone you know.

139
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:23,638
We'd love to stay and chat, but
we have to go get our tuxes for the prom.

140
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,233
Did you say "the prom"?

141
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:29,815
Yes, it's a big fundraiser
at the gay-lesbian-bi-transgender center.

142
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:34,081
- I'm on the decorations committee.
- What's the theme, "Queer and Queerer"?

143
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:39,519
I have the best memories of my prom.
I was the prom queen.

144
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,082
Of course you were, darling.

145
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:45,525
- I missed my prom in high school because...
- You were gay.

146
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,795
No. My girlfriend and I broke up
the night before because...

147
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,393
You were gay.

148
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,607
- No, I wasn't gay until...
- You were born.

149
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,139
Never mind. Goodbye, Charlotte.

150
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,541
- Bye.
- Bye, Marcus.

151
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:10,780
Those two should be going to
the gay-lesbian-and-prostitute prom.

152
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,249
- Be nice.
- What?

153
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:16,591
I happen to know
that Marcus used to be a gay escort.

154
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:20,462
- He was not.
- Honey, wake up and smell the K-Y.

155
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,865
I was flipping through
a vintage issue of Honcho.

156
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:26,565
I saw his ad in the Rauncho section.
He called himself Paul.

157
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,005
Worst hustler name I ever heard.

158
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,109
He and Stanford are in love.

159
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:34,772
Well, according to Honcho,
he used to be in love all over town.

160
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,843
- You are mistaken.
- There's a picture. I'll send you the ad.

161
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,546
- I don't want to see it.
- I'm sending it, prom queen.

162
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,918
- What can I get you?
- Cute waiter.

163
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,258
I wish I didn't know this.

164
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,827
Do you think Stanford knows?

165
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,598
Probably not, so maybe we shouldn't
talk about it in Madison Square Garden.

166
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,174
I don't think that these people
know those people.

167
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:11,343
- Look at how cute he is.
- He is gorgeous.

168
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,056
He looked at me.
Did you see him look at me?

169
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,318
- He totally likes you.
- You think?

170
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:20,984
Look at these seats.

171
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,223
You're right.
These seats are too good to be casual.

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the Knicks City Dancers.

173
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,031
Did I ever tell you I was a cheerleader?

174
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:37,804
No, because you knew
I would mock you endlessly.

175
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,336
Did you used to do that?

176
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:08,366
No, we just did some herkies
and some kicks.

177
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,822
- What is she doing?
- The blonde one in front?

178
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:37,127
- She's flirting with your boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

179
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,133
What is she, like, 21?

180
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,478
It was Friday night, it was the big game...

181
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,538
and Miranda was jealous of a cheerleader.

182
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:56,788
Two hours later, the game ended
and Miranda felt like the loser.

183
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,248
Okay, let's just go.

184
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,792
No, you have to go over there
and talk to him.

185
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,887
- He's talking to her.
- You are better than her.

186
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,761
Go on. You can do it.

187
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,837
- Are you gonna do a herkie now?
- Just you go over there and flirt a little bit.

188
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,365
Go. Go.

189
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,238
The Knicks and Madison Square Garden
thank you for coming.

190
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,507
Have a safe trip home.

191
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,344
That's it. I'm out.

192
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,146
Meanwhile, I invited Jeremy to come over
and watch a movie...

193
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:32,123
which in high school was code for,
"Come over and make out."

194
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,723
And happily, it still was.

195
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:38,161
I've gotta run.
Last train leaves in half an hour.

196
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,097
I think you should stay.

197
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,893
I think we should go all the way.

198
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,429
- All the way?
- We never did.

199
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:51,773
And now we can, and your mother
won't walk in with her laundry and her TaB.

200
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:54,743
That's true.

201
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,949
Carrie, I need to be honest with you
about something.

202
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,952
That's the worst thing you can hear
from someone you really like.

203
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,117
I'm not really just taking time off.

204
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,317
I'm sort of in a...

205
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,893
mental institution.

206
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,971
No, actually,
that's the worst thing you can hear.

207
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:23,206
I wanted a man who would commit,
not a man who was committed.

208
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,403
Apparently, we have to be more specific.

209
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,811
- But how is he able to see you?
- Did he escape?

210
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,442
No, he's voluntary.

211
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:34,042
He says it's not really a mental institution...

212
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,816
it's a therapeutic community.

213
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,686
- Which one?
- Juno-Spears.

214
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,522
That's supposed to be a good one.
I've had clients go there.

215
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,357
Really? Why haven't we heard about that?

216
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,865
Because I'm good at my job. No one
wants to admit they're in a loony bin.

217
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,868
- On a first date.
- It's all humiliating.

218
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,300
Think about what we have to go through
to date.

219
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,068
I am 38,
and I am competing with a cheerleader.

220
00:14:56,142 --> 00:15:00,044
And even when you get the guy, you never
know what fun surprise might be revealed.

221
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,080
Let me tell you something, ladies.

222
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:06,013
In a good relationship,
there are no surprises.

223
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,879
I know everything about Marcus,
and Marcus knows everything about me.

224
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,863
I don't think he knows everything.

225
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,024
What?

226
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:23,791
What?

227
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,968
Charlotte, like all girls,
learned at an early age...

228
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,497
that the only way to get rid of information
you don't want to have...

229
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,804
is to pass it on.

230
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:35,539
Oh, my God! Is this real?

231
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:39,142
Anthony found it
in an old issue of Honcho magazine.

232
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,179
Let me see that.

233
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,885
Oh, my! Is that Marcus?

234
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,355
- What is that?
- Nothing.

235
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,759
Okay, hand it over.

236
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,193
Okay, hand it over.

237
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,007
Where did this come from?

238
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,703
Someone better tell me where
this came from right now. I'm not kidding.

239
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,341
- I got it from Carrie.
- I got it from Miranda.

240
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,817
- I got it from Charlotte.
- I got it from Anthony...

241
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,446
but I told him you and Marcus
were very much in love.

242
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,218
Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love.

243
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,853
But like the Knicks,
her team was having a bad season.

244
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:26,489
Well, you think you know somebody...

245
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:32,601
Excuse me, which one of you
is Annabelle Bronstein?

246
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,702
- I am.
- Well, that's impossible.

247
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,335
Miss Bronstein is in London for the week.

248
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:41,936
No, I am Annabelle Bronstein.

249
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,276
And she's British.

250
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,952
As I was saying, dear sir...

251
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,819
I am Annabelle Bronstein.

252
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,821
I'm fairly certain you're not Annabelle.
I've spoken to her on the phone.

253
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,721
I am absolutely Annabelle Bronstein...

254
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:03,234
and I do not pay $900 annually...

255
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,826
to be treated like this.

256
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:08,635
Now, ring round the waiter
and have him tally up the drinks.

257
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,972
- What's with the accent?
- She's got a case of the Madonnas.

258
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:16,606
I'm sorry, but I know for a fact
that Annabelle lost her card.

259
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,513
Yes, I thought I did...

260
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:23,613
but it was on top of the telly.

261
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,992
And Miss Bronstein is from Sussex,
as am I...

262
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,497
and I'd venture to guess
that you are not, in fact, from the UK.

263
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,965
That's true.

264
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,828
I was raised in Inja.

265
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:42,633
On any given day, there are a lot of versions
of "crazy" right here in New York.

266
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,940
Today, Annabelle Bronstein
had multiple personalities...

267
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,343
and at least two accents.

268
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,777
Hey, Hobbes. Where did you disappear to
after the game?

269
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:59,717
I was gonna thank you,
but you were talking to that girl.

270
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,491
- What girl?
- Some cheerleader.

271
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:08,223
- Do you like her?
- No.

272
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,261
I like someone else.

273
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,829
You.

274
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,669
This cheered Miranda up immediately.

275
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,541
Now, see, how would I know that?

276
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:23,437
Well...

277
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,881
Would it be any clearer...

278
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,953
if I did this?

279
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,126
- Hi, Mrs. McCaffrey.
- Hello, Mrs. McCaffrey.

280
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:52,006
I wanted you to have these. Marbles.

281
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,903
In case I lose any more of mine,
I want to know where I can find a stash.

282
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:59,745
- How are you? Do you want to come in?
- She asked with trepidation.

283
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,684
No, I think it's great what you're doing...

284
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,155
I know I probably
threw you for a loop the other day, but...

285
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:09,489
I should probably just come right out
and say something about this, but I...

286
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,122
Truth is, I haven't worked out
my rap on it yet.

287
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,429
- Well, it's a tough thing to slip in.
- Yeah, it is.

288
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:18,965
"Hi, I might be crazy.
Would you like to share an appetizer?"

289
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:24,240
The thing is,
I think I made it sound worse than it is.

290
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:27,073
If you saw Juno-Spears,
you'd see it's not a cuckoo's nest.

291
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,411
It's more like Canyon Ranch for the brain.

292
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:34,015
- Do they have pilates?
- They do have pilates.

293
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,682
I don't want to lie to you.
I am going through some pretty heavy stuff.

294
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,453
I mean, soul-searching, really.

295
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,591
Trying to figure out why...

296
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:48,130
some things seem to be harder for me
than they are for other people.

297
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,468
I think my family
has something to do with it.

298
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,466
- It's good to blame the parents, right?
- Right.

299
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,338
So I figured I could
spend the next five years in therapy...

300
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,469
or spend the next month
and deal with it intensively right now.

301
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:01,706
It's just more efficient.

302
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,272
- You make a very good case.
- That's what my doctors say.

303
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,549
Well, that's it. Ta-da!

304
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:12,182
I just wanted to explain myself so that...

305
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:17,059
I didn't become known eternally as
that nut case you dated back in high school.

306
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,758
How about "my high-school boyfriend
who was the best kisser ever"?

307
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,493
I could live with that.

308
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:25,269
You're not bad yourself, either, you know.

309
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:29,768
That night we went all the way.
And we weren't the only ones.

310
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:44,320
The next afternoon,
my other crazy boyfriend stopped by.

311
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,758
It's true. Marcus was a gay escort.

312
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,828
- But he's been off the market since 1992.
- So you talked about it?

313
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:56,334
Yes, and he says he did it
just to put himself through dance classes.

314
00:20:56,802 --> 00:21:01,671
- But if that's true, then why keep it a secret?
- Maybe he was embarrassed.

315
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:05,001
Yes, but it's not the escort thing...

316
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:08,706
but the secret thing that's bothering me.
I was the last to know.

317
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:13,476
I don't want to hear the truth from some
bitchy queen with back issues of Honcho.

318
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,111
So...

319
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,448
we broke up.

320
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,083
- Stanny, really?
- Yes.

321
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,990
And right before the prom.

322
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,356
And I still have to go,
because I'm on the decorations committee.

323
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,697
And I have no date. Again.

324
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,068
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.

325
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,896
Will you please go with me?

326
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:39,103
I can't.
I have to visit my boyfriend at the asylum.

327
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:40,542
Of course you do.

328
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:44,806
He wants me to see the place for myself.
It's supposed to be like Canyon Ranch.

329
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,278
- Honey.
- I know.

330
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,118
- But I like him.
- You'd have to.

331
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,657
Who are we to say,
he's got issues, he's getting help?

332
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,991
Usually, that's considered a good thing.
It's New York. Everybody's insane.

333
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:59,830
- You slept with him, didn't you?
- Yes.

334
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,326
That's where the problems begin.

335
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:07,805
You sleep with someone,
you start rationalizing away all the red flags.

336
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:09,841
At least he was honest about it.

337
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,241
Yes, unlike Paul.

338
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:31,225
Apparently, the Juno-Spears Center
was harder than the Soho House to get into.

339
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:32,825
Or out of.

340
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:45,039
Even as a visitor, I could see how this was
a very relaxing place to get away to.

341
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,874
It's kind of nice, huh?

342
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,779
There are great hiking trails all around here.

343
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:55,579
- Maybe later we can do a hike.
- I don't really hike.

344
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,554
Neither do I. But I will fill you in
on something I discovered.

345
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:03,425
Hiking is walking.

346
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,162
- Really?
- Yes, hiking is walking.

347
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,324
I started to think
maybe the Juno-Spears Center...

348
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,459
should be mandatory for New Yorkers.

349
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,629
Like the Hamptons or Fire Island.

350
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,002
Feces!

351
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,910
I guess that doesn't happen
very often at Canyon Ranch.

352
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,920
I've never been. It might.

353
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:34,893
Who am I kidding?
This is a full-on psychiatric facility.

354
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,456
With pilates.

355
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:42,028
- You're definitely the sanest person here.
- Thank you.

356
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,262
That's like being
the best house on a bad block.

357
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,169
People would advise you against buying it.

358
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,306
Maybe it wasn't the wisest thing
to start something while I was still in here.

359
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,073
Maybe when I get out...

360
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:58,207
in eight to ten months...

361
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,475
Eight to ten months?

362
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,779
My doctor still thinks
I have a lot of work to do.

363
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,584
To be honest with you,
I'm comfortable here. I kind of like it.

364
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:14,394
I like that everybody's craziness
is out in the open.

365
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:24,005
- I loved seeing you.
- I loved seeing you again.

366
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:27,744
But I understand.

367
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,441
We're just in very different places right now.

368
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:36,877
Ironically, it was the sanest breakup
I ever had.

369
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,191
And now, the Queen and Queen
of our prom...

370
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:48,164
Carrie Bradshaw and Stanford Blatch.

371
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,975
- Oh, my God! I love this song.
- Me, too.

372
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,937
Thank you very much.

373
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:17,561
This is my best prom ever.
Thank you for coming.

374
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,962
Believe me, I'm glad to be back
with the normal people.

375
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,396
You know the craziest thing of all?

376
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:28,764
I somehow thought
that after everything I've been through...

377
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:32,269
I might end up
with my high-school boyfriend.

378
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,841
I don't think my story's
going to get tied up like that.

379
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:40,180
- Your boyfriend might get tied up.
- And taken away.

380
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:43,717
Okay, no more jokes. I might be dating him
in eight to ten months.

381
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:48,586
May I cut in?

382
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,124
No, thank you. I already have an escort.

383
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,766
Honey, I didn't tell you
because it's part of my past.

384
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,766
It's not who I am anymore.

385
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:05,274
I was really messed up back then,
but I've got it together now.

386
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,911
And it's prom night.
We have to have a dance.

387
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:16,113
Why don't I get some punch?

388
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:25,756
Just tell me one thing.

389
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:31,024
Did you ever, ever sleep
with that little bitchy pine nut, Anthony?

390
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:32,836
No. God, no.

391
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,196
So, maybe it won't look the way
you thought it would look in high school.

392
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:05,634
But it's good to remember love is possible.

393
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,536
Anything is possible. This is New York.
