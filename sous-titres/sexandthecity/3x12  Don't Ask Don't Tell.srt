1
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,041
For Miranda, the only thing worse

2
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,207
than being Charlotte's
34-year-old bridesmaid

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,512
was being a 34-year-old
bridesmaid without a date.

4
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,518
With the wedding approaching,

5
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,487
Miranda fell prey to the siren song
of a singles event.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,825
Multi-dating.

7
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,090
$20 bought you seven mini-dates,
each eight minutes long

8
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,928
which is as long
as blind dates should be.

9
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,592
Hi. I'm Miranda Hobbes.

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,102
Dwight Owens.

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,207
Private wealth group at Morgan
Stanley Investment Management

12
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,831
for high net-worth individuals

13
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,307
and pension plans.

14
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,073
Like my job, been there five years,

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,580
divorced, no kids, not religious.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,240
I live in New Jersey,

17
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,114
speak French and Portuguese.

18
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,050
Any of this appealing?

19
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,554
Sure. Portuguese, that's impressive.

20
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,990
Obrigado. What about you, Mandy?

21
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,993
Miranda.

22
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,224
I'm a lawyer at a mid-sized firm.

23
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,598
I was recently made partner.

24
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,698
I'm a lawyer.

25
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,675
I'm a lawyer.
I went to Harvard Law School.

26
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,977
- I'm a stewardess.
- Really?

27
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,515
But before the wedding bells,
there's the rehearsal dinner.

28
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,922
- You said you were a stewardess.
- I was testing a theory.

29
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,359
- The theory being...
- Men are threatened by good jobs.

30
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,364
- They don't want a lawyer. They...
- Want a liar.

31
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,833
I was the liar.
I'd finally ended my affair with Big,

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,302
but the guilt of lying to Aidan was
like a hangover I couldn't sleep off.

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,911
I'm just saying, as a lawyer -
a partner, no less - I got zero dates.

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,570
As a stewardess,
I got one for tomorrow.

35
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:32,308
- The correct term is "flight attendant".
- Not if you wanna get laid.

36
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:38,253
It's how you say what you do that
matters. For example, "I'm in PR".

37
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,621
Translation - "I give great head".

38
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,590
- What?
- He's actually an OK guy.

39
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,666
Harris Bragan,
emergency room doctor.

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,396
Yeah, but you can't date the guy now
because you lied.

41
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,202
I'd tell him eventually. If he got upset
he'd look completely shallow.

42
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,777
And it would make you look schizo.

43
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,349
Excuse me. I...

44
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,509
We...

45
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,919
See, mother, I told you
I'd become a "we" sooner or later.

46
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,219
This is a "wee" toast.

47
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,992
I'd like to thank everyone for coming,
especially the out-of-towners.

48
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,898
My cousin Caleb, who's in the
wedding party, came from Edinburgh.

49
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,631
Someone had to bring
the real Scotch, like.

50
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,003
I know what I'll be having later.

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:38,412
But the person I'd really like to thank
for showing up is this woman here.

52
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,917
I love you more than words can say.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,786
Those who know me know I'm a man
of many words. God knows I've tried.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,488
All righty, then.
Let's eat, drink, and be married.

55
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,398
- She's so happy.
- She doesn't have to be a bridesmaid.

56
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,942
We got off easy.
The groomsmen have to wear kilts.

57
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,706
I like the idea of men in skirts -
easy access.

58
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,940
Is it true that
they wear nothing underneath?

59
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,984
I'll find out and get back to you.

60
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,682
His name was Caleb, right?

61
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,291
Hi there. I'm Samantha Jones.

62
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,027
Caleb MacDougal, Samantha.
Pleasure.

63
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:34,731
- First time in New York City?
- Aye, and it's brilliant, like.

64
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,935
The architecture, the energy.
It is, you know.

65
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,411
Samantha could
barely understand him.

66
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,982
But if his tongue could do that,
she wondered what it could do to her.

67
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,643
I'd be happy
to show you around town.

68
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,550
That would be great.

69
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:56,787
Trey got lost bringing me back
from the Stanhope Hotel, like.

70
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,292
Samantha wasn't the only one
feeling lost.

71
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,334
- I'm thinking I have to tell him.
- Tell who?

72
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,667
Aidan.
I might have to tell him about Big.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,968
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,079
Relationships are supposed
to be built on trust.

75
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,579
No offence, but that ship has sailed.

76
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,947
You're right. You have to tell him, but
not before the wedding. It's my week.

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,079
It's your day.
You get a day, not a week.

78
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,591
There's no reason to tell him.
Men lie about this all the time.

79
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,424
- And women find out.
- What if he finds out?

80
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,967
You fucked Big all over Manhattan.
Why should he find out now?

81
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,128
Could you not use
the f-word in Vera Wang?

82
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:47,110
If my boyfriend was sleeping
with somebody else for three weeks,

83
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,408
I'd wanna know about it.
I'd wanna have all the information.

84
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,951
That might mean more coming from
someone not posing as a stewardess.

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,212
What?

86
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,916
Nothing, but at your wedding we have
to pretend Miranda's a stewardess.

87
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:05,326
I don't wanna pretend anything. And
I don't want you and Aidan fighting.

88
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,227
Don't you think
this could be a little shorter?

89
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,701
- The skirts must the same length.
- Really?

90
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,138
- What about Trey's skirt?
- It's a kilt, and it's tradition.

91
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,837
Can't I ask you not to wear your dress
round your see-you-next-Tuesday?

92
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,175
My what?

93
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,515
- C-U-Next...
- Tuesday?

94
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,749
Oh, my God. Was that
a Schoolhouse Rock I missed?

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,152
If I have to be a bridesmaid,
I'd at least like to look good.

96
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,766
- You don't have to be a bridesmaid.
- Then why am I here?

97
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,367
Frankly, I didn't want you
to feel left out.

98
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:48,064
I would love to be left out. I could be
in bed with a hot Scot right now.

99
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,503
Fine.

100
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,013
- Don't do this.
- What? We're just being honest.

101
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,014
Honestly, I hate this color.

102
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:04,114
I started thinking about honesty.
Maybe the idea was overrated.

103
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,919
Maybe coming clean is the ultimate
selfish act, a way to absolve yourself

104
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,994
by hurting someone
who doesn't deserve to be hurt.

105
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,724
I cheated on a test
in the fifth grade with two friends.

106
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,697
They confessed and failed the class.

107
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,134
I never told anyone,
and it never mattered.

108
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,766
In a relationship,
is honesty really the best policy?

109
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,245
Evidently, dishonesty was
the best policy for Miranda.

110
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,248
As a stewardess,
she was a charming date.

111
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,716
Once you work first class,
you can't go back to coach.

112
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,220
- I imagine.
- Oh, yeah.

113
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,326
- No warm cookies in coach.
- You get to eat the cookies?

114
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,158
There's always some actress
who doesn't want her cookie.

115
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,566
Free travel, cookies -
this sounds like a great job.

116
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,503
You've got the great job -
a New York ER. I'm not saving lives.

117
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,337
You are, in the event
of an emergency.

118
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,313
Inflatable slide - I'm in charge of that.

119
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,545
But once we open the slide,
it's every man for himself.

120
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,727
That night, Harris got to make love
to a stewardess.

121
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,357
Miranda didn't have to fake anything.

122
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,733
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

123
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,980
I'd love to ask you to spend the night,
but I've got an early flight to DC.

124
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,343
The 5:00am-er.

125
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,850
I should get some rest too.

126
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,289
Saturdays at the hospital are non-stop
since roller blades were invented.

127
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,810
- Do you have a boy in every port?
- Every airport.

128
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,947
Seriously. I bet you're a heartbreaker.

129
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,515
In truth, it's a Ionely life.

130
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,979
There's a wedding I'm in on Sunday.

131
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,819
Days later, the four of us celebrated

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,155
Charlotte's last night
as a single woman.

133
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,957
I can't believe you're getting married.

134
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,157
Is this the beginning?
Are you next?

135
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,235
Oh, yeah.
I'm headed for a storybook ending.

136
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:36,501
The little girl had an affair, lied to her
boyfriend, and lived happily ever after.

137
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,440
Marriage doesn't guarantee
a happy ending, just an ending.

138
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,410
- The end of dating.
- All right then.

139
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,142
It's also the end of the possibility

140
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,117
that your next great fuck
is around the corner.

141
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,619
My next great...

142
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,417
- Yes?
- Say it.

143
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,653
...fuck is just around the corner.

144
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,764
I finally get to sleep with Trey.

145
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,202
- Excuse me?
- You haven't slept with him yet?

146
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,737
Before you buy the car,
you take it for a test drive.

147
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,777
I wanted to save myself
until we got married.

148
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:18,247
- Sweetie, you're not a virgin.
- I am with him, and it's romantic.

149
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,410
It's romantic until he can't figure out
where to put it in.

150
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,557
- No.
- What if he's terrible?

151
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,286
He won't be terrible. No.

152
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,363
He is an amazing kisser.

153
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:38,026
- Really?
- He's so sexy, and he loves me.

154
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:43,097
I want to do things to him
that I have never done to anybody.

155
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,871
The other night, I was thinking
of putting whipped cream

156
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,982
all over my body.

157
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,779
Low fat Cool Whip is the best.
It's less sticky than other brands.

158
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,822
- Low fat Cool Whip.
- You haven't slept with him!

159
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,323
It's been...

160
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:05,930
Too long! I am so horny.

161
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,032
Horny.

162
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:14,201
Those of us not getting married
celebrated with a booty call.

163
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,204
I'm so glad you called.

164
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,172
As soon as I landed.

165
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,804
Samantha's vertical Scotch tasting
that turned into a horizontal one.

166
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,575
I had no idea you Yanks
were so bloody friendly.

167
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:30,984
She couldn't understand him,
but understood he was hard.

168
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:36,151
I decided to crawl into bed with Aidan,
but he wasn't in his bed.

169
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,263
Hey, beautiful.
What brings you down here?

170
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,764
I was trying to surprise you.

171
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,698
You can't surprise a man with a dog.

172
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,929
I see that.

173
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,042
What are you working on?

174
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,509
- The wedding gift.
- This is for Charlotte and Trey?

175
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,945
You wanted to give them
a piece of my furniture.

176
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,246
You didn't have to make something.
We could have picked a piece.

177
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,821
I make all that stuff too.

178
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,586
I know, but this is too nice.

179
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,260
I wanted it to mean something.

180
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,998
God, I was about to get them
steak knives.

181
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,875
What does it mean?

182
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,406
- It's a love seat.
- That I get.

183
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:35,612
It's two different types of wood
from two different trees.

184
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,086
They blend together
and make it stronger, just like...

185
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,421
A mixed drink.

186
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,194
- Kind of like two people in love.
- Right, that too.

187
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,995
Are you gonna make fun of this?

188
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,740
It's really...
nicer than anyone deserves.

189
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,249
You see this piece?

190
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,853
This big old flaw right here?

191
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,956
It's not a flaw, really.

192
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,993
It's just the way the wood is.
It's interesting. Beautiful.

193
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,338
Flaws can be good?

194
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,932
Flaws are the best part.

195
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,879
This was the time to tell him.
I could feel the words inside me.

196
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,645
But if I told him,
could he still love me?

197
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,449
I wasn't ready to find out.

198
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,373
There was another
booty call that night.

199
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,642
Hi, sweetiekins.

200
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,144
Charlotte Yorke, are you drunk?

201
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,552
Yes. Yes, I am, Trey MacDougal.

202
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:26,995
And today is
officially our wedding day.

203
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,931
And I can't wait any longer.

204
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,272
Could we please make love
right now?

205
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,970
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes, I am.

206
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,604
Take me to your bedroom now.

207
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,013
All righty then.

208
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,387
That was unfortunate.

209
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,727
Has this...
ever happened to you before?

210
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,203
Every now and then.

211
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,101
I just didn't think
it would happen with you.

212
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,184
It's no big deal.

213
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,845
Sometimes intercourse
just doesn't do it for me.

214
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:31,053
I can get the sails up,
just can't bring it into the harbor.

215
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,799
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, there is.

216
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,997
What?

217
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,007
You can marry me.

218
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,307
- I'm already doing that.
- I love you, Charlotte.

219
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,576
Sex is such a small part of it for us.

220
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:58,587
That's what I love about you.
It's not just about the sex.

221
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,225
Charlotte couldn't sleep at all
that night.

222
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,023
Neither could I.

223
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,132
All I could think about was
that I was a cheater.

224
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,400
I cheated and lied in fifth grade,
and I was still doing it.

225
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,974
- This isn't gonna work.
- What do you mean? Us?

226
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,815
I can't have you sneaking out at 3:00
in the morning for a cigarette.

227
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,792
I tried to quit. I just couldn't.

228
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,927
Well...

229
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,992
I'll just have to learn to live with it.

230
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,798
- You said you can't date a smoker.
- You're not just a smoker.

231
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,567
You're a lot of things.

232
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,406
- I'm not perfect.
- Oh, yeah? What's your flaw?

233
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,214
You tell me.

234
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,354
I don't know.

235
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,318
That was another lie.

236
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,948
I knew what his flaw was.
It was trusting me with his heart.

237
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:12,359
- Aidan, I need to tell you something.
- What?

238
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,862
But suddenly I couldn't tell him.

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,663
I was afraid he'd never
look at me that way again.

240
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,896
So I didn't.

241
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,631
I love you.

242
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,174
I love you, too.

243
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,915
- Let's go back and go to bed.
- No, I should get home.

244
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,755
My stuff's at home,
the stuff for the wedding.

245
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,156
I'm the maid of honor.
I need to be presentable.

246
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,387
I'll come with you.

247
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:51,002
No, stay here.
Just pick me up in the morning.

248
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,105
I'll get my stuff. I have to go.

249
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,106
Is this wedding black tie?
I don't have a tux.

250
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,718
The groom is in a kilt,
so pretty...

251
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,114
- What happened?
- I cut my finger.

252
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,915
Jesus.

253
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,322
It's OK. It happens.

254
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,325
You haven't made breakfast

255
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,294
till you've made it at 10,000 feet
in turbulence.

256
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,060
- It's really bleeding. Look.
- I saw it.

257
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,362
- What should I do?
- I don't know.

258
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:29,473
- It's deep. Do I need stitches?
- Stop putting it in my face.

259
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:34,943
- I think it's really bad, look.
- Stop it. Blood makes me queasy.

260
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,379
But you're a doctor. Aren't you?

261
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,744
- Not really.
- What are you then?

262
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,288
Assistant Manager of Athlete's Foot
at 81st and Broadway.

263
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,292
- You lied?
- I'm sorry.

264
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,488
I always wanted
to sleep with a stewardess.

265
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,600
For a moment,
Miranda considered coming clean.

266
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,599
But then they'd both be liars,

267
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,603
and he wouldn't have slept
with a stewardess.

268
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,642
You should go. I hope I never
have you on one of my flights.

269
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,872
- I wouldn't be on first class.
- No, you wouldn't.

270
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,023
I'm running late. Charlotte will never
forgive me. I need to...

271
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,221
What's that?

272
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,561
- It's the wedding gift.
- That love seat packs up nice.

273
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,930
It's a Polaroid.

274
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,868
You look too hot to be a bridesmaid.

275
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,138
I thought the whole point was to wear
a bad dress and be humiliated.

276
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,144
It's not that kind of wedding.

277
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,945
I thought maybe one day
I'd build us a love seat.

278
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,317
We're gonna be late.
I'm just gonna grab my...

279
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,889
I was supposed to be
at the church ten minutes ago.

280
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,689
You never let me hold you anymore.

281
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,028
- Why do you keep running away?
- I'm not running away.

282
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,568
What are you afraid of?

283
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,599
Aidan, I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

284
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,714
You met him at the furniture show.
Then we slept together.

285
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,544
I didn't tell you, and I'm sorry.

286
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,513
You slept with that guy?

287
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,457
When we were going out?

288
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,256
- Once?
- No, more than once.

289
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,524
He was married. It was a mess.

290
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,760
I don't know what I was thinking.
I wasn't thinking.

291
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,962
It's so over. And it was wrong.

292
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,735
I just hope you can...

293
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,506
Here. I want to be alone.

294
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,927
What about the wedding?

295
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,756
Just go without me.

296
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:10,230
- I'm gonna take a walk.
- Will you meet me there later?

297
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,168
- Please don't bleed on my dress.
- I'm trying not to.

298
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,834
- Here we go.
- Where is Carrie?

299
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,243
She'll be here.

300
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,942
Charlotte, my grandmother's necklace
looks beautiful on you.

301
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,421
- Could I escort you to your seat?
- Excuse me?

302
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,049
He asked
if he could escort you to your seat.

303
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,421
Certainly.

304
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,757
I guess it's time.

305
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,829
They do wear something under kilts,
but it's easy to get off.

306
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,939
The wedding was complete. Charlotte
had something old, something new,

307
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,905
something borrowed,
and someone Samantha blew.

308
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,710
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
- It's OK. I'm glad you're here.

309
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,977
Jeez, you look perfect.

310
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,417
Honestly?

311
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,424
Honestly.

312
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,753
- We should go. Come on.
- OK.

313
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:44,719
Despite all her bitching, Samantha
enjoyed being a bridesmaid.

314
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,932
Miranda, back to being herself,
found a last-minute date.

315
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,276
Carrie.

316
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,949
- I have to tell you something.
- Right now?

317
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,352
Yeah.

318
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,828
- Trey can't get it up.
- What?

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,164
- Last night he couldn't get it up.
- Was he drunk?

320
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,738
No. I was drunk, he was fine.

321
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,939
Then it must have been
wedding-night jitters.

322
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,171
He says it happens sometimes.

323
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:40,977
Since she was in the white dress,
I reached for a white lie.

324
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,747
Happens to everybody.

325
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,652
I should have slept with him
on the first date.

326
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,161
Maybe he jerked off
before you got there,

327
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,527
and he was
too embarrassed to tell you.

328
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,969
- I do love him.
- And he loves you.

329
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,973
Maybe he did jerk off.

330
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:10,308
If you don't wanna go through this,
you don't have to.

331
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,712
We'll just get a cab, and everyone
will just have to get over it.

332
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,992
No. I'm getting married.

333
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,896
- OK, go.
- OK.

334
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,935
Carrie!

335
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,131
Come here.

336
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:43,806
Don't tell anyone. Go.
OK, go.

337
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,348
Charlotte was 34, single,
and standing in a $14,000 dress.

338
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,050
She was getting married.
Not even a low libido could stop her.

339
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,968
- Could you hold this for a second?
- Sure.

340
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,881
Hey, you.

341
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,079
I walked around for about an hour.

342
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,349
Couldn't bring myself to go in.

343
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,460
I'm so sorry, Aidan.

344
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,688
I know that.

345
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,162
I never meant to hurt you.

346
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,997
I know.

347
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,870
But I did. I'm sorry.

348
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:30,753
Couldn't it be like the wood?
That's my flaw, and...

349
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,686
...and you're the other wood,
and that makes us stronger.

350
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,631
It's not that simple, Carrie.

351
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,943
I wish I didn't know about this.

352
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,309
I just wanted to be honest with you.

353
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,048
People make mistakes.

354
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:16,063
I just know myself. This is not
the kind of thing I can get over.

355
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,075
I just need to be
on my own for a while.

356
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,280
Me on my own.

357
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,895
I really loved you.

358
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:59,034
- Carrie, they need us for photos.
- OK.

359
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,719
I told him.

360
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:34,342
It's hard to find people
who will love you no matter what.

361
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,315
Here we go. Smile.
Everybody looks beautiful.

362
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,616
I was lucky enough
to find three of them.
