1
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:51,725
Some outfits wait a lifetime
to be taken somewhere special.

2
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,565
The same can be true of people.

3
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,907
Hi, it's Aleks.

4
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,705
Stop packing.
They have clothes here in Paris.

5
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:07,269
See you tomorrow. Safe flight.

6
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:10,108
Hi, it's Miranda.

7
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,277
No, this is not
my 40th "Please don't go to Paris" call.

8
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:17,255
It's been three weeks. Is that funny yet?
Anyway, I got us a dinner reservation.

9
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,690
You're leaving at 9:00,
so we have to eat at 6:00...

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,320
which makes us senior citizens, thank you.

11
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,490
Or should I say,
merci beau "please don't go."

12
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,228
It's me. I'm in town.

13
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,764
Look, I'd really like to see you, so call me.

14
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,841
Same number,
and in case you've forgotten, it's...

15
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,240
Deleted.

16
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,176
After many more hours of packing...

17
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,778
I was off for our version of the last supper.

18
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,859
If Mohammed won't come to the mountain...

19
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,028
Hiya, kid.

20
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,590
Hi.

21
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:04,362
I was in the neighborhood,
saw your light on.

22
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,100
Can I talk to you?

23
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:11,042
Well, I'm late for dinner with the girls.

24
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,338
It's 5:45.

25
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,411
Come on, get in, it's cold.

26
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,266
Raoul, give us a minute?

27
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,773
No, it's okay, he doesn't... It's cold.

28
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:44,140
He's a tough guy, right, Raoul?

29
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,972
I'll tip like a Rockefeller.

30
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,976
I'm sorry for not returning your calls.

31
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,146
Yeah, I was starting
to feel like a needy chick.

32
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,053
Did I do something to piss you off?

33
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,559
No, it's...

34
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,490
I've just been busy with other things.

35
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:10,761
Look, I know I freaked out about us
the last time I was here.

36
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,099
No, it's fine.

37
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,499
- You were amazing to me, and l...
- You were fine.

38
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,545
Would you let me finish?

39
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,779
And since then,
I've been thinking a lot about us...

40
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,411
You don't have to do this, okay?
There's really no point.

41
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,148
It's all fine.

42
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,823
Raoul's freezing,
and I have to go meet the girls.

43
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:41,333
Got it. How about dinner tomorrow?

44
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,100
Drinks?

45
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,112
I'm starting to feel like that chick again.

46
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,442
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm leaving for Paris tonight.

47
00:03:58,618 --> 00:03:59,778
Paris?

48
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:06,090
- You're finally taking that vacation?
- It's not a vacation.

49
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:10,758
I'm going there with a man
that I'm in a relationship with.

50
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,360
He's wonderful, and I'm happy.

51
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:18,802
So please don't feel bad about anything.

52
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,168
Goodbye.

53
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,503
Wait. What do you mean, "goodbye"?

54
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,069
I have to go.

55
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,553
Carrie, stop!

56
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:41,860
What are you doing, saying goodbye
and jumping out of the car like that?

57
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,566
Are you moving to Paris?

58
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,068
When were you going to tell me?

59
00:04:56,543 --> 00:05:00,570
- You're not even going to tell me who he is?
- His name is Aleksandr Petrovsky.

60
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,275
You're moving to France with a Russki?

61
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:09,051
- Come on, it's a joke, Carrie.
- You do this every time!

62
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,586
Every time!
What, do you have some kind of radar?

63
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,254
Carrie might be happy,
it's time to sweep in and shit all over it?

64
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,353
What?

65
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:21,963
No, look, I came here to tell you something.
I made a mistake.

66
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,166
- You and l...
- You and I nothing!

67
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:30,332
You cannot do this to me again!
You cannot jerk me around.

68
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,545
- Carrie, listen, it is different...
- It's never different!

69
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:36,776
It's six years of never being different.

70
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,151
But this is it, I am done.

71
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,052
Don't call me ever again!
Forget you know my number!

72
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,886
In fact, forget you know my name.

73
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,659
And you can drive down this street
all you want...

74
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,667
because I don't live here anymore!

75
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:12,842
Sure, now that I'm with someone else,
now that I'm leaving, it's "different."

76
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,853
- You know who he is?
- Who?

77
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,479
The boy who cried love, that's who.

78
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:19,719
And just like in the fable,
it's too little, too late.

79
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,627
Love? He said he loved you?

80
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,395
No, it's...

81
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,865
It's an allegory. No, look, my point is,
he's been doing this for years. Years!

82
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,770
And I'm done with it.

83
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:34,363
- Then just put it all behind you.
- It is behind me.

84
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:38,241
I'm mostly upset about
him ruining my last night in New York.

85
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:42,404
Well, fuck him!
And, you know, I never say that.

86
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,983
- Would you like another cocktail?
- No, I can't be drunk on the plane.

87
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:52,513
I want to arrive stunning
and impossibly fresh-looking.

88
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,050
Okay.

89
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,054
Ladies...

90
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,998
Stop, really, you're going to make me cry.

91
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:03,462
She didn't even say anything yet.

92
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,367
I know what's coming.

93
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:11,942
I want to thank you all
for wishing me well tonight...

94
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:16,614
in spite of some of your personal opinions
about my leaving.

95
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,783
Me? I've never had an opinion in my life.

96
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,486
You guys, stop. Please.

97
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:29,151
Easy there, waterworks.

98
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,823
Today, I had a thought:

99
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:42,136
What if I had never met you?

100
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,162
Let's pull it up, shall we?

101
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:08,790
- I'd like to show my face here again.
- Yes, the tears have to go.

102
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:12,030
All right, someone say something
not sentimental.

103
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,074
Chemo might have kicked me
into early menopause.

104
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,665
Task accomplished.

105
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:20,543
You cannot believe the hot flashes.
I can barely keep my clothes on.

106
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,605
Really, what was your excuse
before the chemo?

107
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,549
I'm going to miss you, you cunt.

108
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,349
Wow, even "cunt" didn't stop her.

109
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,388
It's me, leave a message.

110
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,393
Manhattan Towncar for Bradshaw.
Car number 221, downstairs in two minutes.

111
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:24,770
Ladies, I know it's getting late,
and we all need to get up for our pilates.

112
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,813
- More hot decaf?
- Are you insane?

113
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,270
But hang in...

114
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:33,615
and I know we can make
this breast cancer benefit our best ever.

115
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,549
Mona, the goody bags, tell us.

116
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,120
Thanks, Sheila.

117
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,351
Okay.

118
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,926
First, we have the pink-ribbon
breast cancer cookie.

119
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,794
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong with the cookie?

120
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:50,131
For the past five years, every fucking
breast cancer benefit I've been to...

121
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,728
has had that fucking breast cancer cookie.

122
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:57,105
I don't care about a breast cancer cookie,
and I had breast cancer!

123
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,277
Point taken.

124
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,739
And?

125
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:06,444
Some of the women coming to this event
are battling cancer.

126
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,855
They need something more inspirational
or outrageous than a fucking cookie.

127
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,192
Is it hot in here?

128
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,061
Well, the cookies are donated,
so we're having them, but you're right.

129
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:22,627
We do need something inspirational...

130
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,363
and outrageous to give to these women.

131
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,935
So, I'm giving them you.

132
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,031
Excuse me?

133
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,237
I'd like you make a little speech
before you bring me up.

134
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:37,079
- But what would I say?
- Something inspirational.

135
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,180
Something you think they'd like to hear.

136
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,744
But...

137
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,648
my husband's parents, the Liebermans,
are coming...

138
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,660
so please try not to say "fuck" so much.

139
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,493
Could I get some water, please?

140
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:54,230
Fill it up.

141
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,809
A little slower, s'il vous plaît.

142
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,678
- But of course. American?
- New Yorker.

143
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:49,887
Je m'appelle Carrie Bradshaw.
I'm staying here with Aleksandr Petrovsky.

144
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,422
Very good, Miss Bradshaw.

145
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:54,483
I believe Mr. Petrovsky is
in the salon right now.

146
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,820
Yes.

147
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,995
The luggage?

148
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,769
Thank you.

149
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,585
- Carrie, you're here.
- Hi.

150
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,388
So nice to see you.

151
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,530
I want you to meet my daughter Chloe.

152
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,812
I'm sorry, all I got was, "It's 10:30."

153
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:01,024
- You don't speak French?
- Well, I'm learning, but...

154
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,927
Chloe was saying
that she's having a bad day...

155
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,226
and she wants to kill herself.

156
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,397
She's a bit dramatic.

157
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,430
Boyfriend troubles.

158
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,531
Well, that's my department.
So tell me all about the bum.

159
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,338
Papa tells me this is your first visit to Paris.

160
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,576
Well, not if you include movies.

161
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,175
But I can't believe I'm finally here.

162
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,051
I almost screamed when we
drove by the Eiffel Tower.

163
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:31,385
Terrible.

164
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:35,750
It was tolerable before,
but now with that light show at night...

165
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,997
hideous, just hideous.

166
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:53,040
I wanted Chloe to meet us
for drinks tonight...

167
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,706
but the only time
she could give her old papa...

168
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:58,215
is from now till this afternoon, so...

169
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,981
You two should have your day alone.

170
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,615
Interpreting for me
is going to cut your time in half.

171
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,819
I can unpack and take a nap...

172
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,788
and try to get on Paris time. Okay?

173
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,958
Also, I have to meet some people
from the museum for an early dinner.

174
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:20,597
But I'll eat light,
so we can go out then, okay?

175
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,435
I'm in Paris. Don't you worry about me.

176
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,009
See you.

177
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,554
- It was nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,630
- Where am I going?
- 625.

179
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,122
Ten hours later...

180
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:29,359
all dressed up, and no Petrovsky to go.

181
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:46,181
Where is the recommendation
from your friend, the judge?

182
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:47,644
Here.

183
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:52,283
And Carrie left hers at home,
so I can pick it up when I get her mail later.

184
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:55,486
It's amazing, with all the unwanted children,
we have to do this.

185
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,995
This private adoption
is a very competitive market.

186
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:01,124
More competitive than China?
We've got a year's wait on that list.

187
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,398
Honey, God is going to send us a baby
from somewhere.

188
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:08,933
And it's just our job to file all the papers...

189
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:13,110
and to just be as aggressive as we can,
up to the point of obnoxious.

190
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,271
Amen.

191
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,496
I'm sorry I'm late.

192
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:40,395
This museum dinner
turned into this big, long thing...

193
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:42,600
with the exhibit sponsors...

194
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,611
and other patrons, riffraff, blah, blah.

195
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:48,673
Sorry.

196
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,679
- Why didn't you call?
- I did.

197
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,480
You had the "do not disturb"
on your phone.

198
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,549
Right.

199
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,152
I forgot.

200
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,115
Did you sleep?

201
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:04,460
- Did you get enough sleep?
- Yeah.

202
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:11,198
It's dinnertime in New York.

203
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,312
You look like dessert.

204
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,318
What's under your millefeuilles?

205
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:31,451
Millefeuilles.' a thousand layers.

206
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,256
One, two, three...

207
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,659
four, five, six...

208
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,633
seven, eight, nine, ten...

209
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,940
Oh, my God! Stop!

210
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:57,907
"If you want to see the face of breast cancer,
look around you.

211
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,614
"It's the woman next to you
at the dry cleaners...

212
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,912
"the nurse in pediatrics...

213
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:07,786
"the single mother
picking her child up from school."

214
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,524
Are you sure the heat is off?

215
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,588
Fucking chemo.

216
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,700
Where was I?

217
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,231
"She's the woman with the knowing smile.

218
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,067
"A smile that says:

219
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,441
"'I beat cancer, I can take on the world!"'

220
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,379
It's good?

221
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,085
What is that?

222
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,917
It's kind of stiff.

223
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:41,150
- I thought it would sound more like you.
- It's an inspirational speech.

224
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:45,288
At AA, the most inspirational speakers
are the ones who keep it real.

225
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:46,864
Keep it real?

226
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:51,163
I'm speaking at a black-tie benefit,
not chilling at P. Diddy's crib.

227
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,032
I'm just saying, the truth is powerful.

228
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:56,006
Look, you may know AA, but I know PR.

229
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,640
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I simply must stick my head in the freezer.

230
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:07,775
After a week in Paris, I'd decided
my French was now strong enough...

231
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:11,653
to brave the ultimate test.
A day of shopping.

232
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,604
Fine, I'm fine.

233
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,477
Oh, my purse.

234
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:34,809
I'm fine.

235
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,552
Someone has been shopping.

236
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:48,218
I fell. I fell in Dior.

237
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,094
So I decided that the more I purchased...

238
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:57,333
the less they'd think of me
as the American who fell in Dior.

239
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,932
- They don't think like that.
- Not anymore, they don't.

240
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:03,406
This is the shopping equivalent
of a lobotomy.

241
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,942
Poor baby.

242
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,606
My purse went flying.
I had to scoop everything up.

243
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:14,881
I came all the way from New York
to squat and scoop in Dior.

244
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:18,754
I didn't even bother to check and see
if I had all my credit cards.

245
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,416
Well, apparently you had one.

246
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:24,519
One that I won't be using again
for many, many years.

247
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:31,966
Oh, no.

248
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,229
- No, oh, my God.
- What?

249
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:39,903
My Carrie necklace was in here.
I put it in here, and I don't see it.

250
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,704
It's not in here.

251
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,349
God, no, I can't have lost
my Carrie necklace, no!

252
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:54,321
- Was it insured?
- No, it's not like that.

253
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,621
It cost nothing, but it's...

254
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,587
It's priceless.

255
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,362
I've just had it forever, so...

256
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,509
Hello?

257
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:53,979
Is it too early?

258
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,187
Carrie, hi! How's it going?

259
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,380
I'm really upset.

260
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:02,585
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing serious, I just...

261
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,128
I lost my Carrie necklace.

262
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:10,425
It's gone, and I'll never be able to replace it.

263
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,665
I got it at that street fair
when we were all together.

264
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,835
It just makes me so sad.

265
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,205
Sure, I understand.

266
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:24,848
Well, no one in Paris seems to understand,
or at least they don't understand me.

267
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,075
Come home.

268
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:30,313
I can't come home.
I've only been here a week.

269
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,923
So, aside from the necklace, how's it going?

270
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:37,023
Well, you know, it's hard.

271
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,995
It's harder than I thought.
I don't speak the language.

272
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,830
And it's too cold and rainy
to walk around all day.

273
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:46,496
I've been to every museum twice.

274
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,240
I don't know, I'm just sort of lost.

275
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:53,433
Where's Aleks?

276
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,912
Well, the exhibit is taking much more time
than he thought...

277
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,640
so I'm alone a lot.

278
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,215
Come home.

279
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,748
That's ridiculous, I just got here.

280
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,980
I'm serious, you sound really upset.

281
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:09,517
No, I'm just being a baby.
You know, I lost my necklace...

282
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,428
and I saw these girls having lunch and...

283
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,536
I just thought how much I miss you guys.

284
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,000
We miss you, too.

285
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:30,275
This is absurd. I'm in Paris.
I've wanted to come here my whole life.

286
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,514
I just have, you know,
too much time to think.

287
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,215
What does that mean?

288
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,080
Can I tell you something
you won't use against me...

289
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,024
when I feel better and everything's great?

290
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:43,319
Yeah.

291
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,723
I keep thinking about Big.

292
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,397
About...

293
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,803
what it would be like
if I'd come here with Big.

294
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:00,767
Hello?

295
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,241
I'm still here.

296
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,077
But that's just something I do...

297
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:06,379
when things aren't going perfectly
with any guy.

298
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:08,316
I compare him to Big.

299
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:15,724
God, this French phone
is saying something that I don't...

300
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:16,918
Listen...

301
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:40,718
If you want to see the face of breast cancer,
look around you.

302
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:46,456
It's the woman next to you
at the dry cleaners...

303
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,557
the nurse...

304
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,925
in pediatrics...

305
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:57,625
the single mother
picking her child up from school.

306
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:01,401
I said inspirational, not perspirational.

307
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:02,872
She's brave...

308
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,169
she's capable...

309
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:07,109
she's you.

310
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,244
Oh, fuck it, she's me.

311
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:17,287
And if any of you are
having hot flashes like I am...

312
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,517
you deserve a fucking medal.

313
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:23,857
Bad enough I lose my hair, now I have
my face running down my couture.

314
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,791
Oh, to hell with it.

315
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,261
That's better.

316
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,714
Hey, it's me, leave a message.

317
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,548
It's me.

318
00:27:55,654 --> 00:28:00,250
I know you said you never wanted me
to call you again, but I'm still in town...

319
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:04,260
and I don't know if you're even calling
this number, but I had to call.

320
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:08,595
I figure at this point I've got nothing to lose,
except you.

321
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:13,428
I can't lose you again, Carrie. I love you.

322
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:16,969
Hi, it's Charlotte.

323
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:22,976
And her computer
was just sitting there on the bed.

324
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,717
Well, I know I haven't been your favorite
over the years.

325
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:38,024
- I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

326
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:47,501
Well, God knows
I've made a lot of mistakes with Carrie.

327
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,739
I fucked it up many times.

328
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,578
I know that.

329
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:59,774
Look, I need your advice.

330
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:03,416
You three know her better than anyone.

331
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:08,221
You're the loves of her life,
and a guy's just lucky to come in fourth.

332
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:13,626
But I do love her.

333
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:18,258
And if you think
I have the slightest chance...

334
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:22,100
I'll be on the next plane to Paris,
I'll roam the streets until I find her...

335
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,698
I'll do anything.

336
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,407
But if you think...

337
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,741
that she really is happy...

338
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,254
well, I wouldn't want to wreck that for her.

339
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,752
And I'll be history.

340
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,264
Go get our girl.

341
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,549
And what is that?

342
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,228
Oh, my God.

343
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:25,627
I know this is not the Carrie necklace,
but it's a necklace for Carrie.

344
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,374
These aren't diamonds?

345
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:36,275
Let's just say I wouldn't throw it around
in your old purse.

346
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:40,179
I hope this will cheer you up.

347
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:44,151
- Want to try it?
- Yes!

348
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:46,716
Okay.

349
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:53,491
- It's all right?
- It's lovely.

350
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,332
Listen, I know I've been busy.

351
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,601
As soon as the exhibit opens...

352
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:04,007
it'll be just you and me, I promise. Okay?

353
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,457
Carrie, this is Andre, my best friend.

354
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,760
- Remember, I told you about him?
- Oh, yeah.
