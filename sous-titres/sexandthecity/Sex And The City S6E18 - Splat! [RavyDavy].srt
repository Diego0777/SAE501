1
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:53,097
When you live in New York City,
it can take all your energy to stay in vogue.

2
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:57,466
So when Enid Frick, my old boss at Vogue,
wanted to meet me for lunch...

3
00:00:57,537 --> 00:01:00,233
I was eager to hear what she had for me.

4
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,275
Carrie, I need to ask you a favor.

5
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:06,369
Apparently, this would be about
what I had for her.

6
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,938
I wanted to invite you to a party
that I'm throwing a week from Saturday.

7
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,816
It's for an amazing couple,
Rama Patel and Andre DiBiachi.

8
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:15,582
They make documentary films.

9
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,818
Well, unless I'm doing the catering,
it sounds like a fun favor.

10
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:21,383
There'll be a lot of couples
from the art world...

11
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:24,123
and maybe you could
bring your Aleksandr Petrovsky.

12
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,131
- Done. Is that it?
- No.

13
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,525
I was hoping you might...

14
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,761
I can't believe I have to ask this.

15
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:37,674
Does he have a single friend
that you could bring along for me?

16
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,202
A date?

17
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:42,646
The thing is,
it's shaping up to be mostly couples...

18
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:47,413
and I'm not a couple,
and there are no exciting prospects...

19
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:51,389
so I thought that someone from his crowd
might be right for me.

20
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:57,128
Please never mention this conversation
to anyone at Condé Nast.

21
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:02,329
- Excuse me. Do you know what you want?
- Yes, I'll have the dorado.

22
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:07,203
The dorado. This is a much larger fish,
so this fish we recommend for two people.

23
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:11,341
See? You have to be a couple
just to order lunch in this town.

24
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,637
- I'll have the dorado as well.
- Do you even like dorado?

25
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:17,239
Because if this is a pity dorado,
I can have crab cakes.

26
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,751
- We'll have the dorado.
- Very good.

27
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:28,560
The only thing is,
I'm not sure if Aleksandr is...

28
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:31,790
a "Let's set people up" kind of guy.

29
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,532
Carrie, I got you a job, you get me a man.

30
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:41,362
Later that evening,
the couple I was in had a couple of hours...

31
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,672
to prepare a dinner party
for a couple of couples.

32
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,039
Your friends enjoy red wine?

33
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,378
My friends enjoy all wine.

34
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,949
Yes. We'll have the Barolo.

35
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:06,789
- Do you have any single male friends?
- Are you tired of me already?

36
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:11,437
It's for this friend of mine.

37
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,697
I have a friend.

38
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,704
- He's a food critic.
- Perfect.

39
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:19,043
Is this really how one finds love?

40
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:22,980
No, it's just what we do to distract ourselves
until the real thing comes along.

41
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,577
- Now, I have a question for you.
- Sorry, all my friends are taken.

42
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:31,288
Wow. I've never said that before.

43
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,954
You know, I'll be in Paris for some time
with my exhibition.

44
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,293
I'm going next week,
and I am not sure when I'll come back.

45
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:43,166
Unfortunately, having a man leave me
for Paris was not foreign to me.

46
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,562
I am hoping you will come.

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,870
Sure, I'll come for the opening...

48
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,040
and maybe another weekend also.

49
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:57,550
No, you misunderstand.
I am hoping you'll come and be with me.

50
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:02,150
- In Paris?
- Yes.

51
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,087
For who knows when we'll come back?

52
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:10,154
Yes. I need you there.

53
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,365
But this was foreign to me.

54
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,000
The caviar.

55
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,802
For most women,
the goal of a dinner party...

56
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,934
is to have your friends feel comfortable
around your boyfriend.

57
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,342
I think my maid is using my vibrator.

58
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:30,213
Other times, you wish your friends
were not quite so comfortable.

59
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,808
I don't think you're supposed
to say "maid" anymore.

60
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:36,049
I don't think we're supposed
to say "vibrator" over dinner.

61
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,613
I'm telling you,
I went into the kitchen to get it...

62
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:42,150
- Wait, why was it in the kitchen?
- I like to mix it up.

63
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,264
But yesterday, the batteries were dead.

64
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,590
They were new the last time I used it.

65
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,828
And I haven't used it
since Smith came back.

66
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,336
Baby, that's sweet.

67
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:55,135
Now, maybe in the Dominican Republic
people like to share vibrators...

68
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,768
but this is America, land of plenty!

69
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,711
I think you could have
a potential lawsuit on your hands.

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,338
What, breaking and vibrating?

71
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,645
As long as it's not entering.

72
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,793
- It's a beautiful piano. You play?
- Yeah, I do.

73
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,428
You know any Billy Joel?

74
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,733
I am not familiar.

75
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:25,567
- Uptown Girl? Always a Woman?
- Piano Man?

76
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:31,870
Tell us about your sculpture exhibition
in Paris.

77
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,812
They are not technically sculpture.

78
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,739
Oh, sorry.

79
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:41,048
They are large-scale light installations,
integrated with video imaging...

80
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,554
That's fine.

81
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:48,427
I don't like Paris. Too much attitude.
And what's with the toilet paper?

82
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,729
Paris is the best city in the world.

83
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,197
Easy, fella, you're talking
to New Yorkers here.

84
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:57,259
New York is wonderful,
but there is nowhere like Paris.

85
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,768
You'll see, Carrie.

86
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:05,610
- Are you going for the opening?
- Yes, she's coming with me to live.

87
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:12,616
No, we hadn't actually
discussed the details...

88
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:16,845
but, yes, I have been invited to go to Paris.

89
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:27,128
Later, my friends
wanted a tour of the apartment...

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,636
a.k. A... ' time to ask me
what the hell was going on.

91
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,229
- You would go live with him?
- I don't know.

92
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:34,898
When were you planning to tell us?

93
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,942
No, he just sprang this on me
two hours ago.

94
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,001
- How long would you go?
- Where would you live?

95
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,513
- Is there a guest room?
- You really thinking of going?

96
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:44,846
I'm not sure! I haven't digested it yet.
I'm still digesting dinner.

97
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,112
This is so exciting!

98
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,246
I know! My boyfriend has just asked me
to go to Paris with him.

99
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:53,122
This is the most romantic thing
that has ever happened to me.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,655
What are they doing down there?

101
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,028
Not having a Billy Joel sing-along,
that's for sure.

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,691
Ladies, time's up.

103
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:06,296
I can't pretend to be
one of the boys any longer.

104
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,008
So, I spoke to my girlfriends...

105
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:14,911
and they have a few questions about Paris.

106
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:19,008
But you are the one who's going.

107
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,280
We don't know about that yet.

108
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,684
I mean...

109
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,724
how could this work?
Would I get my own place?

110
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,858
Why would you get your own place?

111
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,023
Well, I don't know.
I've never done this before.

112
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,123
You will live with me.

113
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,726
I have a beautiful apartment
on the Left Bank...

114
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,706
but it's being remodeled,
so we would stay at the Plaza Athénée.

115
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,171
Okay, but are we talking a year?
Indefinitely?

116
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,272
Don't I need to learn French?
Would I be able to work there?

117
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,817
And what about my cell phone?
Would it work there?

118
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,319
So many questions. Which is yours?

119
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:59,922
I can't remember.
I think I drank too much Barolo at dinner.

120
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,221
Okay.

121
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,761
Here's one of mine:

122
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:10,261
What about my apartment here,
would I sublet it?

123
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:14,202
- I will pay for your apartment.
- That's crazy. I can't let you do that.

124
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:16,640
Why? I have plenty of money.

125
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,906
What I don't have:
Plenty of Carrie Bradshaws.

126
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,551
And I've always wanted to learn French,
and drink wine before noon.

127
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,784
So, basically, it's my fantasy...

128
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,420
complete with Parisian parties
and museum openings.

129
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,556
- But for how long?
- As long as it's fun. Indefinitely.

130
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,501
- So you'd be moving there.
- No, 'cause I'd still have my apartment here.

131
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,904
- Which he'd be paying for.
- He can certainly afford it.

132
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,965
Do you think you might get married?

133
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:53,103
No, that's... I don't think that's the point.

134
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,907
- Then what is he promising you?
- The world?

135
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,816
But what about your job?
Your column is all about New York.

136
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:03,378
- You're all about New York. How would...
- I don't know!

137
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,515
How can you people still have questions?

138
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:09,255
I got all your questions answered,
and they were good answers, by the way.

139
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,024
So this is the time...

140
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:14,794
when everybody
should be really excited for me.

141
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:18,326
- We are excited, it's fabulous.
- No, forget it.

142
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:22,340
- No, I think it's really romantic.
- Then stop killing it with questions.

143
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,706
We just want to make sure
you think this through.

144
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:28,144
I am thinking it through. But it's a nice offer.

145
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:32,378
And it would be nice
if my friends could be happy for me...

146
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:37,282
especially when I've always
been happy for them.

147
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,852
Carrie, we are happy for you.

148
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,129
Anyone want to talk about cancer?

149
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:46,993
Anybody?

150
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,860
They say the unexamined life
is not worth living.

151
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,804
But what if the examining
becomes your life?

152
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:56,637
Is that living, or just procrastinating?

153
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,604
And what if all those helpful lunches...

154
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,671
and late-night phone calls to friends...

155
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:06,913
have made us all girl-talk
and no girl-action?

156
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,383
Is it time to stop questioning?

157
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:25,531
Certain questions should never be asked
by anyone, especially a husband.

158
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,840
You think someone's getting
a little chunky?

159
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,769
Harry!

160
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm talking about the dog.

161
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,321
Elizabeth Taylor had gained four pounds...

162
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,086
which, for a dog who used to
weigh eight pounds, seemed excessive.

163
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,025
Hi. Can you tell me
where the diet dog food is?

164
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:01,301
Oh, a Cavalier! She's beautiful. May I?

165
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:05,777
Yes, she is beautiful,
but she's getting a little fat.

166
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,540
She's not fat.

167
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,105
You're right, that is an ugly word.
She's full-figured.

168
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,749
No, she's pregnant.

169
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:20,217
Honey. I got your message.
So the dog's knocked up?

170
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,153
Yes, she's pregnant.

171
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:25,254
Because everyone around me gets pregnant,
just not me.

172
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,698
- It's not like she planned it. She's a dog.
- Exactly!

173
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,498
She's not even thinking about it, and bam!
On her first try.

174
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:36,838
It might have been her first time,
but it was with at least eight dogs.

175
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,206
Eight mutts!

176
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:42,714
And now we are going to have to raise
her whole trampy, un-pedigreed family!

177
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:50,121
Elizabeth, Mommy can't look at you
right now.

178
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,794
Miranda just doesn't like him.
This is all about Billy Joel.

179
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,304
It's not about Billy Joel, it's about you.

180
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,840
We're not going to encourage you
to cross an ocean.

181
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,138
We're selfish bitches
who like you in New York.

182
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,373
I like me in New York, too.
But I really like him.

183
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,674
- He's great, isn't he?
- Yes.

184
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,918
A bit arrogant,
but he's got the goods to back it up.

185
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,580
- And he can be really sweet.
- Then he's got it all.

186
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,452
Then why does Miranda not like him?

187
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,754
She doesn't not like him.
She doesn't know him.

188
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,794
She didn't try to get to know him.

189
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:32,888
She didn't ask him one question all night.
And she is all about the questions.

190
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,763
Well, here's a question: Why do you care?

191
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:40,337
Have you ever heard me once ask
what anybody thinks about my boyfriend?

192
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,738
I've never heard you
use the term "boyfriend."

193
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,107
My point is, it doesn't matter.

194
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:48,511
Nobody knows what goes on
behind closed doors.

195
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:52,416
You know the most annoying thing?

196
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,113
- What's annoying?
- Miranda has a point.

197
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:58,589
What about work, and everything?

198
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:03,090
Maybe I can't leave New York.
I don't know how I'd do someplace else.

199
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:06,130
Believe me,
your fabulousness will translate.

200
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,860
And nobody says
he gets to dictate the terms.

201
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,199
Figure out how to do it
so you're comfortable.

202
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,671
Maybe half the time you're there,
half the time I'm there.

203
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,072
Now you're being too supportive.

204
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:30,949
Later, I still had questions filling my head,
but at least they were in French.

205
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:39,255
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'm just putting my earrings on.

206
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:40,899
No, to Paris.

207
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,004
I haven't decided yet.

208
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:51,641
I'm inviting you to go to France, not to jail.

209
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:56,612
- I just have...
- More questions? Is it possible?

210
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,081
Things to figure out.

211
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:04,682
My whole life is here.

212
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:12,060
Could we stay in New York, and then...

213
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,725
just go to Paris for a few months
for your show?

214
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,462
Then it wouldn't feel like we're moving.

215
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,662
I need to be in Paris now.

216
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:23,806
I have been here for three years.
I'm finished with New York.

217
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,273
It's time for Paris.

218
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:31,947
But I'm not finished with New York.

219
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,028
Maybe we could do
long-distance for a while.

220
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,394
You mean, back and forth?
It's never worked for me.

221
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:54,402
You know, someone meets someone,
someone gets bored.

222
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,634
I don't know.

223
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,700
Voulez-vous an ultimatum?

224
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,337
Normally, a couple doesn't go
from an ultimatum to a party.

225
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,249
But we were in charge
of bringing something very important.

226
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,685
Carrie, so glad you came.

227
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:15,085
- Enid, this is...
- Aleksandr Petrovsky. I'm thrilled.

228
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,594
Pleasure to meet you.

229
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:19,893
And this is Martin Grable.

230
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:23,424
Hi. Looks like it's going to
start snowing out there.

231
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:27,063
They say it's going to be reminiscent
of the '74 nor'easter.

232
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,401
Hello.

233
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:34,040
Martin is a food critic for Bon Appetit.

234
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,879
Fascinating.

235
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,416
The coat check is right around the corner.

236
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,417
He's very sweet and smart.

237
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,588
He's a hobbit.

238
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,159
Carrie Bradshaw!

239
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,935
Where the fuck have you been hiding?

240
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:01,462
Lexi Featherston was
one of New York's legendary party girls...

241
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,735
who always ended up on Page 6...

242
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,539
because of her barhopping
and her bedhopping.

243
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:10,742
I'm going to go up to the roof
and have a smoke. I'll be back in five.

244
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,449
He's just so pretentious.

245
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,583
- Are we still talking about him?
- It's not him.

246
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,426
I've been thinking about this,
and it's how she is around him.

247
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,965
She's different, and not in a good way.

248
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,627
She didn't laugh all night. Not once.

249
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,863
Miranda, no offense, but you never think...

250
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,132
anyone is good enough for you
and your friends.

251
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:37,505
- You didn't think I was good enough.
- That's not true.

252
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,875
Yes, it is, and it's fine.
I knew you'd come around.

253
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:47,041
"Large-scale light installations."
What the fuck is that?

254
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,350
- All right, he is kind of full of himself...
- Thank you!

255
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,323
Let's not wake the kid.

256
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,091
If she moves, it'll be okay.
You'll talk, you'll visit.

257
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,870
I bet she won't go.

258
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,376
She can't leave New York.
She's got too much here.

259
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:22,083
The best raw-milk white cheddar
I ever had was from a farm in...

260
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,123
- Guess where?
- Oh, I don't...

261
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,453
New York!

262
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,221
We now rival England
for the best cheddar in the world.

263
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:32,662
An hour later,
I had somehow ended up on Enid's date.

264
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:37,169
Actually, raw milk couldn't even be used
in the States until recently...

265
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:41,969
because it isn't pasteurized. I mean,
it basically goes from the cow right to you.

266
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,537
And Enid had somehow ended up on mine.

267
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,775
That's priceless. I never liked I.M. Pei either.

268
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:53,285
Martin, can you excuse me
just for a minute?

269
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,080
- Sure.
- Thank you.

270
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,915
Excuse me.

271
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,983
I have to tell you,
I have been a fan of your work...

272
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,154
for longer than I'd like to admit.

273
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,961
I have been doing my work
for longer than I'd like to admit.

274
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:13,430
- Carrie, I love this man.
- Yes, I see that.

275
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,269
Would anybody like a drink?

276
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,971
Are you always this attentive?
I'd love a vodka martini.

277
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,371
- Carrie?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

278
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,576
One vodka martini coming up.

279
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,118
Carrie, why aren't I with him?

280
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,753
Because I am?

281
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:39,230
- What are you doing?
- What?

282
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:46,793
All right, I'm sorry. It's not fair.

283
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,573
He's my age, and you've got him.

284
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:55,103
And I am in no-man's-land, literally.

285
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,375
No man anywhere.

286
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,850
Men can date anyone, any age,
but let's be frank...

287
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,218
most of them prefer the bimbos.

288
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,690
So if you're
a successful 50-something woman...

289
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,328
there's a very small pool.

290
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:16,300
It's very small. It's a wading pool, really.

291
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,166
So why are you swimming
in my wading pool?

292
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,838
It was another question
I wasn't prepared to answer.

293
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:26,870
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, it's down the hall.

294
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,177
Outside, the snow
was starting to come down.

295
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,484
And inside, it was going up.

296
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,984
Want some?

297
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,615
- No, thanks.
- Close the door.

298
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:44,223
- Wow, do people still do coke?
- No, unfortunately.

299
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:47,589
God, Carrie, I'm 40 years old.
Can you fucking believe it?

300
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,327
Don't answer that.

301
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:52,703
Remember when we used to go to Tunnel?
We were, like, 5.

302
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:54,329
Do you need to use the john?

303
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,704
No, I was just trying to get away
for a minute.

304
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,538
Euro-intellectuals.

305
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:02,377
I don't know why I pulled strings
to get an invite to this piece-of-shit party.

306
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm so glad to see you, though.
We're the only two single girls here.

307
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:10,817
- Well, actually, I'm with someone.
- Fuck you!

308
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,731
And speaking of little piece-of-shit parties...

309
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,795
- Babe?
- No, Harry, I cannot come to bed right now...

310
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:29,864
because someone left me a little present.

311
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:33,105
Because someone
is too pregnant to hold it in.

312
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,612
Well, someone isn't holding it in anymore.

313
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:38,844
In fact, someone
is giving birth in the bathroom.

314
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:42,613
- Right now?
- Honey, it's time.

315
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:45,618
Elizabeth Taylor, Mommy's coming!

316
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,856
That night, Charlotte embraced
her maternal instinct...

317
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,562
and three puppies.

318
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,126
Little babies.

319
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:03,535
And I embraced my boyfriend
for as long as I still had him.

320
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:07,568
So, now Rama and I split our time
between Los Angeles and Calcutta.

321
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,581
- He splits his time.
- Rama hates Los Angeles.

322
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,640
Frozen yogurt is not culture.

323
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:17,417
So she stays in our home in Calcutta,
while I edit our movies in Los Angeles.

324
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,480
But I get final Calcutta.

325
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:24,461
- Nice to meet both of you.
- You, too.

326
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,925
They aren't together all the time.
They seem happy.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,729
Carrie, I don't want that.

328
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:33,761
I want: You wake up, you see me, I see you.

329
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,405
We go for dinner, we sit in cafes.

330
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,601
Life.

331
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:42,646
I want you every day, too,
but I have a life here.

332
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:46,681
Yes. But what do you want
to come home to?

333
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,416
What do you want your life to be?

334
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,191
- Carrie, do you have a lighter?
- No, sorry, I don't smoke anymore.

335
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,558
Fuck you!

336
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:02,129
Anyway, I'm just a huge fan
of the pomegranate.

337
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,431
Do either of you have a light?

338
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:07,365
There's no smoking in here.
Please go outside.

339
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,237
There is no outside. It's fucking snowing.

340
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,000
Careful.

341
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:15,535
- She was rather rude.
- I don't even know how she got in here.

342
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,579
How do you open this fucking thing?

343
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:24,613
Excuse me, miss, could you keep it down?

344
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:28,491
You keep it down. Fucking geriatrics.

345
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,562
Now, our hostess has already said
there's no smoking.

346
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,928
When did everybody stop smoking?

347
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,426
When did everybody pair off?

348
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,801
This used to be
the most exciting city in the world.

349
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,638
And now it's nothing
but smoking near a fucking open window.

350
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,037
New York is over.

351
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,910
O-V-E-R.

352
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,442
Over.

353
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,748
No one's fun anymore!

354
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:56,978
Whatever happened to fun?

355
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,386
God, I'm so bored I could die!

356
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:10,957
It was the first time
Lexi had ever left a party early.

357
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:16,101
An hour later,
the snow really started to fall...

358
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,702
the first time that winter.

359
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,311
And it didn't stop.

360
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,842
The city was silent.

361
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,319
There were no more questions.

362
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,388
Only white noise.

363
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,934
I want to go to Paris.

364
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,778
It was a day made for first snows.

365
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:58,783
Look, Brady. Look, snow angels.

366
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,288
And staying home with family.

367
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:14,087
See that? That's called snow.

368
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:26,510
Two days later,
we said goodbye to our snow angel.

369
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,978
Wait, she tripped on her Manolo?

370
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:33,848
Stanny, the girl died. It's sad. The end.

371
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,614
I'll say it's sad.

372
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:39,757
The scandal of the New York social scene,
and I missed it.

373
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:43,192
I need details. Last words.

374
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,556
"I'm so bored I could die."

375
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:47,656
No!

376
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,865
This funeral is better than Fashion Week.

377
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,534
I know. Marcus is saving us seats
next to Hugh Jackman.

378
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,474
I'll see you in there.

379
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,609
I didn't know Lexi had so many friends.

380
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:06,447
She wasn't always so tragic.
Remember the '80s? She was the "it" girl.

381
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,247
I thought I was the "it" girl.

382
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,221
It's your word against a dead girl's,
so you win.

383
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,952
You guys,
we're supposed to be in mourning.

384
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,517
We are. It's the end of an era.

385
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:19,029
Yep, the party's officially over.

386
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,505
Ladies, if you are single in New York,
after a certain point...

387
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,909
there is nowhere to go but down.

388
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,470
Eighteen stories down, to be exact.

389
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,575
I'm going to Paris.

390
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:43,049
- That's so exciting!
- Good for you!

391
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:46,152
Because you're afraid
of going out a window?

392
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,853
No. Because I want to open a new one.

393
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,858
- What about your job?
- I quit.

394
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:54,999
- What? When did you...
- Stop.

395
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:59,332
We are done with the question portion
of the program.

396
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:01,736
I'm happy.

397
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:03,772
I'm going.

398
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,978
Now, let's go say goodbye to Lexi.

399
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,245
It really is the end of an era.

400
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:23,758
After the funeral, a couple of friends
walked a couple of blocks.

401
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:27,261
You want to go get something to eat?

402
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:30,358
- I'm not hungry, but I'll go sit with you.
- Okay.

403
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:33,427
- Isn't Gordon's around here?
- It's two blocks.

404
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,042
I can't believe you quit your job.

405
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:42,546
Couldn't you write the column there?

406
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:46,516
No. They weren't really into
my "American girl in Paris" angle.

407
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,815
New York paper, New York girl.

408
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:51,621
It got to be such a hassle, so...

409
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,653
Are they going to have
someone new write it or...

410
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:56,853
Don't know.

411
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,660
Probably some 29-year-old single girl
with all-new problems.

412
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,796
- I think you're making a mistake.
- Miranda, please.

413
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:08,304
Carrie, you can't quit your column.
It's who you are.

414
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,739
No, it's not who I am, it's what I do.

415
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,904
That's my column.

416
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:20,774
- I think I should go home.
- What? I'm not allowed to have an opinion?

417
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,878
You have an opinion.
You've had it for quite some time.

418
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:28,188
What are you going to do over there
without your job? Eat croissants?

419
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:31,956
- Why can't you be happy for me?
- I'm sorry, but...

420
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:36,828
I don't understand why you have to
move away and give up your life.

421
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,894
- You moved to Brooklyn.
- It's just Brooklyn.

422
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:44,341
I cannot stay in New York
and be single for you.

423
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,240
- What?
- This is about you.

424
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:49,610
As long as I'm here, in the same place,
writing my column...

425
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,410
then nothing has really changed.

426
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,848
No, this is about you.

427
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:57,014
No, you moved on, Charlotte's moved on,
even Samantha's moved on.

428
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,220
I can stay here and write about my life...

429
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,284
or I can go with him and live my life.

430
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,023
You mean, his life.

431
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,595
Carrie, I love you, come on!

432
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,670
Just say it! You don't like him!

433
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,603
Fine, I don't like him!

434
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:20,338
Then don't you go to Paris with him!

435
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:23,606
You're living in a fantasy!

436
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,719
Maybe I was living in a fantasy...

437
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:38,888
but I found a man
who could make it a reality.

438
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,865
And I wasn't going to question any of it.

439
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,868
Not even how he found
a horse-drawn sleigh...

440
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:47,330
in the middle of Manhattan.
