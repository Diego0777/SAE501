Subtitles - Ripped (and Hacked)
by RavyDavy - Part of the [RL] Crew

1
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,336
- Come on, let's hurry.
- I'm not dressed to hustle.

2
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:03,501
When Charlotte and I heard
there was a woman in Chelsea...

3
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:05,272
not talking or eating...

4
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:08,571
we were there in a New York minute.

5
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,927
And she's doing this for how long?

6
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:25,620
Sixteen days, 24 hours a day.

7
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:28,628
- This is Day 6.
- It gets worse?

8
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:32,895
"By changing my personal energy field...

9
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,874
"I'm attempting to change the energy field
of this room...

10
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:39,742
"and perhaps that energy shift
will shift the energy of the world."

11
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,877
Good for her. So, Pastis for lunch?

12
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:45,007
When I was working in the galleries...

13
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,179
performance art was more theater
than installation.

14
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:51,049
She's moved it to the next level.

15
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,093
Well, girlfriend needs
to move a comb through her hair.

16
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:55,958
She has company.

17
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:30,390
There's a man over there staring at me.

18
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,856
- Where?
- Over there.

19
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,330
He's not there.

20
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:47,777
Can you tell Circe that Charlotte
from his gallery on Spring Street...

21
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,282
sends her very best?

22
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,715
Okay, that's him again.

23
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,354
Oh, my God.

24
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,415
That's Aleksandr Petrovsky, the artist.

25
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,351
He is the...

26
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,961
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,593
- Would you like to keep it?
- No.

28
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,662
- Excuse me, Mr. Petrovsky.
- Yes?

29
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,966
I don't mean to bother you,
but I just have to say thank you.

30
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,706
When I first moved to New York
and was working in the galleries...

31
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:24,875
your Abstract No. 1
was my first important sale.

32
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,683
This is such a thrill.

33
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:32,258
I mean, you defined the '70s
in terms of progressive...

34
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,457
And what did you think
about this work today?

35
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,690
Very moving. Significant.

36
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,132
And what do you think?

37
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,132
It was good.

38
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,601
But you thought it was funny.

39
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,039
I heard you laugh.

40
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,665
I'm not very arty.

41
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,108
You don't think it's significant?

42
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,771
Please. There are depressed women
all over New York...

43
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,612
doing the exact same thing as her
and not calling it art.

44
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,120
Put a phone up on that platform
and it's just a typical Friday night...

45
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,882
waiting for some guy to call.

46
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,116
She's kidding.

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,159
Frankly, I don't buy
the whole 24 hours-not-eating thing.

48
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,991
I bet if anyone bothered
to come down here at 3:00 a. M...

49
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:13,590
she wouldn't even be up there.
She'd be round the corner having a Big Mac.

50
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:18,627
Why do you think she has the knife ladders?
To keep her from running out for a snack.

51
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,333
- And who are you?
- What do you mean?

52
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:23,072
Your name?

53
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,841
- Carrie Bradshaw.
- You are a comic.

54
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,779
I'm Charlotte York. I mean, Goldenblatt.

55
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,755
I forgot my married name.
I just got married, so I...

56
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,915
Can I just say again...

57
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:42,028
how very, very important your work is.

58
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,531
Oh, my God.

59
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,268
We just met Aleksandr Petrovsky.

60
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,634
"You are a comic."

61
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,569
That night, over at New Couple Central...

62
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:04,682
Hot pizza, and in less than 30 minutes.

63
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,480
I think I missed my calling.

64
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,885
You just pass by me without a kiss?

65
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,019
I had to wait till I could use my hands.

66
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:18,823
See?

67
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,831
What's with the little pizza box?

68
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,406
One is a pizza,
the other is a surprise for you...

69
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,266
after the pizza.

70
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,139
- After.
- I love surprises.

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,873
What are we drinking? Wine?

72
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:41,278
What?

73
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:45,024
One of my guys busted his knee.
I have to go to the hospital.

74
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,861
What are 6' 8" pro basketball stars
doing on a skateboard? I don't know.

75
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,221
Don't wait up.

76
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,432
I'll see you tomorrow.

77
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,195
All right, then.

78
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,371
Good night, beautiful.

79
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,245
There they were. The sweetest words
you could ever say...

80
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,318
in the sweetest way
you could ever say them.

81
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,655
Turns out Miranda didn't like surprises
as much as she thought.

82
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,835
Last night Robert said, "I love you."

83
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,271
Wow! That's wonderful.

84
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,103
On a cookie.

85
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:38,007
I need more information.

86
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,603
He brought it over, I guess, as a surprise.

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,478
But before we got to it he had to leave...

88
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,644
and then I panicked
and ate the entire thing.

89
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:48,915
Because?

90
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,786
If it wasn't there,
I wouldn't have to deal with it.

91
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,784
Now, was it the fact
that he said it on a cookie...

92
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,830
or that he said it, period?

93
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,156
It had to be the cookie.

94
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,935
Robert is great. Right?

95
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,998
I didn't wanna be the one
to have to tell you this about him...

96
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,474
but he's perfect.

97
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:14,206
I'm sorry. If your best friend can't tell you,
who will?

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,838
He is perfect.

99
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,810
Really. You should see how cute he is...

100
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,183
helping plan Brady's birthday party.

101
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,613
Brady is one year old.

102
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,286
And yet I haven't aged a day.

103
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:31,088
Saturday afternoon, my house.

104
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,724
Just us, some of Steve's family.

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm not coming if there's a clown.

106
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:39,830
- No clown.
- Good. Nothing's scarier than a clown.

107
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,103
We're gonna be four. Thanks.
What are you getting?

108
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,881
Yes, I need glasses, and I'm not ashamed.

109
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,545
I have a sexy young man
who loves to fuck me, and I'm fabulous.

110
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:57,018
Have you considered putting that
on a T-shirt?

111
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,116
Are those the kind you get at the drugstore,
next to the Bengay?

112
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,491
How dare you! These are Chanel.

113
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:10,129
Have you ever heard of that artist,
Aleksandr Petrovsky?

114
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,103
- Who?
- Aleksandr Petrovsky?

115
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,504
Oh, my God.

116
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:17,304
He was the number one hot guy
at Studio 54.

117
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:19,675
Dated every top supermodel in the '70s.

118
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,840
My nipples are getting hard
just thinking about him.

119
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,111
- Why?
- I met him yesterday.

120
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,619
No! How did he look? Is he still gorgeous?

121
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,211
We need more time.

122
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,089
Where did you meet? What's he like?

123
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:35,017
We met at a gallery and...

124
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,490
he was odd.

125
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,623
How old is he now? Let me see.

126
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,259
When I was 22, he was about 30.

127
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:46,271
Studio 54 was '79,
so that would make him, what?

128
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:49,707
- Fifty-three.
- And that would make you...

129
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:54,270
I'm forty-fucking-five.
I have nothing to hide.

130
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,477
Hello.

131
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,181
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

132
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,887
Congratulations!

133
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,795
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,230
It's very early, but I am.

135
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,666
I just heard from the doctor.
We don't know if it's the acupuncture...

136
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,704
or all the herbs that I've been taking...

137
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:22,263
or maybe Harry and I are just a better fit,
or whatever. But I'm pregnant.

138
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,175
- How far along are you?
- About three weeks.

139
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,073
Please excuse me.

140
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,551
- What was that?
- I'm growing it out.

141
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,583
My hair down there.

142
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:38,947
Smith enjoys a full bush.

143
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,623
Isn't this great?

144
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,691
Everything is exactly like it always is.

145
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,791
But I'm pregnant.

146
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,902
One lazy Wednesday afternoon later...

147
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,296
Hello?

148
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,397
Hello. Good afternoon.

149
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,370
Wrong number. Sorry.

150
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,719
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.

151
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,881
Yes, I'm sorry, too. Wrong number.

152
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,497
Yes?

153
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,438
I'm afraid it's me again.

154
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,444
I have really a bit of trouble here.

155
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:35,106
Sir, I cannot understand you.

156
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,149
This is Aleksandr Petrovsky calling...

157
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,740
for Carrie Bradshaw.

158
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,251
I'll get her, hold on.

159
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,094
Carrie!

160
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,357
Hello?

161
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,230
That was you before, yes?

162
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:56,734
Sounded just like you.

163
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,964
No, that was my sister.

164
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,700
- She's visiting.
- That's nice.

165
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,367
I hope you don't mind me calling you.

166
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,878
I got this number from the friend of yours...

167
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,915
who knows the girl who works
at the gallery at Circe.

168
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,382
I hope it's okay.

169
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,679
Okay?

170
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:15,220
Are you still laughing at that artist?

171
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,483
Excuse me?

172
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,526
Saying that she eats all night Big Macs.

173
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:24,788
- I'm sticking to my guns.
- I thought you would.

174
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,831
So let's go see her at 3:00 a.m. To be sure.

175
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,903
How's Saturday for you?

176
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,935
You're not serious.

177
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,100
I am serious, she is serious.

178
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,908
You're the one who is not serious.

179
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,913
You're expecting me
to get out of bed and go meet you...

180
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,745
at some art gallery at 3:00 a.m.?

181
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:48,981
Not 3:00. Let's say 1:00.
We'll have dinner first.

182
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,216
At the Russian Samovar.

183
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,852
1:00 a.m., a mysterious place.
I'm not getting sold into white slavery, am I?

184
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,759
I don't know what this means.

185
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,923
It was a joke.

186
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,266
Okay, comic.

187
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:06,366
Goodbye.

188
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:25,824
- Hello, again.
- Harry.

189
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,427
- It's Harry.
- Harry, hi.

190
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,428
What's wrong?

191
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:36,232
- What happened?
- It just, you know, went away.

192
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,294
Doctor says it happens all the time.

193
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,972
- How is she?
- Not good.

194
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,140
She's just been sitting and staring
since this morning.

195
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,737
She didn't want me to call anybody,
but I thought...

196
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,305
You did the right thing.

197
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,783
She's in the living room.
I told her you were coming.

198
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,584
How are you?

199
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,658
You know...

200
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,878
This is awful. I'm so sorry.

201
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:24,110
The doctor said the good news
is we got pregnant.

202
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:28,415
He said lots of women miscarry
and go on to have perfectly healthy kids.

203
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,386
It's true.

204
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,514
Shall I get you some mint tea?
How about that?

205
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:36,323
I can't go to Brady's party on Saturday.

206
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,087
Okay, she'll understand.

207
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,598
Napkins, cups.

208
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,704
- Party favors.
- Done.

209
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,940
On Saturday,
all Steve has to do is bring the cake.

210
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:56,277
- What kind?
- Chocolate with white icing.

211
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,474
Baby's first sugar. Look out.

212
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,717
You like chocolate, don't you?

213
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,883
Were you ever gonna mention anything
about the cookie?

214
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:11,128
You know what? Yes, I was.

215
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,062
If you'd give me a minute.

216
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,498
It was five days ago.

217
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,728
I'm embarrassed.

218
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,172
I ate the whole thing.

219
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,638
- It was delicious.
- Good.

220
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,680
What about what it said?

221
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,140
Sweet!

222
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,243
So sweet!

223
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:38,947
I love you, Jules.

224
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,857
I love you, Mimi.

225
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,888
I've loved you ever since I first saw you.

226
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,361
It feels so right to finally say it.

227
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,933
I don't have
to hold the words back anymore.

228
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,265
I love you, Jules.

229
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,572
I love you.

230
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,748
- Hello?
- I am so fucked up.

231
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,717
We need to divide and conquer.
What's going on?

232
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,624
I can't say, "I love you."
I just can't. It's not in my DNA.

233
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,596
And everywhere I look
it is just flying out of people's mouths.

234
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,358
- Whose mouths is it flying out of?
- Everyone.

235
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,493
- Jules and Mimi.
- They're fictional.

236
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,935
But they say it. Robert said it.

237
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,870
He said it on a cookie.

238
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,999
I am so fucked up.

239
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,009
Robert asked about the cookie,
and it was the perfect time to say it.

240
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,377
And I couldn't.

241
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,542
He was just hanging there waiting,
and I couldn't.

242
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,848
I am never gonna be happy.

243
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,545
Just not gonna happen for me.

244
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,988
Do you love him?

245
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:48,493
How can I love him
if I can't even say the words?

246
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,525
I always thought
that when the right guy came along...

247
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:55,032
all of my bullshit would calm down
and go away...

248
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,501
and the words would just fall out
of my mouth...

249
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,095
because I would know he was the one.

250
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,531
And here he is.

251
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,200
The perfect guy.

252
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,908
And I...

253
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,944
Is he the one? I don't know.

254
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,912
Because I am so fucked up.

255
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,879
And I am gonna ruin my life.

256
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,480
Stop. It's too late to ruin your life.

257
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:22,323
The only thing you're going to ruin tonight
is your night and mine.

258
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:24,761
I was kidding.

259
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,624
I'm laughing on the inside.

260
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,826
Okay, listen. Get a good night's sleep...

261
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,766
see how you feel tomorrow...

262
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:34,533
turn off Jules and Mimi, and go to bed.

263
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,103
- You've seen enough love for one night.
- You're right.

264
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,474
You know what used
to make me feel better? Cookies.

265
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,679
- Good night.
- Good night.

266
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,285
I blame Valentine's Day.

267
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:55,555
Hundreds upon hundreds of cards,
all decreeing, "You're the one."

268
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,395
Just imagine the hundreds and hundreds
of wrenching late-night phone calls...

269
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,197
all over this one idea.
And it's not just with love.

270
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,263
It seems we're always looking for that one
thing to make our lives complete.

271
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:11,139
That job, that chance, that family.

272
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,235
I couldn't help but wonder.'

273
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:16,247
When will waiting for the one be done?

274
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,523
Samantha was never a woman
who looked for the one.

275
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,789
But today, she found one.

276
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,337
A gray one.

277
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:02,286
She figured a box in the hand
was better than one in the bush.

278
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,524
Turns out, left on too long...

279
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,466
Nice and Simple was not so nice.

280
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,898
Here we go. Happy birthday.

281
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,906
Hey, birthday boy!

282
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,270
How are you?

283
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,305
Who got the clown?

284
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,075
- I did!
- Hey, Ma!

285
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:28,044
I got my grandson a clown.
The kids will love it.

286
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,713
Brady is the only kid.

287
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,550
Well, I paid him.

288
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,726
He can open the door or something.

289
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,162
Put that cake somewhere cool,
where it won't get knocked over.

290
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,533
Laundry room.

291
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,460
And tell the clown to open the door.

292
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,769
I hope you're not insulted.
I brought my own beer.

293
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:53,742
Not at all.

294
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,512
- Hi, Ma!
- Debbie!

295
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,275
There's my Debbie!

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,153
Miranda, the baby looks so cute.

297
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,622
- Thanks.
- God bless him.

298
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,284
You want a beer?

299
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,188
Sure.

300
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,231
Did you see my clown?

301
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,705
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

302
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,641
- How is she?
- The same.

303
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,845
Just stares at the TV.

304
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,108
She said she wasn't strong enough to come.

305
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,878
- I don't know what to do.
- She'll be okay.

306
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,249
She just has to feel it.

307
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,820
- Come on, there's food.
- Good.

308
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:46,825
This is the story of Elizabeth Taylor.

309
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,891
The E! True Hollywood Story.

310
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,267
We'll give you an exclusive revealing look...

311
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,670
at one of Hollywood's greatest treasures...

312
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,836
a talented and courageous woman
who is, above all, a survivor.

313
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,491
- There you are.
- I was told there'd be no clowns.

314
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,721
Nothing's scarier than a clown.

315
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,524
I need to talk to you in private.

316
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,997
It'll have to wait till I get something to eat.

317
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,762
- I'm starving.
- Here. Come.

318
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,044
Okay. What is so important
that it couldn't wait?

319
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,983
I found a gray hair.

320
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,078
- In the food?
- In my hair.

321
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,088
Down there.

322
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:49,055
What am I going to do? It's a disaster.

323
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,688
It's not a disaster.
It's all part of getting older.

324
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:54,562
- You said that yourself.
- My eyes getting old is one thing.

325
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,227
But this cannot get old.

326
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,064
What will Smith think?

327
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,629
Smith is well aware of the fact
that you're older.

328
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,642
Older, not old. And this is old.

329
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,372
No man wants to fuck grandma's pussy.

330
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:11,710
God, this is a child's birthday party.

331
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:16,281
I was going to tweeze, but if you pluck it
six more will come to its funeral.

332
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,583
Well, that's what they say.

333
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,119
- Bye.
- Stop. Please.

334
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,924
I'm not telling you the whole story.

335
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,125
- It gets worse?
- I dyed it.

336
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,892
And I left it on too long.

337
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,001
And it's the wrong color.

338
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:35,666
You have 10 seconds, and then I'm leaving.

339
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,308
- Ten, nine...
- It's red!

340
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,511
And when Smith sees it
I'll have to explain why it's red.

341
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,708
- Five, four, three...
- You don't get the magnitude of this.

342
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,650
...two, one!
- I'm Bozo the Bush!

343
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:53,150
Turns out there is something scarier
than a clown.

344
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:56,786
Elizabeth endured
a difficult tracheotomy operation...

345
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,456
hovering near death for three days.

346
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:03,695
Elizabeth Taylor's story is an epic
and an inspiration.

347
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,897
Now is the time for guts...

348
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,699
and guile.

349
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,376
This is the story of one of...

350
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:42,540
- Everything's so nice, Miranda.
- Thanks.

351
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,107
I'm real glad everything worked out.

352
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,406
You and Robert, me and Steve.

353
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,311
Because I really love him.

354
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,614
There's my girl.

355
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:02,486
I got my pipes all warmed up to sing.

356
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,820
- Now where's that cake?
- I'll get it.

357
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,028
You okay?

358
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:29,351
Hold on.

359
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:31,619
Forget those wimpy little ones.

360
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,988
Wait till you see what I've got here.

361
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,859
Look at that.

362
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,699
I love you, Steve.

363
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,529
I'm sorry, I should never have said that.
It's just that...

364
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:49,404
I love you and I fucked everything up,
and now it's too late.

365
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:53,408
I'm sorry I'm doing this. I'm sorry.
Please don't look at me.

366
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,541
I love you, too.

367
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,182
You do?

368
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,717
I mean, come on.

369
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,422
What about Debbie?

370
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:13,621
I know, but...

371
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,635
Miranda, you're the one.

372
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,402
We're getting the candle!

373
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:27,911
Hello. Where is cake?

374
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,040
Will you look at the candle
that Steve brought?

375
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,218
Look at the candle.

376
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:04,877
Make a wish, Brady.

377
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,893
Did you make a wish?

378
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,825
Give me a kiss.

379
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,168
Three weeks later
Miranda and Steve got their wish.

380
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,398
They were back together.

381
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:37,371
From a one-year-old's birthday party
to a 1.'00 a.m. Dinner party.

382
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:42,009
Hi. I'm here to meet Aleksandr Petrovsky.

383
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,150
Upstairs.

384
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,303
Good evening.

385
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,944
Don't you mean good morning?

386
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,609
You look lovely.

387
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,512
- I'm just wearing my pajamas.
- You know, you're late.

388
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,820
- It's 1:03.
- Sorry, I don't wear a watch.

389
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,756
How did you ever know your time?

390
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,058
I find that someone will always tell me.

391
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,026
1:03, did you say?

392
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,592
1:04.

393
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,565
It's very Red downstairs.

394
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:40,472
Sadly, it's what's expected of Russia.

395
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:44,778
So what's all this?

396
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:48,844
Potatoes with little dill, herring...

397
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,555
beet salad, more red...

398
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,456
veal in aspic.

399
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:58,019
What exactly is aspic?

400
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,326
Kind of a meat Jell-O?

401
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,763
Try it. It's yummy.

402
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:06,232
Do you always eat this late at night?

403
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:09,240
I usually work all night. For me it's not late.

404
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:12,766
- You work all night painting?
- Painting, sculpture, whatever.

405
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:15,472
I have a bit of an art question.

406
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,006
- As you know, Alexander...
- Aleksandr.

407
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,489
Say "Alek."

408
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,392
Call me Bob.

409
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,298
So, I'm a writer.

410
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:44,635
I write a column for a newspaper.

411
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,739
Congratulations.

412
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:57,681
Drink?

413
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,847
- What are you drinking?
- Water.

414
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,594
In that case I'll have a vodka martini, please.

415
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,560
Thank you.

416
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,263
Well, Bob...

417
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,667
this is the latest I've been up
in quite a while.

418
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,934
I even had to take a little disco nap.
Remember those?

419
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:20,404
My spies told me
you were quite the regular at Studio 54.

420
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,239
That must have been an amazing time.

421
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,476
Why don't you tell me about that?

422
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,384
What is there to remember?

423
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,582
Martha Graham's face, Andy Warhol's wig.

424
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:38,094
That's about it.

425
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:41,360
I rarely think about the past,
but I care about...

426
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,299
what can happen today. Tonight.

427
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:47,495
What may happen tomorrow.

428
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,232
Yes?

429
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:03,413
I have something to show you,
and I don't want you to freak out.

430
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,424
Oh, man.

431
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:12,326
- Where did it all go?
- I shaved.

432
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,557
Bummer.

433
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:17,497
Look, I know you enjoy a full bush.

434
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:20,896
But there's something I should tell you.

435
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,069
There is one moment in every relationship...

436
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:27,503
where you risk letting someone know
the real you.

437
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,770
I'm a working woman...

438
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:33,545
and I don't have time for you
to be down there searching for it.

439
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:38,055
So I wanted to make everything
nice and simple.

440
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:40,514
This was not that moment.

441
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:44,558
- How long have you lived in New York?
- A long time.

442
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,358
Off and on Paris, London,
and a few other places.

443
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:50,558
- I like New York. It's honest.
- Honest?

444
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,932
There's no big smile on its face.
It's dark, painful...

445
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,598
I like it.

446
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,473
Okay, you are way too Russian.

447
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:03,105
You'd get a girl out of bed
to tell her you like pain?

448
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:07,483
It's 2:00 a.m. Lighten up, Bob.

449
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:10,184
Don't you know any jokes?

450
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:14,592
- More meat?
- Fruit and tea.

451
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,261
We sweeten our tea with black cherries.
It's good.

452
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:22,232
Try it. You'll like it.

453
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:30,270
- Fruit?
- I'm not really a fruit person.

454
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:33,368
Take a banana.
Put it in your purse for breakfast.

455
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,707
I insist.

456
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,656
There is a banana in your purse,
or are you just very happy to see me?

457
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:50,691
You asked for a joke.

458
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,227
At exactly 3:01...

459
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:02,637
we pulled up in front of the gallery
to see if art was alive and awake.

460
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,238
- My purse, I left it in the cab.
- Taxi!

461
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:14,310
Wait!

462
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,780
Don't go! Wait a minute!

463
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,292
Here we go.

464
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,278
Do you want to give her a banana?

465
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,988
Of all my odd dates, this was number one.

466
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:03,993
Taxi!

467
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:08,328
Hi.

468
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:10,738
Where do you go? Where do you wanna go?

469
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,285
Where is he going?

470
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,420
I asked him to wait
so we could have proper good night.

471
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,730
- Thanks for dinner.
- You're welcome.

472
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,264
I live right near here.

473
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,708
- I thought you lived way downtown.
- That is near.

474
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:52,542
You can take the boy out of Studio 54...

475
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,609
but you can't take Studio 54 out of the boy.

476
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:57,545
You are funny.

477
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,850
Light.

478
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:05,628
So not tonight?

479
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,645
And he tasted like black cherries.
