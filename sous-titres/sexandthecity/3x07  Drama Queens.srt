1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,841
It happened two days ago.

2
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,350
Aidan and I had been seeing each other
for three weeks when...

3
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,118
- What is it? Bad dream?
- I'm not sure.

4
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,729
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

5
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,326
The truth was I really didn't.

6
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,732
The next day
I searched for unpaid bills,

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,205
unanswered calls, unmet deadlines.

8
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,812
But I hadn't so much as missed
a teeth cleaning.

9
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,914
My life appeared to be in order.

10
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,343
But the next night, like clockwork...

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,089
I realized I was in an existential crisis.

12
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,923
One that not even the sight of this
season's Dolce & Gabbana sandals

13
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,758
could lift me out of.

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,740
Do you wanna spend the night?

15
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,710
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Relax. I'll get it.

16
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,587
Then I realized it.

17
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,991
What was wrong was,
for the first time in my life,

18
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,792
I was in a relationship
where absolutely nothing was wrong.

19
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,329
It's smooth sailing.

20
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,975
Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons.

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
See what I'm saying?

22
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,470
Absolutely. Not a cloud in sight.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
We adore each other.

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,246
We have fun. We mesh.

25
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,817
And this is a problem?

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:39,619
It feels odd.
I'm used to the hunt.

27
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,786
This is... effortless.
It's freaking me out.

28
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,400
I totally understand.
You're not getting the stomach flip.

29
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,002
Which is just a fear of losing the guy.

30
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,229
Maybe I'm not used to
being with someone

31
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,705
who doesn't do the seductive
withholding dance.

32
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:01,575
But there is an upside to being
with a guy with no surprises.

33
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,377
Steve is completely predictable,
but that's what I love about him.

34
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,112
He's so comfortable and safe.

35
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,449
Are you dating a man or a mini-van?

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,492
My new favorite thing to do
on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry

37
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,558
and I've never been happier.

38
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,892
Your relationship
is my greatest fear realized.

39
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,297
I understand your dilemma
and from my experience,

40
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,667
if he seems too good to be true,
he probably is.

41
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,969
I don't believe this. Now we're
dumping guys for being too available.

42
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,706
This is all solid proof of what
I've read in this great new book.

43
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,316
It says if you
really wanna get married,

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,113
you shouldn't spend so much time
around dysfunctional single women.

45
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,846
"Marriage Incorporated:

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:49,017
"How to apply successful business
strategies to finding a husband".

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:54,030
Chapter one:
"How To Get Ahead By Giving Head".

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Fine! Make fun.
It's a very smart book.

49
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,663
It encourages professional women
to approach finding a mate

50
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,073
with the dedication and organization
they bring to their careers.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,271
I'm more a student of chaos theory.

52
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,282
If you don't see as much of me,
I'm with my married friends.

53
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,944
And how will this help you
meet your mate?

54
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:21,560
Bachelor friends of married men are
the city's greatest untapped resource.

55
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,219
The way to meet them
is through the husbands.

56
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,561
So my first assignment is to befriend
the husbands. It's my new job.

57
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:33,263
That evening, as Charlotte began
her new career as a husband-hunter,

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,432
Miranda returned home to feather
her stress-free love nest.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,912
- I heated up some leftover lasagne.
- Great. I'm starving.

60
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,745
- Wanna get some plates?
- What for? It's just us.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,011
An hour later it was on to dessert.

62
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,220
Followed by exactly eight minutes
of no-frills sex.

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,265
And 12 minutes of "Front Line".

64
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,641
Theirs was the kind of closeness
that only came from true intimacy.

65
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:21,083
Samantha was experiencing intimacy
that only came from anonymity.

66
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,279
His name was Dr. Mark Raskin.

67
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,754
An ear, nose and throat man
that Samantha met...

68
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,759
actually we're not sure where.
Suffice to say it happened quickly.

69
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,056
Will you get me some water, please?

70
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,667
- What for?
- I want to take a hit of Viagra.

71
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,967
Number one -
that's very presumptuous of you.

72
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,766
And number two -

73
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,639
from what I can tell, you don't need
any help in that area whatsoever.

74
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,305
I don't need it.
I just take it recreationally.

75
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,314
What does it do for you?

76
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,650
Sends me on a rocket trip
right through your solar system.

77
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,061
I'll be right back with that...

78
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,355
...water.

79
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,538
While Samantha enjoyed
the thrill of the new

80
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,148
and Miranda's relationship
happily floated on a placid sea

81
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,342
I was searching for hidden icebergs.

82
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,282
Why are you still single?

83
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,615
- Why are you still single?
- Don't do that.

84
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,554
I hate it when guys act all cute.

85
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,157
- What?
- Waiting for an apology.

86
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,358
OK. I'm a bitch. I'm sorry.

87
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,561
You should know I get a tad bitchy
from time to time.

88
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,799
I'm sure you have your bad traits.
And they would be?

89
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,001
- Alphabetically?
- Whatever you got.

90
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,170
It's all gonna come out eventually,
so I'd like to know now

91
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,043
and that way I can decide
if I'd like to deal with it or not.

92
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,844
This is the strangest two blocks
I ever walked.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,458
Again I'm sorry, but this relationship
cannot just sail on like it is: Perfect.

94
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,856
Frankly, I can't take the pressure.

95
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,757
OK. I'm gonna kiss you now.

96
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:21,240
Seriously. What the hell is wrong
with you that you're not married?

97
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,274
- Tell me.
- Can't you relax and go with the flow.

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,540
Go with the flow? No, I can't do that.
It's so seventies.

99
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,615
How long you think
this phase is gonna last?

100
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,448
My folks are coming this weekend
and I want you to meet them.

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,759
- That's so...
- Fifties?

102
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,155
That is really nice.

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,698
So, these parents
that are coming to town...

104
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,203
do they know what's wrong with you?

105
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,103
Let's get you a doughnut.

106
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,205
Nuts.

107
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,610
The next evening, taking a page
from "Marriage Incorporated",

108
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,948
Charlotte had dinner with her
married friends, Amy and Dennis.

109
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,555
Allow me to get right to the point.

110
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,558
After careful consideration,
I've decided that I'm getting married.

111
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,562
- Charlotte, that's wonderful!
- Who's the lucky guy?

112
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,599
I don't know yet.
That's where you two come in.

113
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:27,228
Dennis, name one great single friend
that you have to fix me up with.

114
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:33,140
I don't know.
No one you'd like offhand.

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,475
- What about Phil?
- Phil, yeah.

116
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,609
If he can tear himself away from his
internet company to go on a date.

117
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,345
Yes! Phil.

118
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,990
Phil, Phil, Phil.

119
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,352
He is so nice and cute.

120
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,826
- You think Phil's cute?
- He's cute.

121
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,328
I can see that.

122
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,697
Great. Then it's all set up.
I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,930
Look! I have tickets
to the opera on Saturday night.

124
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,167
- I would like to take Phil.
- Great.

125
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,907
The next morning before work,
while sorting Steve's laundry,

126
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,986
Miranda came face to face
with the true meaning of intimacy.

127
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,988
I was wrong.

128
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,223
There is a point where a couple
can get too comfortable.

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,426
I reached it this morning
washing Steve's underwear.

130
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,627
Why, what happened?

131
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:38,004
- I'm living with "skid marks" guy.
- Oh, no! Terrible.

132
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,170
I don't get it.
Why do men get skid marks?

133
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,043
Is it laziness?
Or are they just in a rush?

134
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,620
I don't know but it goes hand in hand
with urinating on the seat.

135
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,690
I tell you one thing. When
your boyfriend is so comfortable

136
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:57,158
he can't be bothered to wipe his ass,
that's the end of romance.

137
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,764
It's certainly the end of laundry night.

138
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,869
It got me thinking. Maybe I mistake
falling into a rut with intimacy.

139
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,029
- How often are you having sex?
- Often enough.

140
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,675
But it's totally generic.
We've got every move down pat.

141
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,869
It's more like a race
to have an orgasm.

142
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,176
- It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?
- Sure. I know what you mean.

143
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,481
We whine when we don't have
a boyfriend, we whine when we do.

144
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:27,285
Do you remember how Big
kept me away from his mother?

145
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,395
- I remember.
- And how pissed it used to make me?

146
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,829
Now, Aidan's offering both his parents
on a silver platter

147
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,526
and I'm not sure I want to meet them.

148
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,694
Maybe it's too soon.

149
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,898
I've never met Steve's mother
and I'm in no rush.

150
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,273
The irony is Aidan's acting exactly
how I wish Big would have behaved.

151
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,846
And I'm behaving just like Big.

152
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,043
Maybe you don't believe it's for real
unless somebody plays hard to get.

153
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,814
When things come too easy,
we're suspect.

154
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,447
Do they have to get complicated
before we believe they're for real?

155
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,255
We're raised to believe that
true love never runs smoothly.

156
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,829
There always have to be
obstacles in Act Two

157
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,763
before you can live
happily ever after in Act Three.

158
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,403
But what happens when
the obstacles aren't there?

159
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,233
Does that mean
there's something missing?

160
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,605
Do we need drama
to make a relationship work?

161
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,179
A few days later, still hearing no word
from Dennis about her date

162
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,976
Charlotte made a call to his office.

163
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,587
Charlotte Yorke.
He can reach me at home or at work

164
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,282
and it's very important because I have
tickets to the opera on Saturday.

165
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,326
Never mind, just have him call me.

166
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,829
Her call unanswered,
Charlotte followed up persistently.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,197
Can you tell Dennis
that Charlotte Yorke called?

168
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,362
Yes, he'll know what it's regarding.

169
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,134
It's regarding my future husband, Phil.

170
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,833
OK? Thank you.

171
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,139
Hi. You've reached
the office of Dennis Fincher.

172
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,578
I'm either out of the office
or away from my desk.

173
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,412
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

174
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:06,388
Well. Obviously, you have some good
reason for keeping Phil and I apart.

175
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,656
I can't imagine what it is
but this is Phil's loss and not mine

176
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,560
and don't bother
returning this call either.

177
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,104
While Charlotte was a woman on
the verge of a nervous breakdown...

178
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,574
...my anxiety-free relationship
was driving me crazy.

179
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,987
Excuse me.

180
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,223
- Sorry it's taking so long.
- That's all right.

181
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,024
I'm gonna have to pass on dinner.
It's getting so late. I've got a deadline.

182
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,962
OK. No problem.

183
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,161
My parents get in tomorrow night.
They'll want to crash.

184
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,366
But I thought you'd meet us
for breakfast the next day.

185
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:04,339
I've been thinking
about this meeting your parents.

186
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,044
- I just wondered if it's a good idea.
- They gonna love you.

187
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,749
No, I'm not worried about that.
Parents always think I'm adorable.

188
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,690
- What's the problem?
- Well...

189
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,696
What if they love me...
and if we break up

190
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:25,269
you'll always have to explain to them
what happened to the adorable girl.

191
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,032
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No.

192
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:37,004
Where I come from,
meeting the parents... Oh, so big!

193
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,243
- You'll meet them some other time.
- OK.

194
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,378
So, I guess we won't be seeing
each other this weekend.

195
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,052
- I'll miss you.
- Maybe that's good.

196
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:54,256
Maybe we should see each other less
then we can miss each other more.

197
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,930
You're so available to me,
and I'm so available to you.

198
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,371
Maybe we're both too...

199
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,640
...available.

200
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,407
Carrie, it's no big deal.
I have a life.

201
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,574
I'm just making room for you.

202
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,777
You always say the right things.

203
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,292
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

204
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,069
This is nuts. I'm sabotaging
the best relationship I've ever had.

205
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,307
It's better to have a man waiting
for you than the other way around.

206
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,749
- I guess.
- And if you hadn't been available,

207
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,151
I'd be here alone,
just some pathetic dateless freak.

208
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,451
So glad it worked out for you.

209
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,791
- Who are you calling?
- I'm not taking this lying down.

210
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,727
Hi. You've reached Amy and Dennis.
Leave it at the beep.

211
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:10,001
Well, here I am at the opera
which I planned on going to with Phil,

212
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,144
who I guess you've decided
I'm not good enough for.

213
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,780
Charlotte?
It's Dennis.

214
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,644
I'm so sorry.
I just got back from a business trip.

215
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,581
My secretary gave me
all your messages.

216
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,621
I had no idea
you wanted to meet Phil so badly.

217
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,157
Well, he sounded nice.
It's not a big deal.

218
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,559
Why don't I set something up
tomorrow evening? 7:30?

219
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,626
- You know Rudy's, Midtown?
- I love that place.

220
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:41,239
Phil will meet you there.
I guarantee it.

221
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:49,039
I'm so silly. I created all that drama
in my head for nothing.

222
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,580
- What are we seeing again?
- "Aida."

223
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:06,621
- I guess I'm in for another wild ride.
- I'd say we both are.

224
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,464
What would happen
if I tried one of these?

225
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,233
I don't think they've established
that it works for women.

226
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,275
There's no harm in trying is there,
doctor?

227
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,238
Bottoms up!

228
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,652
20 minutes later,

229
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,987
Samantha officially became
the first woman to land on the moon.

230
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,907
- Isn't the opera romantic?
- Even more so with a man.

231
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,206
Well, I did expect to be taking Phil.

232
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,647
It's quite a lovely evening you planned
for a man you've never even met.

233
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,910
He sounded really nice.

234
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,419
- Here.
- Thanks.

235
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,758
You know what, honey,
I'm not feeling well. I'm going home.

236
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,993
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, I'm fine. Stay, enjoy.

237
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,331
It's all right. I'll call you.

238
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,535
I'll be right back.

239
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,112
I knew it was rude and over-dramatic,

240
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,842
but I felt like I'd just seen
the phantom of the opera.

241
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,594
Yes, ditching Charlotte
was slightly hysterical,

242
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,665
but the idea of sitting across
from Big and Natasha

243
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,031
through the second act of "Aida"
was too emotional to bear.

244
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,743
This time I knew what was wrong.

245
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,971
The shock of seeing Big again
not only made my stomach flip

246
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,015
it sent my spleen leaping
right into my throat.

247
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,995
- Hello.
- It's me. I'm really sorry.

248
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:56,793
- What's wrong?
- I saw Big tonight at the opera.

249
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,529
- That's why you ditched Charlotte.
- She told you. Was she pissed?

250
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,834
I think she's swearing
off women forever.

251
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,708
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm great actually.

252
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,977
I'm realizing that maybe there is
something to this available man thing.

253
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:19,553
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
Just separate your whites.

254
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:24,059
Now I know I wanna be with a man
who wants to be with me.

255
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,823
I've had enough relationship drama
for one lifetime.

256
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?

257
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,771
It's 3:00 am.
I'll wait until a more civilized hour.

258
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,932
The next morning I waited
until a decent hour to call Aidan

259
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,203
and tell him how much I missed him.

260
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,349
- Furniture Company.
- Hi, it's Carrie calling for Aidan.

261
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,383
- He's not here right now.
- He's not?

262
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,080
- Just tell him I called.
- I'll give him the message.

263
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,281
- Thanks.
- Bye.

264
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,389
When I hadn't heard from him
by that evening

265
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,398
I began to get butterflies
in my stomach.

266
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,570
Hey, I'm not in but Pete is.

267
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,275
Hey. It's Carrie.
Remember me?

268
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:17,404
The girl you wanted to introduce
to your parents.

269
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,983
I'm just calling to say hey.

270
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,717
Hey.

271
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,288
I was getting a dreaded feeling
that I had played this all wrong.

272
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:34,899
Suddenly, the idea of losing Aidan
left me short of breath.

273
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,336
Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not
to breathe near Steve's shorts.

274
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,209
What are you doing?

275
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,975
I thought you might need some help
with the wash.

276
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,245
But there's nothing like a twist
in the third act

277
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,151
to spice up even
the most banal scenario.

278
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,423
And while Miranda and Steve
found new life in the familiar,

279
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,192
Charlotte was blindly feeling
her way through the unfamiliar.

280
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,073
Excuse me.
Are you Phil?

281
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,673
Sorry.

282
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,506
- Are you Phil?
- I could be.

283
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,709
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

284
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,083
- Are you here to chaperone?
- Yes, sort of.

285
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,017
What's wrong?
You couldn't trust me alone with Phil?

286
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,789
Charlotte, Phil's not coming...
I never called Phil.

287
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,833
I didn't want you to meet him. You'd
like him and that could be a problem.

288
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,766
- What are you talking about?
- I'm in love with you, Charlotte.

289
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,337
You can't be in love with me -
you're married to my friend.

290
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:58,006
Things haven't been great with us,
and I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,777
- This is nuts.
- Don't leave.

292
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,979
You kept your single friends
away from me so you could cheat?

293
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,192
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- You're such a spark plug. I love that.

294
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,262
I'm not interested
in starting some married man's car.

295
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,399
Wait. Don't leave, please.
I love you!

296
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,463
Charlotte, please. I love you. Wait.

297
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,837
- Taxi!
- What the hell?

298
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,079
Are you all right?

299
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,447
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,519
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.

301
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,088
- I'm Trey.
- Charlotte.

302
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,033
And that's how,
in the most dramatic fashion,

303
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,795
Charlotte met her new leading man.

304
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,148
Well, time to pop
one of those baby blues.

305
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,341
Let's go au naturel this time.

306
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:11,184
No, I really want one.

307
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,123
- Don't you think it's good without it?
- No, I do not!

308
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,285
Let's save it for those special times.

309
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,192
Give me my pills, goddammit!

310
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:25,667
Mark realized he had brought too
much intensity to their relationship.

311
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,431
He wrote Samantha a prescription

312
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,302
and she promised
never to call him again.

313
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,679
You have no messages.

314
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,674
After two days
of not hearing from Aidan,

315
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,844
I realized only a dramatic gesture
could salvage things.

316
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,595
- You gonna...
- Hi, how are you?

317
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,859
You're gonna like this.

318
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,879
What's going on?

319
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,611
You asked me to be here,
and I wasn't sure if I could.

320
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:21,058
Honestly... I mean,
meeting the parents is so...

321
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:25,628
Then I realized I wanna meet them but
I didn't know if you still wanted me to.

322
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:30,461
I've called and you haven't called me,
so then I thought I'm just gonna go,

323
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:37,097
because being in a relationship
means taking a risk... a leap of faith.

324
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:42,008
No matter how many times one
might have been disappointed before.

325
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,982
I said to myself I'm just gonna show
up... because you're a good man.

326
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,151
A really good man.

327
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:59,957
- Why haven't you called me back?
- I was just trying to be less available.

328
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,999
Really?

329
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,770
You don't have to do everything I say.

330
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,037
Well, you're here now.
Can I introduce you to my parents?

331
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,443
- Won't they think I'm nuts?
- Probably.

332
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,176
They'll just have to get used to that.

333
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,850
Come on, Nuts.

334
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,185
I realized then, that I had made
my stomach flip all on my own.

335
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,692
And it felt really nice.
