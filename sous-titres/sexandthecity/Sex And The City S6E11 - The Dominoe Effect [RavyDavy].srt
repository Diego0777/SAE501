1
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:51,986
Taxi!

2
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:03,138
There are some New York nights
that are monumental...

3
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,810
gigantic, historic.

4
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,844
Others are just Big.

5
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,409
Bet you can't get steaks like this
in your little Napa village, can you?

6
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,288
Where do you think this cattle comes from,
a ranch on Canal Street?

7
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:22,852
Well, what we lack in livestock,
we make up for in cabs.

8
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,463
Napa has cabs.

9
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,863
Fine, you win. I don't want to fight about it.

10
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,697
Let's fight. Then we can make up.

11
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,367
So what's on your New York agenda?

12
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,069
Making some deals, breaking some hearts?

13
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,170
- Can I tell you a secret?
- That's not your real hair?

14
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,778
I'm having a little heart thing done.

15
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:47,575
What?

16
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:51,351
They found a blockage
so I'm getting an angioplasty.

17
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,992
Simple procedure, no big deal.
But I can kiss these goodbye.

18
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:04,160
Carrie, calm down.

19
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,664
Come on, don't be such a sissy.

20
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:12,806
It's nothing.
They do a million of these a day.

21
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,443
- It's like having your teeth cleaned.
- You are so sick.

22
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:19,646
Miss?

23
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,255
She's fine.
Could you bring some extra napkins...

24
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:28,120
and some violins?

25
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,426
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,294
Uptown, there was a different kind of dinner
being prepared...

27
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,860
with less cholesterol and no tears.

28
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,109
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

29
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:48,344
However you got in here, I don't care.
I applaud you.

30
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:52,977
Miranda's new neighbor, Dr. Robert Leeds,
had quickly become her new boyfriend.

31
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,782
Doctor of all trades.

32
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,846
Magda let me in. She was very excited...

33
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,756
at the idea of someone using your kitchen
to prepare food.

34
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,589
Well, it's a first.

35
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:05,422
- I didn't know you could cook.
- I make one thing.

36
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,094
Enchiladas, baby.

37
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:11,829
Here.

38
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,840
It's spicy.

39
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,140
You can handle it.

40
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:23,643
Come on.

41
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,287
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,883
I have placemats?

43
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,266
How am I gonna repay you for all this?
I only make Lean Cuisine.

44
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,432
- I have one idea.
- Done.

45
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:45,565
No, it's another idea. But it's related.

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,135
Take tomorrow off.

47
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,139
From work?

48
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:56,441
- I don't do that.
- Just think about it. Brady's with his dad.

49
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:59,815
I don't have to work until 7:00.
We can spend the whole day together.

50
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,480
I bet you have a few personal days
stored up.

51
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,287
Just think about it.

52
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:10,326
Truth be told, Miranda had never taken
a personal day in her entire career.

53
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:15,724
Then again, no one had ever
made her enchiladas before.

54
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,850
Whoa! Jeez!

55
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,524
What are you doing here?

56
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,893
Oh, my God, are you okay?

57
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,629
I'm seeing spots.

58
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,800
- Let me take a look at that.
- Whoa! Who the hell are you?

59
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,266
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,032
I forgot Brady's eardrops.
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,595
I took a personal day.

62
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,538
- I'm Robert.
- This is Robert.

63
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,339
- I'm a doctor.
- He's a doctor and my boyfriend.

64
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,945
I'm sorry.
Is it weird that I just called you that?

65
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,413
No, I like it.

66
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,841
Hey, do you wanna help me here, or what?

67
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:07,887
Let's take this in the bathroom.
Can you get us some ice?

68
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,717
Bend your head forward slightly and sit.

69
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,986
So, how long have you two
been hanging out?

70
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,686
Oh, about a month.

71
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,559
I was gonna mention it
when the time was right.

72
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:20,028
I was just waiting for the right time.

73
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,593
Keep applying pressure.

74
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,831
- So anyway, this is Steve, Brady's dad.
- Good to meet you.

75
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,634
- Oh, my God! Who's watching the baby?
- My ma...

76
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:31,868
- and Debbie.
- He should be fine. It's just bruised.

77
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,435
- I'm gonna need a tampon.
- What?

78
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:34,537
What the fuck?

79
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,981
It's a little trick we use at work.
And some scissors. Here.

80
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,249
What are you, some nose guy or something?

81
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,687
- No, I'm in sports medicine.
- For the Knicks.

82
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,725
Adding insult to injury.

83
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,290
This should do it.

84
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,671
So that pretty much solves the problem...

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,708
of how Robert and Steve are going to meet.

86
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:06,143
I guess I can check that off my list
of things to do.

87
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,144
That's horrifying.

88
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:12,617
I will continue to be horrified by that story
all day long.

89
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:16,144
And poor Steve,
he was in such a vulnerable position...

90
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:19,783
with the sex, and the bloody nose,
and the doctor boyfriend.

91
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,155
Well, you won.

92
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,661
- It's not a competition.
- You're right.

93
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,598
She's being fucked by a hot, black doctor,
and Steve had a tampon up his nose.

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,895
No contest.

95
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,697
Okay, I hate to admit this...

96
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,604
but there is part of me
that took some pleasure in the whole thing.

97
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,368
Is that terrible?

98
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:39,640
No, it's not as though
you planned it that way.

99
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,941
- Did you?
- No!

100
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,543
I'm crazy about Robert.

101
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,818
So why do I even care what Steve thinks?

102
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,786
Because you've been through a lot with him.

103
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:51,255
Some people just get under your skin
and stay there.

104
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,758
- When I saw Big the other night...
- Big is in town?

105
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,954
Yeah, he's here for a little heart thing.

106
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,020
What, is he on the wait list to get one?

107
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:02,592
No, and you're going to feel
incredibly bad in a minute.

108
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:06,500
He's here
because he's having heart surgery.

109
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,966
Okay, I'm officially a monster.
Please continue.

110
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,637
No, it's okay.
It's actually a fairly routine procedure.

111
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,304
They found a blockage.

112
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,109
Honey.

113
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:20,883
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:25,849
This is exactly what happened
the other night when he told me.

115
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,723
I know he's gonna be fine, but...

116
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,855
What is going on with me?

117
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,557
Ladies lunching!

118
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:39,366
Bitsy Von Muffling had recently married
cabaret singer Bobby Fine...

119
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,205
known to everyone, but Bitsy,
as the gayest gay man alive.

120
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,836
My goodness, look at you.

121
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:51,111
Can you believe it? Me, pregnant. It's a girl.

122
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,243
Bobby is so excited,
he's already got two names picked out.

123
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,881
Judy or Barbara. We're gonna wait
to see what she looks like.

124
00:07:58,391 --> 00:07:59,449
I like Judy.

125
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:03,929
And I owe it all to Dr. Mao.
Or as we call him, "Dr. Wow."

126
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,529
Acupuncturistlmiracle-worker.

127
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:11,629
Seriously, I couldn't take it anymore
with the IUls and the IVFs and the l-give-up.

128
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,463
Anyway, then I go to this guy and poof!
I'm with child.

129
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,505
Just from going to acupuncture?

130
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:21,308
I don't know how the hell it works,
but this guy could get a cactus pregnant.

131
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,441
Anyway, I've got to run,
or shall I say waddle.

132
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,777
- It was great seeing you girls.
- Bye.

133
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,118
How is that physically possible?
That woman is 50 years old.

134
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,390
And married to a fag.

135
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,897
I have got to go see that Dr. Mao.

136
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,569
- Hello.
- Hi.

137
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,635
I have a 3:00 with Dr. Mao.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,105
I said to her, "Go see Dr. Mao."

139
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,118
I know someone who tried for five years
and never saw results.

140
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,086
Did she drink the teas religiously?

141
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,589
Tell her to drink them.
They're smelly, but they work.

142
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:07,421
My friend Lois got pregnant
on her third visit.

143
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,985
I know a woman who was told
she'd never get pregnant. Ever.

144
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,588
Because she wasn't ovulating.

145
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,327
And guess what?
She's expecting her fourth this Christmas.

146
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,494
Yes! That's fabulous.

147
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,596
This woman said that the teas and the herbs
are really important.

148
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:24,609
I'm just wondering, because I started
fertility treatments with my first husband...

149
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,702
but now I'm remarried.
So this woman thought...

150
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,646
Mrs. Goldenblatt, I have all that information.

151
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:33,083
Let's just concentrate
on what we're doing here, in this room.

152
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:37,213
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Just relax with your own thoughts.

153
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,534
I know a woman who was told
she'd never get pregnant. Ever.

154
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,162
Because she wasn't ovulating.

155
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,868
And guess what?
She's expecting her fourth this Christmas.

156
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,372
From Eastern medicine
on the Upper West Side...

157
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:02,774
Hello?

158
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,511
...to Western medicine
on the Upper East Side.

159
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,523
- Hey, kid.
- How are you?

160
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,928
I'm alive!

161
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,735
You asshole!

162
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,632
What did you think, I'd be dead already?

163
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,197
I don't know.

164
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,066
Hospitals scare me.

165
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,111
I'm fine, I'm great. I've never felt better.

166
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,705
Boy, you should have seen your face.

167
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,010
You're such an easy mark.

168
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,547
It's Ruby time.

169
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,719
Ruby's my favorite.

170
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:51,525
- He says that to all the nurses, doesn't he?
- It's a safe assumption.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,127
All right, darling, come on. Up.

172
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,768
That hurts. That's it.

173
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,207
Oh, boy, there she goes again,
old waterworks.

174
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,675
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm sorry.

175
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,103
Just ignore me.

176
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,945
So sweet. She's worried about you.

177
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,720
Don't cry. Your husband will be fine.

178
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,051
No, he's not my husband.

179
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:23,859
Meanwhile, Samantha welcomed Smith back
from his movie location with open arms.

180
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,899
Now put your index finger on my clit.

181
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,629
Good, but less pressure.

182
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,535
Okay, now two fingers.

183
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,036
A little higher.

184
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,080
Little bit more to the left.

185
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,945
You feel that ridge?

186
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,681
What, did you take a directing seminar
while I was gone?

187
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,780
I did some summer reading.

188
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:55,017
Okay, now keep your finger there
but move your thumb higher.

189
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:56,751
Higher.

190
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,595
I missed those hands.

191
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:04,296
So where do you want to eat?

192
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,830
Later, without direction, Smith tried
the most intimate hand position of all.

193
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,308
I don't know. What do you feel like?

194
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,339
Sushi, maybe, or Thai.

195
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,276
No, I just had...

196
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,343
Babe?

197
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,319
You okay?

198
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:36,293
- I have a new sympathy for the disabled.
- What happened to you?

199
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,499
I'm fine. I just fell into one of those hatches
on the sidewalk. It was stupid.

200
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,734
God, that's my biggest fear.
How did that happen?

201
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,299
It was Smith's fault.

202
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,811
He did something to me
that was so perverse.

203
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,508
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
He tried to hold my hand.

204
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:55,720
You mean to tell me
that Smith is a hand-holder?

205
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,817
And to think he once served us food.

206
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,621
You laugh, but it's part of a bigger problem.

207
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,930
Do you know that I didn't fuck
a single or a married guy...

208
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,933
the whole time Smith was out of town?
And I'll tell you something else.

209
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,263
I missed him.

210
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:15,603
Well, sounds to me like he missed you, too.
Hence the deviant behavior.

211
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:19,736
Like it or not, that little tadpole is wide open
and there for you.

212
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:23,507
Life's short. You might want to consider
holding his hand.

213
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,316
Okay, it happened again.

214
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,856
The crying.
When I visited Big at the hospital.

215
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,323
That's three times now.

216
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,622
I suggest waterproof mascara.

217
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,425
I finally figured out
the only way to have Big in my life...

218
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,466
was to block out certain feelings.

219
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:44,128
And now every feeling that I ever had
is bubbling up all over the place...

220
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,364
with nowhere to go except out my eyeballs.

221
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,532
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Nothing.

222
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,975
There's nothing to do.
Big is who he is. He's never gonna change.

223
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,705
He's limited and I accept that.

224
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,079
So he'll go back to Napa
and I'll go back to not crying. The end.

225
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,047
If it hurts so much,
why are we going shopping?

226
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:05,022
I have a broken toe, not a broken spirit.

227
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,683
Well, come on then. Move that booty.

228
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,361
If New York City's signature fruit
is the apple...

229
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:18,631
then its signature sound
is the ambulance siren.

230
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,796
It seems like all day, every day,
people are getting hurt...

231
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,605
and the whole city has to hear about it.

232
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:30,180
But what about the injuries
that don't get a siren?

233
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,649
Whether you're falling into a hole
in the street...

234
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:34,845
or possibly falling back in love...

235
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,914
just how dangerous is an open heart?

236
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,369
Hello, Mount Sinai Hospital.

237
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:56,568
Hi, can I please be connected to Room 817?

238
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,375
Let me see.

239
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:01,506
That patient left the hospital this morning.

240
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,451
How did you find me?

241
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:13,014
When you weren't at the morgue,
I figured you were at the Four Seasons.

242
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,150
And here you are.

243
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:17,594
You know, I'd invite you in, sniffles,
but I've run out of Kleenex.

244
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:20,723
Should I call the concierge
or did you bring your own?

245
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,692
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:25,828
You must have me confused
with someone else.

247
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:29,602
I'm Candy, your candy striper.

248
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,134
Stop. Put your coat back on.
Are you trying to kill me?

249
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,238
I can't smoke, I can't drink...

250
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,375
and I can't get excited about anything.

251
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,945
I'm in the union. I know the rules.

252
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:47,049
It's a damn shame, too,
because I love a cute candy stripper.

253
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,856
This isn't about stripping,
it's about striping.

254
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,864
It's a complete waste of the hotel room,
if you ask me.

255
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,593
What are we gonna do now?

256
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,596
Candy's got a whole bagful
of peachy fun in here.

257
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,037
- Oh, goody.
- Starting with...

258
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,267
dominoes. Classic and Day-Glo.

259
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:08,871
Dominoes? Why don't you just
take off your dress and kill me now?

260
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,176
Get it over with.

261
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,979
Nobody wins with that kind of attitude.

262
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:21,653
Meanwhile, across town,
another caregiver was taking precautions.

263
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,786
I know, almost done.

264
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,524
Yeah, there we are. Now we're...

265
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,402
Steve might've gotten knocked out
the other night...

266
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:39,410
but Miranda had no idea
his girlfriend was a knockout.

267
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,135
- Hey.
- Hi, Miranda.

268
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,908
Hello, it's nice...

269
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:46,747
- Oh, my gosh!
- I'm fine.

270
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:51,222
It's nice to meet you. I'm Miranda.

271
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,281
This is my girlfriend, Debbie.

272
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,919
You sure you're okay?
You really came down hard there.

273
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,122
I'm fine, really. Thank you.

274
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:01,289
Hey there, Brady-licious. Hi.

275
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,536
Oh, good. You're back.

276
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,297
Robert, this is Debbie.
And you remember Steve?

277
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:14,710
Yeah. You sure you're all right, babe?
'Cause I saw you go flying there.

278
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,106
What?

279
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,918
I'm fine. It was nothing.

280
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,946
Robert is just overprotective
because he's a doctor...

281
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,515
for the Knicks.

282
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,685
Get out! Did you hear that, Stevie?
The Knicks!

283
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:29,750
Yeah, I know.

284
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,957
What a cool job! That is, like, crazy cool!

285
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:37,061
Debbie works for MasterCard.
Corporate headquarters.

286
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,730
Really? I have a MasterCard.

287
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:43,468
Steve won't even let me talk on the phone
when there's a Knicks game on...

288
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,773
- even if I'm in the other room.
- I didn't know you were a Knicks man.

289
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:49,815
- I follow all the New York teams.
- He lives for the Knicks.

290
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,147
One time he took me to a game
and our seats were so high up.

291
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,846
What do they call that section?

292
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,251
The nosebleed section.

293
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:59,917
I can usually scrounge up a few
courtside seats, if you're ever interested.

294
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,550
That's okay. I like my seats.

295
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,027
- Take the seats.
- I don't need his seats.

296
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,120
Take the seats.

297
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:09,031
As Miranda and Steve continued
needling each other on the playground...

298
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:12,332
Dr. Mao was busy needling Charlotte
in his office.

299
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,838
And this time she was determined
to drown out the voices in her head.

300
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:21,278
I'll be back in about 20 minutes.
Just try to relax and find your center.

301
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,290
Unfortunately, she couldn't drown out
the voices on the street.

302
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,898
When Charlotte opened her mind
to Chinese medicine...

303
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:49,600
she didn't expect a visit
from the Cuban Liberation Front.

304
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,171
Dr. Mao?

305
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,842
Hello?

306
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:01,116
Dr. Mao, I can't get centered.

307
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,220
Is there a quieter room?
I'm trying to relax and find my center...

308
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,262
but I just can't do that with all this noise.

309
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,892
This city will never quiet down.

310
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:16,025
You're going to have to learn
to block out that New York noise...

311
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,898
and listen only to yourself.

312
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,871
Charlotte was beginning to think
that the solution to her problem...

313
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:28,641
wasn't finding her center,
but finding some earplugs.

314
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:33,114
No, the actors were cool,
the location was great.

315
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,585
The whole thing was off the hook.

316
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,846
- But, man, I missed you.
- Look...

317
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,151
I know where you want to put your hand...

318
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:44,390
and I'm sorry,
but I'm just not that kind of girl.

319
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,132
Samantha, I like you. You like me.

320
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,498
I've had enough of this horseshit.
Just fucking hold my hand.

321
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:01,340
Fine, but only until my foot heals.

322
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,915
And that's how Samantha
lost her virginity to Smith.

323
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,525
You've got too many on that end
and they're crooked.

324
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,430
Especially those last four.

325
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:26,528
Hey, I'm doing all the heavy lifting here.
You're sitting there like a log.

326
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,102
I'm in recovery.

327
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,599
Excuses, excuses.

328
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,201
And they're too closely spaced together.

329
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,215
You don't understand the delicate balance
of physics involved in this.

330
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,485
Well, that's true.
This is more your generation's game...

331
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:43,044
whereas I came of age in the Parcheesi era.

332
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,455
So, I guess this is what we'd be like
in our 70s?

333
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:50,989
No sex, and board games?

334
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:54,927
You're already thinking about
your next birthday?

335
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,099
Seriously, kid.

336
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:00,636
You and me.

337
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:04,072
The early-bird special.

338
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:08,011
Yeah, save me a baked potato.
I'll meet you there.

339
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,777
Are you okay?

340
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:24,488
Oh, my God. You're burning up.
Here, come on, let's get you in bed.

341
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,329
Well, it's down to 101.

342
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,736
That's good to hear.

343
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,705
Right. So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.

344
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,513
Okay, thank you so much, Doctor.

345
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,577
Well, he thinks you're gonna be fine.

346
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:55,626
- Is this washcloth still cold?
- Yeah, that feels nice.

347
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:56,953
Good.

348
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,089
You're an angel, you know that?

349
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,066
No, I'm just doing my job.

350
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:08,071
I'm serious.

351
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:11,337
What are we doing?

352
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:15,109
I'm talking about us.

353
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,445
Life's too short.

354
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,850
What are we doing?

355
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,269
I don't know.

356
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,665
It took the best heart surgeon in New York...

357
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,668
but Big's heart was finally unblocked.

358
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,728
In fact, it was wide open.

359
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:26,141
The next morning, by the light of day,
both injured parties were rebounding nicely.

360
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,515
Hi. Hey, Bubs.

361
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,785
- How was he?
- Good. A little cranky when he woke up.

362
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:39,056
- That was funny, the other day.
- Yeah. It was fun.

363
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,690
Wait, did you say it was fun or funny?

364
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,861
I said funny, I think. But I guess I meant fun.

365
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:48,236
Debbie seems really nice.

366
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,275
Thanks. I think so.

367
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,810
So, does Robert... Is it Rob or Robert?

368
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,812
He seems like a really good guy.

369
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:15,993
Hey, good morning, Steve. How's that nose?
Hey, little guy.

370
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:19,469
Much better. I keep telling people
that Debbie punched me.

371
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:20,835
She loves that.

372
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,935
Well, then, I'm out of here.

373
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:26,900
Later.

374
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:37,654
- Oh, my God, Charlotte! Hey there, hi there!
- Good morning.

375
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:40,949
Heather Grayson told me
she saw you at Dr. Mao's.

376
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,220
Didn't you love him?

377
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:46,060
You feel like a pin cushion, I know,
but can't you feel it working?

378
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,189
Sort of.

379
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:51,703
Do you know Isabel Reed?
Horrible woman, but she's got a great story.

380
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,297
She tried everything, and I mean everything,
before she went to Dr. Mao.

381
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:58,400
Anyway, she started going
four times a week, taking the herbs.

382
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:01,810
You have to take the herbs.
Are you taking the herbs?

383
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,278
It turned out
that Dr. Mao was a miracle-worker...

384
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,317
because in just two short sessions...

385
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:11,049
he taught Charlotte to block out all
the New York noise she didn't need to hear.

386
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:23,063
Hey, how long have you been up?

387
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,430
Just a few minutes.

388
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,699
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

389
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,366
I feel like myself again.

390
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,637
- Let's see.
- I'm fine.

391
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:35,878
Excuse me.

392
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,721
It was a shift
imperceptible to anyone but me.

393
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,796
But I knew Big's heart had closed again.

394
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:57,096
Maybe it would reopen in another five years,
maybe it wouldn't.

395
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:01,236
But I knew myself well enough to know that
that's not enough.

396
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,311
I'm going to order breakfast.
What do you want?

397
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,248
Just get me
some cornflakes and juice. Thanks.

398
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,377
For the first time all week,
I didn't feel like crying.

399
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,292
Life's too short.
