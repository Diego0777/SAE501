1
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,679
You can count on one hand

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,908
the things a New Yorker will wait for.

3
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,985
My list includes:
The perfect apartment,

4
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,782
the chocolate soufflé at Le Bernardin,

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,886
and the annual Manolo Blahnik sale.

6
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,696
After four dates
with the furniture designer,

7
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,989
whose kiss made my knees weak,

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,668
this New Yorker
had waited long enough.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,895
So, do you wanna sleep over?

10
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,440
I have to feed Pete.

11
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,079
I have to get up early in the morning.

12
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,078
Apparently, that New Yorker had not.

13
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,658
When one door closes,
another one opens.

14
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,959
At 2:00am, the door that opened
was Samantha's.

15
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,244
What's going on?

16
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,007
Freda in 1D was held up at gunpoint.

17
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,639
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,820
It's under control.
We have the suspect on tape.

19
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,854
This is supposed to be
a safe building.

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,324
It was late. Doorman was off duty.
He entered behind somebody's guest.

21
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,019
That's awful.

22
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,394
The guy came in behind the guy
who came in Samantha.

23
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,865
That's terrible.

24
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,995
- Who has a guest at 2:00am?
- I have no idea.

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,905
- What did everybody do last night?
- Nothing.

26
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,444
- Nothing.
- I don't want to talk about it.

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,014
Did you sleep with someone
on the second date?

28
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,207
No. The third date.

29
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,719
Alexander Lemly, the investment
banker I met at an art show.

30
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,882
- The sex was bad?
- It was good, except...

31
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,230
I don't think I can say it.

32
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,331
Get over yourself.

33
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,296
What happened?

34
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,734
When he...

35
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,734
You know.

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,204
Came, orgasmed, shot his wad.

37
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,735
He said:

38
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,438
You fucking bitch!
You fucking whore!

39
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:10,249
- Why would he say that?
- Because you were fucking him?

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,020
He didn't say it at the drycleaners,
but when he was in you.

41
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,562
Do you think I'm a whore?

42
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,223
If you're a whore,
what does that make me?

43
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,405
- Do you think I'm a whore?
- You have had a lot of bone in you.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,567
This is bad.
Nobody wants to marry a whore.

45
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,514
Even Charlotte
is having more sex than me.

46
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,744
What about Aidan?

47
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,010
I don't know what's going on.
We're spending a lot of time together.

48
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,746
He keeps asking me out.
But he doesn't wanna sleep with me.

49
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,916
- Gay.
- He's not gay.

50
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,994
- Mother issues?
- I don't think so.

51
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,496
- Maybe his dick curves to the right.
- We'll work it out. I'll go left.

52
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,498
I may never know.

53
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,899
Wait too long to sleep with someone,
you become just friends.

54
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,135
As supposed to his fucking bitch,
his fucking whore.

55
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,769
Come on.

56
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,917
If Samantha was right,
I had little time left

57
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,281
before the relationship-window
closed.

58
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,220
So I wore my little dress
that left little to the imagination.

59
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,516
Do you want to take this inside?

60
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,586
I better get home. I gotta...

61
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,458
You gotta get up early.
Whatever.

62
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,012
- What's going on up there?
- Do you just wanna be friends?

63
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,312
I don't know.
Is that how you kiss your friends?

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,414
Why don't you wanna sleep with me?

65
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,390
Whatever it is
I'd rather know sooner than later.

66
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,926
I do wanna sleep with you.

67
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,027
I do.
Look at you.

68
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,698
I've been down that road before.

69
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,466
I've slept with women quickly
and I'm still single.

70
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:18,650
My new thing is, I want to try and
sleep with somebody I care about.

71
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,121
I really think
that I can care about you.

72
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,326
It's only been a week and a half.
Don't people date anymore?

73
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,132
Why did I expect to sleep with him
after only a week and a half?

74
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,393
Had I become so jaded

75
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,665
that I didn't recognize romance
when it kissed me on the lips?

76
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,572
Modern women need a cheat-sheet
to remind us romance isn't dead.

77
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,813
Romance.

78
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,886
I tell you, it didn't even occur to me,
which is so depressing.

79
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,354
Is that what 13 years of dating
in Manhattan does to a woman?

80
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,621
I'll tell you what it does.
It gives you chlamydia.

81
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,456
Excuse me?

82
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,655
My gynecologist called me today.

83
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:10,497
My tests, which she threw in
for good measure, were positive.

84
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:15,266
It's not terrible. There aren't any
symptoms, but it can cause infertility.

85
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,041
I guess it's good I caught it.
I mean...

86
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,041
Not that I caught it,
but that I found out.

87
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,047
- You got it from Steve?
- I don't know.

88
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,309
It could be any number of guys,

89
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,648
which is what I told my gynecologist.
She seemed a little judgmental.

90
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,884
She told me to contact all the people
that I might have given it to,

91
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,028
so they can all be treated.

92
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,893
I knew what was bothering her.
The same thought had bothered me

93
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,594
since the guy I'd been seeing
for 10 days asked me to slow down.

94
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:50,198
If you're a 30 something woman in
Manhattan and you're sexually active,

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,538
it's inevitable that you'll rack up
a certain number of partners.

96
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,409
But how many is too many men?

97
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,883
Are we simply romantically
challenged or are we sluts?

98
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,079
It was the question
on Charlotte's mind.

99
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,050
- How's your swordfish?
- Fine, thanks.

100
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:12,028
- You're awfully quiet tonight.
- Sorry, my mind is somewhere else.

101
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,362
You fucking bitch!
You fucking whore!

102
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:21,200
I hate putting people out of work,
but it happens after a merger.

103
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,434
Maybe I should
teach ESL on the side.

104
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,679
Are you sure you're OK?

105
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:35,012
Actually... what you said
the other night kind of bothered me.

106
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,521
What did I say?

107
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:43,061
You know when we were in bed
and you...

108
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,894
You yelled out something.

109
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:53,233
- During my sleep?
- No, during sex.

110
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,038
I don't remember saying anything.

111
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:05,076
I remember it being very nice.
What did I say?

112
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:13,648
It's not important. I'm sure
it was in the heat of the moment.

113
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,626
Do you want to try my swordfish?
It really is good.

114
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:22,392
By dessert, Charlotte had decided
to forget it and call it a do-over.

115
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:27,495
- You fucking bitch! Fucking whore!
- That! That's what you said.

116
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,732
- What?
- Just then. You said it again.

117
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,275
What did I say?

118
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,144
You fucking bitch, you fucking whore.

119
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,109
My God, are you sure?

120
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,290
That's terrible. That's a horrible thing
to say. I had no idea.

121
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:52,126
I just get lost in the moment.
I don't think that about you.

122
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:59,330
Believe me, you are sweet,
smart and lovely.

123
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,340
You are the kind of woman
I hope to marry some day.

124
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,104
I promise never to say that again.

125
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,082
That's terrible.

126
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,279
As Charlotte started to feel better,
Miranda started to feel worse.

127
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,323
Steve, can we not?

128
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,222
I'm just getting started.
I'm only at the neck.

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,264
Maybe you'll change your mind
when I'm down around your elbows.

130
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,833
I can't tonight, I have chlamydia.

131
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,135
I don't even know what that is,
but it sounds like a problem.

132
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:46,976
It's not a big deal. It's just
a sexually transmitted disease.

133
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,848
I might have given it to you
or you to me.

134
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,985
Either way, you should get tested.

135
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,129
I'm afraid of doctors.
I don't even have one.

136
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,199
Go to the free clinic. Whatever.

137
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,768
What's gonna happen,
does it hurt when you pee?

138
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,534
Men are just carriers,
there aren't any symptoms at all.

139
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,575
Then why do I need to know?

140
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,473
If you don't get treated
you can pass it on to other people.

141
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,916
You are my only other person,
and you already have it.

142
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:26,158
Yeah, but if you've got it,
we'll keep passing it back and forth.

143
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,685
I'd rather not sleep with you
until it's out of my body.

144
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,455
I've got six more days of antibiotics.

145
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:38,662
Will you please just take care of it?
Get it over with.

146
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,840
Steve's trip to the doctor
didn't cure his fear of doctors.

147
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,449
- Drop your trousers.
- There's nothing wrong down there.

148
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,417
I'm here because my girlfriend
said to get the test.

149
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,422
I need a sample
from the inside of your penis.

150
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,184
As Steve faced something
every man dreads,

151
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,796
Miranda faced something
every woman dreads.

152
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,564
She was making a list
of all the men she'd slept with.

153
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,963
At least all the ones
she could remember.

154
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,501
She wondered
how she did all these men

155
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,239
and did her law degree
and became a successful lawyer.

156
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,742
Samantha knew
her number was up there.

157
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,778
But she didn't know
everybody else knew.

158
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,714
We know it was you
who buzzed in the gunman.

159
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,120
- Excuse me?
- You always have guests.

160
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,993
Every time I'm in this elevator
you're with a different man.

161
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,928
That's ridiculous.

162
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,284
This is your floor.

163
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,131
Excuse me.

164
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,929
The next day, Miranda's sex life
was flashing before her as well.

165
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,372
Thanks. OK.
Sorry to bother you.

166
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,907
Congratulations.

167
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,013
Now you're married, you don't
have to worry about stuff like this.

168
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,444
Bye-bye.

169
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,044
Miss Hobbes, line two is still holding.

170
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,323
- Miranda Hobbes.
- Hi, it's David, returning a call.

171
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,397
- How have you been?
- Lousy, I'm partner. All work, no play.

172
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,864
- What do you want?
- It's kind of awkward.

173
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,265
I'm busy, spit it out.
What is it?

174
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,539
OK. I've got this...

175
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,970
- It's chlamydia. Which is...
- I know what chlamydia is.

176
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,811
- Perhaps you should get tested.
- I've been tested.

177
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,579
- Recently?
- Yes. Is that it?

178
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,884
Yes. No... Did you have it?

179
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,154
Is that your business? You call me
after months to discuss my health?

180
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,892
- Yes, I had it. So, what?
- Perhaps you gave it to me.

181
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,902
- What are you gonna do, sue me?
- You could have called.

182
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,306
- You told me never to call you.
- Now I remember why. Bye!

183
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,470
Meanwhile, I was still waiting
for the diagnosis on my relationship.

184
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,674
Would Aidan become
friend or boyfriend?

185
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,876
Delivery for Miss Bradshaw.

186
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,988
It's about time.
I ordered this years ago.

187
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,521
He certainly kissed like a boyfriend.

188
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,261
Don't you have two matching plates?

189
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,435
No.

190
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,198
What do you use for wine,
promotional coffee mugs?

191
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,265
But he teased me like a friend.

192
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,470
Come here. Let me get this.

193
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,447
Boyfriend.

194
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,414
I don't care what anybody says.
I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is hot.

195
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,747
Friend.

196
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,953
Not as hot as you, but she's hot.

197
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,888
Boyfriend. And liar.

198
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,167
- I think Samantha was right.
- About what?

199
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,738
Me and Aidan. I think we're
just friends who kiss occasionally.

200
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,138
- Why are you whispering?
- Cos he's still here.

201
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,833
That's promising.

202
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,679
He's been in the bathroom
for half an hour.

203
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,414
All we did was eat Chinese
and watch "Zorro".

204
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,587
Now I'm working and he's
reading the paper on the john.

205
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,812
This isn't romance, this is bullshit.

206
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,047
- Carrie!
- Yeah?

207
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,420
Come here a second.

208
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,496
I have to go, my friend
wants to see me in the bathroom.

209
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,699
What did you want, because...

210
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,832
Wow.

211
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,943
It's like a Danielle Steele novel
in here.

212
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,308
From a writer,
I'm pretty sure that's an insult.

213
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,249
No, this is... Wow.

214
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,955
I thought a bath would help you relax.
You seemed kind of tense.

215
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,558
Are you sure this isn't
just a cheap ploy to see me naked?

216
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,060
Will you be naked?

217
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,700
That's the thing about baths.

218
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,934
This is about you, so enjoy.

219
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,999
I'm gonna get going.

220
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,408
But that doesn't make us friends
cos I'll be thinking about you naked.

221
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,451
Big tub, little person.

222
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,457
You talked me into it.

223
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,412
So now what?

224
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,105
Now what, what?
We're just taking a bath.

225
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,249
Fuck it, let's just do it.

226
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,618
This isn't how it should happen.
You said this was just a bath.

227
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:37,161
- Come on, who cares?
- You do. And I do too now.

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,124
OK.
Out of the tub.

229
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,065
The next night,
Samantha was feeling exposed.

230
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,970
Here she comes.

231
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,110
- Good evening.
- Hello.

232
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,599
If you wanna say something
about me, say it to my face.

233
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,000
You're bad for the building.

234
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,738
- What?
- You have too many visitors.

235
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,902
- There are always men in the hall.
- I got robbed because of you.

236
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,742
I can't close my left eye.

237
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,021
They practically chased me
like I was Fuckenstein.

238
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,920
They can't evict you for having sex.

239
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,257
They're jealous, dried up old farts who
haven't had sex since Eisenhower.

240
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:50,026
I remind them of what they can't have.
It might be time to move.

241
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,627
You can't. You have a rent-controlled
apartment on the Upper East Side.

242
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,933
This isn't rent control, it's life control.

243
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,167
I have to go, I have a date with Aidan.

244
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,641
Don't tell me
you're not having sex yet.

245
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,839
- We're not having sex yet.
- What are you doing?

246
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,815
Tonight, we're going to a blues club.

247
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:11,321
- Who's singing, you?
- We'll have sex eventually.

248
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,017
By the way, I got a little preview.

249
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,696
I assure you,
there is no curving in any direction.

250
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,462
It is straight. Very straight.

251
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,825
That night,
Charlotte had a date as well.

252
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,168
And he was doing his best
to be the strong, silent type.

253
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,439
- What's the matter?
- I'm afraid to come.

254
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,150
What are you talking about?
I'm close.

255
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,749
Go ahead.

256
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:52,125
You fucking bitch, you fucking whore!
I hate myself, what's wrong with me?

257
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,791
That night, Alexander decided
to stop seeing Charlotte

258
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,429
and start seeing a therapist.

259
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,766
And Steve got his test back.

260
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,943
It was negative,
like the rest of the experience.

261
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,979
That doctor with the swab... Ouch!
I don't even want to swab my ears.

262
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,049
It's my fault.
I'm the one with the disease.

263
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,551
I'm a big, dirty, diseased whore.

264
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,618
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

265
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,320
You know what? I had to make a list
of all the guys I've slept with

266
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,999
and it's not short.

267
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,032
How, not short?

268
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:38,039
It's... No, I can't tell you.
I've never told anybody my number.

269
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,870
I'm just curious.

270
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,977
You won't judge me?

271
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,615
I spent a day at the free clinic.

272
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:51,214
OK. It's like, about... 42.

273
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:56,953
- 42? That's not so bad.
- That's too many.

274
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,823
It's fine.

275
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:05,196
- What's your number?
- I'm not telling you.

276
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,200
Come on.

277
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,999
It's embarrassing. I've had enough
embarrassment for one week.

278
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,269
What is it?

279
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,277
Ten?

280
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,340
Higher.

281
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,542
60?

282
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,020
Higher.

283
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,190
Higher than 60?

284
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,155
A lot higher?

285
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,822
I'm a bartender and I'm cute.

286
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,626
Note, men who have had a lot of
sexual partners are not called sluts.

287
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,863
They are called very good kissers.

288
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,032
A few are even called romantics.

289
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,245
I can't believe you've never been
to the Blue Note.

290
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,042
- Call yourself a New Yorker.
- I've never done a lot of things.

291
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,878
I can think of one thing in particular.

292
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,523
- That I've done.
- I can think of one other thing.

293
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,060
What do you think
about me staying the night?

294
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,666
I don't know.
What about Pete?

295
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:16,205
I arranged for the super's kid
to walk Pete and feed him.

296
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,139
And you knew this all night?

297
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,719
And then something weird happened.

298
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,829
For the first time in a long time,
I was nervous.

299
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,163
We were going to sleep together
and it was going to mean something.

300
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,205
I was no virgin,
but this was definitely virgin territory.

301
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,781
Good morning.

302
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,754
Good morning.

303
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,089
OK, that's what I wanted. Bye.

304
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,199
The nice thing about
a new relationship, it's a clean slate.

305
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,561
And speaking of clean slates,

306
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,740
Samantha moved
to the trendy Meatpacking District.

307
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,500
Good morning, ladies.

308
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,305
Whores were whores,
men were women and rents higher.

309
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,149
Easy, that's my bed.
