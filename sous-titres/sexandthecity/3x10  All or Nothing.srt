1
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,679
One of the best things
about being in a great relationship

2
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,047
is feeling comfortable enough
to leave it for an evening.

3
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,824
What do you girls do
when you get together?

4
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:06,694
The usual stuff - braid our hair,
crank calls, and that weekend stuff.

5
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,527
You don't talk about the boys?

6
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,568
I can't lie.

7
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,331
Sometimes there is talk of the boys.

8
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,100
Men's greatest fear.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,108
- I thought it was hair loss.
- No problem here.

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,270
- I can tell.
- Feel free to pass that on to the gals.

11
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,940
I'll try to work that
into the conversation.

12
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,817
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

13
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,728
EB White said no one should come
to New York unless they're lucky.

14
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:44,393
I was. I had an amazing boyfriend
who had all his hair, good friends...

15
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,808
...and a married ex-boyfriend
I had slept with a week ago.

16
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,415
May I just say, "Wow!"

17
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,852
What can I say? I've arrived!

18
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,083
Samantha had invited us to celebrate

19
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,751
her new apartment, three new clients

20
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,863
and her general fabulousness.

21
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,625
Who knew this existed

22
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,529
in the meatpacking district.

23
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,364
Just yards away from decaying cows.

24
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,632
- Homemade baby quiche.
- You made these?

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,503
No! I had them delivered,

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,110
along with dinner, the wine

27
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,737
and DVD of "An Affair To Remember"
that we're watching later, drunk.

28
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,783
- You can get DVDs delivered?
- I used this new delivery service.

29
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,081
Anything you want
they bring within an hour.

30
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,189
Anything?

31
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,259
- Last night I ordered condoms.
- You didn't fuck the delivery guy!

32
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,497
No, John, the hot guy from the gym.

33
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,125
The condoms
came faster than he did!

34
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,791
There's an ad-slogan.

35
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,129
Ladies, we have it all -

36
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,931
great apartments, jobs,

37
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,006
friends, and sex...

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,769
We can have quiche delivered
and eat it too.

39
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,038
At my age, my mother had three kids

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,704
and a drunk husband.

41
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,181
- You just have three drunk friends.
- By choice.

42
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,617
Having it all really means having
someone special to share it with.

43
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,280
Please. That's so barney.

44
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,690
I'm sorry. My life wasn't complete
until I met Trey.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,955
And Trey's mom is so great.

46
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,260
You'll meet her at the engagement
party she's throwing for us.

47
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,300
You will love her.

48
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,531
Do you see us Manhattan?
We have it all.

49
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,074
- Fuck you!
- You wish.

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,280
Carrie, go home.
I can take care of this.

51
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:41,010
Three hours later, Deborah Kerr had
revealed her secret to Cary Grant,

52
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,849
and I'd still told no one mine.

53
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
- I slept with Big last week.
- You're having an affair?

54
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:54,460
No, no affair. Just one night,
and it is not happening again.

55
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,034
- Please don't tell the others.
- OK.

56
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,470
I am awful.

57
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,671
I have this great boyfriend.
I don't know what I was doing.

58
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,649
Nothing men
haven't been doing for centuries.

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,344
Was it good?

60
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,649
It was great,
and it's not happening again.

61
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,096
Got it. Plates.

62
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,465
How can it feel so good
when it's so bad?

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,471
They design it that way.

64
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,840
Big and I... We have this thing.

65
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:44,245
It's all about the pheromones.
We're just animals reacting to smells.

66
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:49,946
I have a great boyfriend with all his
hair, waiting for me, who smells great.

67
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,614
Aidan hasn't said "I love you" yet.

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,558
- Until then, you're a free agent.
- The rules according to Samantha?

69
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,129
I'm more old-fashioned
than you think.

70
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,460
I don't wanna be a free agent.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,963
Don't you wanna judge me,
just a little bit?

72
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,369
Not my style.

73
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,546
Hang on.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,287
Hang on.

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,352
Hi. God, I missed you.

76
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,397
You gotta go see the girls more often.

77
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,528
Come on.

78
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:44,201
Suddenly I felt safe again.
It had all just been a bad dream.

79
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,574
As long as I was near Aidan,
it would all be OK.

80
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,174
Until the morning.

81
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,615
Why do you have to go
to Pennsylvania today?

82
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,484
See that chair? It's got owners
that miss it very much.

83
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,893
Go tomorrow. Come on, stay.

84
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,859
- I'll make you cookies.
- You don't cook.

85
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,194
I'll buy you cookies.
Come on, stay.

86
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:13,829
It's just for a couple of days.
You gotta have stuff you wanna do.

87
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,905
What I needed to do was not be alone.

88
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,103
Be good.

89
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,689
Downtown, Samantha woke up
to discover she did have it all.

90
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,768
Including the flu.

91
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,433
Shit.

92
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,653
She never wanted a man around
in the morning, until she needed one.

93
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,451
- John?
- It's Samantha.

94
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,059
Jones.

95
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,127
From the gym.

96
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,058
Yeah, right.

97
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:17,931
I wondered if you might be able to
drop by on your way to work.

98
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:24,099
Honey, I can hardly blow my nose,
let alone blow you.

99
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,145
Yeah, I wouldn't want
you to get sick, either.

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,686
Later, in the bridal registry
department at Bergdorf Goodman,

101
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,553
Charlotte discovered,
she wanted it all, and more.

102
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:45,254
- $1,300.
- Yes. We do very well with it.

103
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,593
- It's really beautiful.
- Yes.

104
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,828
It'll look lovely under the noodles
we'll have to eat

105
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,472
due to my outstanding loans.

106
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,073
No, not that face.

107
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,473
All right. If it's what you want.

108
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,311
I'm too crazy about you to say no.

109
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,046
I gotta get back to the hospital.

110
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,023
- Did you do a guest list for the party?
- Oh, right.

111
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,399
I almost forgot.

112
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,408
Sweetie? What's this?

113
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,280
Prenuptial agreements. Standard.
Everyone in the family has one.

114
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,214
You sign on page four. Feel free
to have your lawyer look it over.

115
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,086
I'll call you later.

116
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,451
This looks normal.

117
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,292
Charlotte wasted no time
having a lawyer look it over.

118
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,867
We're not married yet, and already
we're talking about divorce.

119
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,004
A lot of people do prenups.

120
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,004
Marriage is supposed to be
about love and happiness.

121
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,371
- And the protection of assets.
- That is so unromantic.

122
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,206
And necessary. 50 per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

123
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,246
There it is again - divorce.

124
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:15,386
I'm sure you'll live happily ever after,
but I wouldn't marry without this.

125
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm safe. What's he gonna take
from me - shoes?

126
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,452
Maybe I do need one.

127
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,615
What?

128
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,422
This is unusual.
He has you on a vesting schedule.

129
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:29,296
For every five years you're married,
you get a percentage of $500,000.

130
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,403
I'm only worth $500,000.

131
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,008
- Over 30 years.
- Maybe that's your wholesale price.

132
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:40,134
If you have any boys,
you'll get another 100 grand.

133
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,305
How much for girls?

134
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,679
- Nada.
- That's bad business.

135
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,949
I can't sign that. I can't marry
someone knowing they feel this way.

136
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,855
This is just their opening offer.
It's standard to negotiate.

137
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,326
I can't even buy stuff on sale.

138
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:02,524
Talk to Trey. I'm sure his lawyers
will take care of this.

139
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,365
Working over lunch? The New York
office is tougher than ours.

140
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,839
George, this is Carrie and Charlotte.
George works in our Chicago office.

141
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm taking depositions
and restaurant recommendations

142
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,041
from hip and trendy New Yorkers.

143
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,242
- You're hip and trendy?
- George is from Chicago.

144
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,751
- So it's good?
- It's fantastic.

145
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,516
I hope the place tomorrow
lives up to your standards.

146
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,161
- I'm sure it will be great.
- I'll drop by your office later.

147
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,353
- OK.
- Nice meeting you, ladies.

148
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,156
Bye.

149
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,563
Well, well, well, they sure
grow 'em cute in the Midwest.

150
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,931
I know. We have a date.

151
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:44,099
Find out how much he pays
for boys before you get attached.

152
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,542
24 hours, three degrees of fever
and two pages of her black book later,

153
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,274
Samantha was no closer
to closing her deal.

154
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,547
Why don't you go fuck yourself.
I won't be doing it again... ever.

155
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,915
Samantha was discovering it was
easier to find a guy to screw her

156
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,061
than one who'd screw in
her curtain rod.

157
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,697
She wasn't the only one
who needed a fix.

158
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,631
I did everything I could
to keep busy until Aidan came back.

159
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,329
I re-arranged my sweaters,
defrosted my fridge...

160
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,775
broke into my emergency hidden
stash, and thought about choices.

161
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,845
Modern women have been told
that we can be anything we want -

162
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,585
an astronaut, the head of an Internet
company, a stay-at-home mom.

163
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,252
There aren't any rules.
Choices are endless.

164
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,730
And apparently,
they can all be delivered to your door.

165
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,131
Is it possible that we've gotten
so spoiled by choices

166
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,431
that we've become
unable to make one?

167
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,040
That we know
that once you choose something,

168
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,406
one man, one great apartment,
one amazing job,

169
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,876
another option goes away?

170
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,950
Are we a generation who can't
choose just one from column 'A'?

171
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,111
Did we have too much to handle,
or was Samantha right?

172
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,246
Can we have it all?

173
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,086
Two hours later, I had filed
every article I'd ever written,

174
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,493
but I couldn't file away
what had happened with Big.

175
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,861
I made a choice.

176
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,962
I called him.

177
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,840
- Yeah?
- It's me, Carrie.

178
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,980
Jesus, Carrie. How are you?

179
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,844
I'm good, fine. OK.

180
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,577
We need to talk about what happened.

181
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,053
- Right now?
- Yes. Rationally and right now.

182
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,957
- Apparently you're the boss.
- It was just a physical thing.

183
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,621
We gave in to our baser instincts,
shit happens, blah blah blah.

184
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,290
- Are you wearing glasses?
- No.

185
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,461
- You sound like you are.
- It can't happen. You're married.

186
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,941
I'm aware of that. But it was
pretty fucking amazing, wasn't it?

187
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,409
That is so not the point.

188
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,676
We're intelligent beings. We have to
learn to rise above the physical stuff.

189
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,683
You can learn to do that?

190
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,549
Apparently we couldn't.

191
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,020
Next time we're going to a hotel.

192
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,025
I can smell the guy on your sheets.

193
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,629
Woodchips and Paco Rabanne.

194
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,925
He doesn't wear cologne.

195
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,624
Maybe he should.

196
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,238
By the way, there will be no next time.

197
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,633
This is gonna be like
"The Bridges Of Madison Avenue".

198
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,335
A brief affair
I'll write about to my grandchildren.

199
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,140
Can I have a beard
in the book version?

200
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,749
I've always wanted a beard.

201
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,852
Maybe a goatee.

202
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,647
It all felt so easy and so good.

203
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,519
I was like the moth to the old flame.

204
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,420
Meanwhile that night,
Miranda was enjoying her new flame.

205
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,233
Can't believe I have to
catch an 11 o' clock flight.

206
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,304
But it was fun.

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:06,069
If I weren't going back to Chicago,
I would try to sleep with you now.

208
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,043
I'm drunk enough.
I might have let you.

209
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,473
Damn!

210
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,681
- I have to wait till next time.
- There will be a next time?

211
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,825
Of course.
I come back and forth a lot.

212
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,358
In the meantime,
there's always the phone.

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,262
- I have one of those.
- I'll call you tomorrow night.

214
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,304
Damn.

215
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,772
The next night, Miranda was surprised
to hear from George.

216
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,938
I knew you were a middle child.
I love it when I'm right.

217
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,381
Yeah, spoken like a true only child.

218
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,317
They talked for two hours
about everything.

219
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:56,018
Favorite foods, families... It was one
of the best dates Miranda had had.

220
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,254
- What are you wearing?
- Then the date got even better.

221
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,490
Nothing.

222
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,299
- Wish I were there.
- Really? What would you do?

223
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:11,808
I would start
by kissing your neck. Slowly.

224
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,838
Then I'd work my way down,

225
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,041
start licking your nipples...

226
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,517
- Where's your hand?
- On your dick.

227
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,486
Put the other one on you.

228
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,560
That night, Miranda started
sleeping with George regularly.

229
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,893
She had it all - her own life, and
a great boyfriend she could count on.

230
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,525
He always called,
and she always came to the phone.

231
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:43,073
While Miranda came, I was busy
preparing for Aidan to come back.

232
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,075
I had slept in Big's and my sex-sheets
for two days.

233
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,772
Like any good junky,
I knew how to hide the evidence.

234
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,883
Hey, you.

235
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,020
- Come on.
- Hi.

236
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,689
Look at you.

237
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,527
I was sure he saw the scarlet 'A'
on my chest.

238
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,896
If Big could smell him,
could he smell Big on me?

239
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,906
I missed you so much.

240
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,474
I should send you
to Pennsylvania more often.

241
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,140
You should.
I realized something while I was gone.

242
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,310
- You did, did you?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,479
I love you, Carrie.

244
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,761
Is that too much?

245
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,057
- I thought I shouldn't say...
- No.

246
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,571
I love you too.

247
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:58,049
Not only was my secret safe,
but I had become lovable.

248
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,185
I felt awful. And so good.

249
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,446
- Wait. No sheets.
- Fuck the sheets.

250
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,581
You're bent over,
and I'm playing with you.

251
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,526
- Your dick is in my mouth.
- Jesus, I'm gonna come.

252
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,894
The next night, Miranda was
going to third with George

253
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,591
when her second line beeped.

254
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,532
Dammit, hold on.

255
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,639
- Hello.
- Trey says his mom won't negotiate.

256
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,072
- Hold on.
- Are you OK?

257
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,235
I'll be right back.

258
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,474
Your dick is in my mouth.
Keep it there.

259
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,144
The mom's the one holding the cards.
She's the one to go up against.

260
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,484
- How do I do that?
- Charlotte, I'll call you tomorrow.

261
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,853
But...

262
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,159
Sorry.

263
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,356
So am I.
You got me so hot, I just came.

264
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,559
You did?

265
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,070
Now we have to take care of you.

266
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,675
The next night,
I went to take care of Samantha.

267
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,474
More cough syrup.

268
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,379
Which for Samantha meant
making her mom's childhood remedy -

269
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,521
cough syrup
and Fanta orange soda over ice.

270
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,694
No offence, but this is about
to make me sicker than you.

271
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,493
Give me my drink.

272
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,299
A frosted martini glass
would make that more appetizing.

273
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,304
Why don't you ask the super
to fix your window?

274
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,644
I don't have one.
I own this place, remember?

275
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:48,827
I should have got married. Then
at least I'd have a curtain that closes.

276
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,488
Oh, Carrie, it doesn't matter
how much you have.

277
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,998
If you don't have a guy
who cares about you,

278
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:02,004
- it all means shit.
- Sweetie, calm down.

279
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,106
Three days of sleep deprivation had
turned Samantha into a new woman -

280
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,645
Charlotte.

281
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,718
For someone who had it all,
she had never felt more alone.

282
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,821
I'm gonna tell you something.

283
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,587
There's two types of guys out there -

284
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,730
the ones that hold your hand,
and the ones that fuck you.

285
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,868
I'd slept with both of them
in the last 48 hours.

286
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,438
The guys that fuck you
aren't worth a damn.

287
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,733
We're all alone.

288
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:42,609
We are not alone.
We have each other.

289
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,011
- Bed?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:55,922
Three days of rest later, three healthy
girls attended a very uptown party.

291
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,723
Jesus. Looks like
Martha Stewart exploded in here.

292
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,265
- Look, headbands are back.
- Where's the food?

293
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:08,634
Amazing what days of a cough syrup
and Fanta diet will do for the appetite.

294
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,435
They're WASPs.
There's never food, only booze.

295
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,907
Fine.
One martini, six olives.

296
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,876
I can't believe Charlotte wants to be
in this world. Look at these people.

297
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,645
- They're like Ken and Barbie cut-outs.
- You made it.

298
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,518
- I see you found the bar.
- We're good that way.

299
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,889
Trey, you have to keep people
out of the maid's room.

300
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,294
There are photos of me rowing college
crew in there. It's mortifying.

301
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,892
These are Charlotte's friends.
This is my mom, Bunny.

302
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,968
Pleasure to have you.

303
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,606
There's Reverend Williams.

304
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,870
Maybe we should say hello
before he gets into the Scotch.

305
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,673
It's about 20 years too late for that.

306
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,312
- I haven't signed the prenup.
- What are you gonna do?

307
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,489
I don't know. I'm confused.

308
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,252
I love him, but I feel like
no one cares about me.

309
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:08,422
I thought if we could negotiate,
it'd be OK, but now it all feels wrong.

310
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,333
- What does Trey say?
- Nothing. He leaves it to his mother.

311
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,972
You can take her.

312
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,576
- What should I do?
- We can't tell you what to do.

313
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:24,705
I wasn't one to talk about marriage,
considering I might break one up.

314
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,942
You have to do
what feels right to you.

315
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,112
It depends how much
you want to marry Trey.

316
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,697
- Bunny, do you have a minute?
- Of course.

317
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,399
Charlotte realized, if she wanted
to close the deal with Trey,

318
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,907
she'd have to close the deal
with Bunny first.

319
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,844
- I haven't signed the prenup.
- You've been busy.

320
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,483
I have...

321
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,246
...a little problem
with how much I'm worth.

322
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,926
I see.
That is the standard amount.

323
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,257
It's how it's always
been done in the MacDougal family.

324
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,365
Right.

325
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:20,028
Not only would she have to negotiate,
she'd have to play hardball.

326
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,673
Well, you know...

327
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,178
...we haven't finalized
the wedding arrangements.

328
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,176
Trey would be disappointed
if I backed out.

329
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,714
"The Times" announcement
would run, there would be questions...

330
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,754
- What do you want?
- I'm worth a million.

331
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,926
I did it. I negotiated with Bunny,
and I signed the prenup.

332
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,089
That's great.

333
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:52,202
- I'm getting married.
- Congratulations.

334
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:57,434
- I love him.
- Ladies, may I sweep my bride away?

335
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,110
She's all yours.

336
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,611
It was then that we realized
that we didn't have it all.

337
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,411
We no longer had Charlotte.

338
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,944
Then, there were three.

339
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,750
I can't believe
she's marrying that guy.

340
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,290
For a tenth of what she's worth.

341
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,860
I thought you were
Ms Pro Marriage now.

342
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,864
I was delirious.
I also saw spots all over my bathtub.

343
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,663
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but it feels weird without her here.

344
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,329
That's such a Charlotte thing to say.

345
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,136
After a week full of Aidan
and no cigarettes,

346
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,870
I felt like I had
finally kicked my addiction.

347
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,844
- Emu.
- What?

348
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:42,112
- 32 across. Rare bird - emu.
- I was getting there.

349
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,551
Not with the wrong word in 15 down.

350
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,997
Then my addiction found me.

351
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,894
- Hello.
- I need to see you.

352
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,593
- Miranda, I'll call you back.
- Come down or I'll come up.

353
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,637
Right, I'll call you later.

354
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,344
I told Aidan
I was taking Pete for a walk.

355
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,107
He believed me,
which only made it worse.

356
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,811
Don't ever call me
at home again. Walk.

357
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,549
You can't just decide
you wanna see me, and I'm there.

358
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,724
- Is this his dog?
- Yes.

359
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:25,329
You want it all - the girl you screw,
and the girl you go home to.

360
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,727
That's bullshit. I just want you.

361
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,860
I can't do this any more, sleep with
two people at the same time.

362
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,770
- I'll tell her tonight.
- What?

363
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,912
- What?
- No, no.

364
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,877
Married men don't just leave their...

365
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:48,018
I have a man who loves me,
and you have a wife who loves you.

366
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,677
Don't talk about him and her
like it's you and me.

367
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:55,485
You have no right to do this.
You can't come and fuck up my life.

368
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,255
I think there were two people
doing the fucking here.

369
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,265
Shit. Pete. Oh, shit!

370
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,461
- Where are you going? Wait.
- Pete!

371
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,871
- Pete! Oh, shit.
- Carrie.

372
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,736
Excuse me.

373
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,253
Pete! Shit.

374
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,414
- Watch out!
- Pete.

375
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,969
God. Shit!

376
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,040
No. Go home.
Don't tell anyone. Don't do anything.

377
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,909
- I wanna help.
- This isn't helping. Go home.

378
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,919
Back at Miranda's home,
things were heating up as well.

379
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:02,924
I unbutton the last button, slip
my hand in, and touch your breast.

380
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,460
Your nipple's so hard.

381
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,030
I'll be right back.

382
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,244
I'm thrusting, I'm thrusting.
I'm deep inside of you.

383
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,545
You were touching my breast.

384
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,850
Yeah, I'm touching your breast,
and I'm thrusting into you.

385
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,152
No, we hadn't gotten to that yet.

386
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,361
Oh.

387
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:45,261
Are you having phone sex
with other people?

388
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:51,034
I don't think we ever said
this was an exclusive thing.

389
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,801
Oh, my God.

390
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,004
Miranda stopped being hung up
on George. So she hung up on him.

391
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,083
Three hours later, I hadn't found Pete,
and I felt as lost as he was.

392
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,214
I had a man who loved me, and a man
who wanted to leave his wife for me.

393
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,361
I should have been
on top of the world,

394
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,463
but I didn't feel like I had it all.

395
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,997
I felt like nothing.

396
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,431
I had lost Pete,
and I would probably lose Aidan.

397
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,070
I decided to come clean.

398
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,207
Jesus, I was worried about you.

399
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,309
Oh, my God. Pete's here?

400
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:42,120
Oh, my God, I lost him.
I lost him and I looked for him and...

401
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:46,855
Oh, my... Pete, come here.
Come here.

402
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,693
Oh, God.

403
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,168
- I'm an awful girlfriend.
- Take it easy.

404
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,239
- I'm awful.
- He's a dog. He runs away.

405
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,103
He found his way back.

406
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,313
So had I.

407
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,247
I need to ask you something.

408
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,389
- OK.
- I don't wanna be paranoid.

409
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,582
You took Pete for a walk.

410
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,490
We both know you're not big
on the dog-walking.

411
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,794
I can smell something.

412
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,543
Are you cheating?

413
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,179
I can smell the smoke on you.

414
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,087
You're smoking again, aren't you?

415
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,498
Yeah.

416
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,503
Yeah, I am.

417
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,502
It was the truth.

418
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:07,167
- Are you going to quit?
- I really want to.

419
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,812
That was, too.

420
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,313
Come here.
