1
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,262
Do I look overdressed, Vince?

2
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,998
You gotta dress like
they're pulling you out of your day.

3
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:22,097
Get all suited up,
you look fucking desperate.

4
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,608
- Is your name Vince, asshole?
- You look good, Johnny.

5
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,507
Besides, why would you listen to a guy...

6
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,637
who's only worn sweats
since the eighth grade?

7
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:30,113
I know things.

8
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,218
- Ari.
- Welcome.

9
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:32,775
- Ari.
- Welcome.

10
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,110
Koppelman bar mitzvah is in Ballroom 3,
by the way.

11
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:39,992
- I knew it, I look desperate.
- I'm kidding, you look amazing.

12
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,957
You're fucking old school.
Where's he going?

13
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,689
He's going downstairs
to Adam Davies' office, third floor.

14
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,265
Thanks a lot, Ari, I appreciate it, man.
Turtle, roll with me.

15
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:50,697
- Come on.
- All right.

16
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:51,770
Good luck, bro.

17
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,498
- Thanks, man.
- Break a leg.

18
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,234
You have a good weekend?
You ready for this?

19
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,576
What?

20
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,409
What are we doing here, Ari?

21
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:04,745
I'm pulling out the big guns.
Showing you the power of this agency.

22
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,876
- It's just a meeting, right?
- No, it's not just a meeting.

23
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:11,320
- It's not, then what is it?
- It's a fucking experience.

24
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,551
Gentlemen, welcome to mecca.

25
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,696
Big opening, baby. $18.6 million!

26
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,435
This is what happens
when your movie opens huge. $18.6 million.

27
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:53,898
Excuse me, honey, do you know
where I could find Adam Davies?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,332
- Yeah, two down on the left.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,196
You got any bagels or anything at all?

30
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:05,442
I want to start by saying
you could not be in a better position...

31
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,341
and we are so fucking proud of you.

32
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,846
We got a lot of stuff to get to.
Start us off, Trish.

33
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,146
<i>Koresh,</i> a gritty feature version
about the FBI's take down...

34
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,879
of the Branch Davidian leader.

35
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,649
The studio's interested in Vince
for either David Koresh...

36
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:20,157
or the young, out-of-control FBI agent.

37
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,853
- Director status?
- They are out to Milos Forman.

38
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,123
Milos Forman's a genius,
you see <i>Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

39
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:27,358
- No, I did the play in high school.
- All right.

40
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,593
- And he was great, I saw it.
- I sucked.

41
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:31,465
All right, check this out.

42
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,595
Is there anymore of that tuna tartare?

43
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,799
Absolutely. Keep it going, what do we got?

44
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,603
<i>The Last Wasteland.</i>

45
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,305
James Gray scripted a smart tale
about the American worker...

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,207
but set against a post-apocalyptic
underwater society in 2050.

47
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,247
They're talking to Charlize Theron
for the female lead.

48
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:51,853
- She's great, we loved <i>Monster.</i>
- She's hot.

49
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,083
Put a check next to that.

50
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,353
Charlize has a statue,
let's get Vinny a statue.

51
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,789
So what, are they redoing your office?

52
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:00,763
I haven't been assigned an office yet.

53
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,693
Adam Davies' office.
He's in a meeting, can he return?

54
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:17,446
When I read the e-mail
that Vincent Chase's brother...

55
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,747
needed an agent, I assumed
it must be his younger brother.

56
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:24,983
Biologically, I'm older,
but I think we play around the same age.

57
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:31,295
What have you been doing lately, John?
You working at all?

58
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:36,792
I've been working steady for
the last twelve years, minus the last three.

59
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:41,106
I'll fight for you. But I can't lie.

60
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,501
It's not gonna be easy
to get you back in the game.

61
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,071
Back in the game?

62
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,188
I am the fucking game, pal.

63
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,847
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

64
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:01,250
Back in the game.

65
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,524
Some pretty good ideas, though.

66
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:09,460
What the <i>American Taliban:</i>
<i>The John Walker Lindh Story?</i>

67
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,701
Did it happen?

68
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,365
It was one idea, but it happened.

69
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,135
Listen, I'm tired of this.
I've asked you 10 times now.

70
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:19,507
Why isn't the deal for
<i>Queens Boulevard</i> done yet?

71
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,547
Because there is no offer.
Why is there no offer?

72
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:25,242
There's no money.
No money means it's not a real movie.

73
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,842
Which means they're just
a bunch of words on a page.

74
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,183
- Yeah, but they're good words.
- Great words.

75
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,089
These scripts that you're talking about,
they could be good, and they could suck.

76
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:37,356
- They could suck, Ari.
- This we know is good 'cause this we lived.

77
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,090
You know what? E's right.

78
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,166
We should just focus on <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

79
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,701
You know what they feed people
on an indie set, Vinny?

80
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,965
Nothing. No trailer.
They tell you to go sit on an apple box.

81
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:49,302
You ever try to bang an extra
on an apple box?

82
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,639
- Lf anybody could do it, Vince could.
- I do have great balance.

83
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:55,506
Look, okay. We threw out, what, 10 ideas?

84
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:59,175
Ari, stop, you're not listening to me.

85
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:02,514
Look at me.
We want to do <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

86
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,488
Sit down, do what you got to do,
call who you got to call...

87
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,584
stop the agenting bullshit,
and get us a fucking offer.

88
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,154
Damn.

89
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:15,961
My boy's blossoming.

90
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:21,704
- Good work, E. Way to keep him on his toes.
- What did he do?

91
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:25,038
He had Ari freaking.
I thought he was going to cry.

92
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:28,705
I had to straighten him out a bit.
I'm tired of his bullshit all the time.

93
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:31,339
- You the man!
- Johnny, how did your meeting go?

94
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:34,519
Wake up, Drama.
They're asking how your meeting went.

95
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:39,180
This guy, with no office...

96
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:42,087
no assistant,
answering his own fucking phone...

97
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,562
is willing to hip pocket me.

98
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,155
Can you believe that shit?

99
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:50,763
You want to fire Ari, Vince.

100
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:54,095
Fredo is angry.

101
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,872
I'm serious, Vince,
the guy does nothing for you.

102
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,705
All right, what are you so upset about?

103
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,745
You asked him to help me
with representation.

104
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:02,677
The best he can do is Adam Davies?

105
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,376
- You serious, Drama?
- You know what, Johnny's right, E.

106
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,921
I asked Ari to help him and he sets him up
with a glorified assistant.

107
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:12,889
- I'm actually semi-upset.
- Thanks, Vince.

108
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,523
At least you're dressed up
for tonight, Drama.

109
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:18,825
- We still have to go to this thing?
- It's for Shauna, we have to go.

110
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:21,491
This fucking art, man. Fuck art.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,329
What are we? Come on.

112
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,703
It's a very nice of you to show up.

113
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,844
- What is this crap?
- He's Shauna's client, so be nice.

114
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,448
Why, is he retarded?

115
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,212
This piece evokes all of the emotions...

116
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,716
from what I call a discombobulated man.

117
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,786
This is emotional dyslexia.

118
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,790
This is emotional confusion.

119
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,427
And what is emotional confusion, you ask?

120
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:59,197
It's like running naked
through a cornfield backwards at midnight.

121
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:06,111
That was beautiful, Gary.

122
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,546
You know...

123
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:18,179
this kind of reminds me
of Jason Pollock's early work.

124
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:21,418
He employs a similar technique.
Pointillism, they call it.

125
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,158
- How do you know?
- I read for <i>Basquiat.</i>

126
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:27,562
Nice try, Drama, but first of all
his name is Jackson Pollock...

127
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,793
and his work was called
abstract expressionism.

128
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:33,099
Pointillism's a style using points of color,
this is neither.

129
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:36,174
- Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I took art history in college.

130
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,142
- Yeah, community college, loser.
- At least I went to college.

131
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,541
- I was working.
- Schmucks.

132
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,772
What?

133
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,705
Do you like the work or not?

134
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,113
- Phenomenal.
- Fabulous.

135
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,184
Sweet stuff.

136
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,327
- Gus.
- Johnny Drama.

137
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:57,224
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

138
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,129
- Good, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

139
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,760
- Glad to have the job.
- Get out of town.

140
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,636
Gus, I can't believe this.

141
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:08,263
You were the second lead
in <i>Cornelius and Son.</i>

142
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,968
- I was only a recurring.
- That was nine years ago.

143
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,403
Your brother's doing great.

144
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:16,772
Yeah, everyone gets their moment.

145
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:21,149
This catering company is really cool.

146
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,814
Most of the waiters are actors.
They're really flexible when it comes to...

147
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:28,415
going on an audition, or getting a job,
a commercial or something.

148
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,119
That's cool, man.

149
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,990
So, you know, if you want
to make a few extra bucks.

150
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:40,533
- Yeah. Thanks, Gus.
- Shrimp puff?

151
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,339
- What the fuck did you say?
- Shrimp puff.

152
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:48,545
No, I'm good.

153
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:50,539
- Shauna.
- Josh.

154
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,742
I want the most expensive piece
your boy's got.

155
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:55,411
You're a doll. Gary is going to be thrilled.

156
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,284
You know Josh, we share some clients.

157
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,550
- What's up, E?
- How you doing, Josh?

158
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,089
- He gave us <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>
- I rep the writer.

159
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:05,289
Yeah, he's a hack.

160
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,723
- I'm kidding, I loved it.
- Come on!

161
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:13,062
- Emily, how you doing?
- I'm pretty good, how are you?

162
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,671
Great, you kidding me?

163
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:17,741
You guys know each other?

164
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,141
Yeah, we both started
in the mailroom together.

165
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,405
Remember that, Josh?

166
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,178
Guys, I'm having a little bash
at my place in Malibu this Saturday.

167
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,549
It's gonna be off the hook,
you guys should come.

168
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:29,951
Yeah, any girls gonna be there?

169
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:33,252
The only girls in this town
who won't be there are the ugly ones.

170
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,859
You're so gross.

171
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,416
We'll be there.

172
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,520
Great. E., see you then. Vince.

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,492
Eric, Ari would freak
if he knew you were going...

174
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,127
to a party at Josh Weinstein's.

175
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,536
- Why? It's a party.
- No, you have to tell him.

176
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,835
- Lf you don't tell him, I have to.
- So tell him.

177
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,935
You're going, too, we have plans
on Saturday night, remember?

178
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,008
- Man, that was chilling.
- What?

179
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,249
- I just got offered a job.
- Nice, buddy, what's it for?

180
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:03,616
Yeah, as a fucking waiter.

181
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:06,020
I don't know, Drama,
that's a lot of responsibility.

182
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,252
- Maybe you should try out busboy first.
- Eat shit, Turtle.

183
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,625
Why don't you serve it to me, motherfucker.

184
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:18,929
My bad.

185
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,743
- Where am I going?
- Ivy, you're 20 minutes late.

186
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,507
- Ari, I need to talk to you about something.
- Walk with me.

187
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:32,175
Vince and the guys will be partying
at Josh Weinstein's.

188
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,514
- Who's Josh Weinstein?
- He's your old assistant.

189
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,746
I have many old assistants.

190
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,913
Two before me, after Jackie, before Jared.

191
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:40,321
My "J" phase,
I think I fired him for stealing pens.

192
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:43,553
- Why do I care about Josh?
- Now he's an agent at Triad.

193
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:47,093
And he's the one who gave
the boys <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

194
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,702
That's why no more guys.
You fire a guy and you create a rival.

195
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,736
You fire a woman
and you create a housewife.

196
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,328
That's sweet, you're still late.

197
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:57,101
Hold all my calls,
get mini-Vince on the phone.

198
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,337
- Hello?
- Hey.

199
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,507
Saturday, grab the boys,
I got the floor seats.

200
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:08,211
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, $2,400 a pop.</i>

201
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,185
You're gonna be sitting on Jack's lap.

202
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:13,281
Guys, Ari's got floor seats
for the Lakers on Saturday.

203
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,950
- Who they playing?
<i>- Who they playing?</i>

204
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,925
Playing the Wizards, it'll be a great game.

205
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,361
- Wizards.
- Fuck that, bro.

206
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:23,392
- No go, Ari. Thanks, anyway.
<i>- They're playing the Cavs Sunday night.</i>

207
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:25,800
- That's King James.
- Get us tickets for that.

208
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,599
Vince wants floor seats for Sunday.

209
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,567
Let me ask you something.
Should I be worried about this little party...

210
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,045
you guys are going to
over at Josh Weinstein's house?

211
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,447
You should be worried about floor seats
for the Lakers on Sunday.

212
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,358
I want you to go to that party on Saturday.

213
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,191
Represent the agency.
Let Vince know that my army's everywhere.

214
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,390
Ari, I don't want to get in the middle of this.

215
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,797
You are in the middle of this, like it or not.

216
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,996
You want to be a hero?
You want a medal or are you a coward?

217
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:02,767
Stop the hippie shit, strap on a helmet,
start shooting.

218
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:05,968
This is Malibu. I want you to storm
that beach like it's Normandy.

219
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,721
This is great, right?

220
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,422
If you were at Ari's house right now,
you'd be changing diapers.

221
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,677
I can't believe Busey's here.

222
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:46,308
$12,000 you got to pay him, Turtle?
When you gonna get it to him?

223
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,249
Busey's a lunatic, you better pay him.

224
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:52,187
He beat up the gaffer on <i>Point Break</i>
just for cutting in on the lunch line.

225
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,348
I heard that.

226
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,892
Some shit goes down,
you guys got my back, no?

227
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,723
Sorry. No, I don't mess with Busey.

228
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,126
Pussies.

229
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,200
Don't worry, Turtle, I got your back.
I'll put Busey on his ass.

230
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,631
No doubt, Drama.

231
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:07,432
Can I be straight with you?
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Ari.

232
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:11,669
He's been like a grandfather to me.
But he's trying to kill this deal.

233
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:14,473
Yeah, how's that?
He said he never got an offer.

234
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:18,748
They made an offer. I spoke to Scott Wick.

235
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:22,485
You gotta step in
or this movie's gonna go away.

236
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,450
I took a couple of bad hits.

237
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:31,287
Made a movie in Spain that tanked,
then I got divorced.

238
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:32,693
Cunt took half my money...

239
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:34,857
and the rights to my only
viable book property.

240
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,764
I started drinking.
Finally pulled myself out of the gutter.

241
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:39,769
Needed something more stable,
got into this.

242
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,643
So you like what you're doing?

243
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:47,375
You like being a waiter?

244
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah, asshole, I love serving crab cakes
wearing a fucking monkey suit.

245
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,049
Drama, I'm freaking, man.
I keep thinking Busey's behind me.

246
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,887
Relax, he's an old man.
He'll probably split soon.

247
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:08,323
You're on his calls all day.
I mean, is it true? Did we get an offer?

248
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:11,197
Eric, don't put me in this position, okay?

249
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:13,703
- What position?
- He's my boss.

250
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:17,434
What if he's your boss? Who cares?
Is he more important than whatever we are?

251
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,873
Don't ask me that.

252
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,946
Fine. I'll ask Ari, then.

253
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,850
Eric, if you call Ari, I'm leaving. Right now.

254
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,050
I can't.

255
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:40,190
- Honey, our kid is bored out of his mind.
- You know what?

256
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:43,893
- He's having no fun at his birthday party.
- What are you doing? Filming him.

257
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,061
How about if he does a trick,
how about that?

258
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:49,231
Light himself on fire,
the kids will notice him, know what I mean?

259
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,969
- Lf I kicked him in the head...
- Excuse me, Mr. Gold.

260
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:53,671
Jeff Kahn.

261
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,747
- How's it going?
- Good.

262
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,349
I'd like you to have my head shot.

263
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,919
Thanks. It's my kid's birthday,
if you don't mind.

264
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,715
Yeah, no, that's great.

265
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:07,458
I totally understand, it's cool.
Why don't you take my reel?

266
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:12,223
- It's got a lot of good stuff.
- Thank you.

267
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,491
- I'm doing a showcase, actually.
- Hello?

268
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,965
Why are you trying to shut down
<i>Queens Boulevard?</i>

269
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:20,003
- What are you talking about?
- I know Scott Wick made an offer.

270
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,233
Scott Wick tell you that?

271
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,935
No, I spoke to our new agent.
Josh Weinstein, motherfucker.

272
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:32,812
- I'm doing a showcase...
- Where do you think you're going?

273
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,409
They just flew in a liver,
I gotta do the transplant.

274
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,045
- Where do you think I'm going?
- You are such an asshole.

275
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,283
I'm the asshole
that pays for your art lessons...

276
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,553
gets celebrities
to attend your charity events...

277
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,391
- and supports your deadbeat brother.
- Little agent boy...

278
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,598
you better be back here for the cake.

279
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,859
Okay.

280
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,499
Gary?

281
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:58,309
Gary.

282
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:03,080
Gary.

283
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,018
- Turtle?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:10,348
Listen, I just wanted to come over
and apologize to you...

285
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:15,119
for breaking your sculpture the other night.
It was an accident, and I'm sorry.

286
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,790
I just leaned up against it.

287
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,090
- It was kind of an accident...
- Listen.

288
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:20,799
I could snap your sternum with one blow
from my forehead to your chest...

289
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,498
I could snap your sternum with one blow
from my forehead to your chest...

290
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:29,266
I could raise my head up
and loosen your teeth.

291
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:31,239
Knock you down, grab you by the lip...

292
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,312
pull you up, and tell you I'll be right back.

293
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:39,242
While we're here, we're all looking
for the art within ourselves.

294
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,876
Gravity, inertia, and physics...

295
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,145
it's like a round robin.

296
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,689
I'm cleansing you.

297
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,224
In the name of art,
and everything art stands for.

298
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:56,926
Remember this, art is only the search,
it's not the final form.

299
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,298
You know you're burning these?
You're burning the nutrition out of them.

300
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:05,240
- I'll have one of those.
- Don't eat that, Vince, it's garbage.

301
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:06,537
I like them burned.

302
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,977
- Aren't you Johnny Chase?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,239
We're huge fans of <i>Viking Quest.</i>

304
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:12,976
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,976
You girls are too young
to have seen <i>Viking Quest.</i>

306
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,749
We watch it all the time
on the sci-fi channel.

307
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:21,921
- What was your favorite episode?
- My favorite episode...

308
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,188
remember when you were
frozen for 30 years?

309
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,457
And then you woke up
and your wife was remarried.

310
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,555
- That was great.
- That was awesome.

311
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:32,028
<i>The Thawing.</i>
Your favorite episode is <i>The Thawing?</i>

312
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:33,229
Yeah.

313
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,032
Take a hike, honey.

314
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,403
- What?
- You heard me, I said beat it.

315
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,407
Let's go.

316
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:47,010
What the hell are you doing?

317
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,052
<i>The Thawing</i> was Turtle's favorite episode.

318
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:51,884
- It was a setup.
- Come on, we were only joking, man.

319
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,821
What's wrong with you?

320
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,985
It's over, bro.
I'm gonna be working the grill at Chili's.

321
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:02,625
Come on. It's gonna work out.

322
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:09,104
Thanks, bro.
I'm gonna go take a walk down the beach.

323
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:24,217
- Keep it right out here, I won't be long.
- You got it, sir.

324
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,932
Where's Weinstein?

325
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:41,372
- Anyone seen Josh Weinstein?
- He's outside drinking mimosas.

326
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,806
There you go,
the motherfucking host of this shindig.

327
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,009
After that he does the movie
and gets the Oscar.

328
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,912
That's how it went. Hey, Ari.

329
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,716
- That's a great story.
- How you doing? Crashing parties now?

330
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,516
You know Joshie, here?

331
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,457
I don't know if you guys know,
but he used to be my assistant.

332
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,620
- That was a long time ago.
- Fourteen months, that ain't that long.

333
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,857
He used to make the best hazelnut latte.

334
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:10,867
He was like a chemist in there working,
just like Mommy made.

335
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,802
- It was fantastic.
- Ease up, man, it's a freaking party here.

336
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,100
Does your boss know
that you're using his house?

337
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:19,836
'Cause I put a call into him.
He and I went to school together.

338
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:22,435
I helped him cheat on his economics final.

339
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:25,345
That's how he got his degree,
he owes me big time.

340
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,414
- You called my boss?
- Absolutely.

341
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,454
You know what other class
I took at Harvard? Business ethics.

342
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:34,116
I don't steal other people's
motherfucking clients.

343
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,355
But in your case,
I'm going to make an exception.

344
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,226
I'm going to take everyone.

345
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:43,994
Your B-level sitcom stars,
your Reality TV writers.

346
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:47,031
When I'm done with you,
you'll be repping sideshow freaks.

347
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:49,231
You need Jojo the dog-faced bitch boy?

348
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,969
Call Josh Weinfuck,
the lightweight, pen-stealing fuckface.

349
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,349
That's awful.

350
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,353
Now, where's my boy, Vinny Chase?

351
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,728
Look what the tide dragged in.

352
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:13,994
Fucking beach houses, man.

353
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,994
Pieces of shit. If they were in town,
they'd be condemned.

354
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:18,194
Nice view, though.

355
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:22,270
I hate the beach, I hate the ocean,
I hate the sand. I love sharks.

356
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,603
I just signed the girl
that got her arm ripped off.

357
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,643
Gonna be the one-armed Marlee Matlin.

358
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,803
So what are you doing here?

359
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:37,084
Okay, I think it's the height of stupidity
to follow head-on with <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

360
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:40,316
- That's the God's honest truth.
- That's all we ever asked for, Ari.

361
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,859
I don't want to show you my hand.
I'm working for you.

362
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,896
This thing turns out to be
the next <i>My Big Fat Greek Bitch...</i>

363
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:49,091
makes $500 million,
why shouldn't you get rich?

364
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,459
I like rich.

365
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:53,093
Ask the people that didn't
get back in on the <i>Passion.</i>

366
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:55,001
Jesus ain't gonna save them.

367
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,634
Are you telling me, man-to-man, you're
not trying to fuck up <i>Queens Boulevard?</i>

368
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,769
I'm not going to answer that again.

369
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,907
We appreciate your honesty, okay?

370
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,884
- Don't get used to it.
- Don't worry, I won't.

371
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:10,454
You do this, the next one's a studio picture.

372
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:12,682
- We'll discuss it, I'll think about it.
- No.

373
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,655
Franchise, baby, all right?

374
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:18,159
With a lunch box, we're gonna get you
the whole action figure...

375
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:20,390
with a huge cock for me.

376
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,728
- All right?
- It's very tempting.

377
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,132
- I love you.
- Right back at you.

378
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:33,006
Drama, call Adam Davies back.

379
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:35,877
Come on, the guy's barely an agent.

380
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,040
Barely an agent got you
three auditions next week, jackhole.

381
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,139
Call him.

382
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,347
Thanks, Ari.

383
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:47,120
Three auditions.
Guess I don't have to be a waiter.

384
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,819
Gary Busey.

385
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,033
How are you, man?
Good to see you, baby, it's Ari.

386
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,092
- Ari.
- Yeah.

387
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:00,501
You worked craft service
on <i>Lethal Weapon I?</i>

388
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:03,335
I did not.
I used to represent you, remember?

389
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,772
I know you.

390
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,778
You are a gut maggot, with no guts.

391
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,540
You're gonna spin off this planet.
I love it, keep at it.

392
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:13,139
- Okay, Ari.
- God bless you.

393
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,652
God bless you.

394
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,092
What direction is that?

395
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,595
That's east, you idiot.

396
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,390
It's west, idiot.

397
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,294
I mean in New York, it's east.

398
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:35,566
- West, Turtle.
- Either way, it's fucking beautiful.
