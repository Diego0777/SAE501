1
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,463
Do you guys not see the problem here ?

2
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,675
Vince said she was stayin' a couple nights, right ? A couple's two.

3
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,343
Except in Utah.

4
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,930
Look at him, she's got him doing fuckin' yoga, man. It's embarrassing

5
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,183
She thinks she's his trainer.

6
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,559
So do you.

7
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,395
What ? I'm not ?

8
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,023
What the fuck did I get certified for then ?

9
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,983
Relax, Drama, you're his trainer.

10
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,230
Hey, it's all a big joke to E. 'Cause he's been 
sleepin' off campus at Emily's.

11
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,038
What do you got a lojack on me, Turtle ?

12
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,746
You guys are both gonna get girlfriends and
you're gonna fuck everything up !

13
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,825
Quiet, here they come.

14
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,742
How was yoga ?

15
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:02,451
Great.

16
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,620
Fiona's a great teacher.

17
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:04,291
Thanks, baby.

18
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,082
Alright, you ready for a real workout Vince ?

19
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,792
Nah, no weights. I just had a mean stretch.

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,383
Hey, Vince, you gotta hit the weights if you wanna put on size, man.

21
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:18,933
Bulk is so '90s, johnny. It's all about flexibility, 
don't you think ?

22
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:21,512
Um... no, I don't.

23
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,603
We'll catch you later. We're gonna go grab breakfast.

24
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,022
Bye, guys.

25
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,392
I don't trust that "new-agey" bullshit.

26
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:31,610
Me neither. Even if it is attached to an ass like that.

27
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,150
Yo, E., What up, dawg ?

28
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,611
Not much. How 'bout you ?

29
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,200
Never better.

30
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,033
Who's that jerk-off ?

31
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,662
No clue.

32
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:50,043
Yanks are playing the Angels tuesday.

33
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,382
I got the company box if you want to roll with.

34
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:56,170
Got the gals from "the L. Word" coming. 
Trust me, they're only acting.

35
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,590
Not trying to be an asshole or anything, but ah, 
do we know each other ?

36
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,803
E., You kiddin' me ?

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,103
Josh Weinstein, Triad, we met at the fight.

38
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:09,230
Oh, yeah, okay. Alright, Josh, do me a favor, 
put a towel on or something, cover up.

39
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:12,190
Not a locker room guy. No problem.

40
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:15,403
So listen, E, I didn't want to interrupt Vince's workout,

41
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,732
but I got a great piece of material.

42
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,743
Could you do me a favor and have him take a look ?

43
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:23,531
Josh, you got to understand, the guy, he gets
hundreds of scripts a week, you know that right ?

44
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:27,703
Yeah, but this is something special. Kick's ass. 
It's gritty as shit.

45
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,253
You'll love it, I guarantee you Vince will flip.

46
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:34,503
Tell Vince it was a great movepassing on "Matterhorn", too.

47
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,341
You think ?

48
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:40,222
Oh, yeah, script's a piece of shit. It's not a
movie, it's a theme park ride... there's no characters.

49
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,130
That's what I said.

50
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:43,142
I bet Ari pushed hard for that one, huh ?

51
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:43,551
Yeah.

52
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,352
You know he doesn't read, right ?

53
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,931
Anyway, man, this one's different.

54
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,023
Takes place in your old neighborhood.

55
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,143
Queens, right ?

56
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,190
Yeah.

57
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,571
Hey, how are you ?

58
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,073
Hi, sweetheart ?

59
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,442
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,452
I, um, I thought you were someone else.

61
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,912
come on, Monica.

62
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,702
I'm done talking to you, Turtle.

63
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,912
You were supposed to hook me up with some weed two days ago.

64
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,253
The whole town's dry. Believe me, 
I'm not holding out on you.

65
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:17,541
What are you looking at ?

66
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:21,261
These uggs, they're great, but... I can't find them anywhere.

67
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:26,053
I can get those for you in two seconds, alright ?
Just gimme the size and the style number.

68
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:26,970
Oh ?

69
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:28,931
Hey, Shauna, what up ?

70
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:35,812
Yeah, I have an apparel request for Vince.
He needs a pair of uggs for his lady friend, ASAP !

71
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,021
Yeah.

72
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,233
Hey, you don't have a weed guy, do ya ?

73
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,490
Hey.

74
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,663
Hey.

75
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,991
What are you doing ?

76
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,282
Just reading a script.

77
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,543
Any good ?

78
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,460
Ah, it's great, so far, yeah.

79
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:59,672
So, that's your job ? You just read a bunch of
scripts and tell Vince which the good ones are ?

80
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,973
Yeah, something like that.

81
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,223
Wow, that's a really cool job.

82
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,180
So did you go to school for that ?

83
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:09,261
No.

84
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:13,142
I love to read. I read all the Harry Potter books, and...

85
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,483
I don't know, if you need a second opinion,
don't hesitate.

86
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,023
okay, cool.

87
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,613
- Alright.
- Thanks.

88
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,370
Don't get mad, but I think she's stealin' food.

89
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,543
She's not stealing food.

90
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,963
Well, shit keeps disappearin' out of the fridge.

91
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,381
I did have an ivy meatloaf vanish.

92
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,220
I know how these kleptos work.
First it's the food, then it's the plasma.

93
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:51,430
Alright, she didn't steal it, she threw it away.

94
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,430
- Throwing it away, why ?
- She's vegan.

95
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,980
What the fuck does that mean ?

96
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,773
It means, she's into a cruelty-free lifestyle.

97
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:02,150
It's cruel to throw away a $65.00 steak from Morton's.

98
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,903
Look guys, just do me a favor.

99
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,110
And keep the meat out of her eye-line while she's around.

100
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,200
Look, she's already got him wearing cloth shoes.

101
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:10,121
These are my slippers, idiot.

102
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,781
And they're the ones that he stole 
from the Four Seasons mall.

103
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,290
Oh, those are the slippers ?

104
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:15,253
Where's the robe ?

105
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,500
Fiona just dropped the robe at the pool.
And had nothing on underneath.

106
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,041
She's naked at the pool ?

107
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:20,540
Yeah.

108
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,171
And you were looking at her ?

109
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,383
She's naked at the pool.

110
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,132
How'd she look ?

111
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,423
Good enough to eat, I bet, huh ?

112
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:25,882
Yeah.

113
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,971
Too bad Vince can't eat animal products anymore.

114
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,683
I'm goin' up, you mind ?

115
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,181
Yeah, I mind.

116
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:34,472
Sue me, I'm goin' !

117
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,311
Did you call the hack ?

118
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:38,981
Ah, yeah, he's got nothing.

119
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,693
How can the whole town be out of weed ?

120
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:44,070
Hack says the drought dried up the crops, man. 
It ain't on me, peace.

121
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,692
Three days, Vince. You're bending the rules.

122
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:48,950
I made the rules.

123
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,243
Can we talk about something important here ?

124
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:54,701
This is important, it's a lifestyle issue. 
Did you see the picture of the swami in the bathroom ?

125
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,793
It's her guru.

126
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:58,830
Well, I don't like the way he looks at me when I'm pissing.

127
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,670
I found your next movie, Vince.

128
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:01,292
Yeah ?

129
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:05,173
Yeah, this script is awesome,
you got to read it now. Now.

130
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,670
Vince, I need you.

131
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,300
I'll read it later.

132
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,221
All she wants to do is fuck.

133
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,480
The plan is to get as close as possible 
without actually touching.

134
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,150
How long do we have to go for ?

135
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:28,903
The longer we hold out the better the sex. 
Some tantric masters hold out for years.

136
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:33,070
Yeah, but they're up in a mountains somewhere
by themselves. They're probably whacking off like crazy.

137
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,282
Vince, you reading that script ?

138
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:39,290
I'm sorry, babe, I'm on a tight schedule.

139
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,131
Alright, here you go, Turtle.
Now you can stop bothering me.

140
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:47,093
Thanks, Shauna.
Vince's lady friend's really gonna love these.

141
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,421
- These aren't taiwanese knock-offs, are they ?
- Would I do that to you ?

142
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,971
Nah, those are real goods.
Look at the sheepskin.

143
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,221
You can tell these babies were born and raised 
in the outback.

144
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,938
- Yeah ?
- Yeah, absolutely.

145
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,275
Thanks a mil, Shauna.

146
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,855
Don't thank me, thank Christy.

147
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:00,563
Christy.

148
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:04,060
Christy, thanks.

149
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,361
Oh yeah, no problem.

150
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:11,281
If you ever need anything, concert tickets,
pedicure, full body massage...

151
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,703
How 'bout a stun gun ?

152
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,820
Alright.

153
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,371
Shauna, what's with the photographer ?
I thought I told you I don't want Vince posing 
on one of these things.

154
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,830
Yeah, then I called back and said if he still wants
the Harley, he's gonna have to take a picture on it.

155
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,171
Yeah, but we never had that discussion.

156
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,841
- You're right, I had it with Turtle.
- And I spoke with Vince.

157
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:33,431
And that's all I give a shit about. What Vincent wants. So don't fuck with me like you're fucking with Ari, Eric !

158
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,971
Hey, Eric, I read it, it's awesome.

159
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,851
- You read what ?
- The script, it's so good.

160
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:43,520
- You read it ?
- Yeah, god, it even made me cry, right, Vince ?

161
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:44,481
Yeah, it did.

162
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,152
Hey, shauna.

163
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:46,520
Yeah ?

164
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:51,442
Just so you know, look, you know I love you,
but... I can't take a picture on that thing.

165
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,362
Turtle said that you would do it.

166
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:58,202
No, I know, it's just my girl, she's really 
conscious about the environment.
And she thinks it sends the wrong message.

167
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:02,200
Really, I mean she doesn't mind riding around in
your hummer... What is she thinking ?

168
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,461
Look, I don't know what she's thinking, 
but you know, I can't be hassled.

169
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:07,962
Vince, you're totally fucking me on this.

170
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,250
I'll take the picture.

171
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:11,342
What am I supposed to do with your fucking picture ?

172
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:15,090
And you, gimme back those uggs. 
I know they're not for him, you fat midget.

173
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,011
Shauna, you're gonna have to pull 'em 
from my cold, dead hands.

174
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,300
Oh, really ?

175
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,562
Good boy, Arnold.

176
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:29,192
- What the fuck, what are you doin' ?
- You didn't call bank shot.

177
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,482
I did too, you didn't hear me !

178
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:34,192
- You got to learn to project.
- You hire a vocal coach, become a real asshole.

179
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:35,950
E., Script's great.

180
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:37,202
- You read it ?
- Yep.

181
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,240
How many pages ?

182
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:39,623
The whole thing.

183
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,372
Yeah, right, how does it end ?

184
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,332
What are you an asshole ?

185
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,542
I'm just saying, I tell you I got your next movie, 
you ignore me.

186
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,082
Fiona likes it, you read it in an hour ?

187
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,541
I read it, what's the difference ?

188
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,421
I don't know, but there is one.

189
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:56,261
You know, don't worry about that. Let's get it
together. Call Ari, find out why he doesn't know about it.

190
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,843
Yeah, E., Go call Ari. Get us paid.

191
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,473
Shut up, Turtle.

192
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,682
Vince, you see any juicy parts for me ?

193
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,271
Yeah, maybe you could play his father.

194
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:05,932
Fuck you.

195
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,903
Ari Gold's office.

196
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:12,070
- Hey.
- Hey. You left your wallet at my house.

197
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:15,863
- Did I ?
- Yes. Is that your way of saying you want to come back ?

198
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,361
Sort of, yeah.

199
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,783
So, we read a script that we love.

200
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,373
Anyway Ari's free for lunch ?

201
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:22,740
Ah, like in december.

202
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:26,331
Hold on, let me just take care of something for you.

203
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:30,130
Alright, I just rescheduled Anthony Lapaglia.

204
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,340
- Oh, thanks.
- I'll see you tonight.

205
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,053
- Okay.
- Bye
- Bye

206
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,971
- Pussy.
- Fagget.

207
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:46,023
Um, yeah, I'll get the faux mung bean meatloaf.

208
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,230
Okay.

209
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:51,981
What the fuck are we doing here, man ?
I'm on atkins, I need protein.

210
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,073
Come on, there's plenty of protein in mung beans.

211
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:58,403
No, no, I'm talking about real protein. I mean, like man
protein. You know, from the flesh of slaughtered animals.

212
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,613
I want to have war paint on, I want to have blood
dripping. That's what I need.

213
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:04,033
Have you seen a video of a slaughter house, Ari ?

214
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,742
Meat is murder.

215
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,163
Even broccoli screams when you rip it from the ground.

216
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:12,213
Alright, enough about the fucking menu. Can we talk about "Queens Boulevard" for one second ?

217
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:15,420
- I really want to do this one.
- It's the best script I've ever read.

218
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,761
- She's reading your scripts now ?
- Vince asked me to.

219
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,221
Oh, he did ?

220
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,810
Do you guys have a problem with that ?

221
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,431
Not if you don't mind it not being printed on recycled paper. It's all good.

222
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:32,403
What's the matter, E. ? The big words overwhelm you ? You had to, pass it along ?

223
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:33,692
Well, I read it.

224
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:36,070
- You don't even know about it.
- Oh, I knew about it.

225
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,440
- You think that you knew about it and I didn't know about it ?
- I think so.

226
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:41,453
You think there's anything in this fucking
universe that you know about that I don't know about ?!

227
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:45,413
- Vince, can I talk to you, please ?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:53,130
First rule of being a manager, is control the star's fucking girlfriend.
'Cause Yoko Ono, is macro-psychotic.

229
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,293
- What's wrong ?
- You heard what he said about meat.

230
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,591
I know, I know, babe, I'm sorry.

231
00:11:56,638 --> 00:12:00,090
God, man, I'm going to wait outside. Your agent is a karmic disaster.

232
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,632
Okay, babe, I'll see you out there.

233
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,141
I'll be like, five minutes.

234
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,223
Excuse me ?

235
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,603
I was wondering, if maybe, you would take a picture with us ?

236
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:07,562
Sure, why not.

237
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:08,973
Thank you so much.

238
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,601
Hey, idiot, do you know that Scott Wick is my best friend ?

239
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,191
Who's Scott Wick, asshole ?

240
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:16,903
He's the producer of the movie, you dumb fuck.

241
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,863
Oh, okay, well this should be pretty fuckin' easy, 
don't ya think, douchebag ?

242
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:20,950
No, Eric, it shouldn't.

243
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:27,121
Because what you don't know, you little garlic knot making motherfucker, is that Wick hates Vince.

244
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:30,951
So, now that you've gotten him all excited about
the script. How would you like to break that news to him ?

245
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:32,872
Okay, I'll do that. Hold on, watch this.

246
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:37,422
Hey, Vince, the producer of the movie thinks you suck !

247
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:40,462
Do one more.

248
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,052
Now what, Ari ?

249
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,432
Hey, is it alright if I hang out with you guys ?

250
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,023
It's a free sidewalk.

251
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:51,182
What ?

252
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:53,563
Bite ?

253
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,481
No, thank you.

254
00:12:54,526 --> 00:13:00,112
You trying to tell me you can't find one person in
the entire West Coast that has a joint ?
You're slackin', hack.

255
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:01,193
Alright.

256
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:05,530
He's sendin' a recon team up to Humboldt county.
But, ah, he's not hopeful.

257
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,282
You guys in need of weed ?

258
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,282
What do you know about it ?

259
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:13,542
I got a sherpa who grows 100% organic.
No herbicides, no pesticides.

260
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:17,880
Yeah, like we're goin' all the way to Zverest to
score weed from your sherpa.

261
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:21,513
Come on, guys, he doesn't live in Everest
anymore. He lives in Bel Air.

262
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:25,181
What the fuck's a sherpa ?

263
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,852
This guy sells weed out of this house ?

264
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah, even the carpet's made of hemp, it's cool.

265
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,023
I just stepped in shit.

266
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,231
Whoa...

267
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,443
Come on, guys.

268
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,581
Holy shit.

269
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,290
A field of fucking dreams.

270
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:04,723
I said check the fluorescents in the vegetation
chamber. It's the little thingy with the lights on it.

271
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:07,930
Hey, baby.

272
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,303
Dakatoka.

273
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:12,392
How are you doing ?

274
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:16,270
That's her channeled name. Fiona's channeled name is Dakatoka.

275
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,603
I missed you.

276
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:19,941
Oh, you're an ancient wisdom giver.

277
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,361
Who, Fiona is ?

278
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,192
Dah.

279
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,453
Johnny Drama ?

280
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,702
I'm Johnny Drama.

281
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,783
I'm a fan, man.

282
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,621
When's the next season of "Viking Quest", dude ?

283
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,081
It got cancelled seven years ago.

284
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,253
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

285
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,090
Eurydice, ina, we're gonna have a little tea.

286
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:55,563
Make some ancient mayan mule shit. It's a hybrid.

287
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,401
Drama.

288
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,351
Earth is moving.

289
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,481
Did you feel that ? Everything all the time.

290
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,231
There are dimensions we can't even see.

291
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,821
Everything is evolving...

292
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,573
Turtle, you're a dove.

293
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,282
That's cool, could I hit that... chirp, thanks.

294
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,870
Aren't you afraid of getting busted ?

295
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,292
Busted, I'm entrusted.

296
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,673
I don't steal. I heal.

297
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:10,470
We're not getting stoned, we're getting honed.

298
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:14,262
My probation officer's one of my best customers.

299
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:22,271
I'm a prisoner. I'm a prisoner of war... the war on drugs.

300
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,310
It's all so negative, man.

301
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:33,321
I mean the man's most positive, positive 'tiv,
is the negative. He's a mega-negative.

302
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,123
Right ?

303
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,033
"Viking Quest" !

304
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:42,622
Let them be low. We are getting high.

305
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,500
We're not getting fucked down. We're getting fucked-up.

306
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:47,633
That's awesome.

307
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,383
Yo, I think that went out, though.

308
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,052
Don't touch it !

309
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,681
No, it's cool, it's cool, Finley. It's a cell phone.

310
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:04,233
Okay.

311
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,022
Is it cool ?

312
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,482
Please, enjoy.

313
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,241
Put it on vibrate.

314
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,780
Hello ?

315
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:23,120
Call me Helen Keller 'cause I'm a fucking miracle
worker. Seven o'clock at Mastro'S. You're gonna
break bread with wick. And don't be late !

316
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,082
And tell Vince to wear something tight.

317
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,582
Yeah, okay.

318
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:33,222
Sorry about that. Ari delivered Wick.
We have dinner at Mastro's at seven.

319
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:35,260
I'm over that project, E.

320
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,510
What are you talking about ?
I thought you love the script.

321
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,800
I'll love another.

322
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,561
I'm not gonna waste my time with some guy who doesn't like me.

323
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:45,271
Vince, there are no others, trust me, I know. 
I'm the one who reads them.

324
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,813
If this guy meets you, he'll love you.

325
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:49,613
Oh, yeah ?

326
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,110
Free steak, what the fuck ?

327
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm dying for some red meat.

328
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,833
Hey, anybody need some clean urine ?

329
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:06,041
You're fuckin' whipped, bro.

330
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,332
God, would you stop it already ?

331
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:11,752
- Jesus.
- It's true though, I mean this girl tells you 
what pictures to take.

332
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:14,300
What scripts to read, what dinners to go to...

333
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,722
I mean, come on. Where you're fucking balls ?

334
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,641
Alright, E., Don't freak, alright.

335
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,891
I love her, I want to marry her.

336
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:29,523
- I'm fucking with you, relax, bro.
- That's not funny.

337
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:34,322
Dude, look, she's leaving on friday, she's going 
to an ashram in India for four months.

338
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,783
Well, in that case, I love her.

339
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,782
- No problem, she's gone.
- Good, get her out of here.
- I know...

340
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,743
Gentleman, Scott Wick.

341
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,451
Hello.

342
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,333
Let's make this snappy.

343
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,373
Be nice.

344
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,793
Mmm, beluga.

345
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,301
Excuse me ?

346
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:58,012
Caviar. Reminds me of a cold winter night in Novgorod.

347
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:01,511
Where is...Nov, Novgorod ?

348
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,063
It's in Russia.

349
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:07,142
E. didn't know that 'cause he dropped out of college.

350
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:08,772
So what'd you do in russia, scott ?

351
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,062
My father was an american diplomat.

352
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,442
Oh, that's nice.

353
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:13,821
My father was a douchebag.

354
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:20,782
Okay, I am gonna get the New York strip, 'cause
it reminds me of my childhood... in New York.

355
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:23,622
That's funny, that's funny.

356
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:28,372
So, Scott, listen. We want to talk to you about
the script. Vince wants to do it.

357
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,872
Yeah. I read it and I loved it.

358
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:35,673
I appreciate that, boys, but, unfortunately, 
I just don't see you in it.

359
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:42,011
You know, this movie is about a guy from
Queens. It's a kid from the neighborhood.

360
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,390
Vince is a guy from Queens. He is from the neighborhood.

361
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, he doesn't feel like he is.

362
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,682
Where does he feel like he's from ?

363
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,561
I don't know, the Appalachians ?

364
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,562
Come on...

365
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,653
You know what, with all due respect

366
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,993
I grew up a block from where this script takes place,

367
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:02,990
in a shitty little apartment with five brothers and sisters and a psychotically drunk father.

368
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:04,831
I am this part.

369
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:10,462
Yes, but you know that even the truth sometimes
seems fake, right ? Wouldn't you say ?

370
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,500
This doesn't seem like it's going anywhere, does it, Scottie ?

371
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:14,332
Not really.

372
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,462
I'm gonna order a little extra.

373
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:22,973
Maybe I'll get this rib eye, to go. 
Bring a little doggy bag home for the boys.

374
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,010
Do I look like goodwill to you ?

375
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,643
What are you, high ?

376
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,890
Actually, Scott, I am.

377
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,641
Is that a problem ?

378
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,233
Where did you get it ?

379
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:37,483
Oh, a friend of mine. Some of the best shit I've
ever smoked. Are you in need ?

380
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:43,113
I am. My guy says the town is dry...
something about a drought.

381
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:44,413
Is your guy black hack ?

382
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:49,163
My guy spoke to another guy, but I don't really have a guy.

383
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,121
I could hook you up.

384
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,172
Fellas, c'mon, what are we doing here...
we talkin about the script or we talking about weed ?

385
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,422
Maybe both, E. Maybe both.

386
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:09,520
oh, Christ, I'm going to have to lie at my
N.A. Meeting... again !

387
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,152
Scott, can I ask you a question ?

388
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,230
Mm-hmm.

389
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:18,823
Why do you have to be such a hard ass all the time ?

390
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:25,071
I don't know. 'Cause it... I don't know, 
I guess it's just fuckin' fun.

391
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,043
You think I'm a hard ass ?

392
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,913
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

393
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,331
This should be fun.

394
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:37,133
Give me one of those, cocksucker, motherfucker.

395
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,630
Scott, relax, you said your dad's a diplomat, right ?

396
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,801
That was 50 fucking years ago, asshole.

397
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:43,721
Just roll down the windows.

398
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,383
I'm on fucking probation.

399
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:45,933
For what ?

400
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,933
It was nothing, it wasn't anything. It wasn't even true.

401
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:52,182
Hello, officer.

402
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:54,353
License and registration.

403
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,023
Sure.

404
00:21:57,657 --> 00:21:58,773
Here you go.

405
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,363
Is there a problem ?

406
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:04,741
Yeah, um, mr. Wick.

407
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:06,533
You're parked in a red zone.

408
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,531
Oh.

409
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,120
Would you step out of the car, please ?

410
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,280
I could just move it.

411
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,161
Sir, out of the car.

412
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,293
Excuse me, officer. Hi, how are you ?

413
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:17,330
You know officer Hecht ?

414
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:19,333
His daughter Melissa's a good friend of mine.

415
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,632
I know you.

416
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,803
Saw the new trailer, movie looks good.

417
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,630
Yeah. It's a good film.

418
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:29,470
It is good. It's real good.

419
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:35,983
Not only does this guy not bust us for smokin'
weed or parking in the red zone.
He asked this guy for his autograph.

420
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:36,390
Awesome.

421
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,770
What can I say ? I'm above the law.

422
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:39,693
Let's toast.

423
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,020
What is this stuff ? Is it wheat or is it grass ?

424
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:43,361
Whatever, it's good for you.

425
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,363
Nah, I don't trust this shit.
I lived on this stuff in '93.

426
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,613
By the end of the year I was sleeping standing up.

427
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:50,572
Come on, guys, a goodbye toast.

428
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,700
Aw, you're really gonna leave us ?

429
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,163
I could cancel my trip.

430
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,750
- No, no.
- Bad idea.
- Don't do that, we wouldn't want you to bum out rammed ass.

431
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,080
Ram dass.

432
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,540
Whatever.

433
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:02,342
Alright, on the count of three.

434
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:03,250
Three.

435
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:08,930
That's disgusting.

436
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:10,930
Hello ?

437
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:11,763
Mini-Vince.

438
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:12,551
Hey, ari.

439
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:18,773
I don't know who blew who, but Wick's got 
a crush on your boy Vince, wants him to star 
in his vanity project.

440
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:20,193
Alright, I'll tell him.

441
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,231
Prepare to enter the poor house, you little bitch.

442
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:26,783
Wick wants you in the movie.

443
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:30,161
I don't know.

444
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,660
You think I'm Queens enough ?

445
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:34,123
We'll see.

446
