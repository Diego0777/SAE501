00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:40,482
5x01 - Fantasy Island

2
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,671
Subtitles: Sub-way.fr

3
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,926
Our next film is <i>Medellin</i>,

4
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:07,103
the ultraviolent story
of Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar

5
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,906
staring Vincent Chase
in a fat suit and bad makeup

6
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,458
that makes him look like
the lovechild of Jiminy Glick

7
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:13,910
and a case of twinkies.

8
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,938
<i>Now at last year's
Cannes film festival</i>

9
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,415
Medellin <i>from wunderkind
director Billy Walsh</i>

10
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:21,030
<i>was all the buzz
until people actually saw it</i>

11
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,653
<i>at the now legendary
Hindenburg of a screening</i>

12
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,155
<i>which I myself attended.</i>

13
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,368
<i>Now I usually try to keep
my opinions to myself</i>

14
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,410
<i>until we actually review
a film on this show,</i>

15
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,729
<i>but this time I got on my feet and
I booed with the rest of the angry mob.</i>

16
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,798
<i>I would have thrown fruit
if I'd had some.</i>

17
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,259
<i>This is the silliest thing
to come out of South America</i>

18
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,502
<i>since the musical </i>Evita<i>.
It's overacted,</i>

19
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,272
<i>it's underdirected,
it's paced like a snail.</i>

20
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,278
- <i>Did I mention it's long too?</i>
- <i>You did. It is.</i>

21
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,944
<i>The year is young,
but this is a good bet</i>

22
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>for my top 10
of the year's worst.</i>

23
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,074
<i>And by the way, Vince,
Al Pacino called.</i>

24
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,850
<i>He wants his </i>Scarface<i> accent back.</i>

25
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:56,526
<i>It's a real disappointment for me
because I had Vinnie Chase</i>

26
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,051
<i>on my list of stars
to watch in 2005.</i>

27
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:02,484
<i>I think I'm gonna have him on my list
of stars to watch fade in 2008.</i>

28
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,629
- Suck it, dickbag!
- <i>With a budget I cannot imagine,</i>

29
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:08,223
<i>is a straight to dvd release,
if you can believe it.</i>

30
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:09,877
<i>It can be found at--</i>

31
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:11,725
Sorry, E.

32
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,971
It's okay.
Not like I wasn't expecting it.

33
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,350
Still, once you hear it
coming out of their mouths

34
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,501
on tv about you personally, it stinks.

35
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,245
I remember crying myself to sleep

36
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,215
when Roger Ebert singled out
my performance in <i>License to Drive</i>

37
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,176
as the end of the golden age of cinema.

38
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,663
<i>Oh, baby, fuck critics.
What do they know?</i>

39
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,620
Nothing, baby.
Nothing.

40
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,016
Will you mind telling me
when someone else is in the room?

41
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:35,629
- <i>Sorry, E.</i>
- That's okay.

42
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,820
I just like to know you're there.
How's France?

43
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,895
<i>It's lovely.</i>

44
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,147
When are we gonna see you again
three dimensionally?

45
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,058
- <i>Soon, I hope.</i>
- Not soon enough.

46
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:44,041
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

47
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,168
I Miss you, baby.

48
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,880
<i>I Miss you too, baby.</i>

49
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,073
I'm gonna talk to E for a second.

50
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,108
I'll check back in after I wash up.

51
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,517
<i>Okay, baby.
I love you.</i>

52
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,621
I love you.

53
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,536
- <i>Chirp.</i>
- Tweet.

54
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:03,153
What? Like you never had
a long-distance relationship?

55
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:04,780
Not one with bird noises.

56
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:05,981
Whatever.

57
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,359
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I need my beauty rest.

58
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,764
I'm shooting the <i>Five Towns</i>
poster tomorrow.

59
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,582
Unless you want to pound
some whiskey and talk.

60
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,925
Nah, I'm fine.
I just hope Vince is okay though.

61
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,960
Poor baby bro.

62
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,537
Are we ever gonna get
to use the bed?

63
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,805
Come on, honey.
There's nothing wrong with the hammock.

64
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,649
Hey, Ari.
Fuck Richard Roeper.

65
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,085
- Michael phillips is a dick.
- Yup.

66
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,358
- I liked Gene Siskel.
- Whatever.

67
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,397
Give me something good, Lloyd.

68
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:23,533
First draft of my letter
to one Richard E. Roeper

69
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,863
reviewing him personally--
His clothes, his hair,

70
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,504
his nasally midwestern twang.

71
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:29,964
- Screw Chicago and--
- Attention everyone, please!

72
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,088
Listen up.

73
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,401
No one mention
Richard Roeper again.

74
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,980
Not today, not ever.

75
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,752
By doing so,
you are simply announcing

76
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:42,211
that on Sunday nights
instead of doing your job

77
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:45,013
reading scripts,
you're watching tv.

78
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,758
the next person
to mention Richard Roeper

79
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,160
will be fired.

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,488
And, Lloyd,
you will also be fired

81
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,923
if you don't answer
the fucking phone!

82
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,492
Ari Gold's office.

83
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,403
- I liked <i>Medellin</i>, Ari.
- Then you're a fucking idiot.

84
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,172
<i>Carl Urtz on one.</i>

85
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,035
Everybody get to work!

86
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,673
Carl, my man. How you doing?
I saw your trailer last night.

87
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,111
Very very scary stuff.

88
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,581
Makes <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>
look like <i>Free Willy</i>.

89
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,509
I saw Roeper last night.

90
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,420
<i>Fuck Richard Roeper.
You know, I went to college with him.</i>

91
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,257
When we was pledging
we used to tie beer cans around his nuts

92
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,793
and make him walk across campus.
I think last night was payback.

93
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,221
- I've been thinking about Vince.
- Oh yeah?

94
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,532
For <i>Danger Beach</i>.

95
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,190
I thought you had Emile Hirsch.

96
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,268
No, we don't.
Have you read it?

97
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,537
- Despite the title.
- It's a working title.

98
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:36,506
Listen, I read it.
It's good. It's good.

99
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,142
- I want to sit down with Vince.
- He's in mexico.

100
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:41,882
Yeah, I heard he's hiding out
on the beach somewhere, huh?

101
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,817
Think again.
He's doing improvised readings

102
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,841
with Cuaron and Del Toro
till something pops.

103
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:47,750
I'm not messing around, Ari.

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,586
I want Vince for this movie.

105
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,414
Carl, if you think you can
get Vinnie Chase,

106
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:54,717
the star of the highest
grossing movie of all time,

107
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,334
at a cut rate just 'cause
you think he's in a rut--

108
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:58,733
<i>Ari, I love Vince.</i>

109
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:01,598
I've always loved Vince.
How many things did he turn me down on?

110
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:03,633
- One or two.
- <i>Six, but who's counting?</i>

111
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,268
I'll pay his full rate.

112
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,939
- Is this an offer, Carl?
- As soon as I sit down with him.

113
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,100
Listen, I gotta go
to Greece on Wednesday,

114
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,350
which means
I need to see him tomorrow

115
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,637
at The Grill for lunch.
See if you can make it happen.

116
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,195
I'll do what I can.

117
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:21,155
Get E on the phone
right fucking now.

118
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,121
The murphy group.
Can I help you?

119
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,596
Just one second, please.

120
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,368
Just don't tell him the script
sucked like you did last time.

121
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:33,847
Yeah, but it's not funny.

122
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,125
'Cause it's <i>Cold case</i>.
It's not supposed to be funny.

123
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,602
- Leave the comedy for the stand-up.
- All right.

124
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:41,338
A Mr. Ari Gold's on the phone.

125
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,438
Tell him I'll call him back.

126
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:44,939
You trust me?

127
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:46,975
Soon as I get a job,
then I'll trust you.

128
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,304
It's been three months,
you've had four screen tests.

129
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,843
You're gonna get a job soon.

130
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,772
You got to tell my mom this.
She's the one killing me.

131
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,873
Mr. Gold says it's urgent.

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,489
Will you put him through, please?

133
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,880
Sorry, Charley.

134
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:03,285
Well well well,
long time no hear.

135
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,469
You got Bea Arthur
answering the phones for you?

136
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,600
- I'm in a meeting. What do you want?
- Ah, yes.

137
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,726
The Murphy group doubling in size
the past five months to two clients.

138
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,169
- I have three clients.
- You do?

139
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,238
I mean, I thought
I was your only client.

140
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:16,965
Besides the guy on the wall.

141
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,975
You're the only one
that matters, Charley.

142
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,445
- What do you want, Ari?
- To bring our boy back from the abyss.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,749
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Already in motion. We got an offer.

144
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,084
- <i>You got an offer? For what?</i>
- Danger Beach.

145
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,797
- I thought it was Emile Hirsch.
- No, Vincent Chase is doing it.

146
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:33,001
Wow, you really are in the business.
You read it?

147
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,445
Oh yeah, I read it. I liked it,
except for the dumb title.

148
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,068
It's a working title.

149
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:40,124
- Are they gonna pay him?
- Wow, all about the money these days.

150
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,924
Makes me proud and yet a little sad

151
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:45,127
that you've lost that
prepubescent boyish charm.

152
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,396
Yeah, they're gonna offer him
his full quote.

153
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,306
Come on. That's unbelievable!

154
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,732
Well, start believing and start breaking
out your best travel agenting skills

155
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,980
because we need him here
by lunchtime tomorrow

156
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,672
to have a meeting with Carl Urtz.

157
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:58,209
What kind of meeting?

158
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,518
Carl wants to see if his eyes
are still as blue as ever.

159
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:05,155
- So do we have an offer or a meeting?
- We have an offer pending a meeting.

160
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:08,091
An offer pending a meeting
is not a fucking offer, Ari.

161
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,093
How long have you been
in this town, Opie?

162
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,229
An offer pending a meeting

163
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,966
is what you get
when you make a shit movie

164
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:19,169
and haven't been seen this side
of the border in six months.

165
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,282
We're living in a post <i>Medellin</i> world.

166
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,540
But amazingly enough,
if Vince shows up

167
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
with all of his limbs intact

168
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,689
and doesn't have some sort
of seizure in front of Urtz,

169
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:31,014
we are back in the game.
Okay, you'll call?

170
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,798
Hey, I've got to roll, man.

171
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,677
Yeah, Ari.
I'll call, I'll call.

172
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:36,191
Good luck, Charley.

173
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,048
What luck? You got to take me.
I don't have a car.

174
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:41,778
You've been in LA six months
and you don't have a car?

175
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,460
I can't afford a car, all right?

176
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,595
Get me a job, then I can get a car.

177
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,013
Let's go.

178
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:57,625
We gonna outdo
last year's poster, Johnny?

179
00:10:57,785 --> 00:10:59,525
You know it, son.
You know it.

180
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,683
So I told the mofo
nobody upstages Johnny Chase.

181
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,780
Okay, perfect.
That's perfect.

182
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,652
Johnny, switch partners with Ron
and take Linda now.

183
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,019
No problem.

184
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,709
Beautiful, I love it.

185
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,587
Okay, spin her again.

186
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,030
As you wish.

187
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,967
Could <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>
be next for us?

188
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,170
Beautiful, beautiful.

189
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,806
Okay, now some more serious stuff.
Everyone just give me a left side pose.

190
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:35,178
Beautiful.
Lovely. Lovely.

191
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:37,267
Everyone give me a right side pose.

192
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:40,922
Johnny, you want to turn to the right?

193
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,645
- Uh, no, not really.
- Oh god, here we go.

194
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,289
- Why not?
- 'Cause actually, I don't go right.

195
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,575
- What do you mean?
- I mean I don't go right.

196
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,761
It's my bad side.
Everyone knows that.

197
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,007
- I didn't know that.
- Have you ever seen the show?

198
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,591
No. But I'm in Europe a lot.

199
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,627
Well, we've done 54 episodes
and I've never gone right.

200
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,871
Even if we do 500 more I never will.

201
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,672
Come on.
Let's just get this done.

202
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,765
Let him shoot you
without a padded bra, Linda,

203
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,927
- then I'll let him shoot my right side.
- I really don't see the issue.

204
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,381
You don't see this right here?

205
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,342
Maybe we should call the producers.

206
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:16,690
Maybe we should.

207
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,352
Okay, people, let's take a break.

208
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,619
Go ahead, call the producers.
What, is this guy threatening me?

209
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,422
They know. Eddie Burns knows.
Everyone knows.

210
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,962
Shooting me from the right
makes me look...

211
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:30,219
Freakish.

212
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,877
- The life, huh?
- Oh yeah.

213
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,799
- Anyone hungry?
- Getting there.

214
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,970
Could we make it
to the beach-side fiesta?

215
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,350
When you put it like that,
who could say no?

216
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:14,201
Yo, Vin.

217
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,035
It's the real world calling.

218
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:18,515
- Ma?
- E.

219
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,617
- Really?
- Should I answer it?

220
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:21,792
Yeah.

221
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,088
Yo, E, what's up?

222
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,917
<i>How's your office?
Any of your wannabes touching my shit?</i>

223
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:32,261
Your office has remained untouched.
And I'm sure it will continue to be.

224
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,575
<i>Let me talk to Vince.</i>

225
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,724
Not if you're gonna rain
on our parade of pussy.

226
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:38,184
- Put him on the phone, Turtle.
- <i>Vin, talk to E.</i>

227
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,105
- Yo, E. How goes it?
- <i>Great.</i>

228
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,851
We got a project for you.

229
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,934
No hello?
No how are you?

230
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:47,670
Sorry about that. How are you?

231
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,465
- <i>How do I sound?</i>
- You sound good.

232
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:51,345
- I am.
- <i>Good.</i>

233
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,916
- How are you?
- I'm good.

234
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:54,788
Good.

235
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,730
- What you got?
- A cool genre movie.

236
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,249
The producer wants you.
Could you come back and meet him?

237
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,375
Sure. Send the script,
we'll set up a meeting.

238
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,222
- It's got to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

239
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,329
What's the rush?
I'd have to leave right now.

240
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,003
You can't leave before the fiesta.

241
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:10,426
- I can't leave now.
- It's a really good script.

242
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,494
- Yeah, what is it?
- It's called <i>Danger Beach</i>.

243
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:15,564
- It's called <i>Danger beach</i>?
- Sounds stupid.

244
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,905
- It's a working title.
- What do you think, girls?

245
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,743
Should I do a movie
called <i>Danger beach</i>?

246
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,186
- Don't think so.
- Nobody here likes it.

247
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:25,015
- It's a working title.
- Yeah? Well it's not working for me.

248
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,443
- I'm getting hungry.
- <i>Vince, you got to trust me.</i>

249
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:30,320
<i>I do trust you, E.
And I love you and I Miss you.</i>

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,781
But I'm not going back right now.

251
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,998
Not on a day like this.
Not when Maria's cooking.

252
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,726
She cooks like you wouldn't believe.

253
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:39,203
- Hey, I cook good things too.
- Course you do.

254
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,490
<i>I got to go. I'm being rude.</i>

255
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,844
- Okay, I'll talk to you later, E.
- Bye.

256
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:46,641
Later, sucker.

257
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,857
Look, man.
Don't worry.

258
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,949
I'll carry the Murphy group.

259
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,445
What do you mean
he's not coming back?

260
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,698
I mean, you want me
to say it in Spanish?

261
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,438
<i>Why do I have 300 clients</i>

262
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,760
and you have two

263
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,162
and you don't seem to care that one
of them is retiring in his prime?

264
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,106
What is it you think I can do, Ari?

265
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,401
- You two have a little rift?
- What?

266
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,167
Playing the <i>Medellin</i> blame game?

267
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,779
Let it go like a bad piece of pussy.

268
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,182
Just forget that you smelled it
and move on.

269
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,476
<i>If he passes on this thing now,</i>

270
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:37,521
he might as well be Cat Stevens
doing butterfly strokes

271
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,190
in the Caspian Sea
searching for Mohammed.

272
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,518
'cause that's how he's gonna
be viewed in this town.

273
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:45,695
I spoke to him. I know him
better than you. He's not coming back.

274
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,130
Then we're going to him.

275
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,124
Drama's the only one
who knows where he is.

276
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:51,627
Call Drama and meet me
at the Van Nuys airport in 40 minutes.

277
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,475
Really?
Are you supplying the plane?

278
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,279
That's how much I care.

279
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,676
- How'd it go?
- Shitty.

280
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,445
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No, man, I let you down.

281
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,707
You didn't. We'll get 'em next time.
Don't worry.

282
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:06,861
- Do me a favor though?
- What's up?

283
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,752
Drive me to the airport.
Take my car for the night.

284
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,894
Shit, fuck the audition.
Let's roll.

285
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,160
You see what I'm talking about,
right, babe?

286
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,929
I look awful from this side.

287
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:21,398
<i>I wouldn't say awful,
but I see what you're saying.</i>

288
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,235
- You're the only one who gets me.
- <i>Just let them shoot you how they want</i>

289
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:27,504
<i>and if it doesn't look good
they won't use it.</i>

290
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:30,284
Baby, I love your naiveté,
but you don't get this town.

291
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:32,768
You've got to cover your own ass
'cause no one else will.

292
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:34,611
They can say what they want,

293
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:37,239
but I know the reason
I got recast for the <i>Models Inc.</i> pilot

294
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,942
was because the director
kept shooting me from the right side.

295
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,945
That's why test scores
said teenage girls were scared of me.

296
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,954
But how can anyone
be scared of you?

297
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:47,583
Shit. Who is it?

298
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,686
It's Tommy. They got Ben Silverman
coming down from his office.

299
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,676
You better get your ass out here now.

300
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,299
Jesus, the network chairman
is coming down right now.

301
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,469
- <i>Just do what he says, Johnny.</i>
- I can't do that, baby.

302
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:02,072
I struggled for 20 years
to get to where I am.

303
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,708
I'm not gonna let them force me
to looking stupid again.

304
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,196
I won't do it, no way.

305
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:08,912
Tommy, thanks.
But you tell Silverman

306
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,021
I'm not doing it.
Not for him, not for no one.

307
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,216
<i>Johnny, you have me so worried.</i>

308
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:15,025
Hold on one second, baby.
One second.

309
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:18,571
I need to know exactly
where you sent Vince to in mexico.

310
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,056
No go. It's a hideaway.

311
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:22,092
Vince said nobody gets to go
unless he says so.

312
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,653
- He's coming.
- I can't talk right now.

313
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,120
It's an emergency.

314
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,341
An emergency?
Is baby bro in trouble?

315
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,128
Yeah, kind of.

316
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,051
I'm on my way.

317
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,808
Baby, I've got to fly.
Vince is in trouble.

318
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,816
I'll call you back
in two minutes, okay?

319
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,386
- Tweet.
- Chirp.

320
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,861
- Johnny Chase.
- Mr. Chairman.

321
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,501
Shoot me any way you want.

322
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,355
I've got to get to Mexico.

323
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,746
Fucking waste of time.

324
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,376
I could use another shot
if you guys are gonna do this.

325
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:27,866
Boss, the plane.
The plane.

326
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,594
How many times
you gonna do that joke, Turtle?

327
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,521
Till it don't get a laugh, baby.

328
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,902
Come on, Carol, that was funny, right?

329
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,350
Fresh air.

330
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,418
- Oh my God.
- Jesus.

331
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,951
- Look at you.
- E, what's up, bud?

332
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:58,420
- Nice suit.
- I love it. Good to see you.

333
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,794
You must be really desperate
to come running down here.

334
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,702
Listen, the producer Carl Urtz,
six for six.

335
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,844
I know Carl.

336
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:10,914
He makes 'em for cheap
and they make big bucks.

337
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,762
It's a perfect way to come back strong,

338
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:15,272
on a movie the genre
already has a built-in audience.

339
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:18,403
Is there any kind of role in this movie?
One that requires me to act?

340
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,769
The same kind of role
Shia Labeouf had in <i>Disturbia</i>.

341
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,274
You look scared a few times,
smile so girls want to fuck you

342
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,941
and laugh your way all the way
to the next <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>.

343
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,376
Sounds challenging.

344
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:29,928
Listen, we need to get
the 18-25-year-olds back.

345
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:31,899
The ones that have forgotten you exist.

346
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,496
They've forgotten that I exist?

347
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,293
Don't take it personally, bro.
The whole country's on meth.

348
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,129
- So what do you think, Vince?
- I don't know.

349
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't feel like running back right now
for a non-challenging career move.

350
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,828
We're having a good time here.
Even Turtle's getting laid.

351
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah, a lot.

352
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,972
It's vacation pussy.
Anyone can get that.

353
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,672
You see these girls back in the states,
they won't even look your way.

354
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,969
I think you're arguing
against our point there, Drama.

355
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,880
Look, we are desperate.
We haven't had an offer in six months.

356
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,919
- You guys are starting to sound alike.
- Starting to look alike too.

357
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,836
Vinnie, listen.

358
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,021
What happens if another
offer doesn't come in?

359
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,849
It may not.
What then?

360
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,216
What if one doesn't?
You think I'm gonna suffer?

361
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,094
Come on.
Look at this place.

362
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:13,463
I live like a king for $79 a day.

363
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,978
I got great food,
fantastic women,

364
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:19,035
and I wake up every morning
with a big fat smile on my face.

365
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:22,045
Look at you guys.
Fighting the rat race.

366
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:25,154
Wearing uncomfortable shoes.
Angry all the time.

367
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:27,858
Life is not all about
making money and movies.

368
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,275
At least mine isn't.

369
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,782
Ari, it's siesta time.
It's time to chill.

370
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,363
We'll talk about it over dinner.

371
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,380
- We're not staying for dinner.
- I know.

372
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,257
You should stay.
The food's real good.

373
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,719
But know if you do stay,
you guys are sharing the hammock.

374
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,724
Vince, can I talk to you alone
for a second?

375
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,993
Is it gonna be another one
of your famous pep talks?

376
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,999
Call it what you want.
Two seconds, come on.

377
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,613
Excuse me, ladies.

378
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,500
You really want
to go out on the bottom?

379
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,549
- Bottom?
- Yeah.

380
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,942
<i>Medellin</i> sucked
and the whole world knows it.

381
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:05,715
You disappear now that's all
people are gonna remember you for.

382
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,993
When did I ever care
about what people think?

383
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:10,469
All right, maybe you can
go out like this, but I can't.

384
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:13,495
I'm the one that found <i>Medellin</i>.
I got to spend the rest of my life

385
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,318
thinking I ruined my best friend's
career 'cause I couldn't make it good?

386
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:19,427
I know how good you are, Vince, and
I know you got big things ahead of you.

387
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:22,463
You've done everything for me,
but you've got to do one more thing.

388
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,960
Help me let you get back
to where you were supposed to be.

389
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,903
Then you can retire
on any beach you want

390
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:29,448
and you won't have to worry
about me killing myself.

391
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:30,791
That's a pep talk?

392
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:38,243
All right, E.
I'll go for you.

393
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:40,709
Thank you.

394
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:44,354
Hey, Ari, get the plane ready.
We're going home.

395
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:46,456
Wait wait wait,
I need an hour.

396
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:49,025
Carol, I'm leaving tonight, baby.

397
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,884
You need to shave.

398
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,468
- My face feels weird.
- I feel you, bro.

399
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:01,371
I felt like an amputee
when I played that high school swimmer

400
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,323
with alopecia back on "7th heaven."

401
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,600
Vince with alopecia
would still look better than you.

402
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,146
This script is not that bad.

403
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,204
Stop reading and driving
before you kill us.

404
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,690
Sorry, I picked it up this morning
and I couldn't put it down.

405
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,169
It is good.
You were right.

406
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:14,985
- Real dumb title though.
- Real dumb.

407
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:16,653
Reminds me of a Hitchcock movie.

408
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,883
What do you guys think
of <i>M Is For Amnesia</i>?

409
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,024
I think the tropical sun
melted your brain.

410
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,193
- No good, Vin?
- No good, Turtle.

411
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:25,621
- What about <i>High Tide</i>?
- I like that.

412
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,354
- It's pretty good, actually.
- See?

413
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,273
I have a purpose here.
What's yours, Drama?

414
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,091
It's my day off. Get off my ass.

415
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,264
- There he is.
- What are you doing here?

416
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:37,633
- Moral support.
- I told you I don't need any.

417
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:40,035
- Well, I'm here just in case.
- It'll be fine.

418
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:42,012
Tear it up, baby bro.
Tear it up.

419
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:43,723
You're back, Vin.

420
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,545
This is what you losers do
all these years? You wait?

421
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:52,070
Sometimes when I'm alone
I do that.

422
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,373
I'm going back to the office.

423
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,953
- Later.
- I got girl on girl too, Ari.

424
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,891
Will you roll up the window, you idiot?

425
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,282
Look, Vincent Chase.

426
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:22,351
- I thought he was dead.
- Only till he's alive again.

427
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,332
- Oh Jesus -
- What?

428
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,629
- So, Mexico, huh?
- It was phenomenal.

429
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:35,864
I'm more of a Caribbean guy myself.
Lot of history.

430
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,408
So, <i>Danger beach</i>.

431
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:42,472
I have to say, I read it on the plane
and it is really really good.

432
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:45,798
- You sound surprised.
- The title threw me at first. But,

433
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,138
it's a unique story and this character
is better than I've seen in a long time.

434
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:51,741
Fantastic. And you know
we're working on the title now.

435
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:53,947
What do you think about <i>High Tide</i>?

436
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:57,120
<i>High Tide</i>. I like that.
I like that a lot.

437
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,289
- Hi, Carl. -
- It's got a-- Adam.

438
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,338
Nice to see you.
You know Vinnie Chase.

439
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:04,160
- I do. I used to represent Johnny.
- Oh yeah, that's right.

440
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,652
- Crazy running into you here.
- Indeed.

441
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:11,125
Always good to see you, Adam.
Guess I'll talk to you soon.

442
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,278
I guess so.

443
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,073
He seems angry.

444
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:20,534
He's an agent.
They're all pricks.

445
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,881
Ari gold's office.

446
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,383
Really?
Interesting.

447
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,296
- Adam Davies calling.
- For me?

448
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,095
If you need a kidney, Adam,
I'm not willing to donate.

449
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:42,674
But I'm willing to watch you slowly die
if you're looking for that.

450
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,202
- You lost your touch, Ari.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

451
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,977
Urtz doesn't want Vince.

452
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,183
<i>You were set up. He was just trying
to force me to close Emile Hirsch</i>

453
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:52,031
at $2 million less than I wanted.

454
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,244
Explain to your client that you
dragged him back here for nothing.

455
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:58,155
- I'm gonna skull-fuck you, Davies!
- You just did, Ari.

456
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,936
- What did he want?
- Fuck you, Yoko. Get E on the phone.

457
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:05,483
- I will beat Carl Urtz's ass.
- Will you calm down?

458
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,439
No, no calm. Let's go to his house
and beat him in front of his kids.

459
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,915
I know where he lives.
I used to drive him home from softball.

460
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,255
I still see him at the rub and tug
every now and then.

461
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:16,488
- You have a girlfriend.
- I go there for facials, asshole.

462
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,841
- Come on, let's go kill Urtz.
- Guys, will you stop it?

463
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,882
I appreciate the backing
but no one's killing Urtz, all right?

464
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,899
You should kill me
'cause it's my fault again.

465
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,053
Shut up. You couldn't have seen
this coming. Nobody could have.

466
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:30,080
And you didn't push me into "Medellin."
We did it together.

467
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,356
- Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
- Although you did approve the makeup.

468
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:36,578
The guy said it was gonna look good
on film. How am I supposed to know?

469
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,155
It didn't.

470
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,447
Oh boy. So what now?
Back to Mexico?

471
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,951
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm not going out like this.

472
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,876
I thought you don't care
what people think?

473
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:49,247
- I care a little.
- You're gonna be bigger than ever.

474
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:52,067
You're gonna take back the throne.
If I made it back,

475
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:53,970
so can you, baby bro.

476
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:55,677
Thanks, Johnny.

477
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:06,586
It's right here. Kill
the lights. Kill 'em.

478
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,726
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna golf, you're gonna caddy.

479
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:15,409
Five iron.

480
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:21,298
The maserati, really?

481
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:24,093
It is nice.

482
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,213
- What are you, the godfather?
- I'm sending a message.

483
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,421
- Saying what?
- Aquaman will be back.
