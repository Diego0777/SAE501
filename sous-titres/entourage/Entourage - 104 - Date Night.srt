1
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:21,066
- Yeah?
- It's game day, baby. Wake the fuck up.

2
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,332
- What?
<i>- We're opening today.</i>

3
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,637
We got hot little teens walking into theaters
on the East Coast...

4
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,836
to support our boy. Why aren't you awake?

5
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:28,934
What time is it?

6
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:31,947
It's time for you to wake up.
I've already shot a 72, bitch.

7
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,483
- What, on the front nine?
- Yeah, that's funny, cunty.

8
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:37,952
I'll call you with the midday numbers,
get ready. That's not a gimme.

9
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:46,423
- What?
- It's Emily.

10
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,031
I'm headed up your block. Open up the gate.

11
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,624
- You're coming here?
<i>- Yeah, I'll be right there.</i>

12
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,092
- Big day.
- Yeah.

13
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:21,390
Ari's freaking.
He gets crazy before a client's movie opens.

14
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,531
- Fan mail.
- Thanks.

15
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,732
- What about you? Are you nervous?
- Yeah. A little bit.

16
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,101
I called the psychic hotline.

17
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,335
They said Vince's moons were all aligned.
We're looking pretty good.

18
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,107
- What did they say about your moons?
- I don't know, I was too cheap to ask.

19
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:39,441
Do you guys have any big plans for tonight?

20
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,017
We're not gonna do anything.

21
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,916
Vince doesn't want to make a big deal
about it. We'll lay low.

22
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,420
That is way too normal.

23
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:46,649
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:49,655
- Ari has clients who do crazy stuff.
- Like what?

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,456
One of them bought
$3 million worth of tickets...

26
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,724
just to make sure
his movie opened at number one.

27
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,129
- Come on.
- I swear.

28
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,291
- Who was it?
- I can't tell.

29
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,868
Yes, you can. Tell me.

30
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,103
He was in <i>Ocean's Eleven.</i>

31
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:08,705
All right, good luck.

32
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:10,380
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,043
- Bye.
- See you.

34
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,943
- Eric?
- Yeah?

35
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:20,717
Since you don't have any plans tonight...

36
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:24,383
would you maybe want
to go to dinner with me?

37
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,093
Are you asking me out?

38
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:30,890
I could've sent a messenger with that stuff.

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,274
Morning, guys. Fan mail.

40
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,768
What the fuck you smiling about?

41
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,540
Who's smiling, douche bag?

42
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,138
Big night tonight, Vince.
I feel good about it, I do.

43
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,740
Yeah? That's good.

44
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,118
- Anybody know how to work this thing?
- No. Just Johnny.

45
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:53,813
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs. He got a girl.

46
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,180
Really? Who?

47
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,420
I don't know. He must've ordered
in late night. Woke me up at 4:30.

48
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,326
Sounded like a couple of baboons fucking.

49
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,559
Yeah, he better hurry up, too,
'cause I'm getting hungry.

50
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,930
Picture request.

51
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,597
Nice enough to send
the money for the stamp.

52
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,507
Relax. I'll send the picture.

53
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,748
- Fuck me.
- Let me see.

54
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:25,812
- Look at that.
- Not bad.

55
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:28,653
- Not bad? She's on fire.
- Let me see this.

56
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,659
"Vincent.

57
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,922
"I believe we were together in a past life.

58
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,555
"I believe we were destined
to be together in this one."

59
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,429
You should call her, Vince. It's destiny.

60
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:40,367
- Besides, she's got a great ass.
- That's a great idea, Turtle.

61
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,904
Have her catch a ride out here...

62
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,975
with the Kevorkian guy from Michigan
who wants Vince to kill him.

63
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:49,671
He's right. We don't need another psycho.
Look, better keep this, just in case.

64
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,447
Tanya, this is my brother, Vince.

65
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,781
- Good luck tonight.
- Yeah. Me and him, both.

66
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,914
See? These are the other guys.

67
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,321
What's up, guys?

68
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,690
- Want a creatine shake?
- No, I got a case of LUNAbars in the car.

69
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,857
- Show the guys.
- Stop it.

70
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,457
Come on, baby, just once.
Show the guys, please?

71
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:14,766
What's up, body?

72
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:17,864
Look at these pythons.
She'll whip all your asses.

73
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:21,342
- True.
- Come on, baby. I'll walk you out.

74
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,014
Give me a call.

75
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,034
What?

76
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,035
Where'd you meet her, Drama?
Barry Bonds hearing?

77
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,430
Please. Tanya's all natural.

78
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,574
I met her at the Vitamin Expo.

79
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,542
- She's booming, huh, Vince?
- She's got a pretty face.

80
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,570
She gave me the ride of my life.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,649
I just hung onto those lats
and surrendered all control.

82
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:05,187
You know, if I was holding onto those lats,
I'd think I was fucking Evander Holyfield.

83
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,447
Fuck you guys.

84
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:12,084
I ain't cooking shit for any of you.
Let's see what you do about that.

85
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,425
We should hit Encino first.
It's playing at the Galleria at 6:15.

86
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,027
Check out the Valley girls.
Then we head over the hill.

87
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,106
Good call.

88
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,937
I don't want to see the movie.
I can't watch myself again.

89
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:27,340
I love watching myself.

90
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:29,378
Too bad the audience doesn't.

91
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:32,145
Vince, you gotta see it with live crowd.

92
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,911
Especially the midnight show
at the Westwood Mann.

93
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,417
It's all hot UCLA ass.

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,182
- I don't know. What do you think, E?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,416
I didn't know
we were thinking about doing this.

96
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,358
- What's to think about?
- I made plans.

97
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,395
On the night my movie's opening
you made plans?

98
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,991
- Bullshit.
- You said you didn't want to think about it.

99
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:54,002
I didn't want to think about it together.

100
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,299
- What kind of plans did you make?
- Nothing.

101
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,974
I have a date.

102
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,539
You have a date?

103
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:05,171
Yeah. Emily asked me to go to dinner.

104
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,047
- She asked you?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

105
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:12,281
He's fucking a guy.
You're getting asked out like a little bitch.

106
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,152
I'd say it's a very big deal.

107
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,754
- Touché.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,219
Douche bag.

109
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,558
I haven't been on
a real date since high school.

110
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:23,633
That's because nobody dates in L.A., Vince.
It's a waste of time.

111
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,033
- And money.
- L.A. Lives between 2:00 a.m. And 5:00 a.m.

112
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:30,105
You take a lap through the talent pool.
Catch and release.

113
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,174
Online's even better.

114
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:35,006
You get the small talk out of the way
so when they show up, they're good to go.

115
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:37,239
Name one girl
you ever pulled off the Internet.

116
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:39,907
There are confidentiality agreements
with these sites.

117
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,006
I ain't telling you shit.

118
00:07:41,118 --> 00:07:44,349
- Why don't we all grab dates tonight?
- No, don't grab anybody.

119
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,287
- You can bring Tanya.
- You guys aren't coming with me.

120
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,882
It's opening night, it's a work night.
I need you.

121
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,790
- Fuck that, man.
- Come on, I'm serious.

122
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,261
No, you're not.
I want to get to know this girl.

123
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,389
- Will you give me a fucking break?
- So do we.

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,263
Make sure you don't get another lemon.

125
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,996
Just relax. It's not such a big deal.
It'll be fun.

126
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:04,403
- It'll be like prom.
- I guess you won't have a date then.

127
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,577
I told you 10,000 fucking times.
She had food poisoning.

128
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeah, right.

129
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,046
<i>Power 106, blazing hip hop and r & b.</i>
<i>Big Boy's neighborhood...</i>

130
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:12,174
<i>Power 106, blazing hip hop and r & b.</i>
<i>Big Boy's neighborhood...</i>

131
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:15,342
Fuzzy Fantabulous, Joe Grande,
Luscious Liz, up in here...

132
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:16,441
but you know what?

133
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:18,817
- We're not alone.
- No, not at all.

134
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:22,584
Vincent Chase is in the house.

135
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,788
<i>Head On.</i> That's the movie.

136
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,329
We've been hearing
some beautiful things about this.

137
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,695
When it comes to
an opening weekend for you...

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,462
do you have those rituals
that everybody else go through...

139
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,970
like, you got to pack dirt on your face
or sacrifice a goldfish?

140
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,438
No, I'm not superstitious.

141
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,599
- At all?
- No.

142
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,903
I heard...

143
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,537
that Mel Gibson carried a cross up
Temescal Canyon before <i>Passion</i> opened.

144
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,672
- It must have worked, huh?
- It sure did work.

145
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,579
Vince would've been a gorgeous Jesus.

146
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,414
What's going on?
What you got planned for tonight?

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,351
My buddy E. Got asked out on a date.

148
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:53,823
That's nice.

149
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,586
So me and the other guys
are gonna join him.

150
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,059
Wait. Hold on. So your boy got asked out?

151
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:01,196
- Here we go.
- Relax. It's fine.

152
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,358
His ex-girl crushed him.
So he's looking to get laid.

153
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,402
Eric, sit down. Don't fuck with his rhythm.

154
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,436
This is embarrassing.

155
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:10,529
He's telling the world
about my personal life.

156
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:13,007
Relax. The world could give
a shit about your life.

157
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,099
What are you doing?

158
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:17,772
- You got some hot celebrity, some model?
- Right. Some hot chicks.

159
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,082
- I don't have a date yet.
- What?

160
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:21,775
Vincent Chase doesn't have a date?

161
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,113
I find that hard to believe.

162
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,882
We got a lot of females
out there listening right now.

163
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:29,152
Can we bring somebody up in here? Not Liz.

164
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,693
We gonna take a phone call for you, Vince.

165
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,256
Christy, what do you got tonight?

166
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,822
Stop hitting on my assistant, Turtle.
Besides, she'd never go out with you.

167
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,960
What, she can't speak for herself?

168
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,662
You can speak.

169
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,775
I'd never go out with you, Turtle.

170
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:48,002
Ouch.

171
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,113
What?

172
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,685
You won't believe who we got on the phone.

173
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,350
- Who?
- Justine Chapin.

174
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,750
White virgin in the house.

175
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,091
- Justine Chapin. She's fabulous.
- She's not a virgin.

176
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,632
You know she's on
that Pure Tour right now.

177
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,929
- Justine, you there?
<i>- I'm here, Big Boy.</i>

178
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,596
<i>How you doing, baby girl?</i>
<i>We got Vince right here, also.</i>

179
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,298
You can't find a date tonight, Vince?

180
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,466
I'm having a little trouble, Justine.

181
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:23,603
I'm leaving San Diego right now.
I'll be back in L.A. For the night.

182
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,713
I'd love to go out with you.
You look hot on the billboard.

183
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,507
Are you gonna sing for me?

184
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:31,746
- Singing is all you're going to get.
- That's right.

185
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:34,483
Big Boy's right. So do you still want to go?

186
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,617
Of course.
I'm just looking for someone to cuddle with.

187
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:40,720
- He's definitely fucking her, right?
- Definitely.

188
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,230
I'm calling Cindy Adams.

189
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,590
Cuddle.

190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,998
Vince is gonna be there, too.

191
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,269
It's gonna be a nice time, honey.

192
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,972
When did you move away?

193
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,712
What about that cute roommate of yours?

194
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,652
Married?

195
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:07,756
Yeah. Congratulate her.

196
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,693
Yeah. I'll call you if I ever get to Oregon.

197
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,758
What do you think, Arnold?

198
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,037
Baby, I know you like my hair natural.

199
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,699
But I'm gonna
put a little product in it, okay?

200
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:28,242
Don't be so controlling.
All right, I'll talk to you later.

201
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:51,266
<i>- Am I 21st century or what?</i>
- Yes, you are, Ari. What's up?

202
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,326
<i>I had video sex</i>
<i>with an Ecuadorian girl this morning.</i>

203
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,804
I hope she was 18. Federal offense if not.

204
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,041
<i>She had big teeth and a sarong.</i>
<i>That's all I remember.</i>

205
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,269
What's going on?

206
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:03,906
<i>Seriously, here's the deal. Don't panic.</i>

207
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,206
<i>The matinees were less than stellar.</i>

208
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:08,375
- Fuck.
<i>- I just said don't panic.</i>

209
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,715
- I'm not panicked.
<i>- This is a date movie.</i>

210
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,349
<i>This Pixar squirrel is killing us.</i>

211
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:15,550
<i>'Cause all the mommies</i>
<i>who want to fuck Vince...</i>

212
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,820
<i>are taking their kids to see</i> The Squirrel.

213
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,053
<i>We're gonna be fine, though.</i>

214
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,153
<i>Where are you guys gonna be?</i>
<i>I want to meet.</i>

215
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:22,891
Vince is tired. We're staying in.

216
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,830
<i>Why are you so dressed up, then?</i>

217
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,169
I hate that you can see me. You know that?

218
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,137
<i>I love that I can see you.</i>
<i>It's why I bought the thing for you.</i>

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,834
<i>- Show me a little nipple.</i>
- Bye.

220
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,878
- Hello?
- So, who is she?

221
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:40,950
Who's who?

222
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,111
My friend told me they heard
you on Power 106 this morning.

223
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,188
Yeah?

224
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:47,347
Since when do your friends
listen to rap music?

225
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:49,652
You're taking your first date out
with the guys?

226
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,057
I guess you don't want
this one to work out either.

227
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,323
What do you care?
You broke up with me, right?

228
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,059
In case you'd forgotten, we just had sex.

229
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,526
You said it was break-up sex.
What do you want from me?

230
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,162
You want me to just
keep chasing you around?

231
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,865
Maybe I don't know what I want.

232
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,671
Maybe you should figure it out
and then call me.

233
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,905
What the fuck is this?

234
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,481
- What's with the limo?
- Turtle thought it'd be funny.

235
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,557
- I'm taking my own car.
- You're not taking your own car. Move.

236
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,649
Yes, I am. This girl will think I'm an idiot.

237
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,093
Tell her it was my idea
and let her think that I'm the idiot.

238
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,757
You're cock-blocking me so bad
right now and you know it.

239
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:32,198
What are you talking about?
You think I like Emily?

240
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,294
No, I think you think I like Emily
and you're trying to shut it down.

241
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:36,463
Why would I do that?

242
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:39,872
You don't like it when I get a girl
and you get stuck with the retards.

243
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,136
You know what?

244
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:43,542
I'll get a girl
and leave you with the two retards.

245
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,205
See how you like it.

246
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,379
Bro, you just broke up with Kristen.

247
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,047
Fuck around a little bit.
Have a little fun before you get serious.

248
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:55,124
What are you talking about, serious?
It's a first date.

249
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,716
Emily's not the kind of girl
you just play with.

250
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,625
Fine, I'm going.
But if you guys fuck around, I'm out.

251
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,957
Who's gonna fuck around?

252
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,859
Did you talk to Ari?

253
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,800
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

254
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,602
- It's all good.
- Yeah?

255
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,209
- Yeah. It's cool.
- Good.

256
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,305
Smile, biatches.

257
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,607
What's with him? Is he still trying to bail?

258
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:23,618
- Did you even get a date yet, Turtle?
- Of course I got a date.

259
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,484
We have to pick her up
from the Burbank airport in one hour.

260
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,493
- What is she? A Russian mail-order bride?
- No, dick. She's a hottie from Flagstaff.

261
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,825
- From Flagstaff? Who?
- An old friend. Don't worry about that.

262
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,398
Where're we going tonight?

263
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,025
Tanya needs to know
so she can dress accordingly.

264
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:42,229
Dolce. You called, right, Turtle?

265
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,397
No. Me and Vince decided...

266
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:47,203
we don't want to watch Demi cutting
Ashton's steak all night into tiny pieces.

267
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,404
- Where are we going?
- I got us a couple of lanes at Lucky Strike.

268
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:51,946
- Bowling?
- Nice.

269
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,382
I'll get my ball.

270
00:14:57,787 --> 00:14:59,220
That's gonna go.

271
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:04,093
Take it easy, baby.
You're making me look bad.

272
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:17,102
- This is totally fucked right now.
- What are you talking about?

273
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,869
- Your friends are so cool.
- Yeah?

274
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,240
- My ex-girlfriend hated hanging out with us.
- No wonder she's your ex-girlfriend then.

275
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,813
Eric, you're not paying
enough attention to me.

276
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,578
- You're bad.
- The worst.

277
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:32,821
- Leave him alone.
- Turtle, how'd you guys meet?

278
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:34,681
JDate.

279
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,815
Isn't that for Jews?

280
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:39,753
- So?
- She's wearing a cross.

281
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:43,765
She's reformed. Joanne's up.
Give her a hand, everybody.

282
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,438
It's not polite to stare, E.

283
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,195
Vince.

284
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:53,965
Watch me.

285
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:56,840
How do I know her?

286
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:01,984
Yeah.

287
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,219
Jesus Christ. Come here, you sick fuck.

288
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,482
You out of your mind?

289
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,924
If you didn't have Emily,
you wouldn't have called?

290
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,758
This girl is psychotic.
You understand what I'm saying?

291
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:18,095
The girl just wanted to meet Vince.
Let's not unfairly label people.

292
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,999
This is a bad night for this shit.
I don't need this tonight.

293
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,696
What are you so stressed out about?

294
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,899
I'm stressed
because the movie's not doing good.

295
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,135
E., the movie's huge. Relax.

296
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:29,268
Joanne says it's destined to be a classic.

297
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,074
She says it's destined to be a classic?

298
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,411
She's destined to be
in a fucking insane asylum.

299
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:35,450
Keep her under control.

300
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,454
God, you eat like a little bird.

301
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:41,646
Stop it.

302
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,724
Tweet, tweet.

303
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:46,427
Vince, I saw your movie today.

304
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,258
Yeah? What'd you think?

305
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:51,261
- I loved it.
- Really? You see?

306
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:54,934
- Another satisfied customer.
- I heard. Was the theater crowded?

307
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:56,435
Not really.

308
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,474
- I was the first in line, 10:15 a.m.
- Really?

309
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:02,167
I loved it so much, I went to the 12:30 also.

310
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,508
- You were beautiful.
- Thank you.

311
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,077
He is beautiful.

312
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,352
So, Justine, if you lose your virginity...

313
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:15,219
doesn't the whole Pure Tour
thing become, like, a sham?

314
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,287
Who said I'm gonna lose my virginity?

315
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:22,695
Turtle said that these guys
don't even believe you are a virgin.

316
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,627
- I never said that.
- Check, please.

317
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,942
- Look at that.
- Told you, baby, we got a monster.

318
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:47,879
Yo, you cats going to see <i>Head On?</i>

319
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:51,159
No. We're going to see
that talking squirrel thing.

320
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:55,491
Fuck that movie. I saw it this morning.
The mother squirrel dies in the end.

321
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,929
See <i>Head On.</i>

322
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,367
- Yo, good looking, kid.
- You like that, right?

323
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,563
Fucking cartoons.
They got an unfair advantage.

324
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,299
They get to draw everything.

325
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,897
I'm not worried.

326
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,101
- Are you worried?
- Fuck, no.

327
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,906
- Let's go to Prey.
- We're not worried. Let's go to Prey.

328
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:37,239
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

329
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,706
- Did you get the numbers?
- I got the numbers.

330
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:42,073
- Ari, I can't hear you.
- Where are you?

331
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,874
It's Friday night. You at Prey?
Sounds like Prey.

332
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:47,215
Ari, you get the numbers?

333
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,350
Hello? Shit.

334
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:52,387
Hello. Can you hear me? Hey? Fuck.

335
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:56,384
I'm coming over. That was Vince. I gotta go.
I gotta go do this.

336
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,422
What are you talking about?
This is our night.

337
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,589
It's <i>24l7</i> with this shit, baby.
I love you, don't wait up, okay?

338
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,861
Ari, could I have the car keys, please?

339
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:10,096
Come on. There's a cab stand
at fucking Yucca.

340
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:12,638
Give me the fucking keys.

341
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,447
Can you drop me off?

342
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,122
I can't get a signal.

343
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,824
Eric, it's gonna be fine. Enjoy the moment.

344
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:41,370
See, E., I like this girl.
Nice, positive attitude.

345
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,234
- What about my attitude?
- You?

346
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,430
Come on, you have the best attitude.

347
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:46,933
Slut.

348
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:50,636
Joanne, wait.

349
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,014
Vince is my best friend.
I love that guy like a brother.

350
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:58,415
- But if he doesn't see how special you are...
- Nice try, Tortoise.

351
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:02,590
- Is that Jason Bateman?
- What?

352
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:05,856
Get the fuck out of here.

353
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,832
- I saw your movie today. You were great.
- Yeah?

354
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,376
- Thanks. What's your name?
- Take a hike, honey.

355
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,038
Baby, you can't talk to the fans like that.

356
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:29,585
- Don't be a faggot, Johnny.
- Don't call me a faggot.

357
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,711
What are you gonna do? Get tough?

358
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,627
I'm gonna go get a beer.

359
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:54,401
So you played tennis in high school,
you were saying?

360
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:55,874
Tennis, yeah.

361
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,840
I think I want you to be my first.

362
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:03,475
- Really?
- Yeah.

363
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,554
But you're really gonna have to work for it.

364
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,350
Work? Come on.

365
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:10,452
I got into this business
so I don't have to work.

366
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,219
You are not ready for this, are you?

367
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,729
I am tonight.

368
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,391
I'm not.

369
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,796
At least you're honest.

370
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,797
And gorgeous.

371
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,572
I'll call you from the road.

372
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,507
Just so you know.

373
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,383
Tonight, I would have given you
the best head you ever had.

374
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,465
Who's got the number one movie
in the country, motherfucker?

375
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:51,533
We beat <i>The Squirrel?</i>

376
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:55,035
The number one live-action film
in the country, $18.6 million.

377
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:56,639
Yeah.

378
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,871
What the fuck is she doing here?

379
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,069
Just having some drinks
with some friends, Ari.

380
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:04,806
- Yeah? You fucking my assistant?
- No.

381
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:08,475
The last thing I want to do is fire one
of your fuck buddies. You know that?

382
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,381
No tequila? Tara Reid steal it?

383
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,751
Let's get into it. We gotta celebrate.
Come on. I'll get a bottle.

384
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:20,951
Can you relax?

385
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:22,463
- Yeah.
- Good.

386
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:24,897
I can't. Not with my boss here.

387
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,662
I know. That's totally fucked up.

388
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:29,602
I didn't even know he was coming.
He shouldn't even be here.

389
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,503
You want to walk me out?

390
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,006
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

391
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:40,943
I'll be right back.

392
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,451
Sorry about tonight.
I know it wasn't a great first date.

393
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:48,319
This was a great first date.

394
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:50,389
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,326
Don't tell Ari about this.

396
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:13,777
Is this crazy?

397
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,084
Maybe a little bit, yeah.

398
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,379
Good.

399
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:30,895
You're on fire, baby.
We gonna get you your next movie.

400
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:34,929
Wanna do <i>Hindenburg?</i> Script's coming in.
It's like <i>Titanic</i> on a blimp.

401
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:37,101
Why don't we save the business
for Monday?

402
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,470
You got it, baby. No problem. Big weekend.

403
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,702
Where's Tanya?

404
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,645
Doing pushups in the men's bathroom,
for all I know.

405
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,237
I'm done with that girl.

406
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,144
Where's the exhibitionist?

407
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:51,345
She's out there cutting it up with Teen Wolf.

408
00:23:51,454 --> 00:23:53,149
Michael J. Fox is here?

409
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,883
No, the guy from the sequel.

410
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:01,988
Opening night of a hit,
and none of us are getting any action.

411
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:05,158
All I know is I'm here
with my best friends in the entire world.

412
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:06,633
- And Ari.
- And Ari.

413
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:10,201
- And there's no place I'd rather be.
- I'll drink to that.

414
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:11,739
Here you go, baby.

415
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:20,582
Vince, hi. You go to my gym.

416
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:22,207
- Really?
- Yeah.

417
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:26,112
I'll catch you guys later.

418
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:28,422
There you go, daddy.

419
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,560
God, I just want to be him
for like a fucking hour.

420
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:36,064
You think my assistant's hot?
I don't know. I can't tell.

421
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,227
Yeah, I do.

422
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,700
I'm thinking about hitting that.
