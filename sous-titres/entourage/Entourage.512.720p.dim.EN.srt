5x12 - Return To Queens Blvd

00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,109
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

3
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,102
- Come on, let's do another shot.
- I can't.

4
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,931
I've got a 10:00 a.m. meeting.
If I Miss it I can kiss partner goodbye.

5
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,821
- You'll call me?
- Definitely.

6
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,891
- Partner?
- She's a lawyer.

7
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:33,995
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but was that lawyer giving you a tug?

8
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:37,281
In L.A. you can only get an actress
or a hooker to do that.

9
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:40,311
God, I love this
motherfucking town!

10
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:42,114
Hear hear.

11
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,169
Oh, man.

12
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:55,527
- Should we get breakfast?
- No, we'll eat at home.

13
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:57,968
- Train?
- Cab, please.

14
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,366
I'm exhausted.

15
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:02,796
Yeah, sitting in a booth all night
getting no puss can be draining.

16
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,172
Right here.

17
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,818
- Where to?
- Queens, please.

18
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,618
You elbowed me right in the face.

19
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:30,910
Good ride.

20
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,896
Make sure
that cheap bastard tips you.

21
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,768
Thank you.

22
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,900
- I'm starving.
- I smell bacon.

23
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:45,792
Ma, what are you doing up?

24
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,806
Well, sorry, I couldn't sleep

25
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,538
thinking of you all lying
in a ditch somewhere.

26
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,736
We're grown men.
Nothing's gonna happen to us.

27
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,196
Oh yeah? You keep partying
like this at your age

28
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,226
you're gonna have
a heart attack, Johnny.

29
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,623
It's true.
She's right.

30
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,068
And you go home.
Your mother's worried too.

31
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,761
- I can't stay for breakfast?
- She doesn't cook for you anymore?

32
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,673
Sadly my mom's cooking
has gone to shit.

33
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:07,954
- And it started at crap.
- Be nice to your mother.

34
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,933
Easy for you to say.
Your mom's in Florida.

35
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:13,484
- It's like she can smell me.
- I saw your cab pull up.

36
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:16,217
What kind of an animal
doesn't come home till sunrise?

37
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:18,887
- Four nights in a row.
- We're on vacation, ma.

38
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:21,306
Get your fat ass home.

39
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,725
- Right now.
- I'm coming.

40
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,888
- Get your fat ass home, Turtle.
- Shut up, Drama.

41
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,503
- You okay ma?
- I'm worried about you.

42
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,551
You party all night,
you sleep all day.

43
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,261
How are you gonna get a job
carrying on like that?

44
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:39,190
It's always worked before.

45
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:43,078
I'm okay, ma.

46
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,789
Is he?
Is he okay?

47
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,869
You're the mastermind
behind all this. You tell me.

48
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,669
We've hit a bit of a rough patch,
but we'll be okay.

49
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:54,155
You know,
I read in <i>The Post</i> this morning

50
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,425
that Gus Van Sant is in town
working on a new movie.

51
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,678
What? I thought <i>Good Will Hunting</i>
was very good.

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,795
I would love to be
in a Gus Van Sant movie,

53
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:05,648
but I have an agent and a manager
who are on top of these things.

54
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,150
Are you on top of this thing?

55
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,431
I read the script months ago
when Vince wasn't available.

56
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,838
- It's totally cast now.
- Not anymore.

57
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,489
Joaquin Phoenix
broke his arm

58
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:17,195
and Gus
is looking for a replacement.

59
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,091
I would love to work with Gus.

60
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,365
<i>Milk</i> was dope.

61
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,156
It's a great role.

62
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:25,680
- I'll call Ari.
- Maybe I'm not so useless after all.

63
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,459
Gus doesn't think he's right for it.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,253
- How do you know?
- <i>Because</i>

65
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,797
unlike you my workday
starts before reading page six.

66
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,673
- What's he saying?
- He spoke to Gus.

67
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:40,377
He doesn't think
you're right for the part. Hold on.

68
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:43,740
Vinnie, how goes it?

69
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,548
Not well.
My mom's all over me.

70
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,716
She's treating me
like she usually treats Johnny.

71
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:48,977
I'm sorry about that.

72
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,728
So what exactly did gus say?

73
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,622
Listen, gus says he loves
you but just not for this.

74
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,174
All right, what did he really say?

75
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,243
He's not a fan.

76
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,578
He's not a fan.

77
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,814
Tell him you'll read for it.

78
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:04,494
- Really?
- You'll make him a fan.

79
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,620
- What's the idiot saying?
- He thinks I should read.

80
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,988
Vinnie, you haven't
auditioned in years.

81
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,708
So what?
You don't think I can?

82
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,794
I'm not afraid to audition1.
I can turn him.

83
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,755
I like the fire.
I'll set it up.

84
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,444
Great.
Thanks.

85
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,190
Back to basics.

86
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:26,155
I can give you plenty of advice
on how to audition, bro.

87
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,572
He needs advice
on how to successfully audition.

88
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,440
I've booked my fair share of jobs, you
jerkoff. 1Including this one right here.

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,679
One in a million's
not the odds we're looking for.

90
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,025
Vince knows how to audition.
He had to start somewhere.

91
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,624
I don't want to talk about it.

92
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,473
Let's just go say hi
to aunt Darcy for ma

93
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,754
and then we'll hit Don Pepe's
for some baked clams, okay?

94
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:45,116
You can't just say hi to aunt Darcy.

95
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,393
Welcome home!

96
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,164
Oh my god.
Ma, how did you beat us here?

97
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,082
I'm sneaky like that.

98
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,018
So how's it feel to be back home?

99
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,516
Are you kidding? I always love
coming home and seeing everybody.

100
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:02,225
- We're all so proud of you.
- Even when your movie get shit reviews,

101
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,951
- we're still proud, Vinnie.

102
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,960
Would you excuse me for a second?

103
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,302
So when are we gonna see
you in another good movie?

104
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,501
- Soon, I hope.
- Very soon.

105
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,895
Let's just say he may be staring
in Gus Van Sant's new movie.

106
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,980
- Oh, nice.
- Drama, you gonna be in that movie too?

107
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,735
The closest he's getting to Gus Van Sant
is whacking it to <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>.

108
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:23,361
Watch that mouth
or I'll wash it out with Palmolive.

109
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,296
- Would you stop?
- Hear hear, shut up.

110
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,120
Get off that thing.
You're at a party.

111
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,705
- Who do you keep texting with?
- Nobody.

112
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:32,080
I'm gonna get some air.
You guys are crazy.

113
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,275
He won't even let him audition?

114
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,477
He said he doesn't want
to waste anyone's time.

115
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,388
I don't even know
how to tell Vince that.

116
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,993
You knew how to tell him
to read before checking with me.

117
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,258
You've got to get Gus
to do you a favor and see him.

118
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,826
A favor to cover up your fuck up
or a favor for Vince?

119
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,594
For Vince.
He needs this right now.

120
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,546
He might not be showing it,
but he's hurting.

121
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,425
That sucks,
but there are certain realities

122
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,315
we need to face up to in this life.

123
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:56,895
And one of them is that Vince
ain't getting in a gus van sant movie.

124
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,215
Will you call Gus back?

125
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,776
- No, I won't.
- Fine, then I fucking will.

126
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:04,568
- Leave me alone.
- Who you talking to?

127
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:06,027
Maybe it's a girl.

128
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:07,288
- Impossible.
- Why?

129
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,220
We all want to know
who you're talking to.

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,042
But I will give it to
the highest bidder.

131
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:13,040
- 50 bucks.
- Give me the berry, Ronnie.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,813
- Sold.
- Give it to me.

133
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,250
He deleted everything.

134
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,284
You don't think I know
how to cover my tracks?

135
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:19,600
You still owe me 50.

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,058
Take it off my tab
from the last time you lost me money.

137
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,679
You still can't be mad.
I got opportunities for you.

138
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:27,494
- I'm not even hearing you.
- We'll talk tonight.

139
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,807
Can I get a rum and coke?

140
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:32,355
Look who it is.

141
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:34,974
You didn't think I'd miss the
one-who-got-away's homecoming parade.

142
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,942
I'm glad you didn't.
How are you doing, Cara?

143
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:38,424
I'm good.
How are you?

144
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,605
I'm great.

145
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,006
Hey, cara.
How you been?

146
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:44,304
Great.
Really great now that I can get

147
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,113
my once-every-five-years update
on how my old crew is doing.

148
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,535
What did Ari say?

149
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,491
- You want to--
- That's okay.

150
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,678
Gus won't see you.

151
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,318
He won't even let me read?

152
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,224
All right, fuck Hollywood.

153
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,409
You know what?
Let's go have some old school fun.

154
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,751
You guys go. I'm gonna go
into the city and see Gus.

155
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:09,149
- Come on.
- What?

156
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,636
You gonna go knock on his door
and beg him to let me audition?

157
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:14,098
- I tried calling him.
- If Ari couldn't do it, forget it.

158
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,976
- Do you want to do this movie or not?
- I did this morning but this is stupid.

159
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,519
Well, let me try.

160
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,356
- Okay, try.
- Thank you.

161
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,048
I'll see you later. Have fun.
It was good to see you, Cara.

162
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,700
- Mr. Murphy.
- Hi.

163
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,392
Shawn, we spoke on the phone.

164
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,394
Is Gus around?

165
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,331
As I told you on the phone,

166
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,920
Mr. Van sant doesn't have time
to talk with you today. So sorry.

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,388
I totally understand. Actually,
I don't even need to talk.

168
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:46,006
I just wanted to give him these
Vincent Chase movies to look at.

169
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,020
- I picked these up.
- I'll give them to him.

170
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,427
Do you think I can
give them to him personally?

171
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,834
He's not in right now
and he might not be back for hours.

172
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:56,973
That's okay. I don't mind waiting.
I won't bother anyone, I promise.

173
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,575
- Great.
- Thanks.

174
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,863
You know I got fired
off my last movie?

175
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,527
I know.

176
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,738
- Who told you?
- <i>Us Weekly</i>.

177
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:12,881
You read <i>Us Weekly</i>?

178
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,648
A future M.B.A.?

179
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,517
God, that is so sad.

180
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,766
I don't know what's gonna happen.

181
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,610
I just know I can't take
another year like this.

182
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,061
What does E say?

183
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,812
E says a lot of things.

184
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:32,484
I just don't know
who I should listen to anymore.

185
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:34,095
Just listen to yourself.

186
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,438
You don't believe in appointments?

187
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,103
Mr. Van Sant, how are you?

188
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,773
Sorry to drop in on you like this.
If I could have f5 minutes of your time.

189
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,252
Walk with me,
but only 'cause Ari's a friend.

190
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,261
So what didn't I make clear to Ari
that I should make clear to you now?

191
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,254
Nothing, but I know
Vince can do this part.

192
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:57,535
And I know he can't,
so where does that leave us?

193
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:59,754
If you just looked
at some of his work you'd see it.

194
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:01,951
- I've seen all of his work.
- Probably not all of it.

195
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,572
- You've seen <i>Head On</i>?
- Saw it.

196
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,723
<i>Queen's Boulevard</i>?

197
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,189
Not a lot of people saw that
but it was an amazing performance.

198
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:09,508
At sundance the <i>New York Times</i>
said he might win an oscar.

199
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,398
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

200
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:13,330
- And I saw it.
- What about <i>Aquaman</i>?

201
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,467
Everyone saw <i>Aquaman</i>
and I see everything.

202
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,681
What about the scenes
from the last movie he shot?

203
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,148
I know you didn't see those.

204
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:22,403
So you're gonna sell me on Vince
based on a $120 million film

205
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,951
that was shut down because
the director didn't like his work?

206
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:26,772
Look, I know he can do this.

207
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,567
Please,
just take a look at the scenes.

208
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:33,802
- So you're kind of desperate?
- It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

209
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,654
Okay, send over some scenes.
I'll take a look.

210
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,887
Thank you.

211
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:45,962
Thank you very much.

212
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,172
You really are an idiot.

213
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:55,218
Say out loud,
"I am a fucking idiot."

214
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,083
Just call Dana Gordon.

215
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,776
Watch out, man.
What's up?

216
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,317
Have her overnight them.

217
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:03,226
It's an unreleased disaster.
She'll never let them out.

218
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,481
You got her the job.
You could get her to do it.

219
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,331
I don't want to get her to do it.

220
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,354
<i>Fine. You know what?
You call Gus and you tell him that,</i>

221
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,244
'cause he rearranged
his whole schedule

222
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,019
to be there when they arrive
and I told him you were sending them.

223
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,157
Fuck!

224
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:24,872
- I'm not investing in a bar, Ronnie.
- Think of it this way:

225
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,375
You'll be investing in
the old neighborhood, huh?

226
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,552
Tv star makes good, huh?

227
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:33,714
Come on, Drama. Think about all the
great times we've had in this place.

228
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,845
'94, game six,
John Starks.

229
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,970
Come on, you remember.

230
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,681
I do. And I remember coming here
trying to forget game seven.

231
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,249
This place is still
packed every night.

232
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,019
- So how did Philly fall so behind?
- He's a degenerate gambler.

233
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,147
So why would I want
to invest with him?

234
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,955
He's in the program now.

235
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:53,538
30 gs and he's back on his feet.

236
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:56,070
- He won't make the same mistake again.
- Forget it.

237
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,926
Like my last investment with you,
I'll never see my money again.

238
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,473
- Maybe you wouldn't.
- Right.

239
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,986
But I think Philly
might let you change the name.

240
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:12,804
- What's up, buddy?
- Long day?

241
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,846
Yeah. I waited in Gus's office
for six hours today.

242
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,593
- Does he still hate me?
- He definitely hates me.

243
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,433
Is he gonna let me read or what?

244
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,467
He's watching
the <i>Smokejumpers</i> footage tomorrow.

245
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,968
Ari got Dana Gordon to fedex it to him,
so we still got a shot.

246
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,725
- Not a very good one.
- Yeah, but it's still a shot.

247
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,961
- Excuse me, buddy.

248
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,023
- Jesus, Turtle.
- Sorry, I've got to--

249
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,527
We want to know
who you're talking to.

250
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,006
Give me the phone.

251
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,198
Come on.
Enough's enough. Who is it?

252
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,160
Please don't make me tell you.
Just give me the phone back, please.

253
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,681
Oh no no no.

254
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,250
- Turtle's phone.
- Hello? Who's this?

255
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:53,628
- It's a girl.
- His mother?

256
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,255
Can I tell Turtle who's calling?

257
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,008
It's jamie, Drama.

258
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,078
Really?

259
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,866
Are you guys giving
Turtle a hard time?

260
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:04,805
No no.
It's all in good fun.

261
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:06,474
Whatever.
We're fucking.

262
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,746
<i>So can I please just talk to him?</i>

263
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,698
Yeah yeah.
Of course.

264
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,099
It's Jamie-Lynn.

265
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,921
They're fucking and I'm gonna
jump off the Triborough bridge.

266
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:20,780
Hey, sorry about that.
They stole my phone.

267
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,658
Babe, relax.
I don't care.

268
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,833
I just Miss you.

269
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,633
She misses me.

270
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:30,289
I Miss you too.

271
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:31,830
Phone sex?

272
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:34,780
I'll go outside.

273
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,122
Seriously.

274
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,173
All right.
Who's Jamie-Lynn?

275
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,433
- Sigler from <i>The Sopranos</i>.
- Meadow Soprano.

276
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,582
Well, bro,
if Turtle can land Jamie-Lynn,

277
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,925
there's no reason
you can't get a Gus Van Sant movie.

278
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,684
I just hope he lets me read.

279
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,018
There's nothing to hope. He will.

280
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,355
You tell Phil

281
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:58,049
that if this place is henceforth
known as Johnny Drama's,

282
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,614
- I'm in.
- Yeah?

283
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,175
Hey, everyone,
I got an announcement to make.

284
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,326
The drinks are on me.

285
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:07,766
Or should I say,

286
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,484
the drinks are on...

287
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:11,541
The house.

288
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,697
Show me the bar, let's go.

289
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:19,463
How you doing.
Get this guy a drink.

290
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:28,120
The life of an actor--
Waiting around for the phone to ring.

291
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,249
Something kind of exciting
about it, you know?

292
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:35,660
- Pussys.
- Get out of my kitchen, Johnny.

293
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,365
I'm making my famous frittatas.

294
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,191
No, I'm nervous. And when
I'm nervous I have to stay busy.

295
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,069
- Any calls?
- No, nothing yet.

296
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,517
- Relax, ma.
- Look...

297
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:45,654
Some of us are not used
this kind of thing.

298
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:48,531
My god, I always thought it was you
I was gonna have to worry about.

299
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,407
- Never Vince.
- He'll be fine, ma. Don't worry.

300
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,737
Morning, Mrs. Chase.

301
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:55,874
Oh, well,
what have we here?

302
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,381
This is like old times, huh?

303
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,333
E, any calls?

304
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:03,955
- Don't even ask. Don't even ask.
- Sorry.

305
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,761
Well, now that you did...

306
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,678
- Nothing yet.
- Did you track the package?

307
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:12,103
- Are you sure he got the movie?
- They're called dailies.

308
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,861
Whatever, are you sure he got them?

309
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:15,936
- Did you track the package?
- I tracked them.

310
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:18,272
I tracked them.
He definitely got them. Jeez.

311
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:20,322
Let's just focus
on something else, guys.

312
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,491
Like what?

313
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:24,362
Turtle's got a girlfriend.

314
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:25,988
No.
Who is she?

315
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,911
Jamie-Lynn Sigler

316
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:29,453
from <i>The Sopranos</i>.

317
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:30,582
Oh come on.

318
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,620
That's why you're my ma.

319
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,080
One day you're all
gonna believe in me.

320
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,443
Oh God!

321
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,580
- Ma, just relax.
- It's cute.

322
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:40,919
- It's a 212 number.
- Pick it up.

323
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:45,631
- Hey, Eric, what's up?
- Hey, Gus. Did you get the stuff?

324
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,093
I did. I really liked it. Is there
a way to talk to Vince about it?

325
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,675
Yeah. He's right here.

326
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,192
- Put it on speaker.
- Ma, just chill.

327
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,167
Hey, Gus.
How you doing?

328
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,804
Hey, Vince, I'm really glad your crazy
manager got you back on our radar.

329
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,734
- Oh yeah?
- He's a pushy one.

330
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:05,497
Yeah, he is.

331
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:08,579
Anyway, I watched your stuff
and I really thought it was great.

332
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,333
You're definitely growing
and definitely have something.

333
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,077
Just not for this movie.

334
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,559
Yeah, no.
I understand.

335
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,265
But we should work together
in the future. I mean that.

336
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:21,927
Thank you.
Bye.

337
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,118
- What did he say?
- He said...

338
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,545
I'm on his radar
and we'll work together,

339
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:32,094
just not on this one.

340
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,497
All right. At least he appreciates
how good you are.

341
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:38,411
That's cool.
You'll get the next one.

342
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,558
Fuck!

343
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,634
Sorry.

344
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:43,442
Sorry, I--

345
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,562
I just need to go for a walk.

346
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,771
- I got it.
- I'll be back.

347
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,447
I really don't want to talk
about this right now.

348
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,459
We're gonna be all right.
We jut did a lead.

349
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,658
Things didn't go as we planned,
but its gonna be fine.

350
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,487
You sure?
You're always so fucking sure.

351
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,322
- How do you really know?
- I just do.

352
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:05,087
Yeah?
Just like you knew about this?

353
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,987
Ari told you no
and you kept pushing.

354
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:11,163
And now not only did you embarrass
yourself, you embarrassed me.

355
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,588
Embarrassed you?
Gus Van Sant likes you now.

356
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,211
You believe him?
Come on.

357
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,806
He won't even let me audition.

358
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,779
Who knows
if he even watched the footage?

359
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,306
No, this year we said-- we swore
we were gonna listen to Ari.

360
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,012
And guess what?
Again you didn't.

361
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,195
What am I supposed to do?
Do nothing and stand by

362
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,359
- and hope something magically appears?
- Maybe.

363
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,965
Since you've been my manager,

364
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,262
everything you've pushed for
has gotten me to this point.

365
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,615
Are you serious?
I've been the one working

366
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,895
for you to get you what you
want when no one else cared.

367
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,998
Maybe I needed someone
looking out for my career,

368
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,073
- not my personal interests.
- I was doing both.

369
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,701
Whatever it is you were doing
clearly isn't working

370
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,637
Two years ago I was starring in movies.
Now people won't even let me audition.

371
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,261
One person won't let you audition.

372
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:49,136
You have to stay positive,
You know that.

373
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,430
Are you serious?

374
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,444
I have done nothing
but stay positive.

375
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,673
I have listened to everything
you've wanted me to do.

376
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,378
And now I got a house
full of people

377
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:58,495
who can really see what
a failure I've turned into.

378
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,001
- Come on.
- No.

379
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,480
We said when we started this

380
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,861
is was gonna be about the business,
not the friendship.

381
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,356
It's time for a change.

382
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,999
You firing me?

383
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,204
The business isn't working, is it?

384
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,632
Whatever. I'm not gonna grovel.
Go find someone better.

385
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,153
'cause I can live with myself

386
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:17,526
knowing I busted my ass
and I gave everything I had to you.

387
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,244
I know you did.
But it wasn't enough.

388
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,748
Yeah, fuck you.

389
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:34,593
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Los Angeles international airport.</i>

390
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,472
Please make sure that all baggage
is not left unattended.

391
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:51,580
Drama's.

392
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,447
1I love it.
I love it.

393
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,924
Yo, E.
It's me again.

394
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:02,587
Look, I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

395
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,886
Nothing is more important
to me than that.

396
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,119
1Call me.

397
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:09,739
Are you wet?

398
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:13,173
I'm wet and your big cock
is in my mouth.

399
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,874
That's where my big cock
likes to be.

400
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,729
<i>Who are you talking to
like that in my house?</i>

401
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,796
Your father would roll over
in his grave.

402
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,684
I've got to call you back later.

403
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,467
Off the phone now!

404
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:26,885
God damn it!

405
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:31,474
- E, you're late.
- Everything's fine.

406
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,097
You're nervous.
You ready to go?

407
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:35,115
I'm psyched to blow
these network freaks away.

408
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,531
You gonna blow Jimmie Kimmel away?

409
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,908
- What do you mean?
- Just got his people.

410
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:42,789
They want you to do a little standup on
the show to plug the pilot. Cool?

411
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,433
Yeah, boy, it is. What?

412
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,123
All right, let's do this.

413
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,376
- You wanna get that?
- No.

414
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,476
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey hey.

415
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,004
- All right.
- You can just keep that. Thank you.

416
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,536
Okay, Lloyd,
get him on the phone now.

417
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,447
Jesus, is this what you call
a New York vacation?

418
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,040
Where's the glamour?
Where's the bitches?

419
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,326
- Look who's here.
- Welcome to Johnny Drama's.

420
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:25,329
This must be Ari.

421
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,122
Ari, Cara;
Cara, Ari.

422
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,755
I apologize. I was talking
about these bitches, not you.

423
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,353
Ari, let me get you a beer.

424
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,922
Just make it a quick one 'cause
I got a big meeting tomorrow.

425
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,965
Look at you. It's good to see you.
Nice of you to drop by.

426
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,426
Actually, I've got a little
bit of business as well.

427
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,053
Oh yeah?
What's going on?

428
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:42,805
It's right here.

429
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,180
- <i>You got him?</i>
- Indeed I do.

430
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,559
Here's Vinnie.

431
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,734
Hey, it's Marty Scorsese.

432
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,153
- Hi. Hello.
- <i>Yeah, listen,</i>

433
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,004
you got a minute to talk?

434
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:03,408
Yeah.
Indeed I do.

435
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,120
Look, Gus was kind enough
to send me some of the rushes

436
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,976
in that picture you were in about
the forest fires or whatever.

437
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,070
And I saw them
and I thought you were terrific.

438
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,230
I'd love to offer you
a part in my new picture.

439
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,373
Really?

440
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,797
It's a reimagining
of <i>The Great Gatsby,</i>

441
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:20,023
modern day set in
the upper west side of New York.

442
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,698
And I think you'd be perfect
for Nick Carraway.

443
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:24,264
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

444
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,477
- Amazing.
- Great.

445
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:28,176
If you'd like to come in
and talk about the details...

446
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:30,387
See you soon then.

447
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,247
- Thank you.
- Bye.

448
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:37,842
I'm gonna be in a Scorsese movie.

449
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:41,822
Correction. You're gonna be
the lead in a fucking Scorsese film.

450
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,422
You talkin' to me?

451
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,121
That's my De Niro.
No good?

452
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,621
This is unreal!

453
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:50,278
Look at that.
Young love, huh?

454
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:52,711
And it shoot in New York as well,
if that helps.

455
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,862
Nice.

456
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:56,413
Thank you, Ari.

457
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,366
- Thank you.
- You know what? Don't thank me,

458
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:01,675
thank E. For once in his life
the little mcnugget delivered.

459
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:04,424
Where is the little freak anyway?

460
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:09,038
Look, it's not flashy, all right?

461
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:11,380
- But it rides nice.
- And it's practical.

462
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,538
- Still kind of cool.
- Very cool.

463
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,438
If the pilot gets picked up
I'm getting a porsche.

464
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,780
It will get picked up.
But wait till season two

465
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,319
gets the go ahead before
you get the porsche, okay?

466
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,900
- Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome, buddy.

467
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,040
Hey, Jane.
Any calls?

468
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,739
No, but there's a pretty package
waiting inside for you.

469
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,778
- You just gonna keep ignoring my calls?
- I wasn't ignoring them.

470
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:47,758
- I saw you through the window.
- Well, my phone is broken.

471
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,148
What are you doing here?

472
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:52,182
Well, since you wouldn't
answer the phone,

473
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:54,258
I flew in to apologize personally.

474
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:57,140
I appreciate that.

475
00:23:57,724 --> 00:23:59,257
I said some things--

476
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,903
I was really feeling awful about myself
and I took it out on you.

477
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:05,660
Do you accept my apology?

478
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,032
Yeah, I do.

479
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,125
Any chance you might
be my manager again?

480
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,303
I don't know about that, Vince.

481
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,180
I think maybe some
of the things you said were right.

482
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:18,910
I did fuck some things up and I guess
I got in Ari's way a little bit.

483
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:20,673
I'm okay with that now.

484
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:23,180
I got some things going on
and you will too.

485
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,194
I got something going on:

486
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,012
the lead in Scorsese's next movie.

487
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,848
What?
How?

488
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,725
Good management.
You in?

489
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:38,146
Come on, I don't want to do
this without my brother.

490
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:41,900
Yeah, I'm in.
Scorsese?

491
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:43,902
That's crazy.
Congratulations.

492
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,887
Thank god. That scene
was getting way to gay for my tastes.

493
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:48,806
We missed you, E.

494
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:51,906
How are you, man?

495
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:56,957
Let's go get wasted.

496
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,705
- Let's do it.
- I like it.

497
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,210
Where to, where to?

498
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:07,753
You guys ready for what's coming?
It's gonna be big.

499
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,371
I've been ready for a long time.

500
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,620
But don't worry.
I won't let it go to my head.

501
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,706
I just put you in a Scorsese movie.
I might let it go to mine.

502
