1
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:11,559
- So, how many times you call her?
- Once.

2
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,364
And she didn't call you back? Bitch.

3
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,693
Emily's not a bitch.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,769
I was calling you a bitch,
for thinking about calling her again.

5
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,234
That is very bitch-like.

6
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,474
You call a girl once, she don't call you back,
the relationship's over.

7
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,868
I was drunk.
I don't even remember what I said.

8
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:27,443
Maybe she never got the message.

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,979
- You drunk-dialed her?
- Still, no excuse.

10
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,139
- No more tequila for this guy.
- You're cut off.

11
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:35,480
- What is she so mad about, anyway?
- It's not that she's mad.

12
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:39,488
She feels like I'm putting her in
an uncomfortable situation with me and Ari.

13
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,649
You should've bluffed her, spun it around.

14
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,421
Let her think you're uncomfortable
with the situation.

15
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:48,521
First Kristen, then Emily.
Why do you let these girls get in your head?

16
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:52,432
The guys have a point.
You're getting a little soft in your old age.

17
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:55,096
It's Ari, finally. Ari, where are you?

18
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,707
<i>Right where I'm supposed to be.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

19
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,375
We're at Coffee Bean, like we said.

20
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,644
<i>No, we said Starbucks, Eric.</i>

21
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,715
<i>I distinctly remember,</i>
<i>because I fucked a counter girl here.</i>

22
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:09,013
Be careful crossing the street.
He's at Starbucks.

23
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,726
What, did you rob a bank?

24
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:20,695
I earned it. <i>Pacific Blue</i> residuals, baby.
We sold Malaysia.

25
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,397
- How much you got there, bro?
- Don't you worry about it.

26
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:26,295
So, what's with the face to face?

27
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:28,997
I just want you guys to know
that all of my attention...

28
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,574
is now focused on <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

29
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,275
That's nice.

30
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,709
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah. So, we have a deal or what?

31
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:39,146
- We got a deal pending.
- Pending what?

32
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,650
Pending a meeting with the director.

33
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,953
We gotta get approved by the director now?

34
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:47,717
No, we don't. It's like a meet and greet.
A blind date. Fifteen minutes.

35
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,453
You have a drink, you like each other,
you make a movie.

36
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,586
- Blind dates are my forte.
- There you go.

37
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:57,497
I'm heading up the coast with the missus.
Call me, tell me if you guys like each other.

38
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,430
- You did good, Ari.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,596
- Tell him, E.
- You did good, Ari.

40
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:04,003
We just had a moment. Did you feel that?

41
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:07,134
I think I'm gonna leave Mrs. Ari
and take you for the weekend.

42
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,438
Don't do that.

43
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,177
- So, who's the guy?
- Billy Walsh.

44
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:12,840
- Yeah?
- You heard of him?

45
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,283
Yeah, the guy won Sundance.
Film called <i>Daze.</i>

46
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:18,385
I read the guy financed his movie...

47
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,354
- by donating blood.
- How was it?

48
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,823
I didn't see that shit.
You know I don't like indies.

49
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:25,828
- I'm into the studio system.
- Ari says this guy's hot.

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,398
Everybody in town wants to work with him.
We got him.

51
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,864
He wants to work with Vince.

52
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,902
- You'll ask him about a part for me, right?
- And nothing else.

53
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,062
- Where's the meeting?
- Chateau.

54
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,235
- Arnold, come on, boy.
- You guys want to roll with?

55
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,105
The fuck else we got to do, player?

56
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:58,317
You guys hang here.
We'll be back in a little while.

57
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:01,125
Don't talk to us like we're adopted, bro.

58
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:16,245
Just leave it outside the door, asshole!

59
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,076
It's Vincent Chase.

60
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,342
- You Billy?
- No.

61
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:30,325
You guys see Billy around anywhere?

62
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,294
- You know Billy?
- Yeah, whatever.

63
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,592
All right.

64
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,534
Sorry, pal.

65
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:46,765
- You sure you're not Billy?
- Do I look like fucking Billy?

66
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,810
I don't think that's Billy.

67
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,893
My man, Vincent Chase.

68
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:14,598
Wick was right.
You're very fuckable in person.

69
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,838
You fucking laughing?
This guy's the best actor of his generation.

70
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,501
No bullshit.
He'll blow all your asses off the screen.

71
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,080
- Thank you.
- You guys are early.

72
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,342
Actually, no. We're right on time.

73
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,078
That might mean something to me
if I knew who you were.

74
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:32,053
- This is my buddy, Eric.
- You can call me E.

75
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:36,757
Is that your thing, being on time?
I won Sundance at 24.

76
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,556
What do you gotta say
about that kind of arrival?

77
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,426
- Congratulations.
- Cool.

78
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:45,432
I'm gonna get dressed.
You guys grab a cocktail or something.

79
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,763
I'll be right out.

80
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:51,474
He's a nice guy.

81
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:55,634
We're not here to make friends.
We're here to make a movie.

82
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:58,874
You know Howard Hughes
used to stay in this room back in the day.

83
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,075
Now Scorsese's doing the movie.

84
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:04,382
They offered it to Billy first,
but he turned it down.

85
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,581
He ain't gonna soft-soap nobody.

86
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,982
Billy's a genius, brother.
You're lucky to be working with him.

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,828
- You're an asshole!
- Shut up!

88
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,433
- Come on, let's get some coffee.
- Bye, baby.

89
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,599
Come on. I'm buying.

90
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,014
You ever jerk off
with a belt around your neck?

91
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,380
No. Should I?

92
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:42,018
Sounds interesting.

93
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:46,361
All right, forget that shit.
Check this out. Scandinavian twins.

94
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:49,398
For $1,500, they'll come over
and fuck us like we're Vince.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,161
I don't pay for pussy.

96
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:54,135
Since when?
It's like 50 rub and tugs with you.

97
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:57,002
Since I like walking around
with money in my pocket.

98
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:00,270
Come on, Drama,
you got that fat residual check.

99
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:02,271
They're just your type.

100
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,705
No means no.

101
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:09,241
Let me talk to him.
You're like a fucking bull in a china shop.

102
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,650
Thank you.

103
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:12,812
All right, one.

104
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,419
My agent.

105
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,990
Fucking prick wants me to do
a studio movie.

106
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,255
Yeah, mine, too.

107
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:22,764
I told him to go fuck himself.
I'm not in this for the money, Vince.

108
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,460
<i>Queens Boulevard</i>
is gonna be my <i>Mean Streets.</i>

109
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,596
- Kind of an ode to the way we grew up.
- You grew up in Queens?

110
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:32,732
Scarsdale, but my dad owned a Key Food
in Kew Gardens.

111
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:37,247
I bet you'd like to see Vince
do a big studio movie, E?

112
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:40,680
- Actually, no.
- He just wants me to do a good film.

113
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:45,821
Come on. There is no glory
in making a $5 million indie, E.

114
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,053
There is if it's a good one.

115
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:52,226
Ari said you had thoughts on the script,
things you might want to change.

116
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,194
- It's done.
- What did you do?

117
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,430
I made Vincent's character a man.

118
00:07:57,568 --> 00:08:01,004
See, he was a pussy.
That sensitive shit was putting me to sleep.

119
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:03,095
The stuff with the girlfriend
was pretty good.

120
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,606
No, it wasn't.

121
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,405
Vince, I want to shoot you long-lensed.

122
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:10,878
Give you size in the frame, power.

123
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:14,643
Like Redford in <i>Three Days of the Condor.</i>
McQueen in <i>Bullitt.</i>

124
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:17,385
You like <i>The Pope of Greenwich Village?</i>

125
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,148
It's one of my favorite films.

126
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:20,950
You should do a remake of that, Vince.

127
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:24,255
No. No one should ever remake that movie.
It was perfect.

128
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:27,023
You'd let them redo the <i>Mona Lisa,</i> E?

129
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:29,226
Anyway...

130
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,697
read it. Tell me what you think.

131
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:36,129
- All right.
- Call my cell. I'll be waiting.

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,500
- Great.
- Don't let the suit influence you.

133
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,577
Hey, man, I'm not a suit.

134
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,945
Yeah, man, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

135
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,210
- Toodle-loo.
- See you later.

136
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,955
I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.

137
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:55,285
I really digged your movie, man.

138
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:57,326
- It was great.
<i>- Gracie.</i>

139
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,528
Unbelievable.

140
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,060
- You must've found a glitch.
- So what?

141
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,896
So you're a little glitch bitch.

142
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,369
Blame the game makers.
Don't blame the player, hater.

143
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,461
Give me that control.

144
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:11,131
- Get off! Why are...
- This one sucks.

145
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,902
Who dates Scarlett Johansson?

146
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:16,369
Ryan Gosling? Actually, I don't know.

147
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,111
I love her.

148
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,910
Vince, we got a big problem here.

149
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,748
E., we have no problems. Life is good.

150
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,750
Do you know who dates
Scarlett Johansson?

151
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,687
- No.
- I think I'm in love with her.

152
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,758
Did you read this?

153
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,850
You know I like to get
your impressions first.

154
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,691
It's a disaster.
This guy Walsh is out of his fucking mind.

155
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:34,765
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

156
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,256
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

157
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,459
What?

158
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:41,468
He wasn't so nice to E.

159
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,737
- That's not it.
- This guy gets more opinionated every day.

160
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:48,140
Don't fuck this up, E.
I really want to do this.

161
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,338
The guy said the suit would be judgmental.

162
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:53,382
He's got a guy blowing you on Page 26!

163
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,312
Come on.

164
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,147
Seriously?

165
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,248
I better read it.

166
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:02,325
- I better read that shit, too.
- Who's blowing him?

167
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:06,387
I hope it's not the part of the bookie,
'cause I'm playing that.

168
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,531
That would be really awkward.

169
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:12,468
Look, Vince,
there's no shame in playing gay.

170
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,834
Look at Tom Hanks, <i>Philadelphia.</i>
The guy won an Oscar.

171
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,071
I'd take it in the ass on camera for an Oscar.

172
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:22,839
You'd take it in the ass
for a guest spot on <i>The Hughleys.</i>

173
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:24,436
That's not even on the air anymore.

174
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:27,142
I don't know about you,
but I don't want to see Vince...

175
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,447
running around Queens
with a silk shirt knotted at the bellybutton.

176
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:33,148
- You're really homophobic.
- No, I'm not.

177
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,088
If you were gay, okay, I'd accept that.
But you're not.

178
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,127
So why are you gonna pretend you are?

179
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:41,561
'Cause the guy's an actor, you fucking idiot.
That's what he does.

180
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:44,395
No, that's what you do,
you ass-fucked loser.

181
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,563
Keep it up, Turtle.

182
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,763
It's not about an Oscar
or the neighborhood.

183
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:50,601
If it's good, I'll do it.

184
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,107
I'm just not sure I understand
why it's in there.

185
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,805
It's in there 'cause Walsh is psychotic.
He's got to change the script back.

186
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,211
- So call him, E.
- I'm calling him.

187
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,253
Billy, it's E.

188
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah, Vince's guy.

189
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,821
Listen, we want to talk to you
about the script.

190
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,154
Hold on a second.

191
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,364
He's at Crazy Girls.
He wants us to come over right now.

192
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,833
- Sweet.
- Crazy Girls at noon?

193
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:21,733
Cancel that order, honey.

194
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,999
Crazy Girls has got a great buffet.

195
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,158
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,321
They got downgraded to a "B."

197
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,492
If these warm plates aren't heated up
to the right temperature...

198
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,660
they become hotbeds of bacteria.

199
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,769
Isn't that that girl from Cheetahs in Vegas?

200
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,400
Yeah, the one you cock blocked me for.

201
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,611
Please, she was so into me.

202
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:12,578
Don't cock block.

203
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:16,448
- I know you guys. How you been?
- I'm good.

204
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,723
This perv likes to beat off
with a belt around his neck.

205
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,764
This guy pays for pussy.

206
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,625
I see you guys haven't changed.

207
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,703
So, who wants a lap dance?

208
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:30,170
Sorry, baby. The money stays here.

209
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,220
What's the problem, E? You want a blonde?

210
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,312
I just wanted to talk about the script.

211
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:49,290
So talk about it.
You thought it was genius, right?

212
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,916
Not really, no.

213
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,392
No? What the fuck do you know?

214
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,857
Vince, I thought I told you
not to let the suit influence you.

215
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,798
Stop calling me a suit, all right?

216
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:01,666
I just liked the script better
the way it was, that's all.

217
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,170
What did you think, Vince?

218
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,606
I thought it was interesting.
I just didn't totally get it.

219
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,474
That's cool.
I was trying to be abstract, like Kurosawa.

220
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,276
- You ever seen a Kurosawa film?
- Yeah, I saw <i>Seven Samurai.</i>

221
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,113
I seen them all, Vince.
I'll send you a couple.

222
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:17,186
Cool.

223
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,222
You think the scene
where you're getting a blowjob from a guy...

224
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:22,154
makes you look like a fag, right?

225
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,362
You ever see <i>Midnight Cowboy?</i>
Does Voight look like a fag in that?

226
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,625
In that hat and those boots, he does.

227
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,501
My point is, I wanna make you look manly.

228
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,264
- Okay.
- But you gotta trust me.

229
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,377
Kristen.

230
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:43,606
Really?

231
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,342
Excuse me for a second. Sorry.

232
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,215
Ex-Mrs. Suit?

233
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,220
You could say that.

234
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,522
- Hello?
- So who's Emily?

235
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,524
What are you talking about?
How do you know Emily?

236
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,892
I got home and checked my messages
and heard you calling Emily.

237
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,624
<i>Can you turn the music down?</i>

238
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:06,395
I was drunk last night.
I must've dialed your number by accident.

239
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:10,064
You sure it wasn't your subconscious way
of trying to reach out to me?

240
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,237
You analyzing me right now?

241
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:16,243
I got the message and I tried not to call,
but I miss you.

242
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,006
Seriously?

243
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:21,473
Can we go out to dinner sometime this week
and talk about it?

244
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:22,609
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

245
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,552
I need $100.
This girl's gonna jerk me in the back.

246
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,622
No.

247
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:29,214
Drama won't lend me money
if it's for sexual acts.

248
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,055
Not now, Turtle. I'm on the phone.

249
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,425
You got glitter all over your face.

250
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,131
- Can I call you tonight?
<i>- All right.</i>

251
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:39,259
Bye.

252
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,305
What do you mean,
you committed to the guy?

253
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,810
I dig his vibe.
You don't have to get mad at me.

254
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:52,177
He is pretty cool.
He was throwing strippers $20s.

255
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:55,410
He's a pretentious prick.
You don't wanna make this movie with him.

256
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:58,009
You don't know artists.
You haven't hung out with many.

257
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:00,988
- Yeah, we're very sensitive.
- I know people, all right?

258
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:03,082
This guy is an egomaniac
and he's an asshole.

259
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,525
Vince, I'll respect
whatever decision you make...

260
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,120
but I'm still going for
that part of the bookie.

261
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,529
I thought I was making the decisions
around here.

262
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:12,898
Not ultimately. Enough of this.

263
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:17,236
Why don't you tell these guys
how you drunk-dialed Kristen, not Emily?

264
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,103
- You called Kristen?
- You idiot.

265
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,905
What's wrong with you?
Don't ever drunk-dial.

266
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:25,243
E., marry this girl or kill her.
We can't take this anymore.

267
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,548
- So, did you call the babysitter?
- I thought you did.

268
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:36,020
No, you were supposed to.
You're the one who likes to talk to her.

269
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:39,152
You think I have a thing for Olga?
This weekend is all us.

270
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,059
I'm good to go, baby.

271
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,863
Don't even think about answering that.

272
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,935
- Don't even...
- Just quick.

273
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:52,265
- Hello?
- We got a big problem.

274
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,933
Hold on a second.

275
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:55,904
Vince has got a problem.

276
00:15:56,012 --> 00:16:00,346
Baby, I took it an hour ago, okay?
I got 10 more minutes before it kicks in.

277
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,610
Just give me a second, honey. Baby.

278
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,147
Vince hated Walsh?

279
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,884
No, I hated him.
Vince doesn't know I'm doing this.

280
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,659
Behind the back. Slick, I'm aroused.
Go, baby, go.

281
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,560
- Have you met this guy?
<i>- Yeah, he's a pompous dickhead.</i>

282
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,996
Why didn't you say something?

283
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,933
You wanted me to deliver the movie.
That's what I did.

284
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,897
You got to get Walsh off.

285
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,966
So now you need my help?
So now you come to the master.

286
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:28,567
No, Vince needs you.
This guy's gonna ruin the film.

287
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:31,476
This meeting was not set up
so that Walsh could approve Vince.

288
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>It was set up so Vince could approve Walsh,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

289
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,478
He picks up the phone, the guy's done.

290
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,384
He won't do it, he likes him.
He digs his vibe.

291
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,648
<i>- Yeah? Has he seen his movie?</i>
- No.

292
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,885
<i>- Have you seen his movie?</i>
- No.

293
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:47,119
Do your fucking homework.
You've got a screening room. Use it.

294
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,959
<i>- Come on.</i>
- What, have you seen it?

295
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:53,525
No, I haven't. You think I'll stand in line
in the snow in Utah wearing a beanie?

296
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,728
<i>Maybe Vince will hate the movie, though.</i>

297
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,635
I gotta go.

298
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,943
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the pool.

299
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:08,506
- Come on.
- You said no business calls. We had a deal.

300
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:10,943
I'm ready to go here, all right?

301
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:12,487
It's like R. Kelly at recess.

302
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,786
Honey, what are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Baby!

303
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:19,895
Hello?

304
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:23,397
<i>The Advocate</i> just called to confirm a rumor
that in Vince's next movie...

305
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,627
he's gonna be jerking off some guy
in the subway.

306
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:29,262
No, Shauna, the guy is touching him.
And don't worry, he's not doing it.

307
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:32,705
Vince is on his way to becoming
a major sex symbol. Don't fuck this up.

308
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,471
<i>- Get him on screen with someone with tits.</i>
- Man!

309
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:40,742
When I was on <i>Kimmel,</i>
we said the name of the place...

310
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,182
the guy gave us the whole system
for nothing.

311
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:46,153
What do you mean, you were on <i>Kimmel?</i>
Is that "X"?

312
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:50,221
- No, it's a TV show.
- Do you have any "X"?

313
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:54,522
No, I don't have any "X."
Why don't you girls have a seat?

314
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,429
Even if this movie
is better than <i>The Godfather...</i>

315
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,561
you guys both tell Vince you hated it.
What is this?

316
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:04,706
That's Sierra and this is Portia.

317
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:09,411
We pulled them out of Crazy Girls, bro.
For free. How sweet is that?

318
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:10,740
Sweet.

319
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:14,347
Full house.

320
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,179
- Nice.
- I bet this movie's gonna kick ass.

321
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:24,525
- Positivity.
- All right, Turtle, fire it up.

322
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,040
Holy shit, that sucked!

323
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:17,910
- Fuck black and white.
- Reminds me of Godard.

324
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,311
So, what did you think?

325
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:23,310
What'd you think?

326
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,446
I knew you were gonna hate it.
You came into this with no other possibility.

327
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,548
I didn't hate it.

328
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,359
You didn't hate it?

329
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:35,124
You know, truthfully,
I think this guy's a complete jerk-off.

330
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,324
- It was amazing, right?
- He's a fucking genius.

331
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,766
Vince, you do this movie,
they're gonna burn down Queens Boulevard.

332
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,237
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Johnny, run down the list again.

333
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:48,676
Will Smith, <i>Six Degrees of Separation.</i>
Robin Williams, <i>Birdcage.</i>

334
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:54,076
Lucky Leo's gone gay two times:
<i>Basketball Diaries</i> and <i>Eclipse.</i>

335
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:58,078
So has Pacino in <i>Cruising</i>
and <i>Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

336
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,522
- Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man.</i>
<i>- Rain Man</i> was gay?

337
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,385
He wasn't gay, just retarded.

338
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,190
Either way, you play gay or retarded,
you win an Oscar.

339
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,298
Guys, give me a second.
I need some time to think.

340
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,927
What do you girls say
we take this party up to the hot tub?

341
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:16,795
I'm really not in the mood for that tonight.

342
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,108
- What's the matter? You don't feel good?
- I'm a little depressed.

343
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:25,145
I'm getting evicted.
I'm late on my rent again.

344
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,549
- How much is rent?
- $1,200.

345
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,819
I got your rent money right here.
Let's go swimming.

346
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:41,090
I thought you don't pay for sex.

347
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:43,688
I'm not paying for sex.
I'm paying her rent, jerk-off.

348
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,097
Yeah, right.

349
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,358
So?

350
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,904
I feel like he's gonna make a great movie.

351
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:52,474
So the only problem you have
is that one scene?

352
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,236
Yeah, one fucking scene.

353
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:01,643
- I can't believe I fell off the wagon.
- Come on, no regrets.

354
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:06,455
- Was she any good, at least?
- She was great. She's coming back tonight.

355
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:10,284
I'm gonna have to borrow some money
from Vince.

356
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,024
We're willing to respect
your vision of the movie.

357
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:16,587
But we want final cut on the scene.
It makes no sense to either of us.

358
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,532
But you shoot it,
and maybe you'll change our mind.

359
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:22,702
No. Sorry, no deal.

360
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:26,400
- Then Vince isn't doing it.
- Vincent, I make movies a certain way.

361
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:27,908
You made one movie.

362
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,310
Look, Vince, you're the star.

363
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:36,079
Wick will throw me off before he loses you,
so be it.

364
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,620
You're willing to throw
this whole movie away over one point?

365
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,155
Yes, suit.

366
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,286
That's how much I care about my vision.

367
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,022
Good luck with it, Vincent. Seriously.

368
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,500
All right, fuck it. I'll do it.

369
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,538
- You'll do it?
- I'll do it.

370
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,670
All right, do it. Don't fuck this up.

371
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:07,879
The guy blowing you...

372
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:11,112
I'm gonna play that part.
That way, you're in really good hands.

373
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,519
Don't worry,
I've got a pretty solid acting background.

374
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:23,860
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- I fucking had you, motherfucker!

375
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,297
Fucker!

376
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:28,859
- I don't get it.
- It was a joke. He was joking the whole time.

377
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:32,031
- What, the scene's not in the movie?
- No, it's not in the movie.

378
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,668
- It made no sense in the movie.
- I knew it, God damn it.

379
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:38,542
Good fucking scene, though.
I'm gonna use it somewhere else.

380
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,173
And it wasn't a joke, Vincent. It was a test.

381
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,309
I needed to make sure that you trusted me.

382
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,014
The only way this movie's gonna work
is if we trust each other.

383
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:48,613
Yeah, I agree.

384
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:51,284
But you know what?

385
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:54,189
Now there's a bigger problem.

386
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,858
- What's that?
- I can't trust you.

387
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,324
Come on.

388
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,062
No, you can give E. A hard time.
That's cool.

389
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,197
You think you're gonna fuck with me,
and I'm gonna sit back and do nothing?

390
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:09,176
You know what? Fuck you, motherfucker.
You're fired.

391
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,878
- I'm a good actor, aren't I?
- Fucking...

392
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,452
You fucking...

393
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:22,288
I'm so confused right now. What are you...

394
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,554
- A toast. I'll toast to that.
- Yo, Johnny, Turtle.

395
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:26,855
We're making a movie.

396
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:29,261
No, Vince. I'm putting my foot down.

397
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,196
Don't worry, the scene's gone.

398
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,598
- Yeah?
- He's been fucking with us.

399
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,064
Cheers, baby!

400
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,662
To Vince not getting a blowjob
from some dude.

401
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,139
Thank God.

402
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:46,544
- Billy, I gotta tell you, loved your movie.
- Yeah, you told me that already, man.

403
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:50,844
- Yeah, but this time I actually saw it.
- Did you actually love it?

404
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,519
Look, man, I just want to play the part
of the bookie.

405
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,922
I know I could do a really good job.

406
00:23:57,693 --> 00:24:01,129
A lying, conniving, two-faced prick.
You're perfect for it.

407
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,027
- Thanks.
- All right!

408
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:04,827
There it is!

409
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:09,793
Stand clear of the closing doors.
Next stop, <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

410
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,134
Cheers!
