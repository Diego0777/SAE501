1
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:07,385
Were you going to say goodbye?

2
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:10,985
Yeah, I was going to call you tonight.
I swear.

3
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,160
Should I come visit you in New York?

4
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,859
Can you? That'd be great.

5
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,993
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

6
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:28,137
I gotta go. The guys are waiting.

7
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:30,906
Give Philly a kiss for me.

8
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,608
I can't believe you remembered
my dog's name.

9
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,983
It's my favorite terrier.

10
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,285
Let's hit it.

11
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:47,121
E, remind me to call Charlotte, also.
She'll kill me if I don't say goodbye.

12
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,133
- You should call Jamie, too.
- I know.

13
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,930
Make a list so you don't forget anyone.

14
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,005
- That's what I do.
- That's a good idea.

15
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:55,073
- E, make me a list?
- Turtle, make a list.

16
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:56,971
You know Vince can't read my handwriting.

17
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,408
- God! You're useless.
- Says you.

18
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:02,072
- Did you cancel the newspapers?
- You gotta tell me first.

19
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,808
You gotta learn to anticipate, Turtle.

20
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,042
There's a chain of command.

21
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,346
I'm a soldier. I wait for orders.

22
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:08,681
He's right.

23
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,516
What happened to your delegation skills?

24
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:13,854
You had 10 waiters underneath you.
Can't you handle one little Turtle?

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,485
Instead of being an asshole,
you should be pissed at him.

26
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,325
My life is too good
to be worried about shit like this.

27
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:22,629
So where are we at
with Scarlett Johansson?

28
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:25,167
- Where are we at?
- Yes. Where are we at?

29
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,761
I told you to hook me up with her.

30
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,203
I told you I don't know her.

31
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,174
Find her. If I had your job,
it'd been done already.

32
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,608
Scarlett Jo?

33
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:36,546
I had a little
<i>Lost In Translation</i> moment myself...

34
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:39,117
when I was doing
that TNT movie <i>Summerfall.</i>

35
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:41,182
Isolated from the rest of the world...

36
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,484
just me and this little beauty,
Lauren Jennings.

37
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:46,590
They shot that movie in Pasadena.

38
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,182
Yeah, but I didn't have a car.

39
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,989
Back in the real world...

40
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,063
Vince, are we gonna throw
a going-away party?

41
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:53,825
Vince, we got to do something crazy.

42
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,424
Wahlberg spent $500,000 on his bash...

43
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,127
before he left for <i>The Italian Job.</i>

44
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:00,000
Wahlberg made $10 million for that movie.

45
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:02,472
Vince is making $60,000
before taxes and commissions.

46
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,702
I don't understand
why you couldn't get me more.

47
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,175
I don't make your deals, Vince.

48
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:08,109
Can I run with this party, Vince?

49
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,409
- E?
- I'm not running with it.

50
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,112
Run, Turtle. Run.

51
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:18,181
Who you gonna invite to the party, E?
Emily or Kristen?

52
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:22,828
I say invite them both. Let them duke it out
in a steel-cage match, winner takes all.

53
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,457
My money's on Kristen.
She'll knock the crap out of Emily.

54
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,726
I don't know. I saw Emily at Tae-Bo.

55
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,268
She was looking pretty feisty.
What do you think, E?

56
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,894
I think you guys are assholes.

57
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,495
Come on, man, it'd be hot.

58
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,970
I like cute little Emily.

59
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,100
- Then again, Kristen looks...
- Shut up, Drama.

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,177
Jesus.

61
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,678
Vince, who would you rather bang,
Kristen or Emily?

62
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:42,748
Don't answer that, Vince.

63
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,837
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,746
I kinda like them both.

65
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,216
E, you should feel good.

66
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,981
Movie star Vince Chase
would bang both your broads.

67
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:51,750
I do. I feel really blessed.

68
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:55,422
Three months in New York.
What's wrong with that, right?

69
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,891
It's not all it's cracked up to be, though.

70
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,592
Running errands, sitting on the set,
getting coffee? I'm not into it.

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,227
I put this fucking movie together.
I get treated like a glorified gofer.

72
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:09,534
You know, when I went to the reunion,
people would come up to me and say:

73
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,534
"So what are you doing?"
And I'd say, "I'm Vince's guy."

74
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,671
Are you here to talk about business?

75
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:17,916
No, I'm here to talk about us.

76
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,575
It's kinda the same thing, right?

77
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,449
No, not to me it isn't.
You know what your problem is?

78
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,647
No, but I have a feeling you do. So tell me.

79
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,691
You are addicted to Vince.

80
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:30,955
Great. More textbook psychobabble.
Come on, let's hear it.

81
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,894
When you're around him, you feel great.

82
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,193
But when you're not,
you go through withdrawal...

83
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:38,998
and you talk about quitting all the time.
Classic addiction symptoms.

84
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,969
So, what, this is all my fault?

85
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:44,140
No. I think you're both
fucked-up codependents.

86
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:47,040
What about us? What are we?

87
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,342
We're a couple.

88
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:51,980
Maybe we're not.

89
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,222
No, really, I'm just completely disgusted.

90
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,491
You call me and say we're going
to go to the game on the 21st.

91
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,592
I'm waiting for your phone call.
I call your office.

92
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:08,223
I don't get a call back.
Then I turn on the TV...

93
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,393
and I see you sitting next to Vin Diesel.

94
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,028
- So what the hell is that?
- I told Emily to call you.

95
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,131
She didn't call you. She fucked up.
My Blackberry was broken.

96
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,676
Wait a second, I called her, okay?

97
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,302
She gave you that message,
and you never called me back.

98
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,110
I was gonna go to the game with you.
I told Emily that we were gonna be late.

99
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:27,014
Okay? I went to go talk to Vin.

100
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,519
He's got an 18-wheeler with equipment
and going crazy.

101
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,919
They're making power shakes.

102
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,650
He's got the fucking crazy glasses on.

103
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:33,986
I don't know what's happening.

104
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,721
- I told Emily to call you.
- What language are you talking?

105
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,228
You thought... Is this an excuse?

106
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,493
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It's exactly what happened.

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,625
I still don't know. You're talking Chinese.

108
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,397
I'm not talking Chinese.

109
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,529
Larry, how you doing?
Good to see you, pal.

110
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,632
- Johnny Drama.
- Yeah. Remember me?

111
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,370
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Hey, Ari.

112
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,445
Hey.

113
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,239
- This whole thing?
- You like that?

114
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,247
- You don't like it?
- It's okay.

115
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,250
- How's the show going? Good?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,414
Any good parts in there?

117
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:08,093
- Maybe.
- That's great.

118
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,751
So, we will speak,
and I will take you to a game.

119
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:12,558
- Okay. All right.
- All right?

120
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,134
- Bye, Lar.
- Larry, let's talk.

121
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,464
Don't ever fucking harass a real client again.

122
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:20,834
I know the guy.

123
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,338
Ari! Come on.

124
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,539
There he is. Johnny!

125
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:29,073
Sorry I'm late.

126
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,615
- How you doing, you good?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,311
Why don't you come back to the office?

128
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,317
Just tell me the deal's done.

129
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,721
Basically, they don't have enough money
to pay for your flight.

130
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:41,053
Or your room.

131
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,286
Per diem?

132
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,158
I know you're excited about this movie.
It's a good little part.

133
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,859
But here's the thing.

134
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,166
I got you an audition
for a guest-starring role in a pilot.

135
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:57,134
- A pilot that's all but on the air.
- Yeah, what's it called?

136
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,507
<i>CSI: Minneapolis.</i>

137
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:00,969
Don Johnson...

138
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,241
playing William Peterson,
playing David Caruso...

139
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:04,543
playing the Gary Sinise role.

140
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,947
Sounds great.

141
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,612
It's like $10,000,
plus first-class airfare and expenses.

142
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,280
- To Minneapolis.
- No, it shoots in Vancouver.

143
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,053
Now, the dates conflict
with <i>Queens Boulevard...</i>

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,752
and there's no flexibility.

145
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,490
Shit. When it rains, it pours.

146
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,991
Do you think I got a shot at this?

147
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:24,569
You're Johnny Drama.

148
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,165
You always got a shot.

149
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,437
When I played that cokehead stoolie
on <i>Miami Vice...</i>

150
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,602
I remember right after a take,
Don Johnson said, "Nice job, kid."

151
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:37,307
- Or was it the black guy?
- What's the pay?

152
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,108
A lot more than <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

153
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,948
Plus first-class accommodations,
fat per diem.

154
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,315
That's a tough choice.

155
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,549
What are you saying? No, it's not.

156
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:49,992
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll put you up
in New York, and I'll double your per diem.

157
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,620
My baby brother's
not putting me up anywhere.

158
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,767
Come on, Drama. <i>New Jack City.</i>

159
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,562
Room service, escorts.

160
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,269
Everybody knows the best whores
in the country are in Vancouver.

161
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:05,070
- Vancouver ain't the country.
- You know what I'm saying, jackass.

162
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,111
There's no money to stay in a hotel, Turtle.

163
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,236
What?

164
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,542
I can't be bringing girls back
to my mom's house.

165
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,141
- The walls are paper thin.
- You ain't making them scream anyway.

166
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,482
What if I pay my own way?

167
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:19,247
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You gonna sell a kidney?

168
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:22,418
The going-away party.
We can charge $10 a head to get in.

169
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,429
- You wanna promote the going-away party?
- Interesting.

170
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:28,466
Come on, Vince, I'll make us a boatload
of money, all right?

171
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,296
You get 10% of the door...

172
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,461
and a prime table surrounded
by all the hotties in L.A.

173
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:36,735
- All you got to do is just smile.
- He doesn't need 10% of the door.

174
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,174
Yes, he does,
after you got him the shitty deal.

175
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,640
I told you, I didn't make his fucking deal.

176
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,476
Vince, override this guy.

177
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,653
E, come on. It's a party.

178
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:52,053
It'll make Turtle feel good about himself
if he earns a little cash.

179
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,091
Yes. It'll boost my self-esteem.

180
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:55,888
What do you say?

181
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,423
Yeah, whatever.

182
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,019
Knock it out, Turtle.

183
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:02,065
What's the movement
on Scarlett Johansson?

184
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,361
You know what, Vince? I'm not your pimp.

185
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:08,235
If you want Scarlett Johansson's number,
get it yourself.

186
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,399
What did I say?

187
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,274
Yo, mofos, check this out.

188
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:15,602
Ready?

189
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:21,910
Tobey Maguire's house.

190
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:24,521
Bang, Spidey!

191
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:32,021
What's better, Taggert or Taggert?

192
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,453
What?

193
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,694
Taggert or Taggert?

194
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:39,062
- The first one.
- Damn. Really?

195
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,001
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

196
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,198
No problem.

197
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:46,744
<i>Viking Quest,</i> right?

198
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,376
Yeah, that's me.

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,708
I knew it.

200
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,916
Do you think I can get a signed picture
for my wall?

201
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:56,245
- Yes.
- For an extra 1,000 invites.

202
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,551
Why not? For Torvald, anything.

203
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:09,896
Five minutes, that's all.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to her.

204
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,993
Then you can cross her off the list.

205
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,299
It never takes just five minutes with this girl.

206
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,600
Five minutes.

207
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,237
- Girls, what's happening?
- How you ladies doing?

208
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:21,710
Big party Saturday night.

209
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:24,180
Vince Chase is going out of town.
You gotta be there.

210
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,307
You might have heard.

211
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,645
Be there or be square.

212
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,719
How you ladies doing?

213
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,809
Off the hook.

214
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,287
$10, but if you give me your phone number,
it's $5.

215
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,881
It's gonna be a great party.
You don't wanna miss that.

216
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,524
Honey, how are ya?

217
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,930
- They call this work?
- God bless America!

218
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:53,409
I've never been with anyone
that can fuck this long.

219
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:55,104
I've been training for this movie.

220
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:58,012
It's gonna be a great fucking movie.

221
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,821
I've been sitting here for 45 minutes
while he's getting laid.

222
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:07,221
Then you're an idiot. You should leave.

223
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,419
- It's not Scarlett Johansson?
- No.

224
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,728
God, he's so disrespectful.

225
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,889
No. He's sick. He's codependent.

226
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,263
Why do you think
he never got his driver's license?

227
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,962
Fuck it. I'm leaving. Bullshit.

228
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,238
Yeah. Okay. Hold on.

229
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,766
Shauna, it's Richard again.

230
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,933
God!

231
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,775
Richard, you are
a spindly, weaselly, prick queen...

232
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,904
I swear, if you print that about Gary Busey...

233
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,847
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to ruin your fucking life.

234
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,384
- I'll see you back at the office, Christy.
- All right.

235
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,351
And stay on top of that douche bag.

236
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:37,513
Yeah.

237
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:40,892
Asshole.

238
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,756
What the fuck is this now?

239
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,021
God!

240
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,457
Shauna, I agree.

241
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:51,695
Bon voyage?

242
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:54,636
It sounds like you're shipping
a gay French couple off to sea.

243
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,071
I didn't know anything about it.

244
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,141
This is so low rent.

245
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,767
You could've used bonded paper
and an approved photo.

246
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,812
It looks like an audition for <i>American Idol.</i>

247
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:05,441
<i>Eric, you should know better.</i>
<i>Use your fucking directional!</i>

248
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,415
<i>God damn it! These people driving here.</i>

249
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,352
<i>Vincent doesn't need his name</i>
<i>associated with nightclub promoting.</i>

250
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,616
God forbid, there's a Happy Land fire
in there...

251
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,282
like that Great White concert
in Rhode Island...

252
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:16,588
we're fucked. Get your house in order, Eric.

253
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,955
Jesus.

254
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,757
Who says it's my house?

255
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:36,344
I just had Shauna rip me a new asshole.

256
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:39,041
You don't have to take shit from her.
She's a publicist.

257
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:43,884
Jerk-off, you plaster cheap crappy fliers
with Vince's picture all over town.

258
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,320
That wasn't cheap.

259
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:48,018
I paid half price, and it was still expensive.

260
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,650
So you go behind my fucking back?

261
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,456
I didn't go behind your back.

262
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,861
You wanted nothing to do with this.
I did it myself.

263
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,664
You were too busy getting Vince
to do a movie...

264
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,030
that's gonna leave us homeless.

265
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,831
This movie's gonna make Vince's career.

266
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,168
It better. Or else we're all fucked.

267
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,504
Maybe we're fucked anyway.

268
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,178
Come on, Turtle. Let's go get this thing.

269
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,541
Knock them dead there, Drama.
Good luck, buddy.

270
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,981
Thanks. Come on.

271
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,117
Look at you.

272
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,553
How you doing, baby?
I'm gonna nail this thing.

273
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:20,454
- Go get them, Johnny.
- All right.

274
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,691
What the fuck, E, you left me!

275
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,596
Luckily, look who I bumped into
driving down Wilshire.

276
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,291
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Janeen.

277
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,634
Janeen was sweet enough to give me a ride
after you ditched me.

278
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,435
Why did you do that to Vince, Eric?

279
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,368
Yeah, E, why?

280
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,503
Why?

281
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,006
Long story.

282
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,985
- You want a drink, babe?
- You got any juice boxes?

283
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,552
You should've seen him coming down
Wilshire Blvd. All alone.

284
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,286
He looked so cute.

285
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,288
Are you okay?

286
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,027
I'm a little shaken up. But I think I'll be okay.

287
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,860
I can't believe you're leaving.

288
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,629
I'm just going for a couple months.

289
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,159
Yeah?

290
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,115
Vince, we gotta be at Ari's in 20 minutes.

291
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,806
Can you cover for me?

292
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,953
- We're gonna have a Jacuz.
- We gotta go over these deal points.

293
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,589
Could you get me some more money
on that, please?

294
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:28,455
- What if they want you to sign something?
- Come on, E.

295
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,723
Who forges my signature better than you?
Shall we?

296
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,926
Be nice to Vince.

297
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,467
Yeah. Thanks.

298
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:41,264
Taggert! We meet again.

299
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:46,044
For you, maybe.
I always relish our encounters.

300
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,640
No, Taggert.
I'm afraid it's your time that's up!

301
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,388
I just crushed that.

302
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,499
Pizza boy's here.

303
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:14,439
Really?

304
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,465
Really.

305
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:25,805
What's wrong with her?

306
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:28,943
Ask my permission before you bang
one of my assistants.

307
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:31,186
- How'd you know that?
- 'Cause I know all.

308
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,655
I could've told you this would end badly.

309
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,793
I gotta fire her so you don't feel weird.

310
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,883
Don't fire her.

311
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,429
I'll just sexually harass her until she quits.

312
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:41,362
- Where's Vinny?
- He sent me.

313
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:45,098
As long as I'm here, I want to talk.

314
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:46,471
Yeah?

315
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,902
About management.

316
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:53,570
There you go, baby. All right!

317
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,839
Come here. Let's hug it out, you little bitch!
I love it.

318
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:59,746
Step aside and let a professional take over.
That's fantastic.

319
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,876
Let's call Jimmy Miller. Let's get leverage.

320
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,716
360, Handprint. Any one of these.

321
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,517
Ari, I'm talking about me.

322
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,292
I thought you already were his manager.
Because, believe me...

323
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:13,755
I would not put up with this much shit
from anyone who wasn't.

324
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,356
I know I am. But I want to do it for real.

325
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,002
I wanna have the conversation. Lock it in.

326
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,503
You come to me for advice?

327
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,301
I'm gonna fucking cry.
All right, here's what you do.

328
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,842
You deal with talent
the same way you deal with women.

329
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,434
You have to make them believe...

330
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,173
they need you more than you need them.

331
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,248
He doesn't need me much.

332
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,077
Of course not. You're fucking worthless.

333
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,175
I could get a million morons to do the job.

334
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,117
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

335
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,519
The point is that he is an insecure fuck...

336
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,888
like all beautiful but handed-everything-
on-a-silver platter people.

337
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,052
He doesn't trust anyone
in this world but you.

338
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,630
You've been born into royalty, baby.
You know that.

339
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,495
Now you just gotta be thankful
and wear the crown.

340
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:52,900
As much as I appreciate it,
I didn't come here to ask for your advice.

341
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:54,972
I came to ask for your support.

342
00:16:57,943 --> 00:16:59,740
- Do I have a choice? No, I don't.
- No.

343
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,808
You got 1,000%.

344
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:06,277
Here's a little indie script, $60,000.
Big payday.

345
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:07,510
- Thanks.
- This is great.

346
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,610
What's next?
You get a uniform and a mustache?

347
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:10,915
I don't have health insurance.

348
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,923
- But I bet you had it over at Quiznos.
- Sbarros.

349
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,493
- And I had a business card.
- There you go.

350
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,429
What am I supposed to say to Emily
when I walk out?

351
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,465
Pretend you're on the phone.
You're focused.

352
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,124
You can't talk to her.

353
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,860
Let's try to get that immediately if we can.

354
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,199
See you later.

355
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,204
Johnny Chase?

356
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,107
Represent, bro.

357
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,377
- Sheila, how are ya?
- Hi, good. How are you?

358
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:44,049
- Hello.
- There he is.

359
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,316
- Thanks for having me.
- How ya doing?

360
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,457
- You look familiar.
- You auditioned for me a couple years ago.

361
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,727
How did that go?

362
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,396
- You know.
- You can't work them all.

363
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,963
All right. Any notes, any thoughts,
anything I should know?

364
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,061
No, just give it a shot. We'll go from there.

365
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,140
I could do this a million different ways.

366
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:06,574
Why don't you try it just one way?
Make a choice and give it a shot.

367
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:07,872
Stick to it.

368
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,852
Hooga! One time, baby. Come on.

369
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,387
Taggert, we meet again.

370
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,799
And that's one time too many.

371
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,364
For you, maybe.

372
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,137
I always relish these moments.

373
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,900
Your time is up, Conlon.

374
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:37,502
No, Taggert.

375
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:42,175
I'm afraid it's your time that's up.

376
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,515
Come on, man.

377
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,076
A little respect. Yo, back there.

378
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,313
I'm acting here. A little respect?

379
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,118
I mean, please.

380
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:54,480
Important e-mail.

381
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,288
I've been working on this thing all day.
This is important.

382
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,657
John, don't let it throw you.

383
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,822
- Just ignore him.
- Focus.

384
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,423
Fuck that, man! Tell this guy to focus.

385
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:05,435
Johnny, thank you for coming in.

386
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:07,027
- Appreciate it.
- Bye.

387
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,672
- Great job.
- Thank you.

388
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,266
You know what? Fuck you!

389
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,110
Shit.

390
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,347
I don't know. I thought he was great.

391
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,114
Fuck TV!
Let's go to New York and make a movie!

392
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:28,215
- There you go, baby.
- Can I stay with your mother?

393
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,219
I remember.

394
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:33,027
Of course you can bring her.

395
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,524
Yeah?

396
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,170
Hopefully I'll see you in the Hamptons.

397
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,931
Labor Day. I can't wait. Bye.

398
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,109
I think that's the last one.

399
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,573
- So, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
- What?

400
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,719
We should go to dinner before the party.

401
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,582
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

402
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:58,952
Some stuff? What do you mean?
Sounds weird.

403
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,723
It's nothing weird.

404
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,587
E, you're not coming out of the closet,
are you?

405
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:07,622
'Cause you know I like long legs.

406
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,291
I want to talk to you
about being your manager.

407
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:11,835
As opposed to what?

408
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,999
As opposed to nothing,
which is what I am now.

409
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,335
Kristen's been fucking with your head again.

410
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:23,311
- No, she has not.
- Come on, E.

411
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,541
Admit it. You guys have a very
dysfunctional relationship.

412
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,347
Every time you come from her,
you sound like her.

413
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:32,389
- Maybe she should be my manager.
- All right, fuck dinner.

414
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,514
Relax, E.

415
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:37,319
I wanted to go to dinner
and talk about this stuff there.

416
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:38,953
You're making me talk about it here.

417
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,123
And it's just not going right. Fuck dinner.

418
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:44,599
Nothing's been said. Nobody said anything.

419
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,260
Nothing's been talked about.

420
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,101
You want to take me to dinner?
You wanna talk business?

421
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,937
You want to woo me? Wine and dine me.

422
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,234
All right.

423
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,511
Let me pack up some things. We'll talk.

424
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:07,116
- Who's buying?
- I'm buying.

425
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,049
With my credit card that I pay the bill on.

426
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,855
I'm doing this real. This is no bullshit.

427
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:13,294
Great. Now I know what I'm gonna order.

428
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,400
Lanie!

429
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:19,594
- Did I hear you're going out of town?
- I'm leaving tonight.

430
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:21,638
I can't believe
you didn't say goodbye to me.

431
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,934
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm saying goodbye now.

432
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,339
Listen.

433
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:27,536
You remember that
really good bottle of wine...

434
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:28,737
that I got here with Ridley?

435
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,281
- Yeah, '82 Margaux.
- Yeah, that's the one.

436
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,416
We're gonna have two of those.

437
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:36,044
You must be important.

438
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:38,580
We'll see.

439
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:41,759
Before l...

440
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,658
Can we hold off a couple seconds
before we get into business?

441
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,363
My boys just showed.

442
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,168
- What up, player?
- Yo!

443
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,098
I'm hungry.

444
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,334
You want this real.
This is how I did it with Ari.

445
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,379
- What are you gonna do for us?
- Yeah?

446
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,004
I've been doing this job for a year.

447
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,812
- I don't need to put up with this bullshit.
- E, you're really wooing me.

448
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,286
- E never was a real people person.
- That's gonna have to change...

449
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,516
if you want to be involved
in talent management.

450
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,786
Now, I'm pissed. What's your answer?

451
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,390
What's your sales pitch?

452
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:26,031
All right, Vince.

453
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,832
I picked your last movie.

454
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:30,698
I put you in this new movie. I know you.

455
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,469
I know your strengths.
I know your weaknesses.

456
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:37,176
- Yeah, you do have a few.
- Vince ain't got no weaknesses.

457
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:38,909
That's a double negative.

458
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,780
You just said he's got weaknesses.

459
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:43,376
I'm starting to see how this business works.

460
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,053
I feel like I'm starting
to learn how to work it.

461
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,385
How many times
have we heard that one, Vince?

462
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,483
Shut the fuck up, Turtle.

463
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:53,723
Vince, take your time.
Don't rush into anything.

464
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,927
You guys are right.
I gotta think about things.

465
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,768
- I like the way things are.
- I don't.

466
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:03,467
E, you know I don't like change.

467
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm not going to New York.

468
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,374
- Really?
- Really.

469
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,273
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

470
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:14,351
Fuck you, all right?
You asked me to move out here.

471
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,818
Don't forget that. Here you go, asshole.

472
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:19,989
You're still going
to the going-away party, right?

473
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:21,422
Shut up, Turtle.

474
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,959
I can't believe he's not coming.
How can he not come?

475
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,037
I knew this Kristen thing
was gonna backfire.

476
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,469
We should've made Emily work.
She was a career girl.

477
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:36,540
No.

478
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:40,633
He said Kristen had nothing to do with it.
It was his own stupid decision.

479
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,639
You made the stupid decision, bro.

480
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:46,648
- What?
- Yeah. You ain't that easy.

481
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:51,682
You think you're going to find someone
you like that could tolerate you 24l7?

482
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:53,983
I love you, bro. But I ain't doing it.

483
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:55,116
I could do it.

484
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,921
Yes. That's a good option.

485
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,334
Let's go party.

486
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,931
Fuck that! I'm not going in there.

487
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,873
- Come on. One beer.
- No. Come on.

488
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:16,344
Let's get blasted on the plane.
Just the three of us.

489
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:20,144
Fine by me. But I just gotta go in there first
and handle a little business.

490
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:27,315
- Is that Vincent Chase in there?
- No. Vince is inside.

491
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,289
He just called me. I gotta go see him now.

492
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:30,725
Come in, though.

493
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:35,259
Yo, let me use your phone.

494
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,168
Hello?

495
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:52,079
This is awkward.

496
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,549
I forgot my wallet.

497
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:56,877
Come on, Vince. Fuck you.

498
00:24:56,988 --> 00:24:59,513
Seriously, it's somewhere
on the coffee table.

499
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,023
<i>Come on. What do you say?</i>

500
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,559
<i>I'd get it myself,</i>
<i>but I gotta go all the way there...</i>

501
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:05,595
and all the way back. It just seems stupid.

502
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:07,392
What do you say? Come on.

503
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,766
Okay. I'll be there.

504
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:11,957
Thanks.

505
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:15,605
You're an asshole.

506
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:21,243
Excuse me, guys. Sorry. Have a good night.

507
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,047
You two, go get some drinks in there.
It's crazy.

508
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:30,854
- Cha-ching!
- Yeah.

509
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:34,319
My mother would rather be dead
than have you stay with us.

510
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,085
Sweet.

511
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:31,706
Only a real asshole would spend $30,000
on a flight...

512
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:33,807
when the whole job's
only paying him $60,000.

513
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,249
It's worth it.

514
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,480
How else are we gonna bring
the Sherpa weed and the dog?

515
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,118
You're still an asshole.

516
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,854
- Here's your wallet.
- Thanks.

517
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:47,119
You're telling me
you're willing to fuck up our friendship...

518
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:50,694
'cause if this doesn't work out,
there's no turning back.

519
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,626
My best friend, I can't fire.

520
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:55,997
But my manager, he's replaceable.

521
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,428
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

522
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:04,873
Yeah, at 5% of me, I'd take that chance, too.

523
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,000
10%.

524
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,069
Plus health insurance.

525
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,969
Hello?

526
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:12,012
Who is that? Kristen? Let me talk to her.

527
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:13,549
I wanna settle this whole thing.

528
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,743
Hold on a second.

529
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:17,685
Thanks for calling me back,
I really appreciate it.

530
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:20,212
Hello?

531
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,418
Hi, Vince. It's Scarlett. Is this a bad time?

532
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:27,761
Scarlett! How are you?

533
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,461
Where are you?

534
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,498
I'm in New York, I just got in.

535
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:36,699
Really? I'm on my way
to New York right now.

536
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,608
You wanna grab a late dinner?

537
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,242
Let's make it an early breakfast.

538
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,509
I tell you what. I'll call you when I land.

539
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,312
Okay. Cool.

540
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,215
- Talk to you later.
- See you later.

541
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,781
- Nice.
- That's what I do.

542
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:57,458
Get on the plane.

543
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:59,055
What about my car?

544
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:01,961
Your car?
You want me to buy you a new car?

545
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,690
- No, I like my car.
- Get the fuck out of here.

546
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:05,769
Leave it.

547
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,067
I can't have my manager driving around
in a piece of shit like that.

548
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:13,338
You going somewhere?
