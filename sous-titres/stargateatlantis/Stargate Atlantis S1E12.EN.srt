1
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:20,682
- Ease up on the controls a little.
- I'm fine.

2
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:22,993
You're gonna snap the damn things off.

3
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:26,473
- I'm just seeing what this baby can do.
- "This baby"?

4
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,998
It's appropriate space-pilot parlance.

5
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:33,395
- Try to fly the baby in a straight line.
- I'm flying in a straight line.

6
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:41,999
- Not so much.
- Well, in space, all motion is relative.

7
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,918
You OK, Dr Gall?

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,880
I get motion sickness.

9
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,196
These have inertial dampeners.
You don't feel a thing.

10
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:59,116
I know we're moving.
That's enough for me.

11
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:05,478
Why'd you choose this guy
for the mission?

12
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,396
Brendan discovered
the Lagrangian Point satellite.

13
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:10,360
Elizabeth felt he should see it.

14
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,117
- Don't let go!
- Snapping doesn't help!

15
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:16,275
This is why parents
don't teach their kids how to drive.

16
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,355
I'm both insulted and touched by that.

17
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:24,314
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:43,757
- McKay.
- Yes, of course, please.

19
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,918
Holding station at 1,000 metres.

20
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,881
Half a mile away
and it's filling the windshield.

21
00:01:56,043 --> 00:02:00,673
This might be the single largest
weapons platform ever constructed.

22
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:03,198
The last line of defence before Atlantis.

23
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:06,958
Any chance it's still operational?
That would be very good.

24
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:10,838
- Any energy readings?
- Negative.

25
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:16,441
- So it's dead?
- It warrants closer scrutiny, but... yeah.

26
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,992
Knocked out
during the Ancients' last stand?

27
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:23,156
Or its power source is depleted.
We should still take a closer look.

28
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:27,714
Wait. I'm getting something
on the ultra-low frequency range.

29
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:34,996
Where's it coming from?

30
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:39,243
The planet.

31
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:41,394
It's a distress call.

32
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,918
A Wraith distress call.

33
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:58,232
<i>Wraith? In this solar system?</i>

34
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:00,439
I know. It's right in our backyard.

35
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:04,642
We figure the Ancients shot the ship down
in the final battle for Atlantis.

36
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:07,237
And it's still putting out a signal?

37
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:10,440
A very weak signal.
If any part of that ship is intact,

38
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:14,118
the wealth of knowledge
we could acquire is invaluable.

39
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,434
- What are you saying?
- We have to go and take a look.

40
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:22,631
You have to?
It took you almost 15 hours to get there.

41
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,556
All the more reason to look.
We're already here.

42
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,318
The planet's atmosphere
is extremely ionised.

43
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,236
Radio communication could be difficult.

44
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:36,157
<i>And it would take at least 15 hours</i>
<i>to send out any sort of rescue</i>.

45
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:39,042
- We'll be fine.
- <i>Major?</i>.

46
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:41,797
- I agree with McKay.
- Of course you do.

47
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:45,160
How could you resist exploring
a crashed alien spaceship?

48
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:48,793
- Exactly.
- Our interest is purely professional.

49
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:53,081
The intel we can gather from
their weapons system, codes, shields...

50
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,962
All right.
Proceed with extreme caution, please.

51
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:58,876
- Check in with me in three hours.
- Three hours?

52
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:02,001
Will do. Jumper One out.

53
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,952
- "Communication could be difficult."
- She said yes, didn't she?

54
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:14,479
- And no thanks to you.
- All right, knock it off, guys.

55
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:17,794
I've spent the last 15 hours
listening to you two.

56
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:24,154
Are we ready?

57
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:29,999
All right, let's remember where we parked.

58
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:37,755
- Why didn't we land next to the ship?
- A precaution.

59
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:40,960
The Wraith ship
crashed thousands of years ago.

60
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,921
- Automated defences.
- I never thought of that.

61
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,917
Brendan, we weren't all built for fieldwork.

62
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,679
Seriously, we're almost there, right?

63
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:54,834
What's that?

64
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:58,033
Some kind of a bug?

65
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:00,273
Space bug.

66
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,480
It's giving off
a pretty strong life-signs reading.

67
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:06,396
- I'm allergic to bee stings.
- It smells the food.

68
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:10,317
Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear.

69
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:15,034
Well, let's leave it be...
and it'll leave us be.

70
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,234
Guys...

71
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:41,116
- Have you seen one like this before?
- It's too small to be a hive ship.

72
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:44,912
It's been here a long time.
Maybe they discontinued that model.

73
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,713
Maybe, but whatever it is,
it took a hell of a hit.

74
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:53,353
Score one for the Ancient satellite.

75
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:59,756
There are skeletons down there.
I guess everyone didn't die in the crash.

76
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,756
- Any life signs?
- I think we can rule that out.

77
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,199
- Just a precaution.
- Fine.

78
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:16,002
- Us and the bugs. Nothing from the ship.
- Good. Let's go take a look.

79
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,317
Picking up faint power readings.

80
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,475
Something had to be powering
the distress beacon.

81
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,040
Come on, Abrams.

82
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,673
Maybe one of us should stay outside.

83
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:03,834
Look, I know how you feel,

84
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:07,712
but how many opportunities like this
are we gonna get?

85
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,798
- Looks like he just lay down and died.
- It's remarkably preserved.

86
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:48,038
Or it wasn't that long ago.
All right, Beckett'll want samples.

87
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:59,202
It is, uh...? Yeah.

88
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,394
OK...

89
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:14,081
- What the...?
- OK. This is different.

90
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:17,201
- Wraith cannibalism?
- Looks like it.

91
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:20,435
- They feed off each other?
- Probably as a last resort.

92
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,037
They tried to survive as long as possible.

93
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:28,323
- OK, that is incredibly disturbing.
- No kidding.

94
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,475
- You know, I wonder if there's...
- Guys!

95
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:51,513
They're bodies, human bodies.

96
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,871
They have chambers like this
on hive ships.

97
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:58,718
- I've never seen one so large before.
- I don't understand.

98
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:05,322
The Wraith cocoon humans, keep them in
suspended animation, so later they can...

99
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:08,043
I think we just figured out
what this ship is for.

100
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:12,515
A supply ship on its way to feed the Wraith
who were laying siege to Atlantis.

101
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:16,198
- That's terrifying.
- Gall, Abrams, check it out, but be careful.

102
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,433
- What? Wait.
- Where are you going?

103
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,992
To the bridge.
Maybe we can get some intel.

104
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,996
- You're leaving us?
- They're all dead.

105
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:27,200
- That's the problem!
- Just get a rough head count.

106
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:30,560
- We'll stay in radio contact.
- That could be difficult.

107
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:35,751
- This part of the ship seems shielded.
- Weir only gave us a few hours.

108
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:40,394
You wanted fieldwork. This is fieldwork.

109
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:00,714
Lieutenant, put a team on stand-by
for a rescue mission.

110
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,443
- Is the major all right?
- Everything's fine.

111
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:05,639
I'd just like to have a team ready.

112
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:09,591
- So, just in case?
- Yeah. Just in case.

113
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:12,914
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:22,638
I'm not picking up anything
in the EM spectrum.

115
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:27,240
I may need to rig up a secondary power
source to interface with their computer.

116
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,076
- I'm just thinking out loud.
- What?

117
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:33,076
How long could the Wraith
feed on all those humans?

118
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:36,394
They're capable of hibernating
for hundreds of years,

119
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,442
but 10,000 years ago was roughly
the dawn of human civilisation.

120
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:45,472
- So there's no chance that...?
- No. Are you kidding? Well... maybe.

121
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,911
- McKay.
- No.

122
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:55,077
No living thing could survive that long
under those conditions. It's ridiculous.

123
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,242
OK.

124
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:01,759
It would require an incredible
power source to sustain the humans

125
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:05,279
in suspended animation
almost the entire time.

126
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:09,436
- So it's possible?
- Oh, my God. It is possible.

127
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,392
We gotta get outta here.

128
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:18,237
<i>Gall, Abrams, this is Sheppard</i>.

129
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:21,433
Are you trying to scare me to death?

130
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,561
<i>I'm probably being overcautious,</i>
<i>but we should</i>...

131
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,556
We need to what?

132
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,793
Say again. Your radio's breaking up.

133
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:35,117
Fall back to our point of ingress.
We're headed back to the jumper.

134
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,763
I think we're getting outta here.

135
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:42,278
- What?
- I just saw something behind you.

136
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,911
We can't go that way.
Major, I saw something.

137
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,514
All right, stay put.
We're coming back to you.

138
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,797
Understood. There's nothing out here.

139
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:56,716
- You're freaking out on me.
- I saw something.

140
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:59,351
- Put that thing away.
- I know what I saw!

141
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,154
Oh, my God.

142
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:23,116
This way.

143
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:57,642
- He's dead.
- Where's Gall?

144
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,839
I don't know.

145
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:03,678
- Gall, this is Sheppard. Come in.
- It must have taken him.

146
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:09,435
You're right. They're on the move.

147
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:13,198
- What are you doing?
- Taking his weapons and his ammo.

148
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,957
- I already have a gun.
- Now you have two.

149
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,716
- You're not going after the Wraith?
- After Gall.

150
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,443
Then I plan on getting the hell outta here.

151
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,833
I swear there were no life signs.

152
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,882
They don't show up as life signs
when they're hibernating.

153
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,037
OK. Let's go.

154
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:59,242
Please!

155
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,282
- They're not even overdue.
- It doesn't matter.

156
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:16,994
Call it intuition, paranoia, or just a drill.
Either way, I want you to go now.

157
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:21,634
- If they are in trouble...
- Then every moment counts. Exactly.

158
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,600
- Who's your pilot?
- Markham.

159
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:27,961
- Good. He could use some practice.
- I have ordnance to fight a small war.

160
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:30,921
- Let's hope you don't have to.
- Yes, ma'am.

161
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,194
Let's move out.

162
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,592
- What's that?
- I don't know.

163
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:53,962
But I don't have the ordnance
I should have. I'll take any edge I can get.

164
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,318
What world are you from?

165
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,678
You're gonna kill me anyway.

166
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:07,436
You have come here by ship.

167
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,878
Where is it?

168
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,159
You're gonna kill me anyway.

169
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:18,802
But not all at once.

170
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,034
Agh!

171
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,078
OK.

172
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,440
Stay behind me.
Shoot only when I tell you to shoot.

173
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,474
- I'm sorry.
- Sh!

174
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,194
He's left the ship.

175
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,042
- It killed Abrams.
- We know.

176
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:18,321
It was so fast. It fed off me.

177
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:22,874
- You're gonna be all right.
- It was taking my life. I could feel it.

178
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,954
Listen to me. You're still here.

179
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,721
Can you move?

180
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:34,115
- Nothing below my shoulders.
- I'm sure the paralysis is just temporary.

181
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:38,481
I told him where we left the jumper.
He took my remote.

182
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:42,002
- He won't be able to fly it.
- Do we know that?

183
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:46,156
I'm sure the Wraith were the reason
the technology only works with the gene.

184
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:49,838
- He'll have our weapons, food and water.
- Who cares?

185
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:54,076
What if he can use our subspace radio
to signal his friends?

186
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:56,882
- He might do that.
- Not if I get there first.

187
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,874
- He's got a head start.
- I'm fast.

188
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:02,001
- Elizabeth will send a jumper...
- Stay with him.

189
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,358
No. Please don't leave us.

190
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:07,117
- We should stick together.
- He killed Abrams.

191
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,513
Just because we both made an error...

192
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't have time to argue about this!

193
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:17,195
Now, set your radio to channel two,
but don't use it till you hear from me.

194
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,593
Major! Major!

195
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,239
It's fine. Just...

196
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,712
OK.

197
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:06,722
- Anything?
- No.

198
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,477
Hopefully there's just the one.

199
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,319
- You're not gonna let me die out here?
- Don't be ridiculous.

200
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,043
You know, 'cause people would talk.

201
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:19,671
- And why would they do that?
- It's obvious.

202
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:24,121
You're afraid I'll outshine you.
My mind. My youth.

203
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:31,518
- How much did he take?
- You look fine.

204
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:35,676
That's what they do, isn't it?
They take years off your life.

205
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,152
I look old, don't I?

206
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,120
You look older, yes.

207
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:45,196
- Show me.
- There's no point in doing this.

208
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:48,321
Rodney, show me.

209
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,038
Oh, my God!

210
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,162
I don't know how it works, Brendan.
Maybe you haven't really aged.

211
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:12,441
It's possible that in time you could
get better. You're still alive.

212
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:19,432
Can you move yet?

213
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:25,276
- I think I'm getting some feeling back.
- Well, there's something.

214
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:31,433
What? I'm just trying to help here.

215
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:35,835
You're the one who had to find
the stupid satellite.

216
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:41,714
- Agh! Don't make me laugh.
- You shouldn't laugh. It's not so good.

217
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,752
<i>They still haven't checked in</i>.

218
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:56,199
- Good thing we left when we did.
- Be careful, Lieutenant.

219
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:57,682
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:00,152
<i>Gall said radio was a problem</i>
<i>on the surface</i>.

221
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:03,554
<i>Hopefully the jumper's</i>
<i>subspace communications are just down</i>.

222
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,714
We'll do whatever we need to do.

223
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:10,638
You're on the other side of
the solar system. It's gonna be your call.

224
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,395
Yes, ma'am, it is.

225
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,833
<i>McKay</i>.

226
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:22,598
- Still here.
- Son of a bitch beat me to it. He's fast.

227
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:24,560
- <i>Then get back here</i>.
- Negative.

228
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,237
- <i>There's no point being there</i>.
- He's on my ship.

229
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:29,712
Are you Captain Kirk?
What good'll it do him?

230
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:35,799
Maybe he can hot-wire the damn thing.
I don't wanna take a chance.

231
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:43,996
Any idea how long the days are
on this planet?

232
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,642
<i>No. Why?</i>

233
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:49,716
I've got a feeling the nights
are pretty damn cold, sub-zero cold.

234
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:53,193
We're six hours overdue.
Assuming they waited an hour...

235
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,036
<i>It's gonna be dark</i>
<i>before a jumper can get here</i>.

236
00:22:56,203 --> 00:23:00,401
If we play the waiting game, the guy who's
been around for 10,000 years will win.

237
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:04,841
Anyone or anything capable of surviving
that long is a serious adversary.

238
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:08,712
Not if I get him out in the open.
He won't know about our weapons.

239
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:11,955
If all goes well,
I'll fly back and pick you up.

240
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:15,798
And if all doesn't go well?
Things haven't gone well thus far.

241
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:19,433
<i>You know, these guys do die</i>
<i>if you have enough firepower</i>.

242
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:23,562
- Well, eventually, yes, but...
- Try and stay positive.

243
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,556
How's Gall feeling?

244
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:29,999
- He can move his toes.
- See? Things are looking up.

245
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:50,836
<i>This is Major John Sheppard</i>.
<i>That's my ship you're messing with</i>.

246
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:53,233
<i>I'd like it back</i>.

247
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:56,520
- This ship is Lantian.
- Yes, it is.

248
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:58,514
They were on the verge of defeat.

249
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:01,277
You weren't around
for the end of the war. You lost.

250
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,718
- Impossible.
- <i>It's true</i>.

251
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,033
You're the last of your kind.

252
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:10,753
Their city was under siege.
Atlantis was all that remained.

253
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:13,073
Victory was inevitable.

254
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,076
<i>Well, you can see for yourself</i>
<i>my ship is Lantian</i>.

255
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:19,838
I'm living proof we're still around
but the Wraith are all gone.

256
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:23,040
No one's left but you.

257
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:27,636
What you say cannot be true.

258
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:33,116
Come down to your own ship
and see for yourself. I'll be waiting for you.

259
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:29,197
You cannot hope to defeat me!

260
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:46,077
There. What'd I tell you, huh?

261
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:48,757
Rodney, I don't feel so good.

262
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,201
Water. Probably need some water.

263
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,800
- <i>McKay</i>.
- Major, what's happening?

264
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:04,433
I thought you should know...
round one was a draw.

265
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:07,800
- I don't like the sound of that.
- <i>I took some fire</i>.

266
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:11,717
- Are you injured?
- That's what I mean by "I took some fire".

267
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:14,795
But I don't think it's too bad,

268
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,397
but my P-90's out of commission.

269
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:20,361
He found a nine mil,
figured out how to use it.

270
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:23,037
- The Wraith will heal itself.
- <i>No kidding</i>.

271
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:26,115
<i>I put at least 20 shots into him</i>.

272
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:30,834
I've seen Wraith go down and stay down
with far less. This guy's different.

273
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:34,200
The Wraith's ability to heal itself
may be proportional

274
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:39,153
to how recently the Wraith has fed,
and he's... fed pretty recently.

275
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,632
There's gotta be more to it than that.

276
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:45,682
- <i>Can Gall move his fingers yet?</i>
- Barely.

277
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:48,357
- Stick a gun in his hand.
- Major?

278
00:27:48,523 --> 00:27:51,481
<i>Just in case I don't make it back</i>.
<i>Sheppard out</i>.

279
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:55,318
That's comforting, huh? Right. Water.

280
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,759
Oh, crap!

281
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,961
- What the hell was that?
- <i>I almost blew myself up</i>.

282
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,239
- What?
- <i>Stay off the radio. I'm busy</i>.

283
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:34,998
Right. He's busy.

284
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:40,117
- You wanna go and help him, don't you?
- Me go up against a Wraith?

285
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:43,798
You do. I can tell. You've changed.

286
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:46,113
- You wanna get out there.
- Shut up.

287
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:50,481
Don't get me wrong. I'm impressed.
You want in the fight.

288
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:54,158
- The Rodney McKay I knew would never...
- We're staying here.

289
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,598
All right.

290
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:07,800
Take this, but don't shoot at anything
until I tell you to.

291
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,954
OK.

292
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,874
D'you want some of this?

293
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,998
OK, OK. That's enough.

294
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:40,037
- You're right. I should go out there.
- I said you wanted to.

295
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:45,913
- Because I should.
- No, you shouldn't.

296
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:50,235
But don't let me stop you. If you think
you can help the major by going...

297
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:53,839
- I can't leave you here.
- Yes, you can.

298
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:57,359
What difference does it make?
We know I'm not gonna make it.

299
00:32:57,523 --> 00:33:01,152
Stop being so dramatic.
You're getting stronger by the minute.

300
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:04,554
- I've never felt so weak.
- Then stop talking.

301
00:33:04,723 --> 00:33:07,237
I'm dying, Rodney. I can feel it.

302
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,122
- Stop it!
- I'm getting worse.

303
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:14,553
He left me with enough life
so you'd have to watch me die.

304
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:20,434
All you need is a good meal,
a pot of tea and to stop talking and...

305
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:24,038
Brendan!

306
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:27,437
I'm sorry.

307
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:31,152
- You said to stop talking.
- I'm sorry, I thought you'd...

308
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:33,791
Apologies.

309
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,954
Nice work.

310
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:03,994
Not now, guys.

311
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,397
We may be able
to make radio contact now, sir.

312
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:36,758
Major, this is Lieutenant Ford. Come in.

313
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:43,921
Major, we should be there inside an hour.
Please respond.

314
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,758
- Perhaps we are still too far away.
- Or they can't get a signal.

315
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:50,596
See if you can make this thing go faster.

316
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:54,119
Do you think I'm a fool, Major Sheppard?

317
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:57,161
There's nowhere for you to go
on this world.

318
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:01,521
When I feed upon you,
I will savour the taste of your defiance.

319
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,594
Hey, you. Over here.

320
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:06,561
<i>On the ground, the radio</i>.

321
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:13,959
The days on this planet are long,
but the nights are cold.

322
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:17,672
Sooner or later I will have you.

323
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:20,880
I can't hear you threatening
to suck the life out of me

324
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:23,193
till you hit the button on the radio.

325
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:59,352
- You hear that?
- No.

326
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:04,392
I thought I heard something.
Maybe there's another one hibernating.

327
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,554
No.

328
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:09,556
It's been too long.
The major could be in trouble,

329
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:12,283
and if he's in trouble, we're in trouble.

330
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:15,037
- Then go.
- Do you think you can move?

331
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:18,832
Not a chance. I'm not going anywhere.

332
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:22,234
OK. That's OK.

333
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:25,634
Go. Rodney, just go.

334
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,479
Save the day.

335
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:33,841
I wanna call him on the radio,
but I might give away his position.

336
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:37,313
What chance would we have
if Sheppard can't take him out?

337
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:39,838
I was hoping you'd be strong...

338
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,914
Oh, no.

339
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:01,314
You have got to be kidding me.

340
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:05,761
I have fed upon countless thousands
of humans and Lantians,

341
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,914
even upon my own crew,

342
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:12,281
and I will feed upon you
before this day is done.

343
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:21,432
- <i>Major, this is Lieutenant Ford</i>.
- Lieutenant, I like your timing.

344
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:24,993
- <i>Get your ass down here</i>.
- We're still two zero minutes away.

345
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:28,314
Your timing sucks.
Get here as soon as you can.

346
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:35,392
You need me to get off this planet.
I'm the only one who can fly that ship.

347
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:40,682
I will use your dead hands
to operate its controls.

348
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:15,362
- Major!
- McKay!

349
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:19,311
- What do I do now?
- Keep firing everything you got!

350
00:38:24,483 --> 00:38:26,951
OK, now what?

351
00:38:27,123 --> 00:38:29,921
Reload!

352
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:39,279
- We're picking up their life signs.
- Head straight for 'em.

353
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:42,435
<i>Sir, we're picking you up</i>
<i>on the HUD</i>.

354
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:54,632
No more bullets!

355
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:19,751
Ford, lock on to the biggest
life-sign signals you can see and fire.

356
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:23,472
- Negative, sir. You're too close!
- That's an order. Do it!

357
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:26,832
Fire on that target.

358
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:30,681
McKay, run!

359
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,199
McKay?

360
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,955
Still here!

361
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:00,762
<i>Sir, this is Ford. The target has gone</i>.

362
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:03,278
Well, it's about damn time.

363
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,593
We got here as soon as we could.

364
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:08,118
That's not what I meant. Thanks.

365
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,195
You're welcome, sir.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

366
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:13,752
<i>We can wait</i>.

367
00:40:30,603 --> 00:40:34,562
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You too.

368
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,477
- You OK?
- Other than this and a few cracked ribs.

369
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:47,074
What about Gall?

370
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,234
No.

371
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:07,880
You'll have to put the ship back together,
provided you can disarm the shield.

372
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:11,035
Fine. As long as we get to go home.

373
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:14,001
- You can drive.
- Oh, thank you.
