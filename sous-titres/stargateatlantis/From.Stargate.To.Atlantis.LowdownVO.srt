00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:03,570
Previously, on the last seven seasons of...

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,038
Seven ?

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,241
Geez, is that right ?

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,276
Seven years of Stargate ?

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,412
Shouldn't we get a cake or something ?

00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,707
Thank you all for this award

10
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,609
Two years in a row.

11
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,244
Two !

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,113
Can you believe it ? Can anybody believe it."

13
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,982
It's hard to turn on the TV and not see Stargate

14
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,685
Now, if you're anywhere in the United States or

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,555
Canada, North America, it's just always on.

16
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,924
I know worldwide it's a huge success.

17
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,159
I know the DVD's are selling like crazy.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,461
Hello Australia. I'm Amanda Tapping

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,398
Sorry... Cut !

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,366
Stargate's been on for a very, very long time.

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,736
It is a legend amongst scifi fans.

22
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,439
First thing I think you gotta get to have a hit show,

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,541
is someone like Richard Dean Anderson.

24
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,876
He's a hit.

25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,813
And then you surround him with a competent cast

26
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,984
of characters that have a chemistry with each other.

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,854
I'm really proud of the show. I think it's a great show,

28
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,990
and I would never have imagined that we would have had

29
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,825
enough juice to keep going this long.

30
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,362
A huge thankyou to the fans. Because of them, we're back.

31
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,202
Bottom line America.

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,608
Stargate SG1 is way better without Doctor Daniel Jackson"

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,280
True story. A few day's after that segment aired,

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,183
the people at Stargate contacted Pierre

35
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,886
and offered him a part on the show.

36
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:07,160
One thing that's made SG1 what it is,

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,731
is the fact that audiences have wanted to bring

38
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,433
hose characters into their living rooms every week,

39
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,170
for coming up on eight years now.

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,339
Stargate SG1 is a worldwide phenomenon,

41
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,442
but after seven years and a hundred and fifty plus episodes,

42
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,244
who can remember everything ?

43
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,280
Let's recap shall we ?

44
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,451
There was a portal that you could instantaneously

45
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,787
transport into another planet from.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,489
Where the series picks up,

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,524
Stargate is in the possession of the Air Force.

48
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,726
A team is put together, made up of

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,398
Colonel O'Neill, Captain Carter,
Doctor Jackson and Teal'c.

50
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>Clip from "The Lost City"</i>
- This?

51
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,832
At.

52
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,935
- That is at?
- You can stop.... that.

53
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,771
I'd purposefully made the character

54
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:55,108
a bit dense, but that's almost cheating for me.

55
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,011
<i>Clip from "Chimera"</i>
- Most of the guys I have
dated recently, have died.

56
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,913
So much has happened to this woman.

57
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,450
Most recently, she's got herself a fella,

58
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,853
for the first time in seven years.

59
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,455
It's quite funny for me as an actor

60
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,592
to look back on.
Season one basically, he was a mute,

61
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,627
and now this year

62
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:18,198
it's just like, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak !
It's like he has a talk show or something.

63
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:23,737
<i>Clip from "Orpheus"</i>
- Colonel O'Neill has officially informed me
that...I have my..."Mojo" back.

64
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,245
Over the course,
they've had over a hundred adventures.

65
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,313
They've made a few enemies along the way.

66
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:39,653
There is the bad guys called the Goa'uld.
The Goa apostrophe, uld.

67
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,321
<i>Clip from "Chimera"</i>
- Now that is not normal.

68
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,157
The hooded characters all look like this.

69
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,226
"I am very evil!"

70
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:52,132
<i>Clip from "Ascension"</i>
- I just took this form now so that we could relate.
Actually, I used to look this way before my ascension.

71
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,835
A race of beings known as the Ancients,

72
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,437
which we've started to loosely find out about,

73
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,307
over the course of the eight years
that the show has been on the air,

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,011
created the Stargate.
"That's an excellent, excellent concept"

75
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,781
The Asgard are one of our allies.
They're grey aliens.

76
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,684
They're very powerful.
The Goa'uld were kind of afraid of them

77
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,287
for a little bit, and they
protected Earth for a long time.

78
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,822
"That's what us Asgard's do!"

79
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,628
Anubis attacks in all his ships

80
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,032
and Daniel Jackson who also is
an Ancient at the time, cos he ascended

81
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,267
was gonna stop him with his Ancient powers.

82
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,538
You could see it in the actual shot.
He throws his hands out at Anubis,

83
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,507
who's been kind of egging him on.

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,376
Oma Desala grabs Daniel Jackson

85
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,113
and takes all his clothes off and
throws him on this planet, naked.

86
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,949
If you're gonna come back,
come back naked.

87
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,485
But don't do it in parks in Surrey
in February in Canada,

88
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,322
because whatever was there,

89
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,823
gets smaller.

90
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,060
We left things in a lurch last year.

91
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,896
We did film something that could
have served as an ending.

92
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,466
We've been so many places.

93
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,936
Spent so much time with the franchise,

94
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,673
we wanted to be able to do it in
a more prepared way.

95
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,909
And we ended up during this year.

96
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,346
But hold on.
Stargate is spawning.

97
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,149
Stargate Atlantis is here,

98
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,353
and you're about to get a look at the new series,

99
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,154
the new cast,

100
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,156
and the new bad guys.

101
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:26,894
Huge set.

102
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,229
As you can tell.

103
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,366
Over there, we have one of the
biggest sound stages in the world.

104
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,136
The set's are just fantastic.
They're just great.

105
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,872
It helps me to paint a larger picture

106
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,208
of my world.

107
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,143
I've never been so excited in my entire life.

108
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,348
Generally any opportunity my character gets
to hit on someone in a scene,
generally I'm doing that.

109
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,251
The evil wraiths.

110
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,188
The evil wraiths. They're very scary.

111
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,491
They're essentially, life suckers.

112
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,228
I love what you do with those tentacles.

113
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:05,566
The race scared the "[BIP]" out of me,
"[BIP]" to be honest with you.

114
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:11,238
I'm Amanda Tapping, and you're getting
The Lowdown, from Stargate to Atlantis.

115
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,675
We've been travelling offworld through
the Stargate, for the past seven years.

116
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:53,847
Of course, after being together so long on the show,
the cast of SG1 have become much more than just co-workers.

117
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,315
We're a family.

118
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,985
A dysfunctional and eccentric one.

119
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,887
A cliche actually.

120
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,426
Things have happened. Things have changed.

121
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,695
Natural evolution of a show.

122
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,699
Now that we're into our eighth season,
something had to happen,

123
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,968
and they were so desperate,
they made me a General.

124
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:22,142
I think O'Neill as a General,
is actually kind of refreshing for Rick,

125
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,947
because he gets to experiment on things
he never did before, like sitting down.

126
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:36,156
He's much rather be out doing something,
than answering phones or dealing with paperwork.

127
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,526
Of course we play that up a lot in the early episodes.

128
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,431
He's not out there doing what he does.

129
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:50,437
Blowing up people and mouthing off,
and then mouthing off and blowing up people!

130
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:55,342
We said, no, he can blow up people by remote,
and mouth off to people by remote!

131
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,379
<i>Clip from Space Race</i>
"How many times have I told you,
Don't get caught by the bad guys."

132
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:06,019
We are after all the Air Force and will wield
those things, but I'm not preponent of guns, at all.

133
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,855
Quite the opposite.

134
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:13,694
There's the running joke about
shooting any one of the larger

135
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,395
pieces we have in there.

136
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,299
Everybody tends to get wood.
It may be balsam, but it's wood.

137
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:25,639
<i>Clip from "Grace"</i>
- Lately the dating scene has been a little stale
but then again I am marooned on a space ship!

138
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:31,245
Today, Carters on board a replicator ship,
getting tortured by Fifth.

139
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,214
The return of Fifth.

140
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,219
It's also torturous because
it's freezing cold in the studio today.

141
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,221
We saw our breath when we came in this morning.

142
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,225
We're having a heatwave outside,
but for some reason, it's freezing cold.

143
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:49,463
Which of course is the day that I,
Amanda, have to be on set half naked.

144
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,064
"We don't have much time to share"

145
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:56,336
Nudity's not one of my forte's, so all in all,
... a little tense.

146
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,705
<i>Clip from "New Order"</i>
- I never intended to abandon you.

147
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,208
You gained my trust, then you used me, and left me behind.

148
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,777
There's some good career things
that are gonna happen for Sam.

149
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,316
It's gonna give her a lot more responsibility.
We'll touch on how she handles that new responsibility.

150
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:14,121
You shall see. I shall see.
I haven't even read any scripts.

151
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,194
Pete the stalker. There's a lot of talk about that.

152
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:25,699
I have never gotten so much hate mail,
as in the months following the airing of that episode.

153
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,466
It was quite amazing.

154
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,571
There's a huge fan response.
Some very negative. Some quite positive.

155
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:37,678
A lot of the fans like it. A lot of the fans thought it was
great that you could see this other side of her that
you've never seen, and that she's not necessarily
comfortable with.

156
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,780
ou know, the flirty girly side of Sam.

157
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,248
<i>Clip from "Chimera"</i>
- This was romantic.

158
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,917
Watching a man dance around in the rain with an umbrella?

159
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,253
Just because there were no guns or car chases.

160
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,254
Or nudity.

161
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,258
Yeah, well your chances of that
are slim to none now.

162
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,495
I think there's real chemistry between him and Amanda.
The characters work together,

163
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,700
and sorry to say it, but you're gonna see
Pete Shanahan back for season eight.

164
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,637
Personally, I don't know what's gonna
happen with Pete, I have no idea.

165
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,308
A lot of people thought Pete was too much of a stalker.
I don't think he's a stalker. He's a cop

166
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,745
and he's used to investigating things,
and he really cares about her,

167
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,648
and wanted to find out what her secret was.

168
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:21,021
I don't know that much about Pete to be honest with you.
Apparently he's no threat to O'Neill.

169
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:35,002
You have to really consider yourself lucky to
have eight straight years of employment,

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,473
eight straight years of employment, on a show like this.
Eight straight years of working

171
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:45,379
for, and with people that really are concerned
about you, not just as an actor, but as a person.

172
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,481
Don't ... give me the eye brown.

173
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:53,820
He just had this beautiful, you know, massive head,
... hairless head.

174
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,323
And now he runs the risk of blending in.

175
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:00,727
Hopefully, before this is all said and done,
I will have hair. "(2003)"

176
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,933
You know at the beginning of those geo pet commercials,
when they take the seeds, and they just kind of

177
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:12,005
spread them over the top of the armadillo,
or whatever the heck it is, the dog or the puppy.

178
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,210
That's kind of where he's at right now.
He's at the seed spreading thing.

179
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:23,750
I think it's just a matter of time before Chia Teal'c
becomes a merchandise item and we start
to see that, that is gonna waft up.

180
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,955
The show has undergone a transition period.

181
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,925
So it didn't seem so outlandish now,
that Teal'c would have hair.

182
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:37,264
There are stories being written, that kind of deal
with him becoming more Earthlike.

183
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,366
The people of this town are behaving strangely...

184
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,536
Even for humans.

185
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,174
I know that he's also trimming all his body hair.

186
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,343
Which is nice, because that makes you look bigger.

187
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:54,848
What I like to do is use doll house furniture in my bedroom,
and I always find that, that makes me look gigantic.

188
00:11:54,882 --> 00:12:00,754
You know they are getting bigger "(Pecs)".
Because I'm getting older, and it's harder to be thin.

189
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:05,392
Actually, all it is, is that I'm the butt of more jokes now.

190
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,063
<i>Homecoming</i>
- That planet you guys found me on was nice.

191
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,399
People were simple, life was quiet.

192
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:17,871
That's quite a way to make an entrance.
I realise that I'm quite pale, actually, on film.

193
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,942
Anyway, I didn't get too many
offers after it aired, about...

194
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,444
any video's or special films to make, or anything,

195
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,015
so I'm assuming that it wasn't so bad,
but it wasn't so good either.

196
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,416
<i>Clip from "Lost City"</i>
- Come on! Tell them how deep you are.

197
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,752
You'll be lucky if you understand this.

198
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,756
My depth is not material to this conversation.

199
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:49,603
Daniel Jackson is a mystery wrapped in an enigma,
that kind of walks around in a circle, with a riddle.

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,806
<i>Clip from "Enemy Mine"</i>
- You found all this and you didn't contact me?

201
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,773
We were going to...

202
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,107
They've been moved.

203
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,445
Daniel... go to your happy place.

204
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,915
They're having a meeting about my
behaviour on set, right now.

205
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,951
A lot of people are invited.

206
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:09,723
It's just something I have to do every now and again,
because they get sick and tired of dealing with my crap.

207
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:20,901
Next, The Goa'uld, and other alien bad asses.

208
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:30,310
Throughout the history of Stargate, we've had to deal
with a lot of creepy destructive alien thugs and bugs.

209
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,713
But the studio executive's rarely visit us anymore.

210
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,283
Well in season eight, the bad guys are back,
and they're mad.

211
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,620
They're mad as hell,
because they don't have recurring roles.

212
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,827
The Goa'uld have been the bad guys since the movie.

213
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,698
I don't think anyone expected them to be such an
evergreen villain. Variations on a theme,

214
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:55,002
of an egotistical,
technology grabbing,

215
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:59,273
parasite thing, in some
slaves body, bad guy.

216
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:03,410
<i>Clip from Children Of The Gods</i>

217
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:10,250
We started to meet individual Goa'ulds.
The most... dastardley of which, was Apophis.

218
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:14,521
I've always liked Apophis,
maybe because he was my first.

219
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:18,125
So you hold a special place
in your heart for your first bad guy.

220
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:24,364
If you watch the movie, he talks like this.
That's my best imitation.

221
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:29,903
His eyes would glow, and he'd look over
his shoulder a lot. He'd go like this a lot.

222
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,872
<i>(Looks over shoulder)</i>

223
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:38,011
<i>Clip from Full Circle.</i>
"I know who you are, Daniel Jackson.
But you know not, who I am"

224
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:42,216
We've come up against an uber Goa'uld,
by the name of Anubis.

225
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,386
What he has done is, he has found a way to ascend.

226
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,825
The 101 begins with Goa'ulds. But Anubis,
that's where you begin your PHD in Goa'ulds.

227
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:55,896
Anubis is a whole new level of bad guy.

228
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,577
The guys who play the super soldiers, are two of
the biggest human beings on the face of the Earth.

229
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:17,050
But they are Anubis drones,
that have a very single minded purpose.

230
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:26,627
So it's always fun to see them,
because they can't really see that well,
out of the helmets.

231
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:31,064
So it's always an adventure to
see how certain scenes are gonna go.

232
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:35,035
Especially when it involves a lot of walking,
or a lot of movement with them.

233
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,604
<i>Clip from "Abyss"</i>
- Death will only offer a temporary escape.

234
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,941
I can revive you again and again...
a thousand times if need be.

235
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:46,547
Baal, who has a lovely goatee, great cheekbones, very
handsome. Could be an underwear model.

236
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,286
I like our little bit more sophisticated
villains. We have a villain called Baal.

237
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:02,029
Baal will figure heavily in the ultimate
fate of the Goa'uld.

238
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:07,968
You'll see him do a little bit of bragging.
A little bit of boasting.

239
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:12,105
Some threatening, and he may kill some people.

240
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:18,679
As far as Baal goes. I know he's based on an
Egyptian God. I just don't know the God of what.

241
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,282
The God of pouring acid into O'Neills shoulder.

242
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:31,525
We've also had some fun times playing villains
that have entered our characters bodies,

243
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,760
and taken over that. You expect this character to behave

244
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:39,032
in a certain way, so you try to follow
him and trust him. All of a sudden you see
that he's really out for himself.

245
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,434
<i>Clip from Absolute Power</i>

246
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:52,045
Daniel, in an episode called Absolute Power,
became a bad guy.

247
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,028
Along the way, we also created the replicators,

248
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:14,034
who began as bug creatures that make
more of each other, and replicate.
Hence the name.

249
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,105
They were originally not our enemy.

250
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:22,676
They were the enemy of one of our allies,
the Asgard, another alien race.

251
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,382
Replicators exist merely to increase their numbers and do so without prejudice.

252
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,051
They are no more evil that a virus.

253
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,053
A really evil virus.

254
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,156
Then they got scarier, when they
became human form replicators.

255
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,359
I hate them. I hate working with them.

256
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,631
But Fifth is going to prove to be
a very interesting bad guy.

257
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:49,937
Patrick Currie is a wonderful actor,
and a great guy. So we have a lot of fun.

258
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:54,808
He's so pretty.
He's the prettiest bad guy we have.

259
00:17:55,075 --> 00:18:00,347
My brothers and sisters, will devour
entire civilisations, in order to replicate.

260
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:05,485
The replicators are the bad guys.
Bad bugs.

261
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,989
On the other side, the best
character I've had to work with is...

262
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,993
who's the little guy, the little puppet?
Thor.

263
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,562
<i>Thor and Andy Mikita, have a chat.</i>
So how do you like this new ship ?

264
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:19,233
Well it smells like dog food.
But apart from that it's ok.

265
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,904
He is the franchise,
and actually, my pet.

266
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:27,774
Peter DeLuise did the voice of Loki, and
Michael Shanks offered us the voice of Thor.

267
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,577
So you know you've got guys
who can play, sort of, sly moments.

268
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,716
People didn't know it, for the longest time.

269
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:39,353
I kinda wanted it to be a big secret,
but they let the cat out of the bag.

270
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,755
Who's the favourite director so far,
that you've worked with ?

271
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,425
Ooh, that's a tough one... ahh....

272
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,130
Thanks a lot, after all I've done for you,
that's the kind of recognition I get.

273
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,300
Ok... You, it's you.
You're my favourite.

274
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,402
Ow !

275
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,337
Sorry, I never know my own strength.
Sorry.

276
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:00,841
That freakin' hurt.
I'm gonna call my attorney.

277
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:07,147
The Replicators will soon consume all that they can within our home galaxy. Yours will be next.

278
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,217
He's quite capable of doing his own voice.

279
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,021
But for some reason due to...

280
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:18,225
timing issues and issues of scheduling,
they can't actually get him to track his own stuff,

281
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,627
and I don't think he likes
to do any stuff in post.

282
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,098
I think he should just get off his high horse
and do his own voice, one of these days.
But he won't, so....

283
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,104
So you think the Goa'uld are bad ?

284
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,640
In the new scifi series,
Stargate Atlantis,

285
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,046
they've got some really nasty, evil aliens,
and here's your exclusive first look.

286
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:43,016
The bad guys ? I still haven't figured out,
who the hell they are.

287
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,555
They're strange, they're scary.
They're called the Wraith,

288
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:55,696
and they're part of a very strange
extra-terrestrial culture that feeds on lifeforms.

289
00:19:55,796 --> 00:20:02,469
They're essentially, life suckers.
They feed off of life energy.

290
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:06,974
They're the one's who ended up
virtually destroying the Ancient race,

291
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:07,474
so...

292
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,379
it's our job to just irritate
them as much as possible.

293
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:17,484
We've got a serious enemy, and we
piss em off pretty good, right from the start.

294
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,120
They happen to be in a dormant state.

295
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:24,825
And we actually,
like knocking over a beehive,

296
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:29,429
we've suddenly triggered off this
very dark entity in the universe,

297
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,568
so we're running for our lives,
most of the time.

298
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,938
They're terrifying.
I respect them.

299
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,973
I fear them,

300
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,111
and I hate them.

301
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:52,052
There's nothing worse than them,
you'll see.

302
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,188
They're crazy, they're scary.

303
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,124
<b>!!! PAS DE TRANSCRIPT !!!</b>

304
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,092
They're nuts,
I'm scared of them, that's it.

305
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,196
hey're really resiliant.
I've killed a number of them.

306
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,165
They all come back to life.

307
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,968
I guess that's scifi you know ?
They keep coming back to life.

308
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:09,937
I gotta get a bigger gun,
probably.

309
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:15,576
Next on the Lowdown, an exclusive
look at the new world of Atlantis.

310
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,821
Producing Stargate SG1 each week,
is like living in dog years.

311
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,691
For every season we do,
we age seven years.

312
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,694
So we're all actually 49 years
older than you might think.

313
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:37,364
Probably my only demand as,
I guess, the head of a show,

314
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,501
is just to make sure that
people enjoy coming to work.

315
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,436
So far they all seem to.

316
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,639
It's insane.
We're shooting all over the map.

317
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:50,744
It's weird because they're now in
stage six, which was one of our stages.

318
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,614
And so at any given time,
when you're standing inside the studio,

319
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:56,817
you see the red light flashing,
and not know which show is shooting.

320
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,853
I'm ok with longer hours,
because I have a TV in my office,

321
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:04,625
and I think, as we speak,
I'm having a toilet installed in my office,

322
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,661
right where my desk chair used to be.

323
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:16,403
The most exciting thing about being
able to produce a show like Stargate,

324
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:21,708
especially in season eight is, you're really
pushing the envelope on all kinds of filmmaking.

325
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:28,582
Mainly in the use of computer
generated effects and compositing.

326
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:32,186
Matte paintings, and just combining
all those elements together.

327
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:35,189
Create new worlds,
different worlds.

328
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:38,692
Unique, original, creative environments.

329
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:51,371
<i>Clip from "Hereos"</i>
- Close the iris...

330
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,373
Open the iris...

331
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,049
That's pretty much my job right there !

332
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:10,190
One of the first things we had to address,
was obviously replicating the look from the feature film.

333
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,160
we had to try to replicate
the look of the puddle.

334
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,796
It's a great device for a series,

335
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,932
because you instantly walk through this portal,

336
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,935
and be exposed to these various types of cultures.

337
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,805
Getting to that point was really interesting,

338
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:28,675
and that's just been an evolving process
and we've finally got something good there.

339
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:36,250
The next phase that we tried to make
strides in visual effects, was Thor.

340
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,090
This servo here is for the various blinks
but also a lot of different expression,

341
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:48,428
you know, widening the eyes, narrowing the eyes,
and that has to be co-ordinated at the same time.

342
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,567
The replicator shows that
we've done over the years,

343
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,236
have been nominated for Emmys

344
00:23:56,236 --> 00:24:00,073
and Gemini's and things, so that's been
really, really great, to be involved in.

345
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:07,181
It's just a great testing ground, to try
and realise those kind of futuristic visions.

346
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,024
It's so much fun, doing this show.

347
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,527
And especially because most of the time
I get a lot of the big two parters.

348
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:27,734
The rule when you get a big two parter, is that, every four
and a half seconds, something has to explode.

349
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:40,881
hat's sort of a rule that I made up,
but it's a good rule I think. It's one I try to stick by.

350
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:47,421
Adventure's important.
Going out into space is important.

351
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:50,657
Going out into space is important,
and ancient civilisations,

352
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,093
all that stuff is cool.

353
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:57,431
But if you don't care about the characters,
it's all meaningless.

354
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,735
You know, it's too bad I can't
show you a preview of season eight.

355
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,838
<i>Various clips from season eight.</i>
- He sacrificed himself to save us, all of us.

356
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,841
Thor, you're the only one
who can save Colonel O'Neill.

357
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,410
A Goa'uld wants to arrange a treaty with us?

358
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,513
Not just one Goa'uld. All of them.

359
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:28,295
This year, you're gonna get even more Stargate,
with the premiere of Stargate Atlantis.

360
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:32,699
I'm talking about a whole new galaxy,
a new world, and an awesome new look.

361
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:35,636
It's kind of like, new shoes, only better.

362
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:43,310
For Atlantis, we went up to this glacier,

363
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:47,681
and shot the opening title
sequence for the pilot.

364
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:52,553
And also the drone attack on
John Sheppard and Jack O'Neill.

365
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:56,857
I spent close to, I'd say,
6 1/2 to 7 hours in the...

366
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,429
...helicopter itself,
just riding around for the joy of it.

367
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:07,801
He had such a good time up there,
... and Joe Flanigan as well.

368
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:14,808
I actually have to admit that that's one
of the high points of the whole eight years.

369
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,711
Out with the old, in with the new.

370
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,813
Talk to me in eight years ?

371
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,017
Who's gonna complain about doing a
bunch of chopper scenes with Macgyver.

372
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,419
I love it.

373
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,824
"That was different"

374
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,193
"For me ?

375
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,195
Not so much"

376
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:45,906
Now look at this. You are watching the
entire set of Stargate Atlantis being built.

377
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:49,776
These people never took a break.
Except of course for a hockey game.

378
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,480
Finally we discovered the Lost City Of Atlantis,
but there's a few changes I wanted to make.

379
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:59,219
!!! PAS DE TRANSCRIPT !!!

380
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,290
The sets are just fantastic.
They're just great.

381
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:07,961
It helps me to paint a larger picture of my world,

382
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:12,299
and this is vastly different from where
I come from, Teyla comes from.

383
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:16,003
We're having loads of fun,
and they have done so much work.

384
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:20,007
It's a beautiful set, and we hope
that we can keep your interest,

385
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,943
after fabulous Stargate.

386
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,346
Hello, and welcome fellow space travellers.

387
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,986
I've snuck into the control room here, just to give you
guys a little basic rundown of the way things work here.

388
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,890
First off, you'll notice that all of
these panels are lit from below.

389
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,061
Some people think that's a lighting issue,
and that it makes these look more realistic.

390
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:43,363
More sort of scifi.

391
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:45,632
Actually, the reason they're lit like that,
is because,...

392
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,503
...I can place coffee on here and it will
remain warm throughout the scene.

393
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:51,572
This very high tech looking device.

394
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:55,609
Usually used to connect to the rest of the Atlantis city,

395
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,580
is actually a direct connection to
my manager and my agent.

396
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,618
When the obvious problems occur
with other cast members,

397
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:08,121
possibly a tuna sandwhich that may not be
tasting quite right. That sort of stuff.

398
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,524
This over here ?

399
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:17,264
This here actually, most people believe that this is
a 3D map of the Lost City of Atlantis.

400
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,498
Not so.

401
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:25,506
As it turns out, this is a beautifully
rendered 3D map of my Malibu home.

402
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,842
You'll notice that the bedroom
is the largest section in the centre,

403
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,212
and let me tell you, it gets a lot of action.

404
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:40,187
Atlantis is a really challenging project.
There's a lot of really challenging,
a lot of difficult things in it.

405
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,626
The main one is the city coming out of the water.
Water has always been difficult.

406
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:50,063
We know the water's gonna be difficult,
so let's just admit that.

407
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,900
But let's try and come up with the
coolest looking shots that we can.

408
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:57,838
We've decided to bring the city up at sunrise,
because it's difficult.

409
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:04,878
They needed to come up with an adversary,
... the Wraith, ...

410
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:09,383
who were sufficiently powerful, that
they could have defeated the Ancients.

411
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:13,320
But who are sufficiently stupid, that we
can outwit them on a week to week basis.

412
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:14,688
That's pretty tricky.

413
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:19,860
It comes out in the first episode,
that the Wraiths can project illusions.

414
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,829
Where you think you see them,
but they're not really there

415
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,467
They travel in these ships.

416
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:32,739
Here are some of the first charcoal sketches

417
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:37,377
of what we thought would be the
Wraith fighter craft, and the mother ship.

418
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:42,950
The mother ship is massive,
and it has landed on a planet.

419
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,519
It's been there long enough,
while they slept,

420
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:50,524
that trees have grown on the
actual ship itself, obscuring it.

421
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:53,227
So you don't realise what you're into until

422
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:56,864
you're right on their front doorstep,
and then of course, it's probably too late.

423
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,935
You want the real lowdown
on the new Stargate Atlantis ?

424
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:03,070
Stay tuned.

425
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,474
The best part about it is running around,
with large artillery pieces.

426
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,949
Stargate grows from SG1,
all the way to the Lost City of Atlantis.

427
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:19,786
Show creators Brad Wright and Robert Cooper,
tell us how easy that was.

428
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,124
The first thing you have to understand,
is that Brad has had several plans.

429
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,495
- There have been a lot of plans.
- I've planned.

430
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:35,169
Originally, it was more of a hand-off,
and now both worlds had to co-exist.

431
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,871
And not step on top of each other.

432
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:41,542
More importantly, we didn't want
to have a situation where

433
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:45,312
the solution in one universe,
would be "let's call the other guys!"

434
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:49,283
It made Robert and I think a little bit,
about what we originally had in mind for Atlantis.

435
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:53,887
To set Atlantis in
another galaxy entirely.

436
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:59,126
If this is not the lost city, then where is it?

437
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:05,832
The place that we find at the end of Lost City,
is not the Lost City of Atlantis,
but an outpost left behind,

438
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:10,270
when the city left Earth millions of years ago,
and flew off to the Pegasus galaxy.

439
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:16,109
Our specific mission is that we've essentially
found The Lost City Of Atlantis.

440
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:19,947
We have to tap into this Ancient City
and Ancient technology,

441
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,916
and stuff like that.
So we're here for quite a while.

442
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,386
What is "Atlantis" all about? What is the mission?

443
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,156
I dunno! I haven't read that one yet!

444
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:33,327
Atlantis is a one chance trip,

445
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:37,030
that Earth has,
to get into a new galaxy.

446
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:41,034
We have just enough power to get out there,
we do not have enough power to get back.

447
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:43,537
So we have found ourselves in a new galaxy,

448
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:49,743
in an unexplored city, and
it's a very international team.

449
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:54,047
The whole purpose of this is knowledge
and understanding humanity

450
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,083
on the widest scale available,

451
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,052
and how that will teach all of us individually
and everybody back on Earth,

452
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,889
more about ourselves.

453
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,324
I can't get into specifics,
or I'd have to kill you.

454
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,693
We should be wiping the slate clean,

455
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:13,400
and we should give our new heroes a chance
to deal with new problems and new enemies.

456
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,770
So putting them in this other galaxy,

457
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:19,439
really allowed us to say, ok,
we're starting from scratch.

458
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,042
These people are going on a brand new adventure.

459
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,879
Starting a new show with
a new cast can be really tricky.

460
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:28,815
Lucky for us, we have a group
of talented, dedicated actors,

461
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,451
who don't know what the meaning of serious is.

462
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,854
The character I play, is major John Sheppard.

463
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:36,390
There's a little bit of irreverance in this guy.

464
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,359
He's out to have fun, this is an adventure.

465
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,396
But he is somewhat reluctant to get involved in this.

466
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:46,300
<i>Clip from "Rising part 1"</i>
- I told Doctor Weir that, well, I'd think about it.

467
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,636
So? Well? What?!

468
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,942
At the beginning of our two hour pilot,
he's not the hero of this show.

469
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:58,979
<i>Clip from "Rising part 1"</i>
- You know, this isn't about you,
Sheppard, it's a lot bigger than that.

470
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:03,817
Right now, at this very second,
whether I decide to go on
this mission or not seems to be about me.

471
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:06,653
Over the course of the two hours,
he becomes the hero,

472
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:10,090
he really takes leadership
and takes ownership of the team.

473
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,658
<i>Clip from "Rising part 1"</i>
- Why did you become a pilot?

474
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:13,660
I think people who don't wanna fly are crazy.

475
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:17,497
And I think people who don't wanna go through
the Stargate are equally as whacked.

476
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:22,135
The best part about it is running around,
with incredible

477
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,840
special effects, ...
and large artillery pieces.

478
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:33,213
It makes up for something that's missing in my life.

479
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,083
I don't wanna talk about that.

480
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,822
Doctor Elizabeth Weir. She is an interesting choice,

481
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:46,760
as the head of Atlantis crew,
because she doesn't come from military at all.

482
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,430
She comes much more, from political
science, from human relations.

483
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:57,204
So she went from dealing with United Nations,
to aliens that we have communications with.

484
00:33:57,237 --> 00:34:02,676
So she's still a virgin with all of this,
and I think one of her strengths
is that she's aware of that.

485
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,313
I think she's a bit of
a hippy idealist in her heart,

486
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,383
for there to be just peace,
love and understanding.

487
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:13,887
This chair controls the most powerful weapons
in all of humankind. I'm afraid of the thing.

488
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:17,891
We put the civilian,
the person with the moral code,

489
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:21,895
in charge of the expedition,
and made the military guys subordinate to her.

490
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,732
<i>Clip from "Rising part 2"</i>
- It will totally undermine your leadership, so as ranking military officer, I ...

491
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:28,402
Alright, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, alright?

492
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:32,439
As a woman, if you are very,
very strong, you can be considered

493
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:36,043
a diva or a bitch.

494
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,245
<i>Clip from "48 Hours"</i>
- God, you're a jerk.

495
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:44,017
I wish I didn't find you so attractive.
I always had a real weakness for dumb blondes.

496
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,119
David Hewlett plays McKay.

497
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,023
He and I had this really interesting antagonistic
dynamic between our characters.

498
00:34:50,023 --> 00:34:56,363
He was in a couple of episodes.
Last we saw him on SG1, he'd been sent off to Russia.

499
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,101
Now even worse,
they've sent him to a completely new galaxy.

500
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:05,072
It's kind of sad, because she's got
this kind of horrible crush on me.

501
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:09,076
I'm trying to let her down easy.

502
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,516
I'm not even going to make any bones about it.
Carter is smarter than McKay.

503
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:19,186
It's not hard to be smarter than me.
My character has got the book learning,

504
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:22,556
but not the practical knowledge,
which is what is nice about the

505
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:27,294
Stargate Atlantis stuff.
Now he has to prove that not only has he got the smarts,

506
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:32,032
he's got the courage to back it up.
Which actually it doesn't in most cases.

507
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:35,802
<i>Clip from "Rising"</i>
- From what we've been able to ascertain, the city is powered by three zero-point modules.

508
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,805
Two are entirely depleted and the third is reaching maximum entropy.

509
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,642
When it does, it'll die too and nothing can reverse that.

510
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:45,179
All of the characters have a very good
sense of humor about themselves.

511
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:48,315
Except maybe my character,
who's just funny to laugh at.

512
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:55,022
Teyla, we encounter her in the Pegasus galaxy.

513
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:57,524
She's from a planet called Athos.

514
00:35:57,558 --> 00:36:00,494
And she is the leader of her people.

515
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,530
She's strong, she's intuitive,

516
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:08,035
she kind of has a second sense about her.
She is a great fighter,

517
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:11,538
a great warrior,
and a wonderful protector for people.

518
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,215
The Athusians are actually an interesting blend
of native and primitive, with technology.

519
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,518
<i>Clip from "Rising"</i>
- I am Teyla Emmagan, daughter of Turgan.

520
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:29,256
There is an immediate connection
between Teyla and Sheppard.

521
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,460
I don't think Teyla is one to
trust people easily, but

522
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:38,665
for some reason she immediately trusts
Sheppard.

523
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:47,508
Lt Ford is a young cat, but he's very adamant
about his position.

524
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:52,179
He's definitely the weapons expert and
the military force on the team.

525
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,549
Never lose your gun - it's always by your side -

526
00:36:55,582 --> 00:37:01,221
like a good woman, or a good man,
or a good dog, or a good goldfish.

527
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:04,324
He put himself on tape, and put it up on a site,

528
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:08,295
and we ended up looking
at his audition on a little mpeg file.

529
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:11,198
Robert and I are staring
at this tiny little screen going,

530
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,400
"this guy's really good. I love this guy."

531
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:18,906
He managed to make it back to the base and
was ordered to report to his commander. Instead,

532
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:22,910
he climbs in another bird and
went back for the Captain.

533
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:26,947
So when I came in here and
looked at the new Stargate,

534
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,751
I was like, oh my God !
What have I got myself into.

535
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,252
<i>Clip from "Rising"</i>
- What's it feel like?

536
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,922
Hurts like hell, sir.

537
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:36,890
You get the chance to play a guy who's

538
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:43,263
into guns, and he goes and he runs and someone says,
"Oh, there's a bad guy," and he goes, "I'll handle it."

539
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:44,531
I like being that guy.

540
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:49,203
Lt Ford is the man.
You'll learn to love him.
You'll love him before you learn.

541
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:54,842
Next on The Lowdown.
An exclusive look at Stargate Atlantis.

542
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,911
We do have clips to show, don't we?

543
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,613
I'll love it.

544
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:09,923
Ok, hopefully the TV system that blessed
Stargate SG1 with great global success,

545
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,726
ill do the same with
upcoming Stargate Atlantis.

546
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:15,696
This team has a new gate
and an all new mission.

547
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:21,435
I just wanted to be able to contribute in some way,
and help make the transition a little smoother,

548
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:26,773
as a credible, as a seed to start a new franchise.

549
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,677
Let's see what I have in here.
I have a cellphone.

550
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:35,349
I actually get reception in Atlantis,
which is amazing.

551
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,720
I'm gonna walk round going,
"Can you hear me now?"

552
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:44,157
Everybody on Stargate, it was such a joy
to work with them, because these people,

553
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:48,362
it's in their blood now.
They're just so comfortable with it.
Everyone from the actors to the crew.

554
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,931
So you walked in and you just felt safe.

555
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:55,002
They're being so welcoming and warm and funny.

556
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:57,271
That is an incredible gift.

557
00:38:57,271 --> 00:39:00,807
We just feel we have this big brother saying,
"It's ok. Come on."

558
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:05,112
Stargate's been on for a very, very long time.
It is a legend among scifi fans.

559
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:12,619
What's nice about Stargate Atlantis is,
that it's not a replacement to SG1,
it is a compliment to it.

560
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:17,558
Fantasy and scifi and what makes
that realm so exciting,

561
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,494
is that it's endlessly fascinating.

562
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:26,133
Anything could happen,
and everything is possible.

563
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:31,505
That is what is so exciting about Stargate and
what is so exciting about this show.

564
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,774
How do I like being on it ?
I love it !

565
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,978
I think...

566
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:43,116
that if there is a level of expectation for the
show to fill the shoes of something like SG1,

567
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:48,288
the producers are probably feeling
that responsibility, not me.

568
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,991
I'm having fun.
Let them worry.

569
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:57,731
<i>Clip from "Rising"</i>
- Me, I like Ferris Wheels, and college football,
anything that goes more than two hundred miles per hour.

570
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,900
Sir, that's not gonna mean anything to them.

571
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:03,070
Well feel free to speak up.
I'm just trying to break the ice.

572
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:04,505
Major John Sheppard.

573
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:08,575
We're gonna be working very closely,
being as I'm second in charge to him.

574
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:12,246
Shoot lot's of Wraith with him,
and get shot a couple of times.

575
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:16,783
Fall and say some scientific jargon
I don't know, and all sorts of bits.

576
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:25,259
<i>Clip from "Rising part 2"</i>
- So little fear. Is it valour? Or ignorance?

577
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:33,667
I think she'll be the one that most quickly
deciphers and translates and tries to be the bridge.

578
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,771
At this point I don't know any though.
Come back in a week.

579
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,107
I'll do a haiku in Wraith!

580
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:42,442
I get to be off Earth for a little while.

581
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,212
You know how troublesome Earth can be from time to time,

582
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:47,447
so it's nice to get a little escape.

583
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:53,954
We walk through a wormhole,
and all of a sudden we're in a completely different world,
different elements.

584
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:59,826
There's so much to anticipate and look forward to.
It's fun, it's colourful.

585
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,232
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Atlantis. Please remain seated until the puddlejumper's come to a complete stop.

586
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,168
Most of the time we get serious, our work seems harder.

587
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:12,506
I think these guys know what they want,
and they know how to do it.

588
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:16,910
That's nice, and once again,
I have no responsibility.

589
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:20,047
I'm Amanda Tapping, and as promised,

590
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,317
here's an exclusive look at the new Stargate Atlantis.

591
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:24,785
Only on Scifi.

592
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,422
Looks good doesn't it ?
