1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:10,391
They are called the Genii. They are simple
people, but good farmers and fair traders.

2
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:14,841
- They look friendly enough.
- I have often traded with Tyrus.

3
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,722
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

4
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:23,155
If people could just learn to keep
their secret underground hatches locked.

5
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,712
So, the whole farmer thing is just a front.

6
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:29,478
- The next culling was decades away.
- We're looking for allies.

7
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:33,477
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

8
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:36,715
- Do we have that much time, Sheppard?
- No.

9
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:39,113
How does a Wraith ship's computer
help you?

10
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:42,514
This interface device
shows the location of Wraith ships.

11
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:47,040
- You know where to deliver bombs.
- The Wraith must not know we were here.

12
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:48,602
- Help!
- Leave him!

13
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,401
Please!

14
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:56,917
- Where's my father?
- He did not survive.

15
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,802
By leaving him to die,
it's as if you killed him.

16
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:02,955
You do not want to make an enemy
of the Genii.

17
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:18,639
Haven't been to the mainland in a while.
How's everybody doing?

18
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:22,000
Halling believes the first crops
will have a good yield.

19
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,755
You still miss home?

20
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:26,483
There is still talk of returning,

21
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:30,477
even though the Wraith have scorched
Athos in revenge for our resistance.

22
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:35,239
Maybe in time this place
will begin to feel like home.

23
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:38,122
Do you see that?

24
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:43,479
That can't be a storm.
It stretches across the whole horizon.

25
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:45,998
I've never seen that from so high.

26
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:48,961
I've seen a lot from this altitude,
but not that.

27
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:56,035
This is Jumper One. We're changing
our heading to investigate a storm.

28
00:01:56,203 --> 00:02:00,162
Major, this is Weir. We didn't copy that.
You're breaking up.

29
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,518
<i>I said there's</i>...

30
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:05,880
..<i>weather forecasting</i>.

31
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,118
Did he just say weather forecasting?

32
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:25,353
- Do all storms look like this from above?
- No.

33
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:28,481
This must cover 20% of the planet.

34
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:33,763
- Is it headed towards the mainland?
- Tracking towards the settlement.

35
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,757
And after that?

36
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:41,754
Straight to Atlantis.

37
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:52,074
This planet
is basically the same size as Earth.

38
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:55,041
Hurricanes on Earth
never get as big as this boy

39
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,592
because once they hit the shore
they slow down.

40
00:03:57,763 --> 00:04:02,518
Without as much land mass to slow
it down here, it's gaining momentum.

41
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:05,481
- Both of them are.
- Both of them?

42
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,715
- We saw only one.
- It only looked like one.

43
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:13,718
According to the Ancient database, every
20 or 30 years the sea gets very warm.

44
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:18,320
That, for rather boring reasons, means
hurricanes are more likely to occur.

45
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:22,192
- Like El Niño, the ocean...
- Like I said, rather boring.

46
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:26,879
- Focus.
- If there are a bunch of hurricanes,

47
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:29,603
the likelihood of two colliding
is increased.

48
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:33,722
It's more like a merger. They are
intersecting and combining their power.

49
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:36,841
And... it's headed right towards us.

50
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:41,121
You said the Ancients experienced
these storms every 20 to 30 years.

51
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,513
Atlantis must have some precautions.

52
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:48,040
The Ancients were protected by the shield
or submerged deep enough in the water.

53
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:51,912
OK. Strike those options.
What else have we got?

54
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,554
Nothing. It is a real threat.
The high winds alone will wreak havoc.

55
00:04:56,723 --> 00:05:00,272
Come on, guys.
This city's been around for a long time.

56
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:02,081
Storm surge is inevitable.

57
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:08,239
By moving over a land mass before hitting
us, there is a greater risk of tornadoes.

58
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,439
This is Atlantis.

59
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:15,313
They've gotta be able
to handle that... right?

60
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,316
- No.
- Why not?

61
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,122
The people who built this city
had a force field

62
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:24,798
capable of holding back anything
nature or the Wraith threw at them.

63
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:28,558
Without that protection,
Atlantis is remarkably fragile.

64
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:32,193
Even our conservative calculations
project widespread damage.

65
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:37,437
- Flooding could sink the city.
- How could something this big just sink?

66
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:42,313
- The <i>Titanic</i>'s passengers asked that too.
- Yes, well, let's not.

67
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:47,961
What you're saying is
if Teyla and I hadn't discovered this...

68
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:52,275
We would be in even bigger trouble.

69
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:58,800
- What's the plan?
- We have 12 hours until the storm hits.

70
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:02,160
So... we plan to have a plan...

71
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:05,076
- Yeah.
- ..by then.

72
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:13,040
We start investigating evacuation plans,
both on the mainland and offworld.

73
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:16,991
McKay will come up with something.
He's setting himself up to be a hero.

74
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:21,042
Maybe Rodney is, but Dr Zelenka
seemed genuinely concerned.

75
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:25,116
So, I find a friendly planet that
wouldn't mind putting us up for the night?

76
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:28,559
Exactly. Take Ford,
see what you can work out.

77
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,678
I don't have the right boots for this.

78
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:42,721
I was just meant to come
and inoculate some wee babies.

79
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,522
We need all the hands we can spare
before it comes.

80
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:49,073
The storm could destroy our settlement
as well as our crops.

81
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:53,839
- If a few of us remained...
- Homes can be rebuilt. People can't.

82
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,313
Which is why we must do
what we can now.

83
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:15,235
The entire population of Atlantis.

84
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,837
At most, yes.

85
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:21,154
Only for a day. Two at most.

86
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:26,113
We are happy to trade with you
for a share of our crops, but this...

87
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:30,356
I know it's a lot to ask, but... I'm asking.

88
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,794
What do you offer in return?

89
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,523
I guess we'd owe you one.

90
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:40,471
- One what?
- A favour.

91
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,993
We're in trouble.
If you're a friend, you'll help.

92
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:48,631
If not, tell me now
so I can ask somebody else.

93
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:52,432
But who else would take in so many?

94
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:58,675
I want something of value in return.

95
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,038
Oh, you do, do you?

96
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:04,434
We can go find any uninhabited planet.

97
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:06,753
They're usually uninhabited for a reason.

98
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,756
You know that, or you would not be here.

99
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,996
Still, I'm sure you could find
another world to take you in.

100
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:16,836
You're just so short on time.

101
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:21,554
One day you're gonna run across
a problem and need our help.

102
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:25,880
- Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:30,639
And we've got lots of ships and weapons
we can help with.

104
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:37,598
- You're saying we can be your friends or...
- I much prefer friends.

105
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,993
That is of value to me.

106
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:48,392
One night. Two, tops.
We bring our own blankets.

107
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:55,994
- Very well. You may send your people.
- This won't be forgotten.

108
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,916
I'll go back, tell everybody the good news.

109
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:03,679
- We'll send word once we know more.
- I look forward to it.

110
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,671
- I thought of that.
- He may be on to something.

111
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:20,038
I've already thought of it. It doesn't...

112
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:23,400
The naquadah generators
could power sections of the city,

113
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,159
but some areas need to be secure, so
not much power is left for anything else.

114
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,520
- The city breaks apart...
- We could relocate some of them.

115
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,561
If only we had a magical tool
that could slow down time.

116
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:36,714
I left mine on Earth. What about you?

117
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:40,000
You're not pleasant
when you're like this, McKay.

118
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,279
- I'm always like this.
- Exactly.

119
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,913
I got a green light from Smeadon.

120
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,155
I'm not sure how pleased he'll be
if we get stuck there.

121
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:56,002
- It's not gonna happen, right?
- We can always gate off to another planet.

122
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,792
- Comforting. Thank you.
- You sure we can't go to the mainland?

123
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:04,161
Everywhere is in the storm's path.
My people are evacuating even now.

124
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:09,272
The mainland's the size of North America.
Will the entire continent get hit?

125
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,003
I'd rather not owe Smeadon any favours.

126
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:15,519
If we lose Atlantis,
we're left without access to the Stargate.

127
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:22,077
- McKay will come up with something.
- I will try, but I am not Superman.

128
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,999
Was anyone seriously thinking that?

129
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,994
- No, sir.
- Never.

130
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:35,554
Fine. The storm will affect over 70%
of the mainland, and Atlantis isn't safe.

131
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,681
If you want everyone to live,
you gate them offworld.

132
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,115
Relay Station Two,
prepare to receive transmission.

133
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:09,518
<i>RS Two</i>
<i>awaiting transmission. Over</i>.

134
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:13,437
I need you to relay a message
to Cowen of the Genii.

135
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:18,392
Tell him we have something to trade.

136
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,032
- This could be going faster.
- Our people are hunters.

137
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:31,435
Many are returning from great distances.
Others do not want to leave.

138
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:34,401
They know how serious this is?

139
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:38,602
Even I would have a hard time
believing in the strength of this storm

140
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,560
if I did not see it from space.

141
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,317
Do what you can to speed things up.

142
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,992
In the Czech Republic
we don't get hurricanes.

143
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:52,394
We don't get many in Canada.
We once had one called Hazel.

144
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,758
- Hazel?
- 40 years ago.

145
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,357
- That's interesting.
- Not really.

146
00:11:57,523 --> 00:12:01,596
- No, not really.
- I was once almost struck by lightning.

147
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,754
Lightning?

148
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:13,235
What is the one thing
keeping us from having a shield?

149
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,321
- That...
- Power. What does a storm have lots of?

150
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,917
- Power.
- In the form of...

151
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,280
- You wanna build a windmill?
- Electricity.

152
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:27,800
Atlantis is designed to withstand lightning
strikes. There are rods everywhere.

153
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,238
They are channelled
into grounding stations.

154
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:33,918
Those grounding stations
discharge electricity back into the ocean,

155
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,722
keeping Atlantis safe from electric shocks.

156
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:41,798
Many of the hallways allow a low-voltage
transfer of power throughout the city.

157
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,954
- Which means...
- I'm getting there.

158
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,637
Let's say the grounding stations
weren't around.

159
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,636
If lightning struck,
the halls would be super-charged.

160
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,193
- You want...
- If we disabled the grounding stations...

161
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,752
- Which we can.
- ..every time lightning struck,

162
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:59,313
Atlantis would experience
a massive power surge. That energy...

163
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,792
- If channelled correctly...
- Of course.

164
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,080
..could be used to charge up
the shield generator.

165
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,077
The more severe the storm, the more
energy, and the shield runs longer.

166
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,996
- It's an ingenious plan.
- I have to agree.

167
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:14,677
But we have no way
of storing all that energy.

168
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,959
Once the lightning stops striking...

169
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:20,160
- No way of charging the generator.
- Back to square one.

170
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:22,678
So, the city would survive?

171
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,401
- A 90% chance...
- 70.

172
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:26,838
- 80% chance.
- So, we should still evacuate.

173
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:29,392
- Not just for Zelemka's pessimism.
- Zelenka.

174
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:32,873
If it works, the city will be
highly charged with electricity.

175
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:36,956
The only safe place once the lightning
strikes is in the control room.

176
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:39,796
We must evacuate everyone offworld
for the storm

177
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:42,113
and execute the plan with a small team.

178
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,922
OK. Good. Get on it.

179
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,120
- To the grounding stations.
- Power distribution centres.

180
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:52,754
- Good point. I get ahead of myself.
- Yeah, OK...

181
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:23,918
Commander Kolya. Chief Cowen
needs to see you immediately.

182
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,554
- I'm not to be disturbed while training.
- He said immediately, sir.

183
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,553
- Still haven't turned up?
- I'm afraid not.

184
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:53,033
They're hunting.
No one has been able to get in touch.

185
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,081
- How many?
- Three. Two boys and a young woman.

186
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,359
Let's take our jumper and find them.

187
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:02,960
They are hunting in dense vegetation.
We would be unable to land.

188
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:09,237
- Jumper Three is ready to go...
- Go. I will give the hunters more time.

189
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:11,795
I'll stay with you.

190
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:17,039
OK, I get the point. We'll wait.

191
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:20,874
- They're not ready.
- Yes, they are.

192
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:24,399
You commissioned me to train men
who on the most treacherous day

193
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:28,317
guarded this facility
or performed a reconnaissance mission.

194
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,758
They are not yet a strike force.

195
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:34,517
This is the rarest of opportunities.

196
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:37,800
In the next hour
there will be under ten people on Atlantis,

197
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,238
most of them only scientists.

198
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:44,282
Surely you can accomplish our goals
and get out before the storm hits.

199
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:49,312
If all goes well. But we don't train
assuming all will go well.

200
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:52,475
We cannot afford
to pass up this opportunity.

201
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:56,955
- You wanted my opinion. I gave it to you.
- And I value that opinion.

202
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:04,793
The Atlanteans possess materials that are
vital to defeat the Wraith. We need them.

203
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:08,239
I need them.

204
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,234
Ready your strike force.

205
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,674
That's everybody.

206
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,641
Just over four and a half hours
till the storm hits.

207
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:41,794
Let's get down to the labs.

208
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:48,036
Evacuate the people on inbound
Jumper Two as soon as they come in.

209
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,594
I'm finally at the point
where I don't mind the taste of it.

210
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:06,474
I was raised on this brew.
Burned away whatever taste sense I had.

211
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:12,760
So, you think you can teach our farmers
a thing or two?

212
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:16,472
Yes, that's what I was saying, yes.

213
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:22,832
Most people think that farming is planting
good seed in well-tilled soil, which it is.

214
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:26,279
It is, but there's also more,

215
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:29,753
and that knowledge is here.

216
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:34,917
You want to trade these marvellous skills
in exchange for a piece of my land?

217
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:39,281
- I do.
- I think I'll need something more.

218
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:49,878
Who are you?

219
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,921
Tell me the sequence of numbers
to enter on this device.

220
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,722
I can't tell you that.

221
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,920
It's not worth dying for.

222
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,314
But you don't understand.

223
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:06,920
It's my hand that you need
to put in the code. That's how it works.

224
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,961
And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate
will be lowered?

225
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:14,162
Yes. What is this? Who are they?

226
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,791
- Bring him to the gate.
- They're friends.

227
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:20,638
- Make sure he will enter the code.
- He will.

228
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,273
Do as they say
and we'll see about that piece of land.

229
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:36,392
You have done a great service
for the Genii and will be rewarded.

230
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,560
There are hundreds of lightning rods
placed around the city.

231
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,315
- Wait.
- What?

232
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,281
- Why?
- Why what?

233
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:01,516
Why are there hundreds of rods? Wouldn't
the shield protect against lightning?

234
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:05,596
Yes, but running the shield all the time
is only good for draining power.

235
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:08,561
- Right.
- You're aware there's a time element?

236
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:14,480
- Yes, it's been brought to my attention.
- There are lightning rods around the city.

237
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:18,841
All the energy they capture is routed
into four main grounding stations.

238
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,642
These ground that energy
into the ocean below us.

239
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,318
- Instead of sending electricity to ground...
- We power the shield.

240
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:29,078
- How?
- By directing it into the shield generators.

241
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:32,553
- The city can handle that?
- Yes... theoretically.

242
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:37,001
Like dinosaurs turning into birds,
or Theory of Relativity theoretically?

243
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:40,153
What? Somewhere between.

244
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:45,636
Elizabeth, you take Grounding Station
Two. I'll take Grounding Station One.

245
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,873
Major, take Stations Three and Four.

246
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:51,558
- Where are Stations Three and Four?
- Here and here.

247
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:53,759
- And we are...
- Here. Yes.

248
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:57,518
I need to start on the subroutines
and Elizabeth has knee trouble...

249
00:20:57,683 --> 00:21:00,914
Wait. Are these things
even close to a transporter?

250
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,722
- Uh, yes, Elizabeth's is.
- And mine?

251
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:08,274
- It's a brisk walk away.
- By "brisk" you mean "far"?

252
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,116
- By "walk" I mean "run".
- OK.

253
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,592
Radio once you get to your first station.

254
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:16,835
All right. Let's do it.

255
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,992
Hurry! Move! Come this way! Hurry!

256
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:30,080
- You OK?
- Here it comes.

257
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:33,997
OK, sit here. Strap in as best you can.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

258
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:38,195
- Let's get outta here.
- I'm not certain it's a good idea.

259
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,322
- What?
- Look at it out there.

260
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,599
- We are ready.
- Let's wait it out.

261
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:48,517
We're safe if we're in here.
We've got rations and plenty of water.

262
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,322
Yeah, especially outside.

263
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:59,754
I hope you're right. We won't be able
to change our minds if you're wrong.

264
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,552
It'll be cosy.

265
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,474
I'm here!

266
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:39,238
<i>I told you to contact me</i>
<i>when you got to the first one</i>.

267
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,553
I am at the first one, Rodney.

268
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:44,715
Oh. Sorry. Already done mine.

269
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:48,000
- Great. Good for you.
- <i>Me too</i>.

270
00:22:48,923 --> 00:22:50,720
Good for everyone.

271
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:55,001
- Where are you now?
- I'm at the damn grounding station.

272
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:58,633
- No, not you.
- <i>I'm in the transporter</i>.

273
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:02,034
- There you are.
- There I am.

274
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,671
<i>Glad you're having fun</i>.
<i>What do I do?</i>

275
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,311
There should be a keypad on the console.

276
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:19,961
- Got it.
- Put in the Ancient equivalent of 031547.

277
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,993
That do it?

278
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:35,919
- Yeah.
- Good.

279
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,961
One to go. They seem to have
the same separation code.

280
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:42,160
Repeat with the next one.
Meet us in the control room.

281
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:44,712
Roger that.

282
00:23:46,803 --> 00:23:50,079
- Bacon.
- You wish you'd brought bacon with you?

283
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,916
It's the food
that makes other food worth eating.

284
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,472
You wish you'd brought bacon
to another galaxy?

285
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,440
You asked me...

286
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,596
- Offworld activation.
- No one should be back until tomorrow.

287
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:05,392
<i>Attack on Manara</i>.
<i>Wounded incoming. Lower the shield</i>.

288
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:09,272
- They're broadcasting an Athosian IDC.
- <i>Please, before it's too late</i>.

289
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:12,321
- We are lowering the shield.
- Get the OK from Dr Weir.

290
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,156
They're under attack. Lower the shield.

291
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,592
Dr Weir, there's been an attack on Manara.

292
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:23,676
- <i>Athosian party incoming with wounded</i>.
- We're on our way.

293
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:36,156
- What happened?
- They were everywhere.

294
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,479
Check the weapons.

295
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,353
Secure the room.

296
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:01,513
These men could have been overpowered.

297
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:04,516
We need the Atlanteans to be cooperative.

298
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,194
Secure the room.

299
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:11,958
Cover the entrances.

300
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,718
<i>Apparently</i>
<i>there's wounded incoming</i>.

301
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:33,159
It doesn't make any sense.
They said it was Wraith-related?

302
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,396
We'll ask them ourselves in a second.
Hold on.

303
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:39,599
What the hell is going on?

304
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,235
Dr Elizabeth Weir.

305
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:58,238
- Yes.
- And you must be Dr McKay.

306
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,840
That is him.

307
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:07,039
<i>Where is Major Sheppard?</i>

308
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,477
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>Major Sheppard's whereabouts</i>.

309
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:13,601
You seem to know a lot about us.

310
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:16,197
- Who are you?
- The Genii.

311
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,752
There's only one thing you need to know.

312
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:24,354
As of right now,
we are in control of Atlantis.

313
00:26:55,723 --> 00:27:00,956
Jumper Two, this is Sheppard. Come in.
Jumper Two, do you copy?

314
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:07,394
This is Ford.
We're waiting out the storm in the jumper.

315
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:10,873
- You're still on the mainland?
- <i>Yes, sir</i>.

316
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:15,002
We got a situation.
A small Genii strike force has gated in.

317
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:19,315
The Genii? The folks who wanted us
to build them an A-bomb?

318
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:23,556
They've got Weir and McKay hostage
and have control of the gate room.

319
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:27,352
- You're breaking up. Did you say hostage?
- Affirmative.

320
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,195
We're on our way.

321
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,082
- What do you think you're doing?
- You heard him.

322
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:41,235
Look outside, hotshot.
We're not flying through this.

323
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:44,952
McKay and Weir were taken hostage.
I can't sit here and do nothing.

324
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:50,436
Neither of us are real pilots. It was a bad
idea an hour ago. It's an idiotic one now.

325
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:55,438
- We must take our chances.
- Dr Beckett is right. We're no use dead.

326
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:59,152
Major, this is Teyla.
The hurricane is in full force outside.

327
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:02,838
<i>We could attempt to fly through it,</i>
<i>but it's doubtful we'd make it</i>.

328
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:05,597
And we have three young passengers.

329
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,436
- That's bad news.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:12,561
So am I. Just stay put till it passes over.

331
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,714
- Sir...
- <i>It's OK, Lieutenant</i>.

332
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:18,671
Get your ass back here as soon
as you can. I could use some backup.

333
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:22,562
Good luck, sir.

334
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:56,923
Who are you?

335
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:00,200
Commander Acastus Kolya of the Genii.

336
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:08,876
This Atlantis is extraordinary.
More than I ever imagined.

337
00:29:10,603 --> 00:29:13,163
What have you done
with the rest of my people?

338
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:15,917
I'm quite sure
they have no idea we're even here.

339
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,598
- Then they're safe?
- Yes.

340
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,993
How were you able to bypass the shield?

341
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:27,362
With a time-tested combination
of strong drink and weak minds.

342
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:31,232
There was a time when our two peoples
considered becoming allies.

343
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:35,159
Why are you doing this?

344
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:39,157
You're in possession of supplies
we vitally need.

345
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:43,998
Hand them over without difficulty
and we leave peacefully.

346
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:48,916
- Or?
- We're both intelligent people, Dr Weir.

347
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:54,918
I'm sure there's no need for me
to demonstrate the strength of my resolve.

348
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,802
Which supplies did you have in mind?

349
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,876
All of your stores of the C4 explosive.
All of your medical supplies.

350
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:06,002
The Wraith data device
you stole from my people.

351
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:08,154
And one of your ships.

352
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,996
- Is that all?
- No.

353
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:15,674
Where is Major Sheppard?

354
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:21,236
He's on the mainland.
What you're asking for is not easy.

355
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,475
We've diverted a lot of power
to prepare for the storm.

356
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:27,760
The armoury's safety doors have shut,
so we can't...

357
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:32,642
Just so we're clear, I know you lie.

358
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,154
Just give him what he needs.

359
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:43,794
<i>He needs the C4, the medical supplies</i>
<i>and the Wraith data device. Give it to him</i>.

360
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:47,080
<i>None of that's worth dying for</i>.

361
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:53,713
Step away from the console.

362
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:55,874
I was just leaning.

363
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,159
Your request is unreasonable.

364
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,919
You can't possibly need all our C4
or all our medical supplies.

365
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,961
You're in no position
to tell me what is reasonable.

366
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:09,638
How do we know you won't kill us
once we give you what we need?

367
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:11,998
You don't.

368
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:17,319
Please show my men where they can find
what they're looking for.

369
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:36,833
- What are you doing here?
- I understand I'm being held hostage.

370
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:41,281
I mean here in Atlantis.
Why did some of you stay behind?

371
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:45,959
Oh. Tie up some loose ends.

372
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:50,842
- Like what?
- Make sure everyone got out OK.

373
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:57,039
- Isn't that for someone less important?
- You'd think so, wouldn't you?

374
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:03,801
- You have a plan, don't you?
- I got lots of plans about lots of things.

375
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,477
I'm interested in your plan to save the city.

376
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:09,715
I never said anything
about saving anything.

377
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:12,238
Not yet.

378
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,958
Where's Teyla Emmagan?

379
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:51,482
- You know Teyla?
- Is she here? In the city?

380
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,554
No, she isn't.

381
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:03,835
You must be Sora. I read the Genii
mission report. I'm sorry about your father.

382
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:06,836
- He'll be avenged.
- Teyla didn't kill him.

383
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:10,313
- No. She left him to die.
- She had no choice...

384
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,792
Are you finished?

385
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:24,158
All of the information we downloaded
from the Wraith ship is still on this device.

386
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:06,519
- What did they do to you?
- I tried to keep my mouth shut. I couldn't...

387
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:10,073
What's the meaning of this?

388
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:13,952
- I honestly have no idea.
- It's a radio.

389
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:17,195
The arrow points to the talk button.

390
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:22,800
- This is Commander Kolya.
- Kolya. That's a hard name to pronounce.

391
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:27,753
Is that a first name?
My name's Major John Sheppard.

392
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:32,951
I have hidden the C4 where you will never,
I repeat, never, find it.

393
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:38,561
When I hear that the prisoners have been
safely released and gated off Atlantis,

394
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:41,032
<i>I will help you find it</i>.

395
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:45,037
- He's good.
- Yes, he is. I'd do what he says.

396
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:48,400
- Your offer is very generous, Major.
- Yes, it is.

397
00:34:48,563 --> 00:34:53,921
<i>However, Dr McKay recently told me</i>
<i>there's a plan in action to save the city</i>.

398
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,313
- He did?
- He did.

399
00:34:56,483 --> 00:35:00,158
I understand one final grounding station
needs to be deactivated.

400
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:04,919
Uncouple the grounding rods at Station
Three, assist in reactivating the shield

401
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,313
and you and your friends
can leave unharmed.

402
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,953
Wait a minute. I thought all you wanted
was C4 and a jumper.

403
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:13,876
Why raid a city
when you can seize it, Major?

404
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:16,034
Atlantis will be ours or the ocean's.

405
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,836
You choose.

406
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:33,317
We should have heard something
from the major.

407
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:37,078
- He may not have had a chance.
- I hate not knowing what's going on.

408
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:41,953
- Why would the Genii attack us now?
- We didn't exactly leave on the best terms.

409
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:45,593
We stole some of their gear
and didn't give them C4 as promised,

410
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:47,993
and they think Teyla killed one of them.

411
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:53,317
They believe so falsely. The fact that they
chose our weakest hour is no coincidence.

412
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,316
Someone must have told them
we'd be diminished.

413
00:35:56,483 --> 00:36:00,271
- There must be a way back.
- Those winds are blowing at 110 knots.

414
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,434
We're not going anywhere, son.

415
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:23,953
Thank you for seeing me.

416
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,874
This city was designed to be inhabited
by the Ancients and their descendants.

417
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:35,242
Although there is limited functionality for
those who do not have the Ancient gene,

418
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:39,032
only those who have it
can revive the city to its true potential.

419
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:45,481
- And you have this gene?
- No, but many of my team do.

420
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:49,118
The Wraith are slowly waking.

421
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:54,755
Soon this galaxy will be in a war the likes
of which our generations have never seen.

422
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:57,278
A war that you expedited.

423
00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:00,674
Disagreements like ours
will no longer matter.

424
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,232
The only thing of any consequence

425
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:07,078
will be how prepared we are
and what defence we are able to mount.

426
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:11,353
This city holds many secrets
which could help us win that war.

427
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:15,317
But only if my team
are here to discover them.

428
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,122
So, fine, take whatever you need
for your people,

429
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:23,195
but if you don't leave us this city,
you're hurting yourselves in the long run.

430
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,995
You believe your people,
who are not even of this galaxy,

431
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,358
are closer to the Ancients than we are?

432
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,675
Your arrogance is astounding.

433
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:40,076
We will take this city,
we will mount a defence and we will win,

434
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:42,632
with or without your help, Dr Weir.

435
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,795
Sir, he's at the grounding station.

436
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:02,520
- The commander's here.
- <i>He's just standing there, sir</i>.

437
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:06,358
- Do not approach until he's finished.
- <i>Yes, sir</i>.

438
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:08,514
Use lethal force only if necessary.

439
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:13,962
- You told him he would be unharmed.
- Let's hope he doesn't put up a fight.

440
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:36,162
<i>He's stopped. He's not</i>
<i>at the control panel. He's looking around</i>.

441
00:38:36,323 --> 00:38:39,474
- Hold your fire.
- Those control panels are fragile...

442
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:29,238
Let me tell you what you did wrong, Kolya.

443
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:33,200
<i>A: You lost two of your men</i>.

444
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:39,876
B: You damaged the switch before
I could separate the grounding rods,

445
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:44,480
which I'm sure you're gonna get
an earful from McKay for.

446
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:50,912
And C: You lost all of
what little credibility you had with me.

447
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:56,515
You know how big a setback that is?
I may not be able to activate the shield...

448
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,676
- You killed two of my men.
- I guess we're even.

449
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:05,357
I don't like even.

450
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,718
I'm not finished yet.

451
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:11,474
Neither am I.

452
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,358
Say goodbye to Dr Weir.

453
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:17,673
<i>The city has a self-destruct button</i>.

454
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,834
<i>If you hurt her, I'll activate it</i>.

455
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,358
Nobody'll get Atlantis.

456
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:27,119
Even if it exists, Major, you need
at least two senior personnel to activate it.

457
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,551
I'm taking one of them out of the equation.

458
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:34,192
<i>Kolya?</i>

459
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,993
Kolya?

460
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:45,073
I'll give you a ship.

461
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,802
I'll fly it out of here for you myself.

462
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,354
Kolya?
