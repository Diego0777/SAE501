1
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:34,995
- Is it safe?
- Yes, the chamber has been sealed.

2
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:38,473
- Where are the others?
- The Brotherhood has fallen, Astrum.

3
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:41,032
- We're all that remains.
- My God.

4
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:43,159
If we die, then...

5
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:45,837
Hurry. They're getting closer.

6
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:07,434
Allina, I know I've said this before,

7
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:11,312
but thank you for letting us in here,
helping us through the material.

8
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:13,474
It's been utterly fascinating.

9
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:17,921
I'm happy to do it, Doctor.
I'm sorry this information is so scattered.

10
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,553
I'm afraid we're working
on so many projects at once,

11
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,157
reference materials tend to get misplaced.

12
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:27,474
Of course. Look at that.

13
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:40,201
- What is going on here?
- Just having a little fun.

14
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:41,955
Can we get back to work?

15
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:45,752
I don't see how running through
history books will find us our ZPM.

16
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:48,232
Really? See this?

17
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:51,042
This is a charcoal rubbing
from an Ancient temple

18
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,034
built when Weir's list was written.

19
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:57,515
Notice anything familiar? Hm? It's a ZPM.

20
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,277
We are close.
Closer than we have ever been.

21
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:03,833
There may be hundreds
of zero-point modules in this galaxy,

22
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:08,201
but the only one
we are remotely sure of is here. Here.

23
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,638
Now, if you ever want to go home,

24
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:16,036
if you ever want to protect Atlantis
from the Wraith, we need to find this.

25
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,992
Do they have any idea
where the ZPM could be?

26
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,836
An Ancient from Atlantis
came through the Stargate

27
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:31,678
and entrusted a sect of Sudarian priests
with a rare treasure,

28
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,834
or Potentia, as they called it.

29
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:36,642
This Lantian told them
to hide it from the Wraith.

30
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,953
The Sudarian people
worshiped the Ancients

31
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:42,433
and considered the Potentia
their most sacred artefact.

32
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:44,639
They did as the Ancient requested.

33
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,715
- The Potentia being...
- The ZPM.

34
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,475
They wouldn't have used it?

35
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,476
I think they only displayed it
on high holidays.

36
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:55,282
I'd be surprised if they knew
it could be used.

37
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,719
If they didn't know how to use it,
chances are it's still full.

38
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:02,034
The bad news is that
after 10,000 years of Wraith culling,

39
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,875
Sudarian society is extinct.

40
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,399
The planet's inhabitants are at
a Renaissance level of development,

41
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,793
but with help
they could make some headway.

42
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:14,115
All right. I'm sold.
Major, take your team back to Dagan.

43
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,160
Try to get us a ticket home.

44
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,714
Does it still pain you?

45
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:44,401
Leave us.

46
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:53,356
- What do you have for me?
- The Atlanteans have returned to Dagan.

47
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:56,879
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes. Our operative just checked in.

48
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:01,559
It's only been 12 hours since they left.
They must be getting close to it.

49
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:05,318
- Do we have any idea what "it" is yet?
- We know a little more.

50
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:10,113
Our offworld spies have been keeping
an eye on the Atlantean teams from afar,

51
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:13,355
but this is the first planet
we've got this close to them.

52
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:17,236
They're looking for
a Lantian-era power source.

53
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:24,675
- Is Chief Cowen sending a team?
- Not yet. His priorities are elsewhere.

54
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:28,199
Even if he was,
he would never send you.

55
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,996
The last thing the Atlanteans need
is more power.

56
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:36,599
Get me on that planet,
with or without Cowen's blessing.

57
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:38,958
I don't know why, but it stopped working.

58
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:42,354
I got some of the functionality back,
but not everything.

59
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:45,799
Maybe if people stop insisting
on having food and liquid

60
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,919
close to 10,000-year-old equipment...

61
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,153
Hey, we're very careful.

62
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:53,281
- We're not the problem here.
- Ah. Yes. Uh-huh.

63
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,123
- What did you touch?
- I didn't touch anything.

64
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,154
Then why is it...?

65
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,398
What is this?

66
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:24,600
- I didn't know we had deep space sensors.
- No one did.

67
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:28,915
They've been running in the background
along with our other primary systems.

68
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,155
In the background?
Why the sudden leap to the foreground?

69
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,439
Excellent question.

70
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,118
- We don't have an answer yet, do we?
- Not as of yet, no.

71
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:41,992
- OK, well, keep me in the loop.
- You are the loop.

72
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:44,154
Isn't that a nice thing to say?

73
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:50,158
You're more than welcome
to walk with me,

74
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:54,077
- but if there's something you need to do...
- Yes. Yes.

75
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,153
They called themselves the Quindosim,

76
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,757
a brotherhood of 15 monks
whose sole occupation

77
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:03,596
was to keep the Potentia, or ZPM, safe.

78
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:06,914
- It's fascinating.
- Yes. Fascinating.

79
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,082
Please go on.

80
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:12,474
The Brotherhood of the 15
consisted of a Master Handler,

81
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:14,793
five Protectors, and nine Stone Carriers.

82
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,193
Their greatest fear
was that the Brotherhood

83
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,354
might one day be culled by the Wraith,

84
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,957
with the ZPM going missing for ever.

85
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:25,115
Missing, yes, but it would not
fall into enemy hands.

86
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,717
They were entrusted with the ZPM.

87
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:31,432
Their hope was that one day
the Lantians would return to reclaim it

88
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,992
and reward the Sudarians for their work.

89
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,121
So they left clues,
should the Brotherhood be destroyed.

90
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:41,071
That's right.
The priests created nine stone markers

91
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,313
that, if united, are supposed to reveal

92
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:46,077
the resting place
of the Quindosim's treasure.

93
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,677
So far, we've only found three.

94
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:54,041
The etching on the rocks
involved many lines and dots.

95
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:57,115
- We think it's a map.
- Mm. Amazing.

96
00:07:57,283 --> 00:08:00,798
It is, actually. This looks like
an Ancient numbering system.

97
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,362
That's what we thought.

98
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,196
We think they're numbers
three, six, and seven.

99
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:10,517
- Excellent work. I'm very impressed here.
- That's very kind of you, Doctor.

100
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:15,073
- Where did you find them?
- This building was their monastery.

101
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:17,757
We pieced together
the information we found here

102
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,073
and found
the number six and seven stones.

103
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:23,474
We found the number three stone
on an unrelated dig last week.

104
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:27,238
- If we find the stones, we find the map?
- Yes, exactly.

105
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:33,079
- Hm. You see this?
- Under the design?

106
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:36,679
I don't think anything is there
just for aesthetics. Here.

107
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:41,312
Yeah. Each of the stones
has a different part of the grid embossed.

108
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,998
Signifying where its placing
should be in the final configurations.

109
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,552
- Exactly.
- So what?

110
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:51,238
"So what?" Do you have a map?

111
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:56,314
OK, where did you find them?

112
00:08:56,483 --> 00:09:01,603
We found the seven stone here...
the six stone here...

113
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:05,756
and most recently we stumbled
on the number three stone here.

114
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:09,552
You have no idea
how lucky a find that was.

115
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,557
- I see it.
- Doctor, I am not sure...

116
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:17,318
They're buried in a grid.
We needed the number three stone.

117
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:21,112
That, along with the number seven stone,
gives us two corners.

118
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,513
You can extrapolate how big the grid is

119
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:25,992
and where the other stones
should be buried.

120
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:30,361
All right, split up, two teams.
Let's start digging.

121
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,920
Do you think they'll find it?

122
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:37,440
Many people have come to find
the lost treasure of Quindosim.

123
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,879
- Do you think they will find it?
- I do not know.

124
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:46,039
We'll wait for them to find the treasure,
then take it by force.

125
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:49,513
- Your men are not to act until I say.
- Of course.

126
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:53,312
Which would make us... right, I think.

127
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:58,157
Can you believe
the progress we've made, Sanir?

128
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:02,157
How many years
have we been searching for these stones?

129
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:07,362
- What's wrong?
- We should not be helping them, Allina.

130
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,196
They are helping us
as much as we are helping them.

131
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:14,402
They will take the Potentia if they find it.
You must see that.

132
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,919
They have come to us
from the great city of Atlantis.

133
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,759
It is for them that the Brotherhood
of the 15 kept the treasure hidden.

134
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,954
I do not trust them, Allina.

135
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:32,158
If you would rather head back to your
village than help us, I will not stop you.

136
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:06,435
Check this out.

137
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:27,401
Allina.

138
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,361
- This is gonna work.
- I think it just might.

139
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:59,718
It's a layout of the Sudarian villages.

140
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,561
This monastery has protected it
for 10,000 years.

141
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,714
Hm. It's beautiful.

142
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,433
It is... and yet
my eye is drawn elsewhere.

143
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,834
Hm? How so?

144
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:20,361
I'd like to restore it one day,
but I'm afraid of damaging it.

145
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,401
Perhaps you could help me, Doctor.

146
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:26,794
Really, you need
to start calling me Rodney.

147
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,354
Very well.

148
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:38,595
- I don't bore you, do I?
- No. No, no. It's not you.

149
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:41,994
I just don't think I've ever been so tired.

150
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,996
But you're a scientist.
Are you not used to this?

151
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,677
My kind of science
is the good kind of science,

152
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,994
the kind you can do sitting in a chair
or lying on a couch.

153
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:57,351
What was it like? Growing up
in the city of the Ancestors, Rodney?

154
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,595
- I'm sorry?
- Atlantis.

155
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:04,119
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we didn't, uh...

156
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,280
We come from a planet called Earth,
in a different galaxy.

157
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:10,638
We only recently made Atlantis our home.

158
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,601
- How recently?
- Just a matter of months, really.

159
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:20,281
You're tired.
Do not let me keep you from sleep.

160
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:26,762
If you insist, I'll, um... Yeah. OK.

161
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,602
- I'm heading to bed.
- Which bed might that be?

162
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:42,362
Hm... What?

163
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,117
I think Allina might have
a crush on you, Doc.

164
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:49,675
- Oh, she does?
- It is very clear to us all.

165
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:52,562
- It is?
- Well, everyone but you, apparently.

166
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,032
Should I have, um...?
Are you sure about this?

167
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,194
- I'm very sure.
- What should I do?

168
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:01,240
- You don't know what to do?
- I know what to do eventually.

169
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:03,963
What should I do now?
Should I say something?

170
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,522
Tell you what, Valentino,
wait till tomorrow.

171
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:10,197
You'll be more on your game
after some rest.

172
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:15,198
Right. Right. Good answer. Goodnight.

173
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,719
It doesn't look much like a map.
I guess I was wrong.

174
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,842
Possibly, although just because
you originally thought it was a map

175
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:40,882
doesn't make your initial assumption
bad or incorrect.

176
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,115
Well, incorrect, yes,
but it was a good guess.

177
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:46,755
I'm sorry?

178
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:54,119
You're... very, very smart,
and, uh... and attractive and whatnot,

179
00:14:54,283 --> 00:15:01,041
and, um... you've got a lot of things
going for you even when things don't...

180
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:05,355
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's great. Why wouldn't it be?

181
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:10,794
You sure we're in the right place? We've
doubled the site and not found anything.

182
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:14,638
It's got to be the right place.
The other stones were where we thought.

183
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,436
Major!

184
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:23,678
- Tell me you found the stone.
- Not quite, but McKay should look at this.

185
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,673
It carries the mark of the Brotherhood.

186
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:36,482
The writing's in Ancient. Can you read it?

187
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:44,192
It's a warning.

188
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:47,400
"Only the Brotherhood of the 15
should enter the chamber..."

189
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:51,238
- "Of the Quindosim."
- What chamber?

190
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,238
So, who wants to go first?

191
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,917
Seems sort of like a... Sheppard thing?

192
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:56,682
We couldn't have planned it any better.

193
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:08,515
Oh. Easy, Ford! God!

194
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:16,160
All right, he's down.

195
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:18,439
I'll stay here, watch the descender.

196
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,481
I'll let you know
if anything interesting happens.

197
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:49,121
Do you see this? This is the whole pattern.

198
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:51,922
The ninth stone
must integrate into this piece.

199
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:03,641
May I?

200
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,199
I believe we can rule out a map.

201
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:15,517
- All right. Any ideas?
- I'm getting there.

202
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:21,114
Take your team to Section Seven.

203
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:25,674
Dr Weir, I've interfaced our computers
with the Atlantean long-range sensors.

204
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:30,041
There's an unidentified craft the size
of a Wraith dart heading for the city.

205
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,000
- What?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

206
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:36,156
The sensors picked it up days ago.
I've only just deciphered what they meant.

207
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,475
- A dart? How is that possible?
- Maybe it was modified to move quickly.

208
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,554
The hive ships are light years away.

209
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:46,318
It could have used a neighbouring Stargate
and been flying towards us

210
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,633
since the Wraith discovered we were here.

211
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:52,637
At its current velocity,
it will be here in 27 minutes.

212
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:58,717
We need to get jumpers in the air.

213
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,393
What don't you believe?

214
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,997
It's a gate address,
a six-symbol gate address.

215
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,755
Gate symbols?

216
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,194
I see them now. Yes.

217
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:35,833
- Do you recognise the address?
- No.

218
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:38,198
I'm not familiar with this one either.

219
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,957
So the ninth stone is on another planet.

220
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:48,232
- Is he dead?
- No, just unconscious.

221
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,997
- He will be like that for hours.
- Excellent.

222
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,598
We'll wait for them to...

223
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,763
Put the weapon down, Lieutenant Ford.

224
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,555
Ford?

225
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,634
Major Sheppard.

226
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,436
The lieutenant
has had to step away for a moment.

227
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:31,520
- Who's that?
- It can't be.

228
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,674
- It sounds like...
- Kolya?

229
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:40,273
- Surprised?
- You're alive.

230
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,195
As far as I can tell.

231
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:45,833
Did you think a single bullet
to the shoulder would kill me?

232
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:49,833
I always thought
you were smarter than that.

233
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:54,121
- What did you do to Ford?
- He's fine.

234
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:57,912
- Then what do you want?
- The same as you, Major.

235
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,358
The lost treasure of the Quindosim.

236
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:03,560
What possible use could that be to you?

237
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:09,915
The Daganians have informed us
that this ZPM is an object of great power,

238
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:14,194
and great power is of use to all people,
especially the Genii.

239
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:18,914
- Sanir.
- They offered us a great reward, Allina.

240
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,643
They agreed to let us
keep the treasure if we...

241
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:28,316
They're no use to you, Kolya.
ZPMs only work on Atlantis.

242
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:32,761
Perhaps, but I prefer hearing that
from a Genii scientist.

243
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:35,881
We do not have it yet.
We have not found the ninth stone.

244
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:38,876
We have a large tactical advantage
over you.

245
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:43,756
If you want me to cover the mouth
of the chamber and forget the whole thing,

246
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,515
I'm willing to consider it.

247
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:49,119
She's right.
We're closer, but we're not there yet.

248
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:52,753
The ninth stone is on another planet.
We just have the gate address.

249
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:57,474
Dr McKay. So wonderful
to hear your grating voice again.

250
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,954
How's the arm?

251
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:07,958
Do you want to keep trading barbs
or do you want to find the ZPM?

252
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,120
Lift me out, I'll help you find it,
but then you let us go.

253
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:16,751
- Shut up, McKay.
- You got a better idea?

254
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,914
No.

255
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,358
Do we have a deal or not?

256
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:25,352
You and two Daganians
will be raised out...

257
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,913
along with
everyone's weapons and radios.

258
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,119
The rest of you will remain here.

259
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:38,359
If Dr McKay finds the ZPM, the others
will be let go. I give you my word.

260
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:42,402
Well, we have his word.

261
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,077
I don't see that we have much choice.

262
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,437
I'm coming up.

263
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:57,841
The population are confined to their
quarters, hopefully out of harm's way.

264
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,678
- Any word from Sheppard yet?
- No. His entire team is off radio.

265
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:07,679
It's still closing in very fast.
Who is going to fly the third jumper?

266
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:10,960
I can barely make it
to the mainland without crashing.

267
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,637
I'm a doctor, not a bloody fighter pilot.

268
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:16,271
A Wraith dart's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

269
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:18,434
Our only fighter pilot is offworld.

270
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:21,276
I would like to mount
the best defence we can.

271
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:27,034
Brilliant.

272
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:40,391
Jumper Two is away. All three are out.

273
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,874
- Good luck, Carson.
- <i>I'll need it</i>.

274
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,516
- It's not working.
- Try it again.

275
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:00,880
Look, I've tried it twice,
backwards and forwards.

276
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:03,352
We've played this game before, McKay.

277
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,514
Try other combinations of the symbols.

278
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:09,596
- You know how long it would take?
- There are 720 possible gate addresses.

279
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:13,278
- It's a waste of time.
- The address is the ninth stone's location?

280
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:16,799
The puzzle is 10,000 years old.
The gate may not exist any more.

281
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:20,273
Some cultures bury their gates
to render them useless.

282
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:24,595
What about something else?
What if these aren't Stargate symbols?

283
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,440
Look at them.
What else would they be, huh?

284
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:33,600
Actually,
these symbols may not be gate-related.

285
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,754
Really? What are you thinking?

286
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,003
Gentlemen,
you should have visual in 30 seconds.

287
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:45,239
- You ready?
- No, I'm not ready.

288
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,679
- You're gonna do fine.
- Is fine gonna be good enough?

289
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:51,516
<i>Coming right at you</i>.

290
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:53,992
- Do you see it?
- I can't see it anywhere.

291
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,314
Atlantis, Markham and Smith
have been taken out.

292
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,951
<i>It's headed for the city</i>.

293
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:18,035
This monastery is where the 15 priests
of the Brotherhood used to live.

294
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:22,993
The mural here is a map, a layout
of Sudaria as it was in their time.

295
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:28,920
I should have thought of this. The
Sudarians worshipped the Ancestors.

296
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:34,476
The Stargate was considered a sacred
portal and its symbols religious icons.

297
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:39,319
- All 36 gate symbols are incorporated.
- So, connect the symbols on the stones...

298
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:42,555
And you can triangulate
where the centre stone is buried.

299
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:46,241
- You're a genius.
- Thank you, Rodney.

300
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:49,520
OK, we're all very impressed,
but let's get on with it.

301
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,475
Shoot it down!

302
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,192
It's right in the middle of the city.
I don't have a clean shot.

303
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:14,841
- What's it doing?
- It's scanning us.

304
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,682
Huh.

305
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:34,835
I was hoping it would narrow
the area down a little more.

306
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,721
It was worth a shot.

307
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:42,321
- How big an area does that represent?
- Several square miles.

308
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:44,997
Hold on a second. It's part of their symbol.

309
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,682
The mark of the 15. Yes.

310
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:04,472
- What?
- It's a 15-line symbol. 15 lines.

311
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,999
- Nine lines on the outside.
- Representing the Stone Carriers.

312
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:12,441
- Six on the inside.
- The Protectors and the Master Handler.

313
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:17,439
- Do you know where that is?
- Yes, I can take you there.

314
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,002
Hold on a second.

315
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:26,402
Hold tight.

316
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:30,397
One more second.

317
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:35,914
Yes!

318
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,280
We didn't do that.
At least, I don't think we did.

319
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:41,479
Whatever happened, it's dead.

320
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,760
Atlantis, we have a kill.

321
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:49,761
Good news, Jumper Two.
Now head on home.

322
00:27:56,123 --> 00:27:59,195
Someone give me a knife.

323
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,801
You all have guns.
Someone give me a knife.

324
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,753
All right.

325
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:15,642
Rodney.

326
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:20,479
It's not a map to where the centre stone is.
It is where the centre stone is. Look.

327
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,640
We have all the pieces.

328
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:48,274
Congratulations, Dr McKay.
You may live yet.

329
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:03,075
This is pointless. No trapdoors
or hidden passageways.

330
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,119
There may be more than one way in.

331
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,235
If you're trying to hide a chamber,
you don't have lots of entrances and exits.

332
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,598
You'd rather
wait for them to come back?

333
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:19,277
What have you got that we can use?

334
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:25,639
I've got a couple of MREs,
some ammo and some med supplies.

335
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:28,960
That's a start.

336
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:32,240
I've got a couple of flash-bangs.
That's about it, though.

337
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,200
Flash-bangs?

338
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:37,321
Work like grenades.
Pull the pin, depress the trigger.

339
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,838
Once the spoon pops,
you've got 1.5 seconds

340
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:44,076
before the room's filled with 2.4 million
candlepower and a 175-decibel bang.

341
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:49,442
It'll stun anyone with their eyes
and ears open for about ten seconds.

342
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,840
You gonna dig us out of here?

343
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:02,154
Yeah, something like that.
Come over and give me a hand.

344
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:14,235
You want Sora back?
Is that what this is about?

345
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:17,156
Sora knew what she was doing,
more so than most men.

346
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:20,201
Besides, the Genii
do not make deals with terrorists.

347
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,354
Terrorists? You attacked us.

348
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,593
After you ambushed us on our own world.

349
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,675
This is crazy.
We're both trying to protect our people.

350
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:32,792
But if making your people the target
buys my people more time, it's worth it.

351
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,193
- Listen...
- I don't want to discuss it.

352
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:40,676
Find the ZPM and you can all return
to Atlantis. Fail and the deal's off.

353
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:54,112
- What happened?
- We had a clean shot, it self-destructed.

354
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:59,322
- Why?
- No idea. I don't think it came here to fight.

355
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,635
It was only interested in the jumpers
when we were blocking its way to the city.

356
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:10,276
Darts are not long-range fighters. The
fact it came so far alone... it was a scout.

357
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:13,560
But why self-destruct?
Scouts should relay information.

358
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:17,318
But it did relay information. Look.

359
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:25,917
Just before it exploded,
the dart was transmitting data.

360
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:31,636
- I don't suppose you could...
- Not any time soon.

361
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:36,558
- Can we tell where it was sending it?
- I could direct the sensors to the area.

362
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,283
Give me a couple of hours.

363
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,717
I assumed we place the stones
on the pedestal,

364
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:50,035
put someone's hands on the palm prints
and hopefully we get the ZPM.

365
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:54,560
- But what order do we put the stones in?
- I think it's pretty straightforward.

366
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:57,795
Nothing has been yet.
What makes you think this would be?

367
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:00,955
The last one has grooves
that match the centre position.

368
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:03,193
- So?
- So it fits snugly into place.

369
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:06,161
Complete the pattern, get the ZPM.

370
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:11,078
- Why would they continue to play games?
- You don't understand how they thought.

371
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,040
- Stop stalling.
- We need to...

372
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:18,231
Pranos, arrange the stones
and retrieve the ZPM, please.

373
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:35,040
- McKay.
- What do you want me to do?

374
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:39,755
What's this?

375
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:54,957
He's dead.

376
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:00,120
- You knew this would happen.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

377
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:03,639
I was telling you when you ordered him
to activate the pedestal.

378
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,794
Look, you killed him, not me.

379
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:20,358
- What's the correct order of the stones?
- I'm not sure yet.

380
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:30,321
Well, you have four chances to get it right.

381
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:33,474
You go first.

382
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:43,912
- Any time you want to start...
- I'm thinking.

383
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,916
- All right. We tried one to nine.
- Thank you, yes.

384
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,358
- How about nine to one?
- Pranos was right.

385
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:52,640
The centre stone locks into place.
The others move round it.

386
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,158
I need a combination
with five in the middle.

387
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:58,793
15. It must have something
to do with 15... or nine, or five...

388
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:01,113
Shut up. Please? I'm trying to think.

389
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,320
- No. My life's at stake.
- Simmer down and let me save it.

390
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:07,475
- Two heads are better than one.
- That's a misconception.

391
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:10,953
- Give me the gun. I'll shoot him.
- This is too slow. Choose.

392
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:13,717
- You got to be somewhere?
- Choose and go.

393
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:19,361
- I've got nothing.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

394
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:22,321
Nine to one. It's all I can think of.

395
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:24,758
- OK. Step back.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:29,280
- I'm not dead yet.
- Yeah. Sorry.

397
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:36,952
Major. Now.

398
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,042
- I got it!
- What?

399
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,921
- The Brotherhood of 15.
- And?

400
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:56,554
Put the numbers one to nine in a grid
so they add up to 15 in every direction.

401
00:34:57,843 --> 00:35:01,233
- You're right. How did you know that?
- It was on a Mensa test.

402
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,633
- You're a member?
- No, but I took the test.

403
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:07,591
- When?
- You want to talk about this now, Rodney?

404
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:10,596
Right. Right. OK.

405
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,402
Two, nine, four.

406
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:16,714
Seven, five, three. Six, one, eight.

407
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:20,796
- That's it. That's got to be it.
- Good luck.

408
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,154
Aargh!

409
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,558
What the hell just happened?

410
00:36:26,723 --> 00:36:29,760
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Thank you.

411
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:34,201
- Rodney, I had no way of telling you.
- My eyes! I need my eyes for seeing.

412
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:39,960
- Get the ZPM, Rodney.
- It's a miracle I can still make out shapes.

413
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:46,354
Don't look at me.

414
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:55,316
All right. We're getting out of here.

415
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:57,599
We'll send a villager to pick you up.

416
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:00,402
The smart thing would be to kill me now.

417
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,079
You're right.

418
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:17,997
I tell you what... I'm gonna want
points for this in the future...

419
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,235
but if you ever do this again, I will kill you.

420
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:27,762
Deal?

421
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:35,997
- Are we good?
- Yeah, as far as I can see.

422
00:37:36,163 --> 00:37:38,393
Let's move out.

423
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:42,513
I can't believe
you never mentioned Mensa.

424
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:45,151
- I took the test. I never joined.
- You passed?

425
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,518
- Yes.
- We have a chapter on Atlantis.

426
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,913
- You could be an honorary...
- Up the rope.

427
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,277
I thought we'd never find
one of those things.

428
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,274
I'm gonna sleep soundly tonight.

429
00:37:56,443 --> 00:38:00,277
I'm gonna be up all night
getting every system I can back online.

430
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:03,992
Allina, I don't think we'll ever be able
to repay you for this.

431
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:06,154
You won't have to.

432
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:16,354
I'm sorry?

433
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:22,474
All right, all right. Easy. Easy.

434
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:27,391
Allina... you involved the Genii?

435
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,997
This has nothing to do with the Genii.

436
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:32,279
I'm a member of the New Brotherhood.

437
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,240
Then what is this about?

438
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:39,523
Ten generations ago, after a severe
culling, the Brotherhood was destroyed.

439
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:42,595
We found their writings
and decided to complete the task

440
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,754
handed down to us by the Ancestors.

441
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,483
I am the new Master Handler.

442
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:51,556
We thank you
for helping us find the Potentia,

443
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:54,474
but it must go into hiding again.

444
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:59,000
We come from the city of the Ancestors.
That ZPM was intended for us.

445
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:03,361
No. You live in Atlantis
but you are not the Ancestors.

446
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:05,514
What did you tell her?

447
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:10,991
Atlantis might fall
if we don't take this ZPM back.

448
00:39:11,163 --> 00:39:14,041
Do you think
the Ancestors would have wanted that?

449
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:18,116
- None of us can know their plan.
- They don't have a plan.

450
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:22,276
Did they plan to get attacked by
the Wraith and chased out of the galaxy?

451
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,673
Allina, you're far too smart to think...

452
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:27,721
The Potentia will be put into hiding
on another world.

453
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:31,239
When the Ancestors return,
our people will be greatly rewarded.

454
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:35,794
Allina, you can't believe that. Look,
come back with us. Let me prove it to you.

455
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:38,557
This is how it must be.

456
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,192
Now it is time for you to leave.

457
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:57,593
- Did you try to explain...?
- I tried. Believe me, we tried.

458
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,038
- We could have used it.
- Of course.

459
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:04,481
You don't understand. While you were
offworld, a Wraith dart flew over our city.

460
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:08,113
- I'm sorry?
- We lost a jumper, Markham and Smith.

461
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,400
- We what?
- And it scanned us.

462
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:15,556
We lost two men and a jumper
and this is the first I hear about it?

463
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,601
You've been out of radio contact
for over 12 hours.

464
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:23,234
The dart sent a transmission deep
into space and then it self-destructed.

465
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,963
We scanned the area
with our deep space sensors...

466
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,956
- We have deep space sensors?
- It's a long story.

467
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:31,796
And we found something else...
rather unsettling.

468
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,353
I'm already unsettled. Show me.

469
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:48,957
- What are those?
- Wraith hive ships. Three of them.

470
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:52,957
- The system analysis just got back...
- Right. Where are they headed?

471
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:57,992
If they maintain direction and speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.

472
