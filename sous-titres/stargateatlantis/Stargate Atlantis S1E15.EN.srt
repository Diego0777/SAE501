1
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:12,754
- There you are.
- Hey.

2
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:15,391
I was just stealing a breath of fresh air.

3
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:19,272
- I thought you were off exploring the city.
- About to.

4
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:23,322
Picked this up on the mainland.
The Athosians made it.

5
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:26,512
Happy birthday.

6
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:29,715
Hmm.

7
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:34,592
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,913
How did you find out?

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,233
Mum's the word.

10
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,321
<i>Done with the living quarters</i>.
<i>Moving on</i>.

11
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,395
You see anything better
than our current quarters?

12
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,838
A few. Some of them are pretty nice.

13
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,233
What kind of square footage?

14
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:02,840
What am I, your realtor, Rodney? We're
here to unlock the secrets of Atlantis.

15
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:07,554
<i>A one-bedroom with a den and preferably</i>
<i>a balcony, but I'm not married to it</i>.

16
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:10,920
- Check this out!
- <i>Be comfortable until the Wraith get here</i>.

17
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,994
Shut up for a second.

18
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,999
- <i>What? What is it?</i>
- Some sort of laboratory.

19
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:31,916
<i>We've come across dozens</i>.
<i>The city's full of them</i>.

20
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,199
<i>Something unusual about it?</i>

21
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:52,639
I'd have to say... yes.

22
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:06,754
We could stand here looking at her all day.
We've gotta get her out of this box.

23
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,483
We can't. She's at least 100 years old.

24
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:13,238
Which is why every second counts!
She could drop dead.

25
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,314
How? You said she was frozen.

26
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:19,874
She's in a state of metabolic stasis,
ageing slowed but not entirely suspended.

27
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:22,432
- This woman is still alive?
- Yes.

28
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:27,836
Life-sign systems indicate viability. She's
been in that chamber for 10,000 years.

29
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,994
10,000 years?!

30
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:33,399
Doesn't look a day over 9,000.

31
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:37,761
She'll continue to age until she dies,
sooner rather than later,

32
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,914
bringing me back to my point.

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,837
She's so old I'm afraid
reviving her might actually kill her.

34
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,394
We cannot let this chance to talk to
an Ancient slip through our fingers - again.

35
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:52,761
Who knows her state of mind? She might
be carrying some horrifying contagion.

36
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:56,154
Who knows what she knows
about our city, or any ZPMs?

37
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,712
Ah, there's a thought.

38
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:03,715
- Revive her.
- But...

39
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:06,272
- It's my call.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,758
And we thought this city was abandoned.

41
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:16,711
Is it possible the Atlanteans left her
when they abandoned the city?

42
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,920
- Maybe she wanted to stay.
- Or they forgot about her.

43
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,074
In which case she's gonna be pissed.

44
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:24,632
If she remembers anything at all.

45
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,193
Breathing shallow.

46
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,672
Pulse rapid.

47
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:44,358
I'll run an EEG to determine
any brain activity.

48
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,277
- What is it?
- Don't know.

49
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,034
It's gate addresses, five of them.

50
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:58,842
M7G-677. We've been to this planet.

51
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:01,563
Dr Weir.

52
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,434
Hello?

53
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,561
Can you hear me?

54
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:16,078
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

55
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:18,837
- Freezer burn.
- I thought she wasn't frozen.

56
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,278
10,000 years.
You expect her to dance a jig?

57
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,718
It's the eyes. You look at the eyes.

58
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:28,320
Lights are on but nobody's home. Doesn't
take a medical professional to know...

59
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:30,519
Of course she can see us.

60
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,800
And hear us.

61
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,397
Hello. How are you feeling?

62
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:46,993
- It worked.
- What was that?

63
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,199
- "It worked."
- What does that mean?

64
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,082
- I assume something worked.
- That's very sharp.

65
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:54,234
Thank you.

66
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,876
Hello?

67
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,436
She fell asleep. When she's more stable,
transfer her to the infirmary.

68
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,163
And I want video on her at all times.

69
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,791
We might not get
a second chance at anything.

70
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,352
Let's hope we get a first, huh?

71
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:21,080
- Too big, huh?
- I'm just pointing out its dimensions.

72
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,393
- It's not that big...
- Gentlemen.

73
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:27,476
We were wondering if there were
any other frozen bodies out there.

74
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,474
There's no way of knowing.

75
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:34,080
It'd be like searching every room
in Manhattan. It'll take a while.

76
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:37,713
God knows what other surprises
are not showing on the sensors.

77
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:41,114
- That's what we're here to find out.
- <i>Dr Weir</i>.

78
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,717
- Yes?
- <i>You'd better come to the infirmary</i>.

79
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:47,478
- Is our patient awake?
- Aye, and she's saying peculiar things.

80
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,634
On our way.

81
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,559
She's drifting in and out, still very weak.

82
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:05,511
But there's something
a wee bit odd about this woman.

83
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:09,198
She called me Carson.
She knows my name.

84
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,161
- She overheard you talking to someone.
- No.

85
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:15,395
- I was alone here when she woke up.
- Subconsciously?

86
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,997
I've read stories of coma patients...

87
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:21,155
It's more than that. She knows things.

88
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:35,040
How are you feeling?

89
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,194
Look at you!

90
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,401
I didn't think I'd see any of you again.

91
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,953
Missed you all so terribly.

92
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,753
- Even you, Rodney.
- You see?

93
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,711
I'm sorry? Do we know you?

94
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,874
Oh, yes.

95
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,921
I'm you, Elizabeth.

96
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,714
- <i>Time travel?</i>
- <i>That's what she said</i>.

97
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:18,239
She somehow found a way
to travel back in time

98
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:20,633
to when the Ancients inhabited the city.

99
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:23,795
How did she do this?

100
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,921
That will be the first question
when she wakes up.

101
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:32,157
- If she ever wakes up.
- There is the possibility she might be...

102
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:35,315
What is the clinical term... nuts?

103
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:41,038
She may be senile, yes, but that doesn't
explain how she knows so much about us.

104
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:43,763
Is time travel even possible?

105
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,677
There's nothing in the laws of physics
to prevent it.

106
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,640
Extremely difficult to achieve.

107
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:52,954
You need to manipulate black holes
to create wormholes

108
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,273
through points in space and time.

109
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:59,402
- Not to mention a nice DeLorean.
- Don't get me started on that movie.

110
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:01,952
I like that movie.

111
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:07,601
The results of the DNA test. It's a match.

112
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:12,081
She is you.

113
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:24,957
I know what you're thinking.

114
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:28,399
If she's been waiting
all these millennia for us to arrive,

115
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:32,397
why didn't the system attempt
to revive her the moment we got here?

116
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:36,522
Answer: it did. I've been going over
the data from our arrival.

117
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:39,117
One thing we noticed
was a sudden power surge

118
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:41,558
in the section where the stasis lab was.

119
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:44,521
It was trying to revive her,
only we didn't know.

120
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:48,198
We saw more power draining
from an already nearly depleted ZPM,

121
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:53,312
so we shut down all secondary systems,
almost killed her... you.

122
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:58,999
- How weird is that, huh?
- Very. Very, very weird.

123
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:04,314
Looking at yourself...

124
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,274
how you will be.

125
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:11,880
Actually, how you will be
will be different than how she is right now.

126
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:15,752
The moment she went back in time,
she created a separate reality,

127
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:19,359
a second you living in a parallel world.

128
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,515
According to one interpretation
of quantum theory.

129
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,481
Simply put, this interpretation states that

130
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:29,682
the universe is split into
an infinite number of copies of itself

131
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:35,395
in which every possible outcome to every
decision ever made all exists somewhere.

132
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:40,883
- Simply put.
- Yeah, in a nutshell.

133
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:43,954
Elizabeth?

134
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,674
There's so much to tell you.

135
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:55,435
- The note... I had a note.
- Yes.

136
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,400
Yes, we got your note.

137
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:01,636
Forgive my bluntness, but we need
to know everything about your encounter,

138
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:06,593
beginning when you went back in time,
specifically how you went back...

139
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:09,960
Rodney... let me talk.

140
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,672
Yeah.

141
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:17,072
There was an accident.

142
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,918
I remember
we arrived through the Stargate.

143
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:26,472
<i>The lights came on by themselves</i>...

144
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:30,394
..<i>sensing our presence</i>.

145
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,633
Who's doing that?

146
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,522
<i>The city slowly awoke</i>.

147
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,756
Dr Weir, you have to see this.

148
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:45,996
There are a lot of things I have to see.
Just be careful.

149
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:54,473
This is the control room.
Obviously their version of a DHD.

150
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:57,077
- Obviously
- Power control systems.

151
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:59,962
- A computer interface.
- Why don't you find out?

152
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:02,876
We've got lights coming on, air circulating,

153
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,762
but no power coming on
to these consoles.

154
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,801
Wait.
That isn't the way it happened.

155
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:13,275
Everything came online when we arrived.
Lights, computers, power systems.

156
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:18,881
- I accessed the database immediately.
- That's not what happened.

157
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:21,637
Not the first time.

158
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:37,398
- Isn't there something you can give her?
- She's in an extremely fragile state.

159
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:40,077
Her blood pressure is low,
her heart is weak.

160
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:46,000
If I administer a stimulant, it may induce
a dangerous arrhythmia, or worse.

161
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:51,036
Just enough to keep her alert
for a few more minutes at a time.

162
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,718
We hardly get a couple of words out of her
before she dozes off.

163
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:59,195
Which, I might remind you,
is not uncommon for a woman of 10,000.

164
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:06,520
Carson, I understand your reticence,

165
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:11,473
but trust me when I say
I believe she can handle it,

166
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,362
and I know she'd want it.

167
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,594
OK.

168
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,913
It's OK, Carson.

169
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,393
I'm just as freaked out
about all this as you are.

170
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,877
How's our patient doing?

171
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:49,122
Pressure's improving and, as you can tell,
she's much more alert.

172
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:52,514
Are you up for getting outta here?

173
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:18,273
Seeing the city like this,
sitting on the surface of the ocean,

174
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:21,992
you can't imagine how relieved I am.

175
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:26,122
What are you saying?
The city didn't rise the first time round?

176
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,672
No. No.

177
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:35,082
The city was in serious trouble
the very moment we arrived.

178
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,837
With temporary battery power,

179
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,962
we're trying to access
the city's main power systems.

180
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:46,913
<i>Dr Weir, Colonel Sumner. Can you</i>
<i>come down here? We're three levels down</i>.

181
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,041
- Right away.
- How we doing over there?

182
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:53,673
- Nothing yet.
- Let's see what we can do.

183
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:57,074
We've only secured
a fraction of the place. It's huge.

184
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:01,031
- It might really be the lost city of Atlantis?
- That's a good bet.

185
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:03,194
Oh, my God!

186
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,355
We're underwater.

187
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:14,960
I'd say we're under
several hundred feet of ocean.

188
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:21,514
This could be a problem.

189
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:26,274
Oh, no!

190
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:30,520
<i>Dr Weir, I need to see you</i>
<i>in the control room immediately</i>.

191
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:37,353
The city has a shield,
a force field holding the water back.

192
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,993
Or it had a shield. Power systems
are nearing maximum entropy.

193
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,916
Our arrival hastened
their depletion big time.

194
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,395
The shield is collapsing rapidly. Several
sections of the city are already flooded.

195
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:53,193
- Can we use our own power generators?
- We probably don't have time to try.

196
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:57,072
When I say rapidly collapsing,
I mean rapidly.

197
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,563
Colonel Sumner,
order all your security teams

198
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:05,160
to stop searching the city and fall back
to the gate room immediately.

199
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:10,799
Sumner, do you copy?

200
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,517
Colonel Sumner drowned?

201
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:27,755
And he wasn't the only one to perish.

202
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:31,152
We should evacuate through the Stargate.

203
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,475
We can't. Power's been diverted
to the shield holding the ocean back.

204
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:38,157
Do we know why this is happening now?

205
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,235
Power consumption spiked
when we arrived.

206
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:43,871
- This is happening because we arrived?
- Yes.

207
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:48,594
- What about auxiliary power?
- I'll interface with one of our generators.

208
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:52,961
Grodin, see if you can locate
any gate addresses in the database.

209
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:57,560
There won't be enough power to get back
to Earth, but maybe enough for Pegasus.

210
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,362
Some of our team
discovered a bay full of ships.

211
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,798
Spaceships? We should check 'em out.

212
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:06,716
- You could figure out...?
- I can fly anything.

213
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:08,874
Good. Go.

214
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,321
- I'll start with this one.
- What am I looking for?

215
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,917
See how many people they can fit.

216
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:36,761
Two piers are almost entirely flooded,
the third about to collapse.

217
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,472
<i>Dr Weir, these ships</i>
<i>can hold several people each</i>.

218
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,111
<i>Learning how to fly 'em is another matter</i>.

219
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,399
I'll see if I can pull up a schematic.

220
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,316
- <i>This ship is different than the others</i>.
- How?

221
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:52,032
<i>It's a different control console</i>.
<i>Zelenka's on his way over</i>.

222
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,353
- Good. I'm on my way too.
- Oh, no!

223
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,356
- What's wrong?
- The city's in self-protect mode.

224
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,162
Bulkheads are slamming shut.
People are trapped.

225
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:03,918
- Wouldn't that protect them?
- Most rooms are already breached.

226
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,802
We've got people trapped
with water rising.

227
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:13,402
I'll try to override the system, but it could
hamper efforts to power the Stargate.

228
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:21,115
If these ships are our only way out,
don't wait too long to get to the bay.

229
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:26,680
- Rodney!
- Yes, yes, yes. I heard. Go.

230
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:35,471
- How are we doing?
- This ship is different.

231
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:38,521
- What does it do?
- I don't know. I need more time.

232
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,197
You don't have time!
It's airtight, I assume?

233
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:45,322
- It's a spaceship. It better be.
- <i>I've located a roof hatch</i>.

234
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,951
<i>I'll try to get it open</i>.

235
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,273
What was that?

236
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,480
Bulkhead doors have slammed shut.
We're locked in!

237
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:56,077
- <i>Can you get it open?</i>
- I'm trying!

238
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,639
Forget it! The gate room's flooding.

239
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:14,317
Get up here! We're waiting for you!

240
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,873
I'm trying to retract the roof.
As soon as it opens, you go.

241
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,603
- Rodney!
- <i>There's no time to argue</i>.

242
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:24,961
Catastrophic failure is imminent.
Just lock yourself in and go.

243
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,482
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>you could do</i>.

244
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,722
Within seconds
the control room was flooded.

245
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,760
I died?

246
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:41,916
You never gave up trying,
right until the end.

247
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:52,233
Well... a man wonders
how he would choose to go out,

248
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:55,201
given such dire circumstances.

249
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:59,641
- Now I know.
- Trying to save the lives of others.

250
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,192
But ultimately failing.

251
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,595
- I'm sure if I had a few more seconds...
- Wait.

252
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:10,233
Why didn't the failsafe mechanism engage
and raise the city?

253
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,759
Because there was
no failsafe the first time.

254
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,801
Atlantis remained on the ocean floor.

255
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:19,523
The shield completely collapsed.

256
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:25,440
Water came crashing in,
flooding every room in the city.

257
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:32,752
You both drowned while attempting
to get our people into ships.

258
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:40,401
And we, along with Dr Zelenka,
we found ourselves trapped.

259
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:43,555
We need to get outta here!

260
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,681
- Did McKay get the hatch open?
- I do not know.

261
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:56,836
<i>There's six of us stuck</i>
<i>in one of the ships! What do we do?</i>

262
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,242
- What did you do?
- I think I just turned it on.

263
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,200
Stand by, Sergeant.

264
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:06,754
I'm not much for instruction manuals,
but I could use one right about now.

265
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:16,117
- Oh, my God!
- We're in space. What happened?

266
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:20,117
- Now what did you do?
- I don't know. I just...

267
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:24,483
What was that?

268
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:34,679
We were under attack. We didn't know
where we were or who was shooting at us.

269
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,434
And that's when John...

270
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:44,162
- Carson!
- I need medical assistance asap.

271
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,560
How's she doing?

272
00:21:56,723 --> 00:22:00,796
Stabilised, but still very weak,
and getting weaker.

273
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:05,516
Your own mortality
staring you right in the face.

274
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:09,395
I can't imagine how you must be feeling.

275
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:13,638
When she looks at me,

276
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:18,001
it's as if she's sensing my thoughts,

277
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:21,075
and I'm sensing hers.

278
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:23,234
It's very unsettling.

279
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:26,600
Just when you thought
this place couldn't get any weirder.

280
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,358
The puddle jumper they escaped in
must have been a time machine,

281
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,639
had to have an additional component.

282
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:35,363
- Flux capacitor.
- Yeah.

283
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:39,436
The question is,
where's the time machine now, hmm?

284
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:43,357
Why don't we ask her?

285
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:48,759
What happened?

286
00:22:48,923 --> 00:22:53,519
Can you tell us? The ship
that you escaped in, where is it now?

287
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:57,755
It's gone.

288
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,234
- Who is shooting at us?
- How do we shoot back?

289
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,112
Did I do that?

290
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,998
Hang on!

291
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,354
The next thing I knew...

292
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,354
..I woke up here.

293
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:28,912
You mean now?

294
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,594
No. Then.

295
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,880
You're awake.

296
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,682
<i>His name was Janus</i>.

297
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:45,277
<i>He healed my wounds</i>

298
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,037
<i>and explained to me what had happened</i>.

299
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,876
Your ship was shot down.

300
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,035
We retrieved it from the ocean floor.

301
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:57,359
Major Sheppard, Dr Zelenka?

302
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,957
No one survived.

303
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:06,402
Ha! Ah, the bitter taste
of ultimate failure, hmm?

304
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:10,920
If you'd figured out how to fix the damn
shield, none of us would have died.

305
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,881
I valiantly attempted to save your sorry...

306
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:16,511
Gentlemen. Focus.

307
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,112
Please, continue.

308
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:26,394
Needless to say, I was very confused.

309
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:31,597
He explained to me
that the ship we had escaped in

310
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,721
was a time machine.

311
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:37,397
He was the one who built it.

312
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:42,398
After I was feeling better, he brought me
before the Atlantean Council.

313
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:45,077
We welcome you to the city of Atlantis.

314
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,642
Thank you.

315
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:50,193
Your arrival has come
at a time of great conflict.

316
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:55,118
We've been under siege and have
submerged our city for protection.

317
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:59,561
Yes, it's how we found the city
when we came through the Stargate.

318
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,317
- From Earth?
- Yes.

319
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,792
10,000 years from now.

320
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:10,041
It should be noted that our actions

321
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:14,116
have succeeded in protecting the city
for so many years.

322
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:17,878
Let us hope Dr Weir's arrival
has not altered this eventuality.

323
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:21,479
By encountering the Wraith,
she may have already set in motion

324
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:25,761
events that could lead to a future
far different from the one she left.

325
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:29,518
I'm sorry. What are the Wraith?

326
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:33,437
They told me of beings called Wraiths,

327
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:36,481
a vicious, formidable enemy

328
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:39,316
whose power and technology
rivalled their own.

329
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,633
Yes, actually, we've already...

330
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:44,522
The Atlanteans sent a delegation,

331
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:48,278
protected by
their most powerful warships,

332
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:51,241
in the faint hope of negotiating a truce.

333
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:55,555
One on one, the Atlantean ships
were more powerful,

334
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:57,998
but the Wraith were so many.

335
00:25:58,163 --> 00:26:04,079
After that great battle...
it was only a matter of time.

336
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:09,112
We're awaiting our offworld transport
ships before beginning our evacuation.

337
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:12,241
- Where will you go?
- We're returning to Earth.

338
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,997
You're welcome to join us.

339
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:19,041
Thank you. That's very kind, but...

340
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:24,994
I'm sure you must understand my desire
to return to the future, to my people.

341
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:28,200
I was hoping to be able
to use the time machine again

342
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:33,073
and programme it to arrive at the moment
we came through the Stargate,

343
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,155
and if you had a ZPM
I could take back with me,

344
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,314
that would help us considerably.

345
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,793
- The power systems were depleted...
- No.

346
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:46,035
Enough of this tampering with time.

347
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:50,321
- Causality is not to be treated lightly.
- No one's treating it lightly.

348
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,362
You are, with your insistence
on continuing these experiments,

349
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:57,196
despite the condemnation of this Council.

350
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:00,833
We ordered you to cease these activities
and yet here we sit,

351
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:04,234
face to face with a visitor from the future,

352
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:08,362
who arrived here in the very machine
you agreed not to construct.

353
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:12,759
We are about to evacuate this city

354
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,915
in the hope that it will lie safe
for many years

355
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,597
and then, one day, our kind will return.

356
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,478
And they have.

357
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,953
Because of my experiments,
we now have the opportunity...

358
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:29,638
Enough! We have no time for this.

359
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:36,556
I'm hereby ordering the destruction
of this time-travel device

360
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:39,795
and all the materials
connected with its design.

361
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:46,319
You are welcome to return to Earth
with our people.

362
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,917
You shall not be returning to yours.

363
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:08,480
The tests confirm her skeletal, muscular,
circulatory and neuroendocrine systems

364
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,713
have all been decimated by age.

365
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:15,673
I'm seeing renal failure, liver failure
and evidence of a stroke.

366
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:19,552
- How long does she have?
- I doubt she'll live out the night.

367
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,441
Please.

368
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:25,202
I don't know how much time I have left

369
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:28,673
to tell the story
I have waited so long to tell.

370
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:33,076
Oh...

371
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:37,316
The Council, they were very upset.

372
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,441
You said they decided
to destroy the time machine.

373
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:44,881
I tried to talk them out of it.
I didn't give up hope.

374
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:48,354
Thankfully, I had an ally.

375
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:52,994
You need to talk to Moros. Dr Weir was
brought here through no fault of her own.

376
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:56,473
- She shouldn't be punished.
- She's free to come to Earth.

377
00:28:56,643 --> 00:29:00,238
She needs to return to her time,
not remain in ours.

378
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:04,601
That's not possible. I'm sorry.

379
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:08,881
Wait. I don't think you understand
how far we've come,

380
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:12,513
or how much my people have sacrificed
in the hopes of meeting you.

381
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:18,434
We call you the Ancients,
the gate builders.

382
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:22,596
We've crossed galaxies in the hopes
of finding a great people.

383
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,880
Please, is there no other way
you can help?

384
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:31,513
We could block the Stargate permanently
after the evacuation.

385
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:34,322
That way, your team
will be unable to come here.

386
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:37,043
The city may never be found.

387
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:40,752
- But their lives would be saved.
- Thank you for your offer.

388
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:45,394
But we are explorers, just like you.

389
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,514
Which should come as no surprise,

390
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:51,561
since they are the second evolution
of our kind.

391
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:58,032
Don't you understand?
This city will survive 10,000 years.

392
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:07,115
The Council's decision is final.

393
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:16,792
Of course,
Janus refused to concede defeat.

394
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:22,394
The more someone told him not
to do something, the more he had to do it.

395
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:27,557
So he came up with an alternate plan
behind the Council's back.

396
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:32,793
It was all I could do
to try to keep pace with him.

397
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:44,398
May I ask what it is you're doing?

398
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,758
Calculating the necessary power needed.

399
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:51,872
- Needed for...?
- The shield collapsed after your arrival.

400
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:55,194
I have to find a way
to extend the supply of power.

401
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:03,395
- What is it you called them?
- ZPM. Zero-point module.

402
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,554
Yes.

403
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:11,353
They operate in parallel, providing power
to the city simultaneously.

404
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:14,799
However, used in sequence,
it may be possible

405
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:18,353
to sustain the necessary power
for the needed time.

406
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,957
<i>I couldn't believe my eyes</i>.

407
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:27,116
<i>Three ZPMs right in front of me</i>.

408
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:31,276
There is one small problem, however.

409
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:36,312
Someone will need to remain to transfer
the power from one device to the other,

410
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,361
to rotate them sequentially.

411
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:43,232
- Over thousands of years?
- It is possible.

412
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:49,233
<i>Janus, please report to Central Control</i>.

413
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:55,123
Their transport ship was inbound.
It was taking heavy fire.

414
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:02,199
<i>Cloaking shields damaged</i>.
<i>We're returning fire</i>.

415
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:05,275
- There's too many enemy ships.
- And more coming.

416
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,911
Engage auxiliary power.
Try to outrun them.

417
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:16,114
There are over 300 people
on that transport.

418
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,194
<i>The shields are down!</i>

419
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:28,073
Begin evacuation. We must leave now.

420
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,877
Damn. Fell asleep again.

421
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:04,432
Well, you're not the only one.

422
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:11,075
- Are you in any pain?
- Would we admit it if we were?

423
00:33:14,163 --> 00:33:17,075
I wish there was more
we could do for you.

424
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,313
Look at you.

425
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:23,840
Always worrying.
You put too much pressure on yourself.

426
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:29,361
Remember that miserable
Baltic negotiation?

427
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:33,037
What Simon told us afterwards?

428
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:37,037
"Breathe", among other things.

429
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,961
Enjoy the moment, what's here right now.

430
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:47,514
The sun... the breeze.

431
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,720
Our birthday.

432
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:56,237
Sheppard couldn't keep it to himself, huh?

433
00:33:57,483 --> 00:34:00,475
I'm just saying stop being
so damn hard on yourself.

434
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,440
Life is quick.

435
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:12,154
- Not for you.
- It was my choice, Elizabeth.

436
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:18,273
I didn't second-guess it then,
and I don't regret it now.

437
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:34,717
- Where is Dr Weir?
- She's gone through the gate.

438
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,078
She was among the first to evacuate.

439
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,234
Good.

440
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:57,438
<i>Janus prepared</i>
<i>the stasis chamber for me,</i>

441
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:01,118
<i>said it would be like</i>
<i>a deep, dreamless sleep</i>.

442
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:04,116
I'm inputting commands
for the system to revive you

443
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:07,673
at intervals of 3.3 thousand years
to rotate the ZPMs.

444
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:11,597
I'll give you instructions
on how to reactivate the stasis process.

445
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:14,357
I'm entering commands
to commence final revival

446
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:18,801
the moment sensors indicate
the presence of your... expedition team.

447
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:25,038
Look, I feel that I must tell you
that there is a possibility,

448
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:28,673
remote as it is,
that this might not succeed.

449
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:31,202
I know.

450
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,797
It's impossible to predict what'll happen.

451
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:36,033
I'm convinced that you will survive.

452
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:43,637
But if you don't, I've programmed
a failsafe mechanism to protect the city.

453
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,680
- A failsafe?
- Yes.

454
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:50,041
If the power drains, the mechanism
holding the city will release

455
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:53,195
and it will rise to the surface.

456
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:54,682
Really?

457
00:35:57,883 --> 00:36:00,681
<i>And then they left, all of them,</i>

458
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:03,437
<i>returning to Earth through the Stargate</i>.

459
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:12,918
What's all that?

460
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,597
My research.

461
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:17,879
You're gonna build another time ship.

462
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,762
Doubt I'll succeed.
The Council will be watching.

463
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,232
I'm sure you'll find a way.

464
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:30,435
I've blocked all addresses
to the gate except Earth. You will be safe.

465
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:35,322
- Thank you.
- Thank you...

466
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:39,715
for giving me the hope that Atlantis
will survive another 10,000 years

467
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:42,477
after you discover it again.

468
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:07,274
I'm ready.

469
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,952
<i>And then I was alone</i>.

470
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,992
I set the city to slumber...

471
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,716
..and began my long journey home.

472
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:40,081
It worked... the stasis, the failsafe.

473
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:43,952
You gave up your entire life.

474
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:49,556
No, because we are the same person.

475
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:54,721
The best part of my life is just beginning.

476
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:57,716
I'm exploring a new galaxy.

477
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:04,482
I have years ahead of me still.

478
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,512
Trust yourself, Elizabeth.

479
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:18,722
All that matters is right now.

480
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:27,959
And the note,
I wrote it in case I didn't survive.

481
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:30,593
Has Rodney figured it out yet?

482
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:35,516
- Five gate addresses.
- Outposts.

483
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:40,313
Each one with a zero-point module.

484
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:43,714
Janus told me.

485
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:50,597
The note she left, it's coordinates
of planets to have known ZPMs.

486
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:59,273
- They could still be there.
- M7G-677! We've got...

487
00:40:47,963 --> 00:40:51,399
We're about to start
our mission briefing, so...

488
00:40:51,563 --> 00:40:53,554
I'll be right there.

489
00:40:55,803 --> 00:41:00,399
Actually, John...
give me a minute, will you?

490
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,274
Sure.
