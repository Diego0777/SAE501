1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,399
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:10,600
It can't be a storm.
It stretches across the whole horizon.

3
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:14,358
- It covers 20% of the planet.
- If you want them to live, gate them off.

4
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:17,560
In the next hour there'll be
under ten people on Atlantis.

5
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,873
We cannot pass up this opportunity.

6
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:24,556
What is the one thing keeping us
from having a shield? Electricity.

7
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:28,875
Atlantis is designed to withstand lightning
strikes. There are rods everywhere.

8
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:32,319
If we disabled the grounding stations,
the energy could be used

9
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,474
to charge up the shield generators.

10
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,679
We're waiting in the jumper.

11
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:45,081
A small Genii strike force has gated in.

12
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:48,394
- Why are you doing this?
- You possess supplies we need.

13
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:51,396
The C4 explosive.
All of your medical supplies.

14
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:55,681
As of right now,
we are in control of Atlantis.

15
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:57,834
Say goodbye to Dr Weir.

16
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>And now the conclusion</i>.

17
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:04,076
Kolya!

18
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,360
Kolya, don't do this!

19
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:10,559
How does this help get what you want?

20
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:13,396
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.

21
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:16,236
- You can't do this. You need her.
- She's right.

22
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:20,396
There are codes required that only
she knows. You can't do it without her.

23
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:26,920
You can't do this without me, either.
We're a package deal.

24
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,519
You take us out of the equation
and you don't have an end-game.

25
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,359
That's a chess term.

26
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:38,038
My point is, we're the only ones
who can fix the grounding station,

27
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:40,273
the only ones
who can solve any problem!

28
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:43,992
You kill either one of us
and you don't get what you want!

29
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,154
- It's important...
- Rodney...

30
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,598
Rodney, he gets it.

31
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:58,352
- I appreciate...
- You're an asset we need for this mission.

32
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,720
- You stood in front of a gun for me.
- Don't thank me yet.

33
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:10,000
2½ hours till the storm hits,
and unless our luck changes,

34
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,552
this city is gonna be obliterated.

35
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:33,197
Major Sheppard, how's this for credibility?
Weir is dead.

36
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:38,552
- I'm going to kill you.
- <i>Maybe</i>.

37
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,478
Stay out of my way or McKay will join her.

38
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,194
This is amazing.

39
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,794
There you are.

40
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:32,194
We're here. Take two men.
Head there, four levels down.

41
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,077
- That's Sheppard.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:39,558
Let's go. You're with me.

43
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,679
He's heading out of the hallways.

44
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:06,354
- Holy...!
- Right, that's it!

45
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:12,080
- What are you doing, man?
- Adding weight to the puddle jumper.

46
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:15,155
- Don't screw with the controls.
- Can't be too careful.

47
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:19,794
You can be way too careful. There's
no chance we're gonna blow away.

48
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:22,272
- Let it go.
- That should be enough.

49
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,911
How much longer until the storm passes?

50
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,042
I guess we're barely halfway through,
but there's no way to tell.

51
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:37,479
I know. I hope they're OK, too.

52
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:27,354
What's this, then?

53
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:31,321
- We're through it?
- We can't be.

54
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,273
That's not possible.

55
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:02,999
He's moving.

56
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:13,197
Are you sure
we're on the right level?

57
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:28,799
- <i>Where did he go?</i>
- Sh! He can probably hear you.

58
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:50,554
Will you look at this?!

59
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:56,040
How bad is this?!
That is just never gonna be useful again!

60
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,160
I should be able to bypass
the switching station entirely.

61
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,032
- Good. How long?
- It's not half as bad as it looks.

62
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,036
- I'd say 15, 20 minutes, tops.
- Good.

63
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:21,036
- Dr Weir, I need you to...
- Right, of course.

64
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:24,632
Keep that there.

65
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,474
- We're in the eye.
- Right. Has to be.

66
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,962
- The eye?
- Dead centre of the storm.

67
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:14,001
The storm swirls around
a 20 to 40 kilometre-wide area.

68
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:15,881
Then this calm will not last?

69
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:19,558
No. In fact, in about ten minutes,
it's gonna get very ugly again.

70
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:24,001
- We have to help the major.
- We can take off, but landing's hard.

71
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,313
- What if it's reached Atlantis?
- Has it?

72
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,032
- It will any time now.
- Stop wasting time. Let's go.

73
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,161
We still have to fly through the storm.
It's insanity.

74
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,678
This is a spaceship.
We can fly up and over.

75
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,722
Straight up and down? I'm a bloody
medical doctor, not a magician!

76
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,000
- You can do it.
- If we can help, we must.

77
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:47,922
Oh, crap.

78
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,672
20 feet away.

79
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:05,602
- Five feet.
- There's so much smoke. Which way?

80
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,556
- You're right on top of him.
- Yeah? I think I would see him if I was.

81
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:14,714
Stand by.

82
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,074
Do you see him?

83
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,554
Did you get him?

84
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,714
Report.

85
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,636
- <i>Commander</i>.
- Yes, Sora.

86
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:49,557
Laden has been leading three of our men
on a reconnaissance mission.

87
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,601
Major Sheppard has killed
three more of our strike team.

88
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:55,960
Tell everyone to move back
to the control room.

89
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:02,200
Why did you tell him you could
have this fixed in 20 minutes?

90
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:05,958
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe so he wouldn't kill us!

91
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,719
I understand that, but once the shield
is operational, we won't be very useful.

92
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:13,443
Why did you let me tell him
I could fix it in 20?

93
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:16,640
- You have to stall him.
- I told him how long it'll take.

94
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:19,158
Find another problem with it.

95
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:23,362
Tell them that the power loop interface
isn't jiving with your walkabout.

96
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,878
- Isn't jiving?
- Rodney, you get my point.

97
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:29,561
By the sounds of it,
if we can buy Sheppard enough time,

98
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,999
he can take care
of the rest of them on his own.

99
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:37,275
Radio Chief Cowen.
Tell him to send reinforcements.

100
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,957
A full company.

101
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:44,833
If you're hoping Major Sheppard can
diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.

102
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:58,557
OK. What would McKay do?

103
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:12,156
- You're coming in a little steep, Doc.
- Thank you. I'm very aware of that.

104
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,473
I told you not to play with the controls.

105
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:18,352
I'm sure I got 'em back right.
Why don't you try to contact the major?

106
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,912
First you gotta get us in there.

107
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,840
What are you up to?

108
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,075
What's he done now?

109
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:56,272
I should have seen this coming.

110
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:04,632
Commander. Major Sheppard
has cut power to the control room.

111
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:07,112
How?

112
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,161
Atlantis is being powered
by five small generators,

113
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,553
each responsible for a separate area.

114
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:18,672
Major Sheppard has disabled the
generator that powers Stargate operations.

115
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:21,835
We still have most primary operations.

116
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,152
We have definitely lost
all secondary systems.

117
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:31,957
Can you still track Sheppard?

118
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,714
No.

119
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:39,476
- Then we have no idea where he is now?
- <i>No, sir</i>.

120
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:45,999
- <i>Is the control room secure?</i>
- <i>Yes, Commander</i>.

121
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,882
<i>I suggest we send men</i>
<i>to guard the generators</i>.

122
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:52,240
<i>No! He's trying to divide us</i>
<i>into manageable numbers</i>.

123
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:56,078
Just hold Stargate operations
until the reinforcements arrive.

124
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,234
<i>Understood</i>.

125
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:10,722
If he asks what's taking so long,
you do the talking.

126
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,875
- You'll be fine.
- No, I won't. I'm a terrible bluffer.

127
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:18,753
I've lost small fortunes at poker.
My eye twitches, I laugh. It's not pretty.

128
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,801
What's our progress?

129
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:24,352
We've hit a small snag.

130
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:28,311
We're running a diagnosis
to make sure we can interface our codes.

131
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,921
It's a small snag.
It's like half an hour at the most.

132
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,471
Sheppard has just disabled
another generator.

133
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:44,239
Yes, Laden, I'm aware of that. He's cut
the power to grounding station three.

134
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,394
Can it still be repaired?

135
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,714
Without power, no.

136
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,634
Can the plan be completed without it?

137
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,601
The other three grounding stations
have been disabled.

138
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,913
No, no, it's just not good enough.

139
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,358
Look, by uncoupling
the grounding stations,

140
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:07,596
when lightning strikes the city,
the electricity'll have nowhere to go.

141
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:09,993
If we can channel the electricity properly

142
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:12,518
to the conduits
that mine the city corridors,

143
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:15,516
we should be able
to power the shield temporarily.

144
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,117
If any grounding stations are left active,

145
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:22,481
a sizeable amount of electricity
will find its way to ground, and no shield.

146
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,198
The storm has not slowed its pace.

147
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,673
We have little time.
We should re-evaluate our goals, perhaps.

148
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,801
We have more than enough time
to complete our objectives.

149
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:39,592
Then I must strongly advise that
we send men to repair the generators

150
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:41,560
and to guard the active ones.

151
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:44,954
Agreed. Teams of two,
but you watch over the control room.

152
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:50,197
As soon as the reinforcements arrive,
have them take Sheppard with force.

153
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,877
Understood.

154
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:59,033
Perhaps we could be under shelter.
I'm liable to catch a cold like that.

155
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,833
I take it that's a no?

156
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:21,001
Remain here and be still.
I will return for you.

157
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:24,080
- Where are we going?
- Armoury.

158
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:25,562
Are you sure...

159
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:29,318
You know you're always saying
you don't have to take orders?

160
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:33,112
- Now you do.
- So long as it's temporary.

161
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:46,193
- Shall we contact the major?
- The Genii may be monitoring us.

162
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,923
We do not want to alert them
of our presence.

163
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,199
Life-signs detector.

164
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:55,402
These dots don't tell us who's who.
How do we know which one's the major?

165
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:58,282
He'll be the dot
getting rid of the other dots.

166
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:24,560
- How many should we expect?
- A full company. 60 or more.

167
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,995
I don't know how we were expected
to do it with any less.

168
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:32,678
It was supposed to be a raid
to retrieve what was rightfully ours.

169
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,639
With me. Come on.

170
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,202
Reinforcements are arriving now,
Commander.

171
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:49,639
Have them secure Stargate operations
and report back to me.

172
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,794
Yes, Commander.

173
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:59,479
Secure the area. Anyone...

174
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:02,840
Shut it off, Laden!

175
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:05,642
- Stop him!
- Up there!

176
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:13,518
This is Sora. Stop sending reinforcements.
The shield has been raised.

177
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:18,356
- <i>Sheppard has raised the gate shield</i>.
- Shut it down.

178
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:23,195
- <i>Turn it off</i>.
- I don't know how. Laden is unconscious.

179
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,513
- Tell her.
- I don't know what he's done.

180
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:28,151
- Tell her!
- He must have added a command code.

181
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,961
- What is it?
- I don't know!

182
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:34,435
- Only Sheppard would know it.
- Trust me, I would help you if I could.

183
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:37,751
You have command codes.

184
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,558
It's no use.

185
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,032
It's over.

186
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,442
The gate has shut down.
There are no more men coming.

187
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:57,637
How many men made it?

188
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,398
Five. Five of sixty.

189
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,957
You still need me, if you want this city.

190
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,477
You still need both of us.

191
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:51,754
He's entered some sort of security code
to lock down the gate.

192
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,357
Give me some time.
Should be able to crack it.

193
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:56,479
Do it.

194
00:19:56,643 --> 00:20:00,113
Commander, Laden thinks
he can have the gate fixed.

195
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,518
Did Athor's son make it through the gate?

196
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,480
I'm sorry?

197
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,555
His name is Idos. Did he make it?

198
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:11,714
No, sir.

199
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,879
Over 60 men killed!

200
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,877
Defending his home and his people,
Commander, as we would.

201
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,474
When can more reinforcements be sent?

202
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,362
- It will take time, perhaps an hour.
- Unacceptable.

203
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:31,673
Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable.

204
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,482
By then, we will be
in the full force of the storm.

205
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,032
Probably sooner.

206
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,195
<i>Major Sheppard,</i>
<i>I have a proposition for you</i>.

207
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:10,392
- Do you recognise that voice?
- No.

208
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,479
Kolya, I'm having a hard time keeping up.
What's the score?

209
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:18,921
My men have informed me that not only
have you disabled crucial generators,

210
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,520
but you've stolen key components which
make it impossible for them to be restored.

211
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,038
Yeah, I did that.

212
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,717
There are two flaws in your plan.

213
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,716
I'm always open to constructive criticism.

214
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:34,113
One: the assumption I would believe

215
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:37,958
you'd rather destroy the city,
than let it fall to us, is childish.

216
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:41,081
- Doesn't sound like me.
- Second...

217
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,235
If and when I determine
Atlantis unsalvageable,

218
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,281
<i>Drs Weir and McKay become obsolete</i>.

219
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,116
Weir's alive?

220
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:54,037
Dr McKay was able to make a strong case
for keeping her alive.

221
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,194
<i>Let me talk to her</i>.

222
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:04,398
Sheppard, we're both here.

223
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:09,840
- It's good to hear your voice.
- That's good to hear.

224
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:13,962
We have less than one hour
before the storm hits full force.

225
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:20,995
If the power is not returned to grounding
station three in ten minutes, Dr Weir dies.

226
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:26,882
- Again, you mean?
- Her death will buy you ten minutes,

227
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:30,797
after which, should the power still be out,
Dr McKay dies.

228
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:34,478
We will then leave with what we can
and the city will be destroyed.

229
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,440
That's not enough time.

230
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:40,881
If you don't mind destroying Atlantis,
stay where you are for 20 minutes.

231
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:43,162
Starting now.

232
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,991
Don't load up so much it'll slow you down.
Two extra magazines each.

233
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:05,158
- All right.
- What d'you need that for?

234
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:08,520
- Anything moving's gonna get shot.
- What if it's the major?

235
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:11,243
He'll get hit with a stunner
instead of a P-90.

236
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:14,395
- What if he sees us first?
- He'll hear you first.

237
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,123
- Are you telling me to shut up again?
- Again.

238
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,994
Right.

239
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:35,674
Let's go.

240
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,712
Which generator powers
grounding station three?

241
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:47,353
- You're asking me?
- Whichever one it is, we gotta be there.

242
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:49,514
- There's one here.
- Is that a guess?

243
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:52,072
- Aye, but it makes sense.
- It's the closest.

244
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:55,838
I'll take point. Teyla, on our six.
You, don't open your mouth.

245
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,881
- Only shoot at what I tell you to.
- Don't be so pushy.

246
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,034
That's an order.

247
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,841
Stop!

248
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:39,642
Look, your boss wanted me
to turn this thing back on.

249
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:42,522
- I think we should do what he says.
- Be quiet.

250
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:50,720
- Sora, we have him.
- Keep him alive. I'm on my way.

251
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:16,236
- Is it the wrong one?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

252
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:19,156
Don't you blame me for this.
I'm not an engineer.

253
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:23,236
I only have a basic understanding
of how Rodney configures the power, so...

254
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:26,600
You just can't stop talking.
No matter what I say...

255
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:30,199
You're such a nice lad,
until you're in charge, you cheeky bugger!

256
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:34,914
Wait. What if this is the right station
and the major has not made it back yet?

257
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:37,834
She's right.

258
00:25:38,923 --> 00:25:41,517
No. No, this one's working.

259
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,752
- How much time?
- Two minutes.

260
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:49,155
There's five generators. It's not this one
or the one powering the control tower.

261
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:52,679
That leaves three. One-in-three chance
of guessing the right one.

262
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,074
We may walk into the ambush
we're trying to save him from.

263
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:59,713
Are any of the generators
near a transport station?

264
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:02,522
- Aye, there's two.
- Let's go.

265
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:16,680
- OK, now, if I remember correctly...
- Remember correctly.

266
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:20,631
- I think they're here and here.
- Which one is next to a generator?

267
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:22,839
- Give me a moment.
- Pick one!

268
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:26,313
- I'm the one you're gonna blame.
- We have to go now.

269
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:30,394
Here.

270
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:37,878
I don't mean to be bad, but Kolya'll kill my
people if I don't get this turned back on.

271
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,522
Turn around.

272
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,757
- You turn around.
- What?

273
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:56,873
If I have to turn around,
you should turn around.

274
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,118
- What took you so long?
- The storm...

275
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,274
Hold that thought.

276
00:27:12,243 --> 00:27:15,041
It seems Major Sheppard
wants you to live.

277
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:17,194
Let's get back to work.

278
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:30,680
- You OK, sir?
- Been better, been worse.

279
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:33,198
- Shoulder's sore.
- Want me to take a look?

280
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:36,799
- Take a rain check, Doc.
- We should leave. More Genii will come.

281
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:38,954
I couldn't agree more.

282
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:58,237
- If this doesn't work...
- It will.

283
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:01,042
- I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...
- It will.

284
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:05,196
- I'm sure it will, but if it doesn't...
- Rodney.

285
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:08,481
Please.

286
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:42,635
- Fantastic.
- Oh, thank God.

287
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:50,795
McKay figures he can harness
the storm's lightning.

288
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,273
- This lightning?
- SG teams have done it before.

289
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,753
- There's a big difference...
- I didn't say you could talk.

290
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:06,361
Now... I need to run the sub-routine

291
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:09,242
that will convince the buffer
to the shield generator

292
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:12,042
to attenuate the raw electricity
into useful power.

293
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:16,594
I can only do that from the control room,
using Dr Weir's codes.

294
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,401
Yes.

295
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:22,397
Only primary systems are operating.
Sheppard has to repair the generators.

296
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:28,001
The shield's considered a primary system.
We're good to go, but we have to go now.

297
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:31,235
I mean now, I mean everybody,
all your men.

298
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,553
What does that have to do with my men?

299
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:35,839
Now the grounding station's deactivated,

300
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:40,838
electricity will flow through the conduits
that line every corridor in the city.

301
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:44,598
- What kind of plan is that?
- A McKay kind of plan. It's all we got.

302
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:49,200
- It leaves us only one place to go.
- Where the Genii will also be.

303
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:52,833
The control room and Stargate operations
are shielded.

304
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:56,996
The rest of the city...
once lightning starts to hit...

305
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:00,792
Anybody left in the hallway
is as good as dead.

306
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,996
- Why haven't you responded?
- <i>She's here</i>.

307
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:21,961
- Who?
- Teyla and two others joined Sheppard.

308
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:26,321
Why wasn't this reported sooner?
Fall back to the control room immediately.

309
00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:29,281
She's just out of my reach. If I'm patient...

310
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:32,719
- <i>I gave you an order</i>.
- She left my father for dead.

311
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:35,078
The storm is upon us.
The city's not safe.

312
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:39,282
- I don't care.
- Fall back. Your father will be avenged.

313
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:42,241
- By me.
- <i>Sora</i>...

314
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:51,119
- Will the hunters in the jumper be safe?
- Jumper bay's part of Stargate operations.

315
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:55,196
- That's where we should be headed.
- Weir and McKay will be expendable.

316
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:59,754
- We gotta take the control room first.
- Would he kill them for being of no use?

317
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:03,154
No, he'd kill them to punish me.
Here's the deal.

318
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:06,554
Ford and I go to the control room.
You head to the jumper bay.

319
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:10,511
- I intend to fight alongside you.
- I intend you to fight with us.

320
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:13,641
Lower the ship into the gate room.
Open the weapons pods.

321
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:16,192
Should be enough distraction
for us to go in.

322
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:21,118
We take the control room, get the shield
up, city saved, Weir and McKay saved...

323
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:23,080
take the rest of the day off.

324
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:26,633
- Sounds like a plan, sir.
- Stay on channel two. Let's move out.

325
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:30,239
You're not gonna need that thing.
Shoot to kill.

326
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:41,278
The winds are getting stronger
and the wave heights are growing.

327
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,434
- We need to keep stalling.
- What for?

328
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:46,913
- Major Sheppard is still out there.
- Now, McKay.

329
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,677
It's done. Dr Weir,
I need to enter your codes.

330
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:54,042
Yes, of course.

331
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,512
79...

332
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,913
421.

333
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,722
Yes?

334
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:05,842
- 03245.
- And the second sequence?

335
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,637
I'll be glad when following orders is over...

336
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:18,432
Drop it!

337
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,474
I'll kill him.

338
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:31,837
I would hate to kill you so quickly.

339
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:36,360
I've known you almost all your life.
Why are you doing this?

340
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:38,991
- You left him to die.
- He killed an innocent.

341
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,473
- He alerted the Wraith to our presence.
- And you escaped.

342
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:44,873
If I am to die by your hand, Sora,

343
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:49,639
I die knowing there was nothing
I could have done to have saved Tyrus.

344
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,154
We're in position.

345
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,839
- This isn't right.
- What?

346
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:05,722
They should have made it
to the jumper bay first.

347
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,839
They should have been waiting for us.

348
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,994
Teyla, what's your position?

349
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:13,879
Teyla?

350
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:20,080
This was my father's.
It was handed down from his father.

351
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:25,274
If you want to fight this way,
Sora, I will win.

352
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:28,401
You will have avenged no one.

353
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:30,201
We'll see.

354
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,119
- Engage the shield.
- Almost finished.

355
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,672
A massive wave is approaching.

356
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,799
- Without the shield...
- McKay.

357
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:56,276
We're getting hits on the northern pier.
Routing power to the corridor now.

358
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:01,639
Now.

359
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,358
Now.

360
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,396
- OK, this is a problem.
- What?

361
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:12,234
I told you this was a long shot.

362
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:15,236
We have serious flooding
on the north and west piers.

363
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,475
The city conduits just can't handle
this kind of raw power.

364
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:21,874
- Is any power getting to the shield?
- Nowhere near enough.

365
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:25,433
- You said this would work.
- I'm an extremely arrogant man.

366
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:28,401
I tend to think all of my plans will work.

367
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,958
- Idiot!
- This was a long shot at best.

368
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:36,762
Why else would we evacuate the city?

369
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:40,632
It was always our intention
to dial out in case this didn't work.

370
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,438
Within minutes, Atlantis will fail.

371
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:49,433
You can leave and survive,
or you can go down with the city.

372
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:55,912
You choose.

373
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:28,919
Ow!

374
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,718
We're not getting enough power
to the shield.

375
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:41,636
Are you gonna sacrifice
the lives of all of your men

376
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:46,274
on the off chance that this city
won't be completely destroyed?

377
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:53,153
Open the Stargate.
Start evacuating the remaining men.

378
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:57,640
- You're making the right decision.
- You're coming with us.

379
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:59,395
What?

380
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:02,635
- As payment for what you've done.
- What we've done?

381
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:31,954
Change of plan.

382
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:40,037
- You get McKay.
- This is a bad idea!

383
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,081
You saw what happened with my last plan.
This is not...

384
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:52,914
You're not going anywhere.

385
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:56,552
I will shoot you if you don't let her go.

386
00:36:58,203 --> 00:37:00,512
And risk hurting Dr Weir?

387
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,318
I'm not aiming at her.

388
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:15,562
Find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure
that's all of 'em. Sorry. I had to...

389
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:18,442
- You OK?
- No.

390
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,401
You will be. Come on.

391
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:30,719
- What are you doing?
- I thought I'd activate the shield.

392
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:35,479
- Teyla and Beckett are still out there.
- There's a tsunami heading for the city.

393
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:39,875
- In two and a half minutes they're dead.
- Then give 'em two minutes.

394
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:01,037
This is not what your father
would have wanted.

395
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:06,277
- Our people were destined to be allies.
- <i>Fall back to the control room</i>.

396
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:09,355
This must end now!

397
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,514
Then end it!

398
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:33,238
There's no more time.
We either lose them or we lose the city.

399
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,878
- Rodney, go!
- Going!

400
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:59,199
- What's happening?
- It just needs to build up enough power.

401
00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:01,558
Wait for it.

402
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,282
Carson.

403
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:11,957
- Rodney.
- Just in time to see how this ends.

404
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,714
Now!

405
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:35,082
- Nice work, Rodney.
- Did you ever doubt me?

406
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:38,235
Yes, several times.

407
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:41,201
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.

408
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:56,800
- What do you wanna do with her?
- I don't know yet.

409
00:39:56,963 --> 00:39:59,523
We'll keep her locked up
for the time being.

410
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:02,641
Maybe releasing her to the Genii
would help ease tension.

411
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:05,112
You're extremely optimistic,
you know that?

412
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:08,002
- You think so?
- Everyone getting back OK?

413
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:11,439
- Looks like it.
- How fares our city?

414
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:14,515
We're pumping out
the lower levels of the east pier.

415
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,913
There is structural damage.
Nothing serious.

416
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:21,042
Beckett suffered from a minor concussion.
I had to do this myself.

417
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:24,798
Still, on the bright side,
I've had my first decent meal in 24 hours,

418
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:28,399
so, all things considered,
I would say we are just fine.

419
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:31,919
- These things happen every 20 years?
- That's what they tell us.

420
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:36,160
How far in advance can we book days off?

421
