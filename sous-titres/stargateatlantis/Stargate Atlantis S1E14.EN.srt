1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,194
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis</i>...

2
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:10,036
What do we know about the Wraith?

3
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:13,752
They are the enemy
that defeated the Ancients.

4
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:16,960
<i>A few hundred years pass</i>
<i>before they awaken</i>.

5
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,318
We have visited many worlds.

6
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,838
I know of none untouched by the Wraith.

7
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:26,315
You are doomed, as are any humans
that stand in our way.

8
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:29,998
- The Ancients researched ascension.
- What is ascension?

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,916
Where they rid themselves
of their physical bodies

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:37,042
and rise to a higher plane of existence
where they live as pure energy.

11
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:49,351
- I count two. How about you?
- Yes, sir. I recommend shooting back.

12
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:52,196
That hit must've caused
some damage. McKay?

13
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,718
- I'm on it.
- Where did they come from?

14
00:00:55,923 --> 00:01:00,713
The darts are short-range fighters.
There's probably a hive ship somewhere.

15
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:03,602
- Then we need to get out of here.
- Yes, we do.

16
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,312
- The Stargate is the other way.
- This is the scenic route. McKay!

17
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:10,714
- I'm almost there.
- There's one on our tail!

18
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:14,114
- Keep your eye on the other one.
- You should have weapons.

19
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,602
- Negative.
- Sure?

20
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:18,357
- Positive!
- I'm pretty sure I fixed it.

21
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,639
Well, obviously you didn't!

22
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,038
We could lose them in the atmosphere.

23
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:26,956
- Two more darts on our two o'clock.
- I see 'em. McKay!

24
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:30,001
It's not like I'm holding back on you.

25
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,594
Hang on!

26
00:01:57,123 --> 00:02:01,833
- The Wraith darts have been destroyed.
- That's a good thing.

27
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:06,519
I thought for sure we were dead.
Didn't you think we were dead?

28
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:09,322
- What was that?
- Some sort of energy weapon.

29
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:12,077
What do you say we find out?

30
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,394
Yeah.

31
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:25,754
So, just to confirm,
we're all still... definitely not dead.

32
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,483
- I feel very much alive.
- Good. Same here.

33
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,873
- Wish I knew what that was.
- Lightning?

34
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:34,194
- Space lightning?
- It's some sort of an energy weapon.

35
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:37,833
- One that destroys Wraith darts.
- But why them and not us?

36
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,834
Assuming that we're still alive,

37
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:43,837
and there doesn't appear to be
any damage, we can conclude that...

38
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,235
Um... um...

39
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:52,521
I got nothing to conclude.
I'm just talking for the sake of talking.

40
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,834
- Are you sure you're OK?
- I hate certain death.

41
00:03:56,003 --> 00:04:00,042
- You're alive.
- Could it be naturally occurring?

42
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:03,752
- My money's on non-naturally.
- A weapon the Ancients left?

43
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:06,517
A weapon that impressive
would be powered by...

44
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:09,277
A zero-point module.
We need to get down there.

45
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,561
I've got to put down and check for damage
anyway before we head back.

46
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:29,635
If there is a weapon somewhere
down here, sir, these folks didn't build it.

47
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,159
Not these kids. Picking up anything?

48
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:36,520
Everything, just nothing worth mentioning.

49
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,834
- These folks look familiar?
- The Stargate is in orbit.

50
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,358
My people could never
have ventured here.

51
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:45,959
Right. What say we venture?

52
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,914
Hi.

53
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:15,194
It's OK. We're friendly.

54
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,394
Hi.

55
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:23,276
It is likely they have never seen anyone
from outside their village.

56
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:37,675
Welcome.

57
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:42,314
I am Zarah, one of the abbots of Proculis.

58
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:44,075
I'm John. John Sheppard.

59
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,555
This is Teyla, Lieutenant Ford
and Dr McKay.

60
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:52,194
Please, come.

61
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:17,402
This is the first time,
at least in my own lifetime,

62
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:21,192
that people from another land
have come to us.

63
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:24,275
Well, we came by ship.

64
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:30,882
A flying... thing that allows us
to move from one world to another.

65
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:36,356
- Another world?
- From among the stars in the night sky.

66
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,242
We are peaceful explorers.

67
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:43,032
Then glory to Athar
for bringing you here safely.

68
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:49,072
- Athar?
- The provider and protector of all.

69
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,722
Surely you know.

70
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:54,273
Athar is known by many names
among the stars.

71
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,559
Is Athar around?

72
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:59,954
We'd love to talk to him. We're friends.

73
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:04,401
Athar is friend to all, and with us always.

74
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,554
Even now.

75
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:10,318
Of course. Hi, Athar.

76
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:14,874
What Dr McKay means
is that we wish to offer our thanks.

77
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:19,673
We were attacked by the Wraith and would
have been killed were it not for Athar.

78
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,038
Wraith?

79
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:25,718
Pale skin, sunken eyes,
suck the life out of you with their hands.

80
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:28,602
We have never encountered such beings.

81
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,958
Never?

82
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,921
And there is no mention of them
in your history?

83
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,837
None. I can assure you
that for many thousands of years

84
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:41,154
we have lived here in peace.

85
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:45,163
Could you excuse us for a moment?

86
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:48,918
Of course. Please, I must tell
the other abbots of your arrival

87
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,119
before we go to meet with Chaya.

88
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:55,276
- Chaya is...?
- The high priestess of Athar.

89
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,922
This is a great day for our people.

90
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:03,763
Ours too.

91
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:09,032
- I'm not kidding. This could really work.
- I agree, Major.

92
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:13,196
Every inhabited world I have encountered
has been ravaged by the Wraith.

93
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,399
It's protected by an Ancient weapon.

94
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,599
- This confirms it.
- Does it?

95
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,994
The power requirements
must be astronomical.

96
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,438
Only a ZPM could generate that.

97
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,675
They do not appear to be
technologically advanced.

98
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:29,994
Unless that guy was lying.
He doesn't seem like the lying type.

99
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:32,802
So, automated defences?

100
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:37,241
Imagine a world where displaced refugees
could come and live in peace

101
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:39,871
without fear of being culled by the Wraith.

102
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:43,922
- We can negotiate a treaty.
- We need access to the weapon or ZPM.

103
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,440
- Not that we'd steal it.
- Let's try to stay on our best behaviour.

104
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,878
I'm always on my best behaviour.

105
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:57,076
- How much farther?
- Not very.

106
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,234
Oh, good.

107
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:03,440
- We could have taken the jumper.
- Exercise is good.

108
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,992
Chaya does live pretty far
from your people.

109
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:10,554
It is not uncommon, Major, for clerics
to live apart from the community.

110
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,041
- Glory to Athar.
- Welcome, and rest.

111
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:44,001
Thank you, sister.

112
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:49,112
- You are new to Proculis.
- Yes. We're brand-new, in fact.

113
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:54,715
- Major John Sheppard.
- I am called Chaya Sar.

114
00:09:54,883 --> 00:10:00,515
And you are... Teyla,
Lieutenant Ford and Dr McKay.

115
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,959
- How did she know that?
- One of the abbots ran ahead.

116
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,842
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chaya.

117
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:11,076
You must be tired after your long journey.
Shall I prepare some tea?

118
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:16,112
Well, I was hoping
you were gonna say just that.

119
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:22,158
- Where do they come from?
- They're everywhere in this galaxy.

120
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:25,474
They've been on top of the food chain
for a long time.

121
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:31,832
It's terrifying. Truly terrifying.
My heart goes out to your people, Teyla.

122
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,119
It is not only my people who suffer.

123
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,513
The Wraith have awakened
from a long sleep

124
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:40,915
and this entire world is safe
from the culling that has already begun.

125
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,793
Even Atlantis, with all its wonder,
may not survive the onslaught.

126
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:50,832
It is our hope that Athar
could grant sanctuary here on Proculis.

127
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,756
Sanctuary?

128
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,357
For so many?

129
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,720
We're not talking about
everybody in the galaxy showing up.

130
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:03,239
- This planet is pretty big.
- And largely uninhabited.

131
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:06,042
More importantly,
it is protected by your weapon.

132
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:09,354
Weapon? I am aware
of no such thing on Proculis.

133
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,757
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

134
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,721
- Oh, please.
- Rodney, best behaviour.

135
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,680
This is as good as it gets.

136
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:23,119
Chaya, we're alive because of
a powerful energy weapon

137
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,274
that emanated from this planet.

138
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:29,356
It destroyed the enemy ships.
That weapon is keeping the Wraith away.

139
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,162
No, Dr McKay.
It was Athar who protected you.

140
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:36,316
- Athar?
- Yes. Athar saw you were in need.

141
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,680
Chaya, there are a lot of people just like...

142
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,999
you and me
who are in need because of the Wraith.

143
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,281
What you have here,
what Athar has provided you,

144
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,833
is a very rare thing,

145
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:56,358
but we have a lot to offer too.

146
00:11:56,523 --> 00:12:00,232
That's what friends do. They share.

147
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,633
I think we could help each other.

148
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,192
I understand.

149
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,923
I shall consult with her now.

150
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:15,751
Please stay here.
I don't know how long this will take.

151
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:18,835
Thank you.

152
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:22,200
"What Athar provides for you?"
Are you buying into this?

153
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:26,402
Rodney, what religious people
don't take their religion seriously?

154
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,554
We didn't imagine that weapon.

155
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:31,715
- We saw what it was capable of.
- Yes, we did.

156
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:35,592
Perhaps Chaya is simply unaware
of the weapon's existence.

157
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,641
Or she knows
and wants to keep it a secret from us.

158
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:41,920
She doesn't strike me
as the lying type, either.

159
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:47,031
All right, let's just see
what Athar has to say.

160
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:51,154
So, pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain, hmm?

161
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,314
Exactly.

162
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:21,712
Major. We have conveyed your request
to our Divine Mother.

163
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:24,920
She does not doubt
the righteousness of your mission,

164
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,871
but she cannot countenance
any other people but hers settling here.

165
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:32,035
You had to chant all that time
to come up with that?

166
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:35,798
- McKay.
- Is there any way Athar can reconsider?

167
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,033
Athar understands and sympathises.

168
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,717
These Wraith are a scourge
among our stars.

169
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:44,876
But she has to place
the lives of her people first.

170
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:48,433
We both knew what you were gonna say
before you even went in.

171
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,833
We prayed for Athar's guidance.

172
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,073
And what did Athar say?

173
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:56,519
You're hiding behind your religion
to justify your selfishness.

174
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:00,198
- Rodney...
- If Athar existed, she would be ashamed.

175
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:04,117
We ask only to be left alone and in peace.

176
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:08,913
So thousands will die when they could
have been saved, all in the name of Athar.

177
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,393
- How peaceful of you.
- You should be grateful to Athar.

178
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,873
- This is a waste of time.
- Athar regrets that she cannot help.

179
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:19,433
- I'm sure those were her exact words.
- That's enough!

180
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:23,442
Head back to the jumper.
I'll be there in a minute.

181
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,559
- Why?
- 'Cause you're not helping.

182
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,714
Yes, sir.

183
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,560
I apologise.

184
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:40,681
He acts only in accordance to his beliefs,
as do we.

185
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:43,562
But Rodney is right about one thing.

186
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,920
This really is about lives, human lives.

187
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,041
The Wraith will show up in Atlantis.
When they do...

188
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:54,401
- You're a warrior.
- Well, I don't know about "warrior".

189
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:57,282
It is your vocation, Major. You will fight.

190
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:02,312
I'll try, but knowing what we're up against,
and the odds...

191
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:07,801
Look, I'd appreciate it
if you would ask Athar

192
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:11,922
to consider that we are her people.

193
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:17,758
Even though we come from very far away,
we're the same, we're human,

194
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,676
which means we're not strangers,
we're family.

195
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:28,800
Whoa.

196
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,635
Evening breeze.

197
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:34,077
I was hoping it was a sign from Athar.

198
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:37,076
Your words are most compelling,
Major Sheppard.

199
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:39,803
Thank you. I was going for compelling.

200
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,193
Do you truly believe we are family?

201
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,513
We are. I can prove it to you.

202
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,833
- How?
- Come back to Atlantis.

203
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,473
See who we really are.
Once Athar learns more about us...

204
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,713
- This is acceptable.
- It is?

205
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:57,193
Chaya, please, you cannot leave.

206
00:15:57,363 --> 00:16:01,151
Athar is with us always,
no matter where we are, Zarah.

207
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,194
I understand.

208
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,874
I am ready.

209
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,562
- Welcome to Atlantis.
- Thank you.

210
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,601
Our doctors do require a medical exam

211
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:27,482
of all off-planet team members
and our visitors.

212
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,111
- Then perhaps you'd like a tour.
- I would.

213
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,922
Major Sheppard
has already promised to do so.

214
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,278
- Of course he has.
- Of course I have.

215
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,513
If you'll follow me to the infirmary.

216
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:40,880
- Maybe I should tag along...
- I think I got a handle.

217
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,433
- There are a lot of systems you know...
- Got it covered.

218
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,475
Fine.

219
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,362
Hold still. Just a minute more.

220
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:05,274
Well, it seems you're just as lovely
on the inside as you are on the out,

221
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:08,196
if health is synonymous with beauty.

222
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:10,160
You can get up now.

223
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,791
How does this device
do what you say it does?

224
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,761
It creates images of the tissues
inside your body.

225
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:20,121
- They are picture perfect.
- Are these machines from your world?

226
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:24,322
Some. Others are Atlantean technology
that we've figured out how to use,

227
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:28,192
and a few, well, I haven't
the vaguest idea of what they do.

228
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,082
Hopefully one day
I'll meet one and ask them.

229
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:36,158
- Do you know what happened to them?
- Some returned to Earth after the war.

230
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:39,395
That much we know.
But some of them ascended.

231
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,042
Ascended?

232
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:44,195
To a higher plane,
where they exist only as energy.

233
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,196
Are all the people of your world
as healthy as you?

234
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,035
Yes.

235
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:53,515
No disease, ailments?
No one ever breaks a leg?

236
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,880
Such things are rare,
but my people heal quite rapidly.

237
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,635
Really?

238
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,637
- Are we done?
- Are we?

239
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:06,795
Healthiest patient I've ever had.
Off you go, love.

240
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,721
- Where are we?
- Either she knows where the weapon is,

241
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,443
or she has no idea
and we are wasting our time.

242
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:21,118
- What do you suggest?
- Scan the planet for energy signatures.

243
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:26,152
They won't know what we're doing unless
they're advanced and pretending not to be,

244
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,553
which has happened before.

245
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:32,477
Did you find something that would suggest
they are more advanced?

246
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:36,875
No. They're pathetically pretechnological
or brilliantly post-technological.

247
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:39,193
There's no way this could be natural?

248
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:42,275
A timed energy burst
that only affected Wraith ships?

249
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,513
- That's a no?
- That's a no.

250
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:48,961
- <i>Dr Weir, I have those results</i>.
- Thank you, Carson. We're on our way.

251
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,800
How many of you are there?

252
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:57,160
Counting the Athosians on the mainland,
a couple of hundred,

253
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,518
which leaves a very large, empty city.

254
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:04,677
We're living in one section because
we don't have the power to spread out.

255
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,679
What do you think so far?

256
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,198
I think it's wondrous.

257
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:13,957
But ultimately the decision is up to Athar.

258
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,358
You're not a believer, are you?

259
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:22,675
Look, Chaya, I respect that you believe.

260
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:27,598
Look, I can't talk to Athar. I can only talk
to you, so let me ask you this.

261
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:30,323
What if the shoe was on the other foot?

262
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,872
What if your people were in trouble?

263
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:36,513
Would you just take no for an answer?

264
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:40,596
It must have been very hard
to live under the shadow of the Wraith.

265
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:45,560
Teyla and her people
have known the Wraith for ever,

266
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,476
but when I say we're new,
I mean we just got here.

267
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,918
We're from a planet called Earth.

268
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,643
- Earth?
- It's very far away.

269
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:58,001
Those clusters of stars in the night sky,
some of 'em are called galaxies.

270
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,552
They're even further away than the stars.

271
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,759
Earth is in one of those galaxies.

272
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:05,835
- You came through the Stargate?
- That's right.

273
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:09,678
- And can you not simply return?
- Well, not simply.

274
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:13,677
We knew that it was probably
going to be a one-way trip,

275
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:17,438
but we thought what we would find here
would be worth the risk.

276
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,594
- And is it?
- So far.

277
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:22,231
Ask me again when the Wraith show up.

278
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:26,635
Blood work shows no viral,
bacterial or parasitic infections.

279
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:31,957
MRI reveals no tumours or cancers,
no heart defects of any kind.

280
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:37,595
Blood pressure 130 over 70.
Total cholesterol 107.

281
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,560
She's in perfect health.

282
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:42,840
I'm happy for her.
Why did we need to see this?

283
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:45,471
- She's too healthy.
- What does that mean?

284
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:48,157
There's no trace of congenital conditions

285
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:51,599
that you typically find
in pretechnological societies.

286
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:54,197
No rickets, no fungi, STDs...

287
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:56,160
- Perfect health?
- Aye.

288
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,713
From what she told me,
this may be the norm among her people.

289
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,999
- But she is human?
- Without a doubt.

290
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:06,759
- How is that possible?
- I can't say for certain.

291
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:11,121
But if this data is accurate,
people on Proculis live in optimal health

292
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,080
for a very, very long time.

293
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:17,316
- You make it sound like some sort of a...
- Paradise? Because it is.

294
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,156
And that's a problem because...?

295
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:25,317
Because human life, quite simply,
Dr Weir, is more fragile than that.

296
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:30,118
I don't care what galaxy we're in,
it's unnatural.

297
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,638
The ocean air is so invigorating.

298
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:43,557
Plenty of that here.
Most of the planet's ocean.

299
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:47,555
There's enough land
to resettle the refugees.

300
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,954
Well, there is.
We just can't guarantee their safety.

301
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,159
Even though you control all of this?

302
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:57,236
I'd be lying if I said we controlled it all.

303
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:00,634
This place is so far beyond us
in so many ways.

304
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:04,955
We have a shield that can withstand
anything the Wraith could throw at us,

305
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,239
but we have no way of powering it up.

306
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:10,918
We can't risk taking in any more refugees
than we already have.

307
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,917
Come with me.

308
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:20,241
- Major Sheppard...
- I'd prefer you to call me John.

309
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:23,793
John. How did you make enemies
of the Wraith?

310
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:26,272
- That was my fault.
- Yours?

311
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:29,116
I woke them up
trying to rescue some people.

312
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,319
They didn't take too kindly to that.

313
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,678
But you saved your people?

314
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:35,640
Most of 'em.

315
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:37,998
You know for sure they're coming back?

316
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,996
Yeah, we just don't know when.

317
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:43,836
Main control console,

318
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,198
environmental support systems,

319
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:48,354
communications.

320
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,799
And this... This is, uh...

321
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:57,116
Sorry, Major.
We haven't the faintest idea what...

322
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:03,239
This is a new piece of equipment
we found in the city.

323
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:05,792
- It hadn't been initialised.
- She has...

324
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:07,760
She has the gene.

325
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:12,394
- Did I do this? What does the machine do?
- We don't know. Not yet, anyway.

326
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,952
The Atlanteans were good at lots of things.

327
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:18,035
Writing instruction manuals
wasn't one of 'em.

328
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:21,195
We should probably wrap this tour up.

329
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:24,275
I know Dr Weir is anxious to talk to you.

330
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:28,519
- Will I see you afterwards?
- And during.

331
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,552
We are proposing a kind of land lease

332
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:39,035
in which refugees rendered homeless
by the Wraith could resettle on Proculis.

333
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:42,195
In return, we can offer you
services and knowledge.

334
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:45,878
- Such as?
- You've seen the technology we possess.

335
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:48,955
We could help you down a path
to an industrialised society

336
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:52,274
while maintaining
your planet's ecological balance.

337
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:56,834
Your scientific knowledge is impressive,
Dr Weir, but we have no need of it.

338
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,563
Athar provides us
with everything we require.

339
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:03,033
Well, food just doesn't show up
on the dinner table.

340
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:06,036
- You plant all your own crops?
- Of course we do.

341
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:08,319
We can help increase your crop yields.

342
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:12,681
We grow all the food we need to live.
Anything else would be gluttony.

343
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:17,598
- Building materials, then.
- We have abundant timber and iron ore.

344
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,754
Athar is kind.

345
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,599
There must be something.

346
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:29,153
What my people value most
is spiritual knowledge.

347
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:32,633
What can your culture provide
in that regard?

348
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:38,192
Earth's people don't share
a single spiritual belief.

349
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:41,992
We embrace a number
of different religions and philosophies.

350
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:46,873
Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam...

351
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:50,035
Hinduism, Kwanzaa...

352
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,994
Interesting. Tell me about them.

353
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:57,156
- All of them?
- Yes. They sound fascinating.

354
00:24:57,323 --> 00:25:01,521
I am hardly competent to discuss
all religions, but I can offer you resources.

355
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:04,675
You could have access
to our historical database.

356
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:08,077
That would be wonderful.

357
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,594
- You got it working?
- Yeah.

358
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,879
Well, do we know what it does?

359
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:17,796
It's an internal-external
biometric sensor array.

360
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:22,241
See, now, sadly, I understood that.
Where did all those Saturday nights go?

361
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:25,042
These are biosignatures
of everyone in Atlantis.

362
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:27,433
How can you tell?

363
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:30,117
I've been deciphering
the Ancient logarithms.

364
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,638
I suspect this was
an early-warning system

365
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,317
to signal any alien presence in the city.

366
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,555
And it activated
when our visitor touched it?

367
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:40,759
So she has the Ancient gene.

368
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:44,393
Or it only activated
because it was detecting her.

369
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:48,476
She could be an alien and this thing
knows more about her than we do.

370
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:51,840
- We should be keeping an eye on her.
- Major Sheppard is.

371
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:54,915
- I'm sure.
- Not entirely for the reasons you think.

372
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,881
- Dr Weir asked him to.
- I'm sure she did.

373
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,961
- Weir wanted Chaya to see everything.
- Everything?

374
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:11,116
Not everything. Chaya wanted
to see the best view of the city at night,

375
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:14,036
which I think is atop the south-west pier,

376
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:18,719
and since it's such a long walk,
I thought I'd bring along a few provisions.

377
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,397
Continuing our efforts to secure a treaty.

378
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:24,361
- Exactly.
- As our ambassador.

379
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:32,116
I am an ambassador
and she is a diplomat.

380
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:35,480
On a late-night... picnic?

381
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:38,439
Yes.

382
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:41,959
I know that as ranking military officer
here in Atlantis,

383
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:45,160
you feel a heavy burden of responsibility,

384
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:48,520
but you are allowed
to have feelings for others.

385
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:54,716
No, this is an ambassadorial,
diplomatic picnic outing... thing.

386
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:58,000
Without having to justify them to anyone.

387
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,794
Goodnight, Major.

388
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:05,474
Goodnight, Teyla.

389
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:13,274
- Send her back?
- She's not who she's pretending to be.

390
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:16,276
- You know this because...?
- I can't have intuition?

391
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:19,355
No. I asked Major Sheppard
to keep an eye on her.

392
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:22,401
Which is like asking the fox
to guard the hen-house.

393
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:23,882
What?

394
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:27,797
The biometric differential
is not insignificant, Elizabeth.

395
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:31,114
What I'm saying is
the woman set off an alien alarm.

396
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,080
You don't know that for certain.

397
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:37,031
You are nowhere close
to understanding the nature of that device.

398
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:39,956
There are too many unknown variables:
the weapon,

399
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:43,559
they claim never to have seen the Wraith,
she's healthy.

400
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:45,998
Very mysterious, but what does it prove?

401
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,916
We should give her
a one-way ticket back home.

402
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:54,237
There is something different about her, but
that doesn't necessarily make her a threat.

403
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:56,394
It doesn't rule it out, either.

404
00:27:56,563 --> 00:28:02,752
Then what we could gain by securing
a treaty is worth the risk of her being here.

405
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:04,242
Fine.

406
00:28:07,923 --> 00:28:09,242
Mmm.

407
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:11,792
This is delicious.

408
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:15,478
Well, enjoy it while you can.
That's the last of what we have.

409
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:18,077
Then I am honoured.

410
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:20,598
When McKay finds out, he's gonna kill me.

411
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:23,038
- Athar will save you.
- Oh, good.

412
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,754
Such wondrous things.

413
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:32,201
I can't imagine wanting to do anything
but eat with such variety of foods.

414
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:35,241
We manage
to pull ourselves away somehow.

415
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:37,439
I've been learning much about Earth.

416
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:40,276
Dr Weir has got me
on your information machines.

417
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:43,276
Elizabeth's got you
on a computer already, huh?

418
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:45,718
I'm fascinated by your many religions.

419
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:48,636
So many beliefs, so many philosophies.

420
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:52,512
- Yeah, we got a few of those.
- So many contradictory faiths.

421
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:55,595
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess.

422
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:59,517
- More?
- Yes, please.

423
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:02,872
We traded for grapes.

424
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:07,916
The Athosians, Teyla's people,
they make this on the mainland.

425
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:12,517
I wasn't completely truthful with you
about something.

426
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:18,795
On Proculis, when I told you
I did not feel lonely...

427
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,398
Coming here and being with you...

428
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,841
..it reminded me
what it was like not to be alone.

429
00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:36,641
- What?
- Well, I mean, nothing.

430
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:39,636
It's just that this is the first time

431
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:43,512
I've been in a romantic situation
with a woman from another planet.

432
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:45,799
It just strikes me as really, um...

433
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:47,954
- Wrong?
- No! God, no.

434
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,035
Just... funny.

435
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:54,915
I'm sorry. I just thought that I would, uh...

436
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:58,436
You said it yourself, we're both human.

437
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:00,958
Yes, we are.

438
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:06,241
And I'm really glad you didn't say "family",
otherwise I'd have to leave.

439
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:09,554
Don't.

440
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:16,792
I'm not going anywhere.

441
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:35,802
Major.

442
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:39,842
- Rodney. What are you doing up so late?
- I couldn't sleep.

443
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:42,563
I was going to do a little research. You?

444
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:45,681
- No, thanks.
- What were you doing up so late?

445
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,879
I'm always up late, Rodney.

446
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:52,400
A word of caution. The whole
Captain Kirk routine is problematic,

447
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:54,633
let alone morally dubious.

448
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:57,033
- Routine?
- Romancing the alien priestess.

449
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,159
Very 1967 of you. I'm surprised...

450
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:02,793
If and when anything I do
becomes your business...

451
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,194
An alien woman
who is clearly not who she claims to be

452
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:09,036
has you wrapped around her little finger.

453
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:13,515
- Don't go there, McKay.
- I know I'm not normally Mr Sensitive.

454
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,958
But there is something about her.

455
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:19,593
- It's intangible, but I can feel it.
- I said don't go there!

456
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:23,153
It's just a matter of time
before I prove it, Major.

457
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:26,156
I recommend that in the meantime,
you keep your...

458
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,994
- Did you sleep last night?
- No.

459
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:48,552
This is the data
from the biometric sensors.

460
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:52,193
I can't tell you what
all these signatures mean, but look at this.

461
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:55,878
These are ours and this is hers.
There's a distinct difference.

462
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:58,762
She was born on another planet
in another galaxy.

463
00:31:58,923 --> 00:32:01,960
- They're different from Teyla's.
- It doesn't mean...

464
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:06,753
- She's not what she seems to be.
- I sense an honest and spiritual person.

465
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,835
All right. There may be a way to find out.

466
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:12,881
You're opening negotiations with her?
Let me sit in.

467
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:15,876
I'll pretend to take notes on the laptop
and scan her.

468
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:18,762
Radiation, EM scans, energy signatures...

469
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:22,836
That way, if I am crazy, you and I
are the only ones who need to know.

470
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:25,801
- What's the harm?
- All right.

471
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:29,083
- But be discreet.
- I'm Mr Discreet.

472
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:35,753
I'm impressed by most
of what I've read of Earth religions.

473
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:39,233
The Torah, the Koran,
the Talmud, the Bible...

474
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:42,793
Most reveal a diverse and deep desire
to grasp the divine.

475
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:46,717
- So we have something to offer you.
- I've also read about your history.

476
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:50,876
Even now, somewhere on your planet,
you are at war.

477
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,034
Well, yeah, that's true.

478
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:57,674
I made no attempt to hide that fact
from you. We are definitely not perfect.

479
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,835
There's a lot about you as a people
I find disturbing.

480
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:03,563
- Can that not be said of any people?
- No.

481
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,362
Every soul in Proculis
is free from the hatred

482
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:09,083
people from Earth
seem to feel for each other.

483
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:12,838
- We're not all that bad. You know that.
- I do.

484
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:19,192
I'm talking about every member
of my expedition team here in Atlantis

485
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:23,356
and the friends we've met
since coming here, like Teyla's people.

486
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,595
There are some among you,
yourself included, Dr Weir,

487
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,641
that I know Athar would welcome
with open arms.

488
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,600
But there are others.

489
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,323
I hand-picked
every member of this expedition,

490
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:38,396
and I know Teyla feels as confident
about her own people.

491
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:42,715
- I'm sure.
- This is a matter of trust.

492
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:46,671
Yes. It is, Dr Weir.

493
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:51,917
Have your scans
found anything yet, Dr McKay?

494
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,119
Uh...

495
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,234
Actually...

496
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,516
..no.

497
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,151
- What the hell is this?
- I'm sorry, Major.

498
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,917
There was cause
for legitimate concern as to...

499
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,392
Whether I was or not who I claimed to be.

500
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,077
I'm sorry, Chaya.
I felt it would do no harm.

501
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,632
Stop apologising, Elizabeth.

502
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,600
- How did she know?
- McKay.

503
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,038
- She's an Ancient, Major.
- She's what?

504
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:22,754
I'm right, aren't I? The perfect health,
the energy weapon, she has the gene.

505
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:27,201
- It's the only logical explanation.
- What the hell are you talking about?

506
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,194
I just don't understand the act.

507
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:33,834
You must know we'd give anything
to talk to you, to learn from you.

508
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:37,598
What is it? Are you checking us out?

509
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:41,998
In my desire to come to Atlantis,
I have revealed too much.

510
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,677
- He's right?
- I'm right?

511
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:47,801
I am what you call an Ancient,

512
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:51,751
and it is also true that I can never
offer your people sanctuary.

513
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,721
But you are wrong as to why I came here.

514
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:57,113
Why did you come here?

515
00:34:57,283 --> 00:35:00,081
You, John.

516
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,596
Me?

517
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:05,438
I have lived in solitude for so long
that when you asked me to come...

518
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,117
Oh, my God, he is Kirk.

519
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:10,274
So this was never about...

520
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:15,557
Could we just have a moment
to ourselves here?

521
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:17,236
No.

522
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:21,396
That's all right.
I've stayed here long enough.

523
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:33,754
Come on. You and your people were
the reason we came here in the first place.

524
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,914
I can't... I can't...

525
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:44,760
No.

526
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,153
What the hell was that?

527
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:51,362
They're coming for them.
I should have never left them.

528
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:53,639
What's going on?

529
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:56,192
I'm sorry, John.

530
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,718
I'm taking a jumper back to Proculis.

531
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:22,319
- What just happened?
- There's only one way to find out.

532
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,474
Go.

533
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:47,478
Sure you know what you're flying into?

534
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:50,032
The Wraith are attacking Chaya's people.

535
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:54,523
You can't hope
to defend them with one ship!

536
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:56,719
I don't think I'll have to.

537
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,796
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you.

538
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,761
- Help me?
- To defend your people.

539
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:45,201
Leave. I will take care of this.

540
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:28,357
Is it Chaya or Athar? I'm just curious.

541
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:32,277
When I was a mortal, I lived here.
This was my home.

542
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,241
When those of us you call
the Ancients ascended,

543
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:38,475
we were supposed to leave behind us
all human ties.

544
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:41,077
Some of us found that difficult.

545
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:44,519
You couldn't watch your people
get wiped out by the Wraith.

546
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:49,279
When their fleet approached, I lashed out
with my mind and destroyed them all.

547
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:54,517
The others of my kind
did not approve of such interference.

548
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:57,592
And so I was exiled.

549
00:38:57,763 --> 00:39:01,802
My punishment was
the unending protection of this world.

550
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,118
Why pretend to be human at all?

551
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:12,400
So that, time to time,
I may walk among the people,

552
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:15,794
know them as the good
and kind souls they are.

553
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:20,353
For thousands of years,
I have come and gone to the villages,

554
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:23,993
never staying too long
to get attached to anyone...

555
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:26,119
until I met you.

556
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:32,040
I have never regretted the choice I've made
all of these years... until now.

557
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,275
I am permitted
to safeguard my people only.

558
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:40,515
But this is my punishment.

559
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:43,834
This is what makes it punishment.

560
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:48,076
If your people came here for
my protection, the others would stop me.

561
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:51,952
Do you understand?
I can never help your people.

562
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:57,475
I'm not sure
I'm willing to walk away that easily,

563
00:39:57,643 --> 00:40:01,875
and I'm not just talking personally,
although that's definitely part of it.

564
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:06,197
There is so much more
we can learn from you.

565
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:09,116
I can't, John. The others won't allow it.

566
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,275
- That's...
- It's their highest law to never interfere.

567
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:17,715
I am bound by those laws,
however much I wish to help you.

568
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:22,073
- So, we can never...
- I can never leave.

569
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:25,474
Well, I could come and visit.

570
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:31,720
Now I'm flirting with somebody
from another species.

571
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:34,477
We're not as different as you think.

572
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,918
We're more different than you think.

573
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:41,002
I can show you.

574
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:43,882
- Show me?
- By sharing each other.

575
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,921
We will know each other
as well as anyone ever can.

576
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:52,718
OK. I gotta get the car
back by midnight, though.

577
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,079
This will only take a few moments.

578
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,114
Just close your eyes.

579
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:11,554
This is cool.
