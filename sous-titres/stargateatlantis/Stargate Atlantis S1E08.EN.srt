1
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,954
I've never seen so much nothing.

2
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,273
I've never walked so far to see it.

3
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:28,152
How was I to know the only structures
would be around the Stargate?

4
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,996
There's the gate. Dial it up.

5
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:34,792
The energy readings here
are the same as they were a mile away.

6
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:36,954
I think we should stay for a while.

7
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:41,196
- I thought you hated these suits.
- I do, but the readings are amazing.

8
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:42,762
It's all around us.

9
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,357
- Yet you cannot explain it.
- Not yet.

10
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,754
- You can't figure out a way we can use it?
- Not yet.

11
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,480
Let's call it a mission.

12
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:56,602
There's such a thing as pure science.
Not everything has to be useful.

13
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:03,600
You said the energy readings indicated
the presence of a civilisation.

14
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:08,120
There are no buildings,
no people, no nothing. Just fog.

15
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:12,196
It's not technically fog. There's
no water vapour in the atmosphere.

16
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,878
And I don't think we need to wear
the Hazmat gear.

17
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,157
Now you tell me.

18
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:27,201
Dial the gate.

19
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:50,595
- Let's move out.
- Wait. Hold on.

20
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:55,676
- You wanted useful?
- What are you talking about?

21
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,915
When the wormhole connected
there was a wild fluctuation.

22
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,281
It looks like the gate is actually
drawing power from the atmosphere.

23
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:07,436
- So?
- So this field goes on for miles.

24
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:10,117
It may envelop the planet.
It's a lot of energy.

25
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:13,116
- How much is a lot?
- In terms of joules or ergs?

26
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:17,720
- In terms of lots.
- Well, lots and lots.

27
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:20,477
Enough to open a wormhole
back to Earth.

28
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,277
I thought only the Atlantis gate
could dial Earth.

29
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:32,436
Yes. It has an additional control crystal
allowing an eighth chevron to lock.

30
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:35,242
- Probably a security measure.
- It doesn't matter.

31
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,076
With the crystal,
I can make the other gate work.

32
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:43,715
You're suggesting we remove it
from our DHD and bring it to M5S-224?

33
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,521
- Yes.
- Isn't that risky?

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,232
- I'll be fine.
- She means in terms of breaking our gate.

35
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,600
The control crystal is useless
without enough power.

36
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:55,357
You said you didn't know
where the energy comes from.

37
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:58,196
I believe it is being generated
in the atmosphere.

38
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,479
- The fog?
- Yes.

39
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:03,111
- You said it wasn't fog.
- Whatever it is.

40
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,955
- How do you know?
- I don't.

41
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:09,674
But the fog is the only thing around
and the energy readings were constant.

42
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:13,119
OK, even if you can pull this off,

43
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,241
we have to assume the Earth gate
lacks a power source

44
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,837
capable of establishing
a wormhole to Pegasus.

45
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:22,996
Whoever went would be taking the risk
of it being a one-way trip.

46
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,518
- Someone will volunteer.
- You?

47
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:29,642
I would only go if I knew there was
a good chance I could come back.

48
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,273
We can send a message
to Stargate Command that we're OK.

49
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,274
We've gathered a lot of intel.

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,798
We should send it.

51
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,558
If we can. Even if it's over a radio.

52
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,314
All right. That's it.

53
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,681
How easy is it to put that
in the other DHD?

54
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:58,313
The Atlantis's DHD is unique.
There isn't an empty slot waiting.

55
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:02,271
- Meaning?
- It may require some disassembly.

56
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,554
- You wanna take the DHD apart?
- I'll put it back together.

57
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,032
Don't you risk
disabling the other Stargate?

58
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:12,673
Only if I screw up,
which is extremely unlikely.

59
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,152
- 840 years.
- What?

60
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:18,520
How long it will take us
to come get you by puddle jumper.

61
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:21,675
But you would do that, right?

62
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,834
- Of course.
- It won't be necessary.

63
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:26,756
- However, I may require some assistance.
- Major?

64
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:30,632
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,361
- Atlantis, this is McKay.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

66
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:54,038
- We're ready to begin work on the DHD.
- You're sure about this?

67
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,558
Positive. We'll deliver good news.

68
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,795
- Good luck.
<i>- Back in time for supper.</i>

69
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,194
Right.

70
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:06,834
Let's get started.

71
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,193
Come in.

72
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,551
Hi. Do you have a moment?

73
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,714
Yeah, sure.

74
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:24,355
<i>War And Peace.</i>
That's some heavy reading.

75
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:27,595
Back on Earth
when I was getting ready for this mission,

76
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,152
I realised I might be here for a while,

77
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,317
so I figured, "Why not bring along a book
that takes a while to read?"

78
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,951
- Page 17?
- I'm right on schedule.

79
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:42,756
Hm. It's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

80
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,517
Home. Going home.

81
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:48,993
- Oh.
- McKay's right.

82
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:52,838
If this works and we establish
a wormhole back to Earth...

83
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,996
If this conversation is going where I think,
you can put your mind at rest.

84
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:00,235
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't read my book.

85
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:08,273
Look, all I'm saying is that
you are the person who is best qualified

86
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:12,038
to brief General Hammond and the others
about the Wraith threat.

87
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:15,912
Well, maybe so,
but I think I'm needed here.

88
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,797
- Good.
- But if you wanna go, I understand.

89
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:23,319
- Are you saying I'm not needed here?
- I said I'd understand.

90
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:26,316
Well, thank you, but I made a commitment.

91
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,635
Of course, in all fairness, life-sucking
aliens weren't part of the brochure.

92
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:36,475
- Regardless, I'm staying.
- Good.

93
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:39,521
Wouldn't be the same without you.

94
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:50,518
- Would you want to go back?
- It doesn't matter what I want.

95
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,880
- Why not?
- Atlantis can't afford to lose me.

96
00:07:54,043 --> 00:08:00,039
I'm their expert in gate theory, wormhole
physics and a myriad of other sciences.

97
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:03,434
I'd love to see my grandma.
She thinks I'm in Afghanistan.

98
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:06,276
Whoever goes should command
the respect of the SGC,

99
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:09,515
have the patience and knowledge
to bring them up to speed

100
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:11,833
and find a way to bring the cavalry back.

101
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:14,722
You're saying
you're invaluable everywhere.

102
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:16,874
It would create a void if I went,

103
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:20,479
but you'll know that
I'll be spearheading the effort to return

104
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:23,794
with reinforcements, fresh supplies
and Big Macs for all.

105
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,602
- I feel better already.
- Yeah. Good.

106
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,833
Good.

107
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:35,359
Major Sheppard,
have we heard back from Dr McKay?

108
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:38,913
- Not yet.
- Word of the discovery has spread.

109
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,881
- I've noticed.
- It is to be expected,

110
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:46,400
faced with the prospect of being reunited
with loved ones, returning home.

111
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:49,157
Yeah, I'd love to go back.

112
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:52,076
You would consider leaving Atlantis?

113
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,280
If I knew I could gate back here,
I'd go in a heartbeat.

114
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:59,231
- It would be good to see your world.
- You could help with the briefing.

115
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:04,601
- I would like that.
- You know about the Pegasus galaxy.

116
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:08,073
Then there's those cool Earth things -
football, Ferris wheels.

117
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:12,236
Oh. Do you remember
the last of the popcorn we ate?

118
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:17,914
- We could get more.
- If we knew we could return.

119
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,199
<i>Unscheduled activation.</i>

120
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:26,281
It's a radio transmission
from Dr McKay.

121
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:29,401
- Rodney?
<i>- Elizabeth. I'm done.</i>

122
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:32,839
<i>- The component's installed in the DHD...</i>
- Well done.

123
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:36,040
- What about the energy readings?
<i>- Same as before.</i>

124
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:40,594
<i>The gate's drawing power</i>
<i>from the atmosphere.</i>

125
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:44,358
- OK, you stay put. We're on our way.
<i>- Right.</i>

126
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,799
So, are we ready?

127
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,113
What's there to be ready for?

128
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:56,958
It's a big moment and we haven't
been in contact for some time...

129
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:59,432
- Hooray.
- Go ahead.

130
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:09,838
Please work.

131
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:21,234
Stargate Command, this is Dr Elizabeth
Weir of the Atlantis expedition.

132
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,201
Do you read?

133
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:30,039
I repeat, this is Dr Weir. Come in, please.

134
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,483
<i>This is Sergeant Harriman
of Stargate Command.</i>

135
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:36,111
<i>Whoever you are,</i>
<i>this better not be a joke.</i>

136
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:41,357
No joke, Sergeant. I'm sending
my personal IDC for confirmation.

137
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,240
<i>Sorry. We're just a little surprised</i>
<i>to be hearing from you.</i>

138
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:49,793
- Understandable.
<i>- The iris is open. Clear to come through.</i>

139
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,592
Thanks, but we're not ready
to risk a one-way trip.

140
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,723
<i>Doctor, things have changed</i>
<i>around here.</i>

141
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:03,082
<i>The Asgard are fitting Prometheus with</i>
<i>engines that can reach other galaxies.</i>

142
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:06,474
<i>We were manning a mission</i>
<i>to find out what happened to you.</i>

143
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,793
Is he serious?

144
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,761
- Are you serious?
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

145
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:15,882
Come through now and you could be
back in Pegasus inside of a month.

146
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,992
Well... who's going?

147
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,838
Welcome back to Earth.

148
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:47,876
While the Pegasus galaxy
does hold many dangers,

149
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,955
I feel its potential rewards
justify the risk

150
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:54,081
of maintaining a continued presence
on the Atlantis base.

151
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:59,033
Your preliminary report has given
the Pentagon cause for concern.

152
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:02,001
If the Wraith are as powerful as you say,

153
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:05,473
they are an enemy
even more dangerous than the Goa'uld.

154
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:11,832
Some say it would be prudent to cut our
losses and abandon the Pegasus galaxy.

155
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:15,439
- You can't...
- This is a race that defeated the Ancients.

156
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:21,239
Over the years, Stargate Command
has encountered a number of threats

157
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,871
that could well have destroyed
this world.

158
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,241
That never stopped you from continuing
to send teams through the gate.

159
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:34,000
By the time SG-1 had returned from their
first mission, the damage had been done.

160
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:38,679
We'd already alerted the Goa'uld
to our presence.

161
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:42,074
In the case of the Wraith, however,
we have a choice.

162
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,121
So we're just going to turn tail and run?

163
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:48,798
The Pentagon would prefer to call it
a strategic withdrawal.

164
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:51,921
How can we be sure
they won't come after us?

165
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,837
They feed on human life forms.
They know there's a smorgasbord here.

166
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,074
I don't think we have a choice.

167
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:04,237
We need to explore the opportunities for
technological advancement in Pegasus.

168
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:08,191
Not to mention our responsibility
to the other humans who live there.

169
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:12,594
- Responsibility?
- We did wake up the Wraith.

170
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:16,278
While that would have happened
eventually without our interference,

171
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:21,153
our access to Ancient technology puts us
in a unique position to help those people.

172
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:24,360
We can't just walk away.

173
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:32,875
Rest assured your recommendation
will be considered at the highest level.

174
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:42,433
General, sir.

175
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,514
Thank you, sir.

176
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,799
Major Sheppard.

177
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:53,073
I'm surprised the briefing went so quickly.

178
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:56,360
- You were very thorough, Major.
- Thank you, sir.

179
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:59,401
I thought you'd be enjoying
some well-deserved R & R.

180
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:02,361
I was going to arrange
some transportation.

181
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:04,639
Consider it done. Anywhere you like.

182
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,192
That's very generous.

183
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,275
You've done your country a great service.
You deserve it.

184
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,632
Thank you, sir.

185
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:28,873
Well, how's our patient doing?

186
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,796
We're all done, Major. She's free to go.

187
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,194
I was afraid you had abandoned me.

188
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,752
Just setting up our ride.

189
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,752
So, where are we going?

190
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:46,553
We should start
by getting you a new outfit.

191
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,993
Hello, Simon.

192
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:26,872
My God. When did you...

193
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:39,753
I missed you.

194
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:58,076
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

195
00:15:58,243 --> 00:16:01,519
Huh. Must have been
a power failure or something.

196
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,674
Anyways...

197
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:13,361
<i>There is nothing wrong</i>
<i>with your television set.</i>

198
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:18,119
<i>Do not attempt to adjust the picture.</i>
<i>We are controlling the transmission.</i>

199
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>We will bring up the volume or whisper.</i>

200
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:29,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:36,276
- Thank you, Major.
- You're welcome.

202
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:39,515
I have traded in many market-places
on many worlds...

203
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:44,154
- Countries. Countries.
- Yes, of course. Countries.

204
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:48,441
But here there are so many
different items to choose from.

205
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:53,154
You seemed like you were having fun.
Hours and hours of fun.

206
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:56,273
But you have picked out a nice outfit.

207
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,434
Thank you.

208
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:03,358
I wonder... if we had never
suffered the Wraith,

209
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,960
would my people have created
a civilisation such as this?

210
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:11,320
I'm starting to wonder
about a few things myself.

211
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:14,677
- What?
- Nothing feels wrong to you?

212
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:19,598
I don't mean one thing,
I mean... everything.

213
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:22,231
I do not understand.

214
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:27,033
Excuse me, could you take us
to the Green Moss Park area?

215
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,797
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

216
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:35,753
I think I'll have a better idea
of what's bothering me once we get there.

217
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:43,076
Hey, Sedge! Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

218
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,632
More than you can imagine.

219
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:58,359
I don't know how many times
I watched that damn tape you left me.

220
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:03,437
- I wanted to tell you in person.
- No, you didn't.

221
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:07,596
- You were afraid I'd talk you out of it.
- I was afraid you'd try.

222
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:12,279
When you said you couldn't say where
you were going, my first guess was Korea.

223
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,593
My second guess was Israel.

224
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:19,438
To be honest,
the Pegasus galaxy didn't make my list.

225
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:23,113
I am sorry.

226
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,995
I know.

227
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:32,997
I imagine my security clearance
doesn't let you tell me what you did.

228
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,722
- No.
- Or when you'll be leaving again?

229
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,601
No.

230
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:46,958
At the very least
you could promise me that...

231
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,155
..you'll take this with you.

232
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,314
Simon.

233
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,754
It's beautiful.

234
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,954
Looks nice.

235
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,159
Thank you.

236
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,352
Is something wrong?

237
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:31,076
No, I'm sorry. Just when you kissed me...

238
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:35,083
What are you talking about, Elizabeth?

239
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:41,554
Hello.

240
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,873
General. What...

241
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:50,878
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

242
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:14,597
Hang on.

243
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:27,681
Oh, hey. I was in the middle of a
power nap and I'm not wearing any pants.

244
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:32,238
I didn't think you knew where I lived.

245
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,394
- Air force.
- Right.

246
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,554
Look, I can't really...

247
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:38,998
I have a date with a girl in 302.

248
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:42,314
She's been taking care of the cat
while I was away.

249
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,917
- Apparently she... misses me.
- Rodney.

250
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,871
I know, trying to pawn my cat off
on a neighbour and I end up with...

251
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,682
- What?
- I got a call from General Hammond.

252
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,721
There was an accident on the Prometheus.

253
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:57,477
We can't go back to Atlantis.

254
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:05,592
I was just gonna come home, unwind,
then start work on a solution.

255
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,402
An hour ago it hit me,
like Archimedes in the bath.

256
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:11,794
Except I wasn't in the bath.
I was on the couch watching...

257
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,760
- Dr McKay.
- Forget Prometheus.

258
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:17,802
I have figured out how to establish
a wormhole connection back to Pegasus.

259
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,875
- I'm gonna need the ZPM.
- It's been depleted.

260
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:25,400
No. Last time it had to establish and
maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis.

261
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:29,476
This time it just needs enough energy
to establish a brief connection.

262
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,953
My calculation is approximately
3.5 microseconds.

263
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:34,715
That hardly seems enough...

264
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:37,795
When we set foot on M5S-224
before the wormhole shut down,

265
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,681
I picked up energy fluctuations.

266
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:43,358
I assumed it was an effect
of the gate's residual energy signature.

267
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:45,718
But that can't account for the variances.

268
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:49,717
There's one explanation. The gate
must have been energised on our arrival.

269
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:53,671
It doesn't just drop power on outgoing
wormholes, but incoming ones.

270
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:56,596
We just have to make a connection.
3.5 microseconds.

271
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:02,121
The minimum amount of time
to confirm a lock before the gate kicks in.

272
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:05,912
You'll forgive me, Doctor.
This all seems a little far-fetched.

273
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,439
Think of it like calling someone
who will accept the charges.

274
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:12,163
- All you have to do is dial.
- I'm sorry, Doctor.

275
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:17,477
You won't lose anything by letting me try.
I just want to run a couple of tests.

276
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:21,397
All right. I'll have the ZPM
delivered to the lab.

277
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,679
Thank you.

278
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:43,552
Dr Weir, I wasn't expecting to see you.

279
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:46,795
I've been thinking about what happened.
Thank you.

280
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:51,759
I know it's a setback,
but I don't think we should give up yet.

281
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:55,359
- If we get the Prometheus repaired...
- She was severely damaged.

282
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:59,072
We lost 20 crew members.
She won't be flying again any time soon.

283
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,996
So we ask the Asgard
for one of their ships.

284
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:06,361
I'm sure that when the Asgard
are in a position to help, they will.

285
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:11,879
General, I only came to Earth because
I was assured I'd be able to get back.

286
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,716
I am not about to abandon
my expedition team.

287
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,155
I'll see what I can do,
but I'm not making any promises.

288
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:26,672
You gotta talk to somebody about this
for me.

289
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:30,279
Sorry. If those are the orders you received,
it's out of my hands.

290
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,798
I can't abide sloppy work.

291
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:35,875
Your people
must double-check their results.

292
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:37,635
- Dr McKay.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

293
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:40,112
- I'm being transferred.
- Congratulations.

294
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:45,152
I was with my parents and a sergeant
shows up with new orders for me.

295
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,553
They wanna ship me back to Antarctica.

296
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:49,793
Do you know something that I don't?

297
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,397
Last time I checked,
the Prometheus was damaged

298
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:55,077
and our only ZPM
couldn't even run a car stereo.

299
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:58,679
- I thought you'd find another way.
- There is no other way.

300
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,641
You're gonna have to deal with it.

301
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,153
Thank you.

302
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:38,393
Would it be so bad if you had to stay?

303
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:42,317
I'm sorry, Simon.
I know none of this is fair to you.

304
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:46,556
It is tough to compete with
the greatest adventure in human history.

305
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:52,436
I don't blame you for going.

306
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:55,676
Thank you.

307
00:24:57,003 --> 00:25:02,635
But I still feel guilty.
And now I feel guilty about being back.

308
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:05,636
Because of the people you left behind?

309
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,476
No. I should have stayed at Atlantis.

310
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:12,522
Major Sheppard should have been
the one to go.

311
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,954
Oh, yeah.

312
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:22,193
Just like I left it.

313
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,602
So much space for just one person.

314
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:32,118
Well, a guy's gotta have a lot of space.

315
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:38,879
I bet there's still...

316
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,113
Perfect.

317
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:57,073
- Nice and cold.
- And this is...

318
00:25:57,243 --> 00:25:59,632
It's called beer.

319
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:12,635
Is all this... for recreation?

320
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:18,034
Yeah. I got pretty much
everything you can imagine, don't I?

321
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:25,157
What is it?

322
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:28,281
I was just thinking again...

323
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:33,119
..about Dr Weir
and everyone else on Atlantis.

324
00:26:33,283 --> 00:26:36,878
Of course. I am sure she is fine.

325
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:42,200
As I am sure they are all fine.

326
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:46,759
Yeah. I'm sure.

327
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:01,833
- You have those test results for me yet?
- We need more time.

328
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:05,120
What are you talking about?
Let's see what you got.

329
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:09,793
Wait a minute.
What is this, some kind of a joke?

330
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:14,115
- I told you we need more time.
- These don't make any sense.

331
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:17,518
We don't think the ZPM
can open the wormhole.

332
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:22,518
You wouldn't know that from this.
It's complete gibberish.

333
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,992
Get outta here. I'll do it.

334
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:27,154
Go.

335
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:30,957
You've got to be kidding me.

336
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:33,914
Thank you for coming in again.

337
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:39,601
- Was there a response to my request?
- We won't need help from the Asgard.

338
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:45,793
It turns out Dr McKay has discovered
how to open a wormhole back to Pegasus.

339
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:49,000
He has? Why wasn't I informed?

340
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,800
Doctor, the Atlantis mission
has been reassessed.

341
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,999
What does that mean?

342
00:27:57,163 --> 00:28:00,200
In light of your intelligence
concerning the Wraith,

343
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:04,197
it's been decided that the Atlantis presence
should be military.

344
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,593
- Our allies have agreed to this?
- They did.

345
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:11,596
As soon as Dr McKay
can establish a wormhole,

346
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:16,598
we intend to send reinforcements
along with a new commanding officer.

347
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:20,392
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but you've been relieved of your duties.

348
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:25,512
OK, wait. I am not saying there shouldn't
be an increased military presence,

349
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:29,756
but the mission must remain the same,
and if Major Sheppard were here...

350
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:34,792
We've spoken to Major Sheppard.
He dialled in to check on your progress.

351
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,114
We informed him of the situation
and he agrees with us.

352
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:42,552
He wouldn't do that, General.
I know John Sheppard.

353
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,521
Apparently you don't know him
as well as you thought.

354
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:51,553
He stated categorically it's the only way
to ensure the security of the project.

355
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,393
- Let's get outta here.
- Why?

356
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:58,554
You wanna see Earth? It's out there.

357
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:03,513
I thought you'd want to spend time
in your home. Visit with friends.

358
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:06,072
There is an idea.

359
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,281
Hey!

360
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:14,753
Mitch. Dex.

361
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:18,552
You didn't think you could
pass through town without seeing us?

362
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:22,316
You gonna invite us in or what?

363
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,474
Yeah, sure. What the hell.

364
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,237
All right! Hi, I'm Dex.

365
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:46,395
- What is this?
- Is there a problem?

366
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,999
- Elizabeth.
- Rodney, I need to talk to you.

367
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,235
- Can it wait?
- No. Something is very wrong here.

368
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,996
I ran a diagnostic on the ZPM.
These are the results I keep getting back.

369
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,394
- I'm not a scientist.
- Neither's anyone else here.

370
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:04,031
The laws of physics
have flown out the window.

371
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,798
- Problem with your equipment?
- I checked. It's fine.

372
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:12,002
If your solution doesn't work,
it's not your fault.

373
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:15,951
We'll have to accept the fact
that we can't go back.

374
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:18,273
What?

375
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:28,391
Our boys were pinned down. Hotshot here
takes his chopper right over this bridge.

376
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:33,683
- We're supposed to follow him.
- I'm not flying over enemy tanks.

377
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:35,401
- Over what?
- Tanks.

378
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,793
- You're welcome.
- Ha-ha!

379
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:42,082
I still love that, man!

380
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,916
Yeah, that was... priceless.

381
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,235
But we got that Special Ops team
out of there, didn't we, Shep?

382
00:30:51,403 --> 00:30:55,362
- Yes, we did.
- That was some flying, Shep.

383
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:05,671
- Look who's in the pizza business.
- No, sir. I caught the guy on the way up.

384
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:08,880
I was thinking about you. Come in.

385
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:14,121
Looks like we are having a party.

386
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:17,081
- Yes.
- I got pizza.

387
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,234
All right!

388
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:25,636
- I've been relieved of my command.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

389
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:28,237
They're gonna militarise Atlantis.

390
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,236
Interesting. It was bound
to happen sooner or later.

391
00:31:32,403 --> 00:31:34,553
So, you're OK with this?

392
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,521
How did you expect them to react
about the Wraith?

393
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:40,117
I thought I'd be kept in the loop.

394
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:43,036
Why don't you go home,
spend some time with Simon?

395
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:46,593
- Simon?
- He's important to you, isn't he?

396
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:50,676
Yes. I just don't remember
ever telling you that.

397
00:31:53,803 --> 00:31:56,397
Well, how else would I have known?

398
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:00,034
We didn't know what to think.

399
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:04,594
This guy was supposedly one of
the most ruthless warlords in Afghanistan

400
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:06,355
and he sits at our table.

401
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,878
- Sir, you gotta hear this.
- I was there.

402
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:13,036
Yeah, you remember. Turns out
he wants to practise his English on us.

403
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:17,162
- Shep spent half the night talking to him.
- Yeah, that was funny.

404
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:20,838
He wouldn't even let you
go to the bathroom.

405
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:28,559
Then two days later
you guys were killed outside Kabul.

406
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:38,594
These results say this reality
isn't governed by any natural laws.

407
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:42,915
It's like looking at a cell culture
and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters.

408
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,473
- Rodney, you need to calm down.
- No, I need to get agitated.

409
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:52,161
I'm realising all of this is a lie.
This and this and this!

410
00:32:56,283 --> 00:33:00,322
- What are you saying?
- Your chopper took an RPG.

411
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:04,999
There was barely enough left
to bring back for a funeral.

412
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:08,360
- What?
- You guys have been dead for years.

413
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:12,911
Don't get me wrong,
it's really nice seeing you.

414
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,517
- You too, Miss Watson.
- Sir...

415
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:18,197
She was my sixth-grade teacher.

416
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,958
I don't remember your name
but I remember you wouldn't date me.

417
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:24,637
Shep, I think you should see a doctor.

418
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:28,159
- Oh, really?
- You're acting pretty strange.

419
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:32,637
I'm acting strange, huh?

420
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:42,393
Major!

421
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:50,476
Now you see what I mean?

422
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:56,991
The McKay I know would never accept
the militarisation of Atlantis without a fight.

423
00:33:57,163 --> 00:34:01,315
I don't think Major Sheppard would
agree to it without speaking to me.

424
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:04,680
You shouldn't take it personally.
Think of it like a blessing.

425
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,119
You have a life.
You can get back to it now.

426
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:11,958
No. I'm not buying this any more.
Who are you really?

427
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:14,994
Who am I? What do you mean?

428
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,840
- You shot me!
- You're already dead!

429
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:21,392
Sir, give me...

430
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:25,715
I'm beginning to have my doubts
about you. I wouldn't put them to a test.

431
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:37,835
Now, somebody explain to me
what the hell is going on here.

432
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:42,554
Dr Weir.

433
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:48,555
OK, no more lies. What is this?
What's happening to me?

434
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:53,114
There's no point in deluding you
any longer.

435
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:01,317
Now you know.

436
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:13,402
Where's Rodney?

437
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:18,114
The real Dr McKay and his team
reside in their own illusory worlds.

438
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:21,353
I wanna see them. Please.

439
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:33,715
What happened?

440
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,841
I drew you together
from your fractured realities.

441
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:41,394
- I'm talking about the beer I had.
- Sheppard discovered the truth first.

442
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:45,636
- He did?
- Home was a research base in Antarctica.

443
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:50,757
Although I did dream
about a bachelor pad like that.

444
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:55,394
He seemed uniquely capable
of manipulating his own fabricated reality.

445
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:57,952
The scenarios I could have cooked up!

446
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:01,672
The realities you experienced
were fabrications of your own minds.

447
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:07,236
Since you had no memories of Earth,
you shared in Major Sheppard's illusion.

448
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:09,920
I thought that was you.

449
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,881
It's unfortunate
you all became aware so quickly.

450
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:16,797
However, you may now create
a fabricated reality of your own choosing

451
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,113
for the remainder of your lives.

452
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:22,275
- What?
- That's not gonna work for us.

453
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:26,231
I'm afraid
the matter's beyond your control.

454
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:31,878
- Well, we'll find a way to fight you.
- That would be quite impossible, Major.

455
00:36:32,043 --> 00:36:35,672
Even now you are simply experiencing
a shared fabrication.

456
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:39,281
It's best if you try
to make a life for yourselves.

457
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:42,833
This isn't life.
What do you want us to do, just pretend?

458
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:45,597
I'm sorry, but that's all I can offer you.

459
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:48,072
Wait.

460
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:51,481
- Why would you do this?
- To protect ourselves.

461
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,434
From us?

462
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,117
We did not intend to harm anyone.

463
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,843
Unlike you,
we exist in a non-corporeal form

464
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:04,076
susceptible to the destructive effects
of the Stargate on our home world.

465
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:05,722
What destructive effects?

466
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:09,273
The energy readings we had
were life signs. You were in the mist.

467
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:13,561
We are the mist. Every time
the gate is activated, lives are lost.

468
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:18,717
Over time, explorers have come and gone,
completely unaware of our existence.

469
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:22,000
Sacrifices are made to ensure our secrecy.

470
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:24,233
When you came back,
we grew concerned.

471
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:28,476
To learn your intentions,
we had no choice but to enter your minds.

472
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:32,921
When we discovered what you'd do, we
were forced to take preventive measures.

473
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:36,162
You said you'd let others come and go.

474
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,314
Why not allow us to do the same?

475
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:41,759
Your desire to return to your home world
was too strong.

476
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:46,519
The energy required to gate to another
galaxy would have killed millions of us.

477
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:52,842
So when we dialled the gate...

478
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:56,882
You never dialled the gate.
You just imagined you did.

479
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:59,955
You are unconscious even now
on the planet's surface.

480
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,114
So none of this is real?

481
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,074
The cute brunette. Of course.

482
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:10,236
How do you go from "You're a pig
but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?

483
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:14,078
We lacked a sophisticated understanding
of your world.

484
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:18,714
As a result, the illusions we created
from your thoughts were ultimately flawed.

485
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:22,159
The dead people were... a dead giveaway.

486
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:24,393
Dead people? What were you doing?

487
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:28,442
- If you had just told us...
- Wait. I just realised something.

488
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:31,322
Our unconscious bodies
are still on the planet?

489
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:35,192
- Yes.
- So we need food, we need water, food.

490
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,399
We won't live long in this state.

491
00:38:37,563 --> 00:38:40,077
Make the most of the time you have left.

492
00:38:40,963 --> 00:38:43,079
You're killing us to save yourselves.

493
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:47,361
In order to save millions of our kind.
I believe you would do the same.

494
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:51,198
If we do not go back,
our friends will come looking for us.

495
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,877
- Others of your kind?
- They'll show up.

496
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:57,513
What you gonna do, kill them too?

497
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:00,993
- More will come.
- They'll work out how to access the gate.

498
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,518
Then millions of your kind will die.

499
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,994
We don't leave people behind,

500
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:13,519
and if you were really General Hammond,
you'd know that.

501
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:21,803
But if you allow us to leave here,
we promise we will never return, ever.

502
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:27,040
You will not have to fear us ever again.
I give you my word.

503
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,753
How can you make such a promise
when you so desire to return home?

504
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:35,602
Sure, we'd like to go home.

505
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:38,800
We're not willing to kill millions
of your kind to do it.

506
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:43,432
You've been in our heads.
You're in our heads right now.

507
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:46,322
You should know we mean that.

508
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:59,275
I understand.

509
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:29,992
I don't mean to sound negative
because that would be so not me,

510
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:33,599
but how do we know this isn't
a double fake-out? How do we know...

511
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:38,041
<i>This is your reality.</i>
<i>You have my word.</i>

512
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:45,195
- I'm starving. He's gotta be right.
- I wonder how long we've been out.

513
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:49,595
I need to get the control crystal
out of the DHD. Shouldn't take long.

514
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,754
I'll give you a hand.

515
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:56,281
Thank you for trusting us.

516
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:02,762
Rodney, be careful with that.
I wanna make sure we can get back home.

517
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:05,960
- You mean Atlantis.
- I think that's what she meant.

518
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:09,433
She could have meant we pull
a double fake-out and dial Earth.

519
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:13,994
Forget the double fake-out and get
the damn crystal. I'll do the dial-out.
