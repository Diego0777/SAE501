1
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:13,553
Reliable power generation
is one of our greatest concerns.

2
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,476
With this project
we hope soon to convert and utilise

3
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,441
the intense heat
trapped beneath our planet's surface.

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,482
Geothermal energy. What, using this?

5
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,918
Do you have any idea how complex...

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,632
- McKay.
- I'm sure it'll work like a charm.

7
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:33,156
Looks like you're accomplishing
great things here.

8
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:37,236
Since the last Wraith culling
we have diligently rebuilt our society.

9
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:40,281
Are you not concerned
you will attract their attention?

10
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:44,880
Yes, but we refuse to let that stop us
from striving to reach our potential.

11
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,477
To do otherwise
would mean victory for them.

12
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:51,238
However, we currently are working
on a viable defence.

13
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:54,234
Defence?

14
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,837
Really?

15
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,642
We've been here two days
before you mention that?

16
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:02,112
I had to learn that you could be trusted.

17
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:05,116
Are you talking
about a defensive weapon?

18
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:09,799
You could say that. Something we hope
will protect us from another Wraith culling.

19
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,602
- You expect it to happen again?
- Of course.

20
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:17,200
But if they return as they have historically,
they won't be here for 50 years.

21
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:19,354
50 years, you say?

22
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:25,316
- How about that weapon?
- Yes, if you'll just come this way.

23
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:28,759
You haven't told him
we woke the Wraith from hibernation.

24
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,153
Well, I really haven't had the chance.

25
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:34,042
- We've been here two days.
- One and a half, really.

26
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:37,718
Major, they're not expecting the Wraith
for another 50 years.

27
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:42,559
- They could show up at any time.
- Why don't you tell them?

28
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:48,793
- Reminds you of Area 51, doesn't it?
- Circa 1918.

29
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,954
Area 51 wasn't around in 1918, sir.

30
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:52,920
- The area was.
- True.

31
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:58,282
- These people couldn't have a weapon...
- Weapons come in all shapes and sizes.

32
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:05,272
Major Sheppard,
I think you'll find this intriguing.

33
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:13,395
OK. I'm intrigued. What is it?

34
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:17,841
Something that we hope will one day
make us completely immune to the Wraith.

35
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:29,039
Druhin says their drug
is several years from being finished.

36
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:33,037
Given their current level of technology,
that could be an understatement.

37
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,922
They only believe
they're close to a breakthrough.

38
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:40,759
You saw their entire civilisation
is based on the completion of that goal.

39
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,391
I would not underestimate them.

40
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:46,760
Do we know for sure
that the Wraith are an immediate threat?

41
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,596
We can probably bet
they don't have 50 years.

42
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,233
Hence Major Sheppard has generously
offered the Hoffans our help.

43
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:54,836
Has he?

44
00:03:56,283 --> 00:04:02,597
The fact is if they're onto something.
Maybe we can speed up the process.

45
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:05,760
OK, Major, you have a go.

46
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:10,394
- But if the drug is just a pipe dream...
- Dr Beckett's volunteered to help us.

47
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,713
Oh, he has, huh?

48
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,714
He will.

49
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,601
- It's not that I mind lending a hand.
- Of course not.

50
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,755
- You're a generous man.
- But it's the principle.

51
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:27,040
You can't volunteer someone
without consulting them first.

52
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:31,037
That's not even volunteering.
It's being pressed into service.

53
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:34,479
- And I'm not...
- In the military. I can't give you orders.

54
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:38,431
- He won't go through the Stargate.
- He's worse than Dr McCoy.

55
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:42,721
- Who?
- The TV character that Dr Beckett plays.

56
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,718
Converting a human body into energy and
sending it through a wormhole... insanity.

57
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:51,717
- How often do you go to an alien planet?
- I was already on one.

58
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,519
- Should you be messing with that stuff?
- I know what I'm doing.

59
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,639
They've mastered a few basics.

60
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,478
Biochemistry, physiology, perhaps
even some form of molecular biology.

61
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,952
- Fairly impressive...
- Our people's legacy.

62
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:14,162
This room represents hundreds of years
of medical knowledge.

63
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,315
I am Perna, chief scientist for the project.

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:22,159
John Sheppard. Oh, and this is Teyla
and Lieutenant Ford.

65
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:26,999
Carson. Beckett. Doctor.
I mean, call me Carson.

66
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:29,438
I'm Dr McKay. Dr Rodney McKay.

67
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,838
I hope you find our facilities suitable.

68
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,757
Oh, they're charming. Perfectly charming.

69
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:46,239
Long ago this city was a testament
to our imagination, our creative spirit,

70
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,995
to endless possibility.

71
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,642
How long ago was that?

72
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,239
We have been forced to rebuild
many times, never to our potential.

73
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:56,201
That is why perfecting the drug
is so important.

74
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:59,833
It is more than a defence
against the Wraith. It is our future.

75
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:04,155
With respect, you cannot prevent
the culling. It is a fact of existence.

76
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,919
A fact we challenge. We will always seek
to end the cycle of destruction.

77
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,995
The Wraith will prevent any race
from advancing too far.

78
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,395
- You figure you can beat 'em?
- Yes. Through knowledge.

79
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:36,673
A number of archives like this
are hidden throughout the city.

80
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:39,562
Their existence is known only to a few.

81
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:43,602
This is very impressive.

82
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,994
We preserve the accomplishments
of each generation

83
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:49,597
before they are wiped out by the Wraith.

84
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,277
So everything your people learned
is in here.

85
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,434
And in other identical archives.

86
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:58,073
In case they destroy one.
You guys are serious about this.

87
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,598
Standing on the shoulders
of our forefathers.

88
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:03,231
How long have you worked
on this Wraith drug?

89
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:08,033
150 years ago our scientists were close
to creating a viable prototype,

90
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,239
but died before seeing its fruition.

91
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:13,998
You're hoping that if this world's
no good to them, they'll move on?

92
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,996
The Wraith cannot possibly
perceive us as a threat.

93
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:20,473
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how they would react.

94
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:24,636
If they choose to wipe you
out of existence, you will be helpless.

95
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,919
We cannot hope to control their actions.

96
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,793
We can only do what we can to end
a cycle that has gone on for far too long.

97
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:36,640
His name was Farrol Mylan.

98
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:41,399
Before he died in the last culling, he was
one of our most celebrated researchers.

99
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:43,554
He was the one who found it.

100
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,873
- Found what?
- The key.

101
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:50,161
His journals tell of one man who survived
an encounter with the Wraith.

102
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:54,475
Farrol and his team discovered
that this man possessed a unique protein.

103
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:59,512
He could resist the chemical released by
the Wraith to drain life from their victims.

104
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:02,117
After painstaking trial and error...

105
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:05,002
Farrol made a copy of the protein.

106
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:08,553
He was eventually able to create
a prototype of a drug

107
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,112
to interfere
with the Wraith feeding process.

108
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:16,038
- And it worked?
- He was killed before it could be used.

109
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:20,958
And it's been your job to make certain
his work wasn't in vain.

110
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:24,240
- Quite the responsibility.
- It is a great honour.

111
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:31,313
How do you know that this Farrol
wasn't just embellishing his results?

112
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:34,600
Or making them up.
All you have to go on are his notes.

113
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,721
He and his team worked
until the last possible moment.

114
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:42,035
They knew the Wraith ships were
overhead and worked through the night,

115
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:45,991
hoping to provide one more insight,
one last thread of knowledge.

116
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:50,156
Not for themselves,
but for the generation that would survive.

117
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:59,080
10,000 soldiers gave their lives
to give them those last few hours.

118
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:03,555
The last words of Farrol's journal
are known to all Hoffans.

119
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:07,396
I meant no disrespect, Perna.

120
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:13,671
It's all right. More than just his journals
survived the culling.

121
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:18,075
His research materials
were safeguarded as well,

122
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:23,363
including carefully preserved
Wraith cell samples,

123
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:26,799
which we still use in our work today.

124
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,954
Please.

125
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:34,194
See for yourself.

126
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,034
That's incredible.

127
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

128
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,002
In a Petri dish. We are talking
about 150-year-old Wraith cells.

129
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:04,314
For all we know
they could be immune to the drug by now.

130
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:05,962
I don't think so.

131
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:08,353
I ran a few tests of my own

132
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:12,072
using cells from the Wraith arm
Major Sheppard brought from Athos.

133
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:15,553
The results were the same.
Near complete resistance.

134
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:18,556
They've got something.
I'm more surprised than anyone.

135
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,998
So what do you recommend?

136
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,552
That we take their work to the next level.

137
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,442
I've informed the Hoffans
of our guest in the brig.

138
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:28,992
You realise what you're asking for?

139
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,836
I do.

140
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,438
- Anything I should know about?
- No, sir, he's been quiet.

141
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:46,039
- Still trying to make you see things?
- He's given up on that.

142
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,194
I didn't think he'd last this long.

143
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:01,193
Hello again, Major Sheppard.

144
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:08,033
Sorry if I woke you.

145
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:11,036
Just came by to see
if there was anything you needed.

146
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,273
Magazine, fresh towels.

147
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:22,356
We've been talking for a couple of weeks
now and I don't even know your name.

148
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,320
You guys do have names?

149
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:28,235
Let me guess. Steve?

150
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:32,521
I am your death.
That is all you need to know.

151
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:34,833
I prefer Steve.

152
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,234
What do you hope to gain from this?

153
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:46,555
Just trying to bridge the gap between
our cultures, get to know you better.

154
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:52,313
And trying to figure out how to keep your
kind from sucking the life out of people.

155
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:57,511
Even if I told you what you want to know,
it would change nothing.

156
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:02,438
You are doomed, as are any humans
that stand in our way.

157
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:05,163
Can't be a nice way to die.

158
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:07,883
Hungry, slow,

159
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:13,600
knowing your food source
is just out of reach.

160
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:19,432
- Why do you keep me here?
- I need to know what we're up against.

161
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:24,233
For example, how many of those hive
ships have you got and where are they?

162
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,997
You have nothing to offer me in return.

163
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:32,072
We could talk about easing your hunger...

164
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,962
Steve.

165
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:38,715
You would never sacrifice
one of your own kind.

166
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:45,675
And yet it is all that stands between you
and the information you seek.

167
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,322
Using living Wraith cells
is our only recourse at this juncture.

168
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:04,078
Without them we have no way of knowing
if the drug is viable.

169
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,872
You said it worked on the cells
of the severed Wraith arm.

170
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:12,514
It did, but those were already
in a partially decayed state.

171
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,082
We need live samples.

172
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:17,997
With new samples you think it's possible
to create a prototype?

173
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:20,040
Given enough time, yes, I do.

174
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,433
He's got a point.
The Hoffans are obsessed.

175
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,594
- Thank you, Rodney.
- I agree.

176
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,993
But their obsession may be their undoing.

177
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:32,237
Even if they do undo, it'd be good for us.
Wouldn't you want to be immune?

178
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:35,156
Not if it meant
the lives the Wraith might spare.

179
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:38,599
This drug would only be of value

180
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:42,597
if everyone everywhere
possessed the same immunity.

181
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,357
There's a thought worth pursuing.

182
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,195
I agree.

183
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,355
Major, have you made any progress
with your prisoner?

184
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,037
Not yet, but he just blinked.

185
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,592
He blinked? What does that mean?

186
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:59,722
He's still holding on, but he's indicated
to me that he may break soon.

187
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:03,762
- And he indicated this to you by blinking?
- Yes.

188
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,881
No offence, Major, but so far
he hasn't told you a thing.

189
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:12,640
He could linger this way for months
and ultimately we'll learn nothing.

190
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,112
The Wraith could be on their way to Hoff.

191
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:19,435
If your prisoner holds the key
to the creation of this drug,

192
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,594
should we not take advantage of this?

193
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,436
How could we get the sample
off him safely?

194
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,912
We possess the weapons
used in his capture.

195
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,155
It would be a simple matter
of incapacitating him again.

196
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:33,599
- So, then, it's possible?
- It's possible.

197
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:42,882
Hi, Steve.

198
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:46,195
Bye, Steve.

199
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:59,914
Doctor.

200
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,235
- Is he... You're certain he's...
- He's down, doc.

201
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,155
Do your thing.

202
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:17,718
- Almost looks peaceful, doesn't he?
- Peaceful? You're out of your mind.

203
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,482
I have never seen devices such as these.

204
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:35,794
The work you've done refining the drug
has been good.

205
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:39,319
With all this, we can make it better.

206
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:44,433
Your biggest problem
is that the test inoculations

207
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:47,879
failed to show enough presence
in human cells to be effective.

208
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:50,557
- We need a better delivery system.
- Exactly.

209
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:55,274
We'll recreate the key protein in the
serum and work our way up from there.

210
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:58,321
If we can avoid re-engineering it
from a natural source

211
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,553
and make an entirely synthetic version,

212
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:02,759
it should increase the efficiency.

213
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:08,043
- Such a thing is possible?
- Anything's possible if you give it a go.

214
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:11,320
Come on, then.
A bald head is soon shaved.

215
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:16,079
You speak differently than the others.

216
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,438
You noticed that, did you?

217
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:23,518
Sorry if I confuse you. Trust me, where
I come from, it all makes perfect sense.

218
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,312
- What is it like?
- Scotland? Oh, I think it's beautiful.

219
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,202
But I'm told it's something
of an acquired taste.

220
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:34,993
I meant your world. It must be so peaceful
there, knowing the Wraith will not come.

221
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,917
You'd be surprised
how not peaceful it is.

222
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:42,112
We're spoiled rotten,
now that I think of it.

223
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:46,038
You miss it. I'm sorry for enquiring.

224
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,353
Oh, no. Don't be, love.

225
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:55,155
One can see the various
refraction changes required

226
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:59,999
to complete the preliminary stage required
to boil down the base material.

227
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,954
Perna.

228
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:38,636
100% cellular penetration
in all five test inoculations. Incredible.

229
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:43,115
There's still a lot of data to be analysed,
but the initial results are promising.

230
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:46,355
Dr Beckett's efforts
have advanced the project by decades.

231
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,957
Perna's formula was right on track.

232
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:53,753
It was a matter of changing its molecular
design to be better absorbed by the body.

233
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:57,836
This is an enormous victory for
our people. I don't know how to thank you.

234
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,234
No need. Of course, it's only a preliminary.

235
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,440
How soon until you can set up
the next stage of testing?

236
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,514
You'll have a schedule later today.

237
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,482
I'm sorry. Next stage?

238
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:14,433
Your report makes it clear that the project
is ready to proceed to its next phase.

239
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:18,835
We want to test the serum's effectiveness
against your prisoner.

240
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,280
You support this?

241
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:31,800
He's gonna die, so we might as well
make good use of him while he's alive.

242
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:37,560
The Geneva Convention prohibits
using prisoners for scientific experiments.

243
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:41,602
No offence, doc, but had the Wraith
attended the Geneva Convention,

244
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,472
they would have tried
to feed on everyone there.

245
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:50,763
Beckett's report indicates we have no idea
of the long-term effect on humans.

246
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,154
We know what the long-term effects
of Wraith culling are.

247
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:58,157
We're talking about putting a human
in the same room as a starving Wraith.

248
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,794
- Once we start down that road...
- Which road did you think we were on?

249
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:06,797
Not this one. At least not this fast.

250
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:11,397
Having spent time with the prisoner,
I don't pity him.

251
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,599
He's gonna die anyway.

252
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:19,832
- This drug could be useful someday.
- Someday.

253
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:23,837
The point is, we don't get
a lot of opportunities like this.

254
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,073
Do you know how obsessed
the Hoffans are?

255
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,996
When they found out
we had a live Wraith prisoner...

256
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,231
He's going to die.

257
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:36,635
I tried to feed him live stuff, but apparently
there's only one item on his menu.

258
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:40,318
What about the test subject?
If the drug fails...

259
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:42,280
We're not just grabbing anybody.

260
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:46,755
The test subject is a terminally ill patient
who has volunteered himself.

261
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:53,678
These are not exactly the type of decisions
I expected to make on this expedition.

262
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,961
Do it.

263
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:20,522
Hi, Steve.

264
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:22,992
More samples?

265
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,757
I was thinking more of a field trip.

266
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:29,552
You want sustenance, I want information.

267
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:35,192
You are incapable of offering such a trade.

268
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:40,562
You tell me something of value,
I let you eat.

269
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:43,635
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

270
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:49,840
Very well.

271
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:00,395
Are they ready?

272
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,919
Major Sheppard is loading the prisoner
into Jumper Two.

273
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:09,441
Sergeant Bates is standing by
for their arrival at the rendezvous site.

274
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,353
Jumper Two, what's your status?

275
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:31,673
<i>Cosy in here. Ready to depart</i>.

276
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:34,516
- <i>Be safe, Major</i>.
- That's the plan.

277
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:37,959
- Jumper Two, you are go for launch.
- <i>Roger that</i>.

278
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:41,639
Dial it up.

279
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,719
This isn't supposed to be fun.

280
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:11,635
Perna explained to me about your illness.

281
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,556
I want you to know how sorry I am.

282
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:17,635
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

283
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:20,078
It's my time, Dr Beckett.

284
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,882
I'm at peace with my fate.

285
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:28,675
It's important you know that we may be
talking about a less than peaceful ending.

286
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:33,678
I have explained to Merell
in great detail what may befall him.

287
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:39,759
You should know this drug has
only worked in a laboratory simulation.

288
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:42,721
We don't know for certain
what will happen.

289
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:47,240
Even if it doesn't work,
you'll learn something of value,

290
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,271
how to perfect it in the future.

291
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:56,437
Possibly, but that's no reason
for you to face that creature.

292
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:00,873
Dr Beckett, I'm not afraid.

293
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:04,194
No matter what happens,
my death will have meaning.

294
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:10,636
Is that not something we all strive for,
to die knowing we made a difference?

295
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:13,271
I want to do this.

296
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:17,402
Please don't deny me the chance
to help my people.

297
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:29,631
- What do you think?
- It goes against everything I believe in.

298
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,397
There's an oath among medical people.

299
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:35,031
It begins, "First, do no harm."

300
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:38,912
- Important words to you.
- More than words, Perna.

301
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,996
"The battle rages at the very threshold
of our laboratory now."

302
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:46,951
"We know that these few final hours
have been dearly purchased,

303
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:50,274
yet our concentration has not waned."

304
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:52,434
"We cannot hope to save ourselves,

305
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:57,916
but we can hope that one last insight,
one last revelation before we die

306
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:02,042
may prevent this terrible day
from happening again."

307
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,194
Farrol's last journal entry.

308
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:07,154
More than words, Carson.

309
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:10,520
I understand that. I do.
But there are too many unknowns.

310
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:13,595
- We need time to determine...
- There is no time.

311
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:18,359
Are you so afraid of making a mistake
that you can't see what we're up against?

312
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:23,153
This isn't about making mistakes, Perna.
It's about the end justifying the means.

313
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,281
In our profession,
that's a very slippery slope.

314
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:30,398
We have no idea if this'll work.

315
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,316
We could be sacrificing that man
to a monster.

316
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,836
There will be another to take his place.

317
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,432
That's just what I'm afraid of.

318
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,873
They are ready.

319
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:54,354
Careful, sir.

320
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,557
This is the sustenance you promised?

321
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:10,601
A little change in plans.

322
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:15,314
You tell me something right now
or the dinner party's cancelled.

323
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:16,962
What do you want to know?

324
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:21,082
How many hive ships have become
operational since we awakened one?

325
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:23,473
All of them, Major Sheppard.

326
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:28,273
First they will travel their own
feeding grounds and gather strength.

327
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,393
We are a patient race, Major.

328
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:35,599
When we have taken our fill
and gathered our strength,

329
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:39,233
we will join force and come for you.

330
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:43,157
Do you have any idea when that'll be?
Morning, afternoon?

331
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,353
Open it up.

332
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:02,077
You don't have to do this.

333
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:05,921
I know.

334
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,392
I'm ready.

335
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:36,437
He is weak.

336
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:24,121
You are both heroes of the Hoffan people.

337
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:26,274
I'll admit, it was amazing.

338
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:29,958
I hope your friends will join us
for a banquet to honour your work.

339
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:33,513
They'd be glad to,
but aren't celebrations a bit premature?

340
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:35,958
The results speak for themselves.

341
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:40,082
I intend to ask the Council to approve
mass production of the serum.

342
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,962
After today I doubt
they will offer any resistance.

343
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:46,638
- That is wonderful news.
- With all due respect, it isn't.

344
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,634
We're talking about one test here.

345
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,715
I'm as pleased as anyone
with the results,

346
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:54,636
but we have a lot of work to do
before we can use it.

347
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:58,637
Dr Beckett wishes to run
a full series of tests on Merell

348
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,873
prior to issuing his final report.

349
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:05,355
There may have been mitigating
circumstances. The man was dying.

350
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,242
Of course. I'll bring it up with Council.

351
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:11,198
To success.

352
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:17,474
- What is it?
- Steve. He doesn't look so good.

353
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,842
- How long has he been like this?
- Since the test.

354
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:25,722
- Think it's a ruse?
- It is not their way.

355
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,759
Hey.

356
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:36,039
What have you done to me?

357
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:55,520
- We need Beckett in here.
- Go.

358
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:03,514
We're gonna help you.

359
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,439
Don't feel pity for me.

360
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:13,874
You will suffer far worse
when the others come for you.

361
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:38,515
Major. I was just about to cut him open.

362
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,674
Then I was just leaving.

363
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:44,916
I've already done a series of tests
you might like to know the results of.

364
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,482
You know what killed him?

365
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:51,159
It was all of his vital organs
shutting down almost simultaneously.

366
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:54,156
- Did he starve to death?
- No.

367
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:57,440
I don't think he died
from a lack of nourishment.

368
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:58,922
What was it?

369
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,519
Tests revealed a significant amount
of Hoffan serum in his blood.

370
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:07,359
I'm guessing we'll find similar
trace amounts in each of his organs.

371
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:10,401
Why did the Hoffan drug
end up in his blood?

372
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:16,195
We know that when the Wraith feed, they
release a chemical to their victims' bodies.

373
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:19,002
What it does we don't yet understand.

374
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:23,918
I can only assume that it prepares
the human body to be drained of life.

375
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:28,952
The serum is designed to shield the victim
from that initial chemical release.

376
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,442
OK.

377
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:34,312
The serum protein may have mutated
when exposed to the chemical,

378
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:36,474
triggering a toxic reaction.

379
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:41,034
- Instead of feeding off him...
- He was poisoned.

380
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:45,754
So if the serum did this, it's more
than just a defence against the Wraith.

381
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:48,992
It kills them.

382
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:54,920
I fail to see cause for alarm. This
development increases the serum's value.

383
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:59,793
No, it takes away any doubt about what
the Wraith will do when they come here.

384
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:01,442
I don't see the difference.

385
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,992
Once they learn you possess this weapon,

386
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:08,122
the Wraith will wipe your people
from existence in retaliation.

387
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:13,198
Or they may simply leave us alone
once they learn we are unpalatable.

388
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:16,514
'Cause they're such
a live-and-let-live kind of race.

389
00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:20,801
Maybe when you were talking about
this being defensive, but now...

390
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:22,794
You fail to see the larger picture.

391
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:26,797
For the first time we have a way
to not just defend, but strike back.

392
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:30,558
Is this about revenge
or saving your people?

393
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:34,511
You can't hope to understand
the generations of suffering.

394
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:38,358
I've been in one of their hives
and fought against their ships.

395
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,402
When the first Wraith dies
because of this drug, they won't move on.

396
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,554
They'll make the problem go away.

397
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:50,195
They will seek out any who have had
contact with you. They will spare no one.

398
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:55,153
I know how passionate you are about this.
This drug is sort of your Holy Grail.

399
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:58,599
- You're gonna have to shelve it until...
- No.

400
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:02,756
I'm serious.
Otherwise we can't help you any more.

401
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:05,801
You don't understand, Major. It's too late.

402
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:09,672
I have made my recommendation
to the Council and they've agreed.

403
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:13,601
We have already begun
inoculating our people.

404
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,558
You're leaving?

405
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:37,796
Unless you'll go back to formula on
the serum, there's no point in my staying.

406
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:39,601
Re-open the project.

407
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:44,075
With more work we could prevent the
mutation, maintain it as a defensive drug.

408
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:45,915
Merell is dead.

409
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,676
The cause of death
is still to be determined.

410
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,482
- They need to stop the inoculations.
- They won't.

411
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:55,760
- A man is dead.
- More won't necessarily follow.

412
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,756
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't make them stop.

413
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,993
Not without more proof.

414
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,477
Perna, you're one of
the brightest people I've ever met.

415
00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:12,352
For your own sake, I beg you,

416
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:14,639
have no more part in this.

417
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,158
At least until we know more.

418
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:22,117
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

419
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:26,356
Because I was among the first
to be inoculated.

420
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,953
I appreciate your sense of urgency,

421
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:36,479
but at this point it would be unwise
to rush to any conclusions.

422
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:39,077
You want to exercise caution?
Are you serious?

423
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,122
You yourself have told us the Wraith
could be on their way here right now.

424
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,001
We have to move forward.

425
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,916
You're speaking
on behalf of a lot of people.

426
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,313
You think I'd force this choice
on my people?

427
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:53,680
No, sir, our people
are in complete agreement.

428
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:57,916
Your people may be dead before
the Wraith even get here, for all you know.

429
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,233
Chancellor, please. It's not too late.

430
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:03,440
Suspend the inoculations
until we know what killed Merell.

431
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,720
He was terminal. We don't know
the serum caused his death.

432
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,272
He suffered
a complete respiratory breakdown.

433
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:13,800
Which could have been due
to his condition. His sickness had spread.

434
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:17,876
Are you willing to risk lives
based on that assumption? I'm not.

435
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:21,961
- <i>Major Sheppard</i>.
- Go ahead, Teyla.

436
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:25,911
We're in the medical centre. We need help.

437
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,956
My God.

438
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:47,515
The doctors say they began arriving last
night and their numbers are increasing.

439
00:35:47,683 --> 00:35:53,360
I'm on it. Lieutenant, radio Weir. Tell them
we need a full medical team on a jumper.

440
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:55,514
Roger that.

441
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:09,642
Perna. Perna.

442
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:13,159
I need help here. Oxygen!

443
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:14,961
Take it easy.

444
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:31,674
Leave us.

445
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:36,119
- Do you have any idea what's going on?
- I do, Major.

446
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:40,640
- Half those who took that drug are dying.
- Half of them, Major. Half.

447
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:45,038
The statistics are clear
and the numbers are holding at that level.

448
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,878
Which means the other 50%
of those we inoculated will live

449
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,193
and destroy any Wraith who feed on them.

450
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:53,081
I don't believe this.

451
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:56,394
The Wraith will know the full conviction
of the Hoffan people.

452
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:01,842
- Conviction?
- If we spread this drug to every human,

453
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:05,552
future generations would never know
the horror of a culling.

454
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,715
You're deliberately sacrificing
millions of lives.

455
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:11,317
An end to the Wraith.

456
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,673
You can't comprehend the bargain in that?

457
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:17,801
You can't make a bargain like that
for your entire people.

458
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:21,239
- Do you think I'm alone in this?
- I think you're delusional.

459
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,713
You shall see. We are putting it
to a vote as we speak.

460
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:28,034
I will stand by the decision
of the majority.

461
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:33,281
- Does that satisfy you?
- Do they know what they're voting on?

462
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:37,678
Yes. I promise you.

463
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:41,836
- You'll back off if it doesn't go your way?
- You have my word.

464
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:55,035
Use any rooms you need for overflow.
We need to keep this area clear for triage.

465
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:03,315
Teyla, there you are. Make sure oxygen
is properly deployed in the hospital.

466
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:07,476
- Doctor...
- Have non-critical patients use it in turns.

467
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:12,673
Teyla, you're not listening to me.
Where's Perna? I need her.

468
00:38:12,843 --> 00:38:14,674
Carson.

469
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:37,435
I would... like to have seen Atlantis.

470
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:44,042
Perna, I'm so sorry.

471
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:48,720
Don't look at me that way.

472
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:54,154
I am at peace with what I have done,
as you should be.

473
00:38:55,363 --> 00:38:57,513
I wish I had no part in this.

474
00:38:58,523 --> 00:39:00,753
You gave us hope.

475
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:06,032
For years our people have been working

476
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:10,242
towards this very moment.

477
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:16,876
We didn't betray the forefathers.

478
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:22,753
We fulfilled their destiny, their promise.

479
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:34,122
Stay. Stay with me. Stay.

480
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:36,274
I'm here.

481
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,798
It's OK.

482
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,477
- You OK?
- Aye.

483
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,914
- I'm told you're leaving.
- Yes, we are.

484
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,358
Not that it hasn't been... lovely.

485
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:12,482
I wanted you to see the results
of the vote before you left.

486
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,193
96% in favour.

487
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:24,958
- Does the vote include all your people?
- Every one.

488
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,718
So you see, Major, we speak
with one voice and we are resolute.

489
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:31,078
Yeah, I can see that.

490
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:36,633
Next time I'd like to discuss disseminating
the drug on as many worlds as possible.

491
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:41,433
- We won't be doing that any time soon.
- Our victory may change your mind.

492
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:46,199
If and when we ever return,
I don't imagine you'll be here.

493
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:49,594
I don't imagine
anybody else will be either.

494
00:40:59,243 --> 00:41:01,234
Good luck.

495
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:10,561
"Victory at all costs."
