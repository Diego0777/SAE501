1
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:11,638
They are called the Genii. They are simple
people, but good farmers and fair traders.

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:15,955
We're still months away from producing
successful crops on the mainland,

3
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,114
and heading for a food shortage.

4
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,922
It's getting desperate.
We're almost out of coffee.

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,075
Maybe you should stop drinking
eleven cups a day.

6
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:27,041
I'm getting my fair share
before it's all gone.

7
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:29,717
- Sounds fair.
- Hm.

8
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:34,957
I'm all for trade. But shouldn't we
find a way to help defend ourselves?

9
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:39,674
- How can a bunch of farmers do that?
- Introduce us to people who can help.

10
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:42,198
For now let's take care of the basics.

11
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:44,797
It's good to get to know
your neighbours.

12
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,272
The Genii Stargate is near their village.

13
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:50,719
I suggest we walk.
The Puddle Jumper may alarm them.

14
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,192
As I said, they are very simple.

15
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:55,638
Sounds like a mission.

16
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,960
All right. Where to, Teyla?

17
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,114
We should allow them to come to us.

18
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,878
- If you know where their village is...
- They trust me.

19
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:21,352
- But that trust was hard-earned.
- OK.

20
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:24,833
- What is it you said they grow here?
- Many things.

21
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,597
They're best known for a bean
known as tava.

22
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:30,072
- What, java?
- Tava.

23
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:33,514
How will they know we're here?

24
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:36,322
They already do.

25
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:42,439
- They look friendly enough.
- The eldest is called Tyrus. We've traded.

26
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:49,795
- Teyla Emmagan.
- Tyrus.

27
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,193
- It has been many days.
- Too many.

28
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,081
Teyla.

29
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:59,271
This is Major Sheppard,
Dr McKay and Lieutenant Ford.

30
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:03,402
- My daughter Sora.
- You must be very proud.

31
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:09,878
- She's betrothed.
- I wasn't hitting on your daughter. I just...

32
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,955
They have come to trade
for a share of your crops.

33
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:16,798
- Yet you bring weapons.
- Only to defend ourselves.

34
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:21,639
- Do you dress of your own accord?
- Of course. Why?

35
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:24,317
He wants to know
if you work with us or for us.

36
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:28,158
Ah. These are my friends, Tyrus.

37
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:32,157
I would not have brought them
if I did not think them worthy to be yours.

38
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:36,033
We'll take you to see Cowen.

39
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,194
Follow me.

40
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,883
Maybe we should offer
a sense of humour in trade.

41
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,034
Sure. They can have yours.

42
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,639
Oh, please, my side. You slay me.

43
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm thinking about it.

44
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:59,994
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

45
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:14,278
- These medicines are potent?
- They can stop bacterial infections.

46
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:17,321
It would help us
through a harsh winter.

47
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:21,874
- Hm. We will need more than you offer.
- More?

48
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,511
You don't understand
how cool this medicine is.

49
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:28,835
- Leave if you wish.
- Leave?

50
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,563
I thought you said
they were fair traders.

51
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,962
We have always been able
to achieve a reasonable bargain.

52
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:40,240
You ask for much of our harvest.

53
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:44,112
Sufficient new crops must be planted
to replenish our stores,

54
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,478
or it is the Genii who will starve.

55
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:51,159
That will require new land to be cleared.
Clearing land is slow, hard work.

56
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:54,998
It will lose us growing time
between now and the next harvest.

57
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:58,633
OK. What if clearing land
was fast and easy?

58
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:05,556
You know a simple way of uprooting
the stump of a 300-year-old tree?

59
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:09,352
As a matter of fact, I do.

60
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:17,914
Come on over.
They're about to start.

61
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,995
Cover your ears!

62
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,313
- I don't understand.
- It can be loud.

63
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,077
Come on. You're gonna wish you did.

64
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,313
Lieutenant.

65
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,112
Fire in the hole.

66
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:44,714
It's called C4.

67
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,319
If you can supply us
with a sufficient quantity of C4,

68
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,394
we will trade the crop you require.

69
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,397
- This instead of the medicine?
- As well as the medicine.

70
00:05:57,563 --> 00:06:01,761
Really? That wasn't impressive enough?

71
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,914
It is you who are in need.

72
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,880
Well, I'll have to discuss this
with my people.

73
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,637
I'm sure we can come to terms.

74
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,636
Teyla, thank you for bringing
new trading partners.

75
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:19,237
Please stay as our guests.

76
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:22,315
There will be a harvest ceremony later.

77
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,078
Wonderful.

78
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,154
- Ford?
- Sir?

79
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,156
We're talking harvest ceremony.

80
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:35,280
Sounds like fun, sir.

81
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:37,593
I'll be back soon.

82
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:41,203
I should go back with the major.

83
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:58,558
Explosives?
This is a scientific expedition, Major.

84
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,635
- I know.
- But you want us to become arms dealers.

85
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:05,796
- Ever tried to clear a stump by hand?
- Yes. It's a hobby.

86
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:09,717
They are taking a chance by giving us
so much of their crop this year.

87
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:13,159
Plus the medicines I already agreed to?

88
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,121
I think in the future
I should do the negotiating.

89
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:22,912
- I did say I had to ask you first.
- To terms you already agreed to.

90
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,511
- Yes.
- You see why I have a problem with this?

91
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:29,800
Do we need food or not?
We are on the verge of rationing.

92
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,319
Much as I'd like to devote every mission
to tava beans...

93
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:37,112
I get your point. Tell them we agree.

94
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:49,554
We give thanks for a plentiful harvest.

95
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:51,714
We give thanks.

96
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,716
May next season be as fruitful.

97
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:58,842
And... to our new friends.

98
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,312
New friends.

99
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:09,191
Moonshine?

100
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,674
I thought you were man enough.

101
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:25,201
- You have no idea which way.
- I'm getting my bearings.

102
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:29,197
Translation: I'm lost.
They were very clear which route to take.

103
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:33,151
- I prefer straight lines.
- Everything's a short cut in your world.

104
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:36,633
- OK. Here it is again.
- What?

105
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,436
I'm picking up a strange reading
from over there.

106
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:45,839
- Define strange.
- You don't know what strange means?

107
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,994
- Of course.
- Weird, freakish, odd...

108
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:51,075
I'm trying to see if
it's worth getting off the route.

109
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,803
Radioactive readings in an Amish world.
Your call.

110
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,602
- We're lost anyway.
- I am not lost.

111
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:01,438
All right. Let's check it out.

112
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:39,233
- That is definitely...
- Strange.

113
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:42,236
- Not that Amish, really.
- Not so much.

114
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:44,917
Maybe they don't even know it's here.

115
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,362
This hatch has been oiled recently.

116
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,878
- We have to check it out.
- Really?

117
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,113
Of course we do.

118
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,512
- All right.
- Great.

119
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:21,322
The construction's architecturally
advanced. I don't think they made this.

120
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,194
Lieutenant, come in.

121
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:30,435
- Ford?
- The place is built like a bunker.

122
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,958
It must be shielded for RF.

123
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,512
The reading's stronger this way.

124
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,353
- What kind of readings?
- Palm readings.

125
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,878
- McKay.
- It's neutron radiation.

126
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:44,796
It's definitely a powerful energy source.

127
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:48,080
OK. Let's check it out.

128
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:53,119
I really think we should get out of here.

129
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,914
Now, this is strange.

130
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:53,002
Excuse me.
I must go and tend to a dispute.

131
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,553
- Is everything all right, Cowen?
- I will return shortly.

132
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:07,116
Maybe they exist
as two separate cultures.

133
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:09,751
Maybe.

134
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:11,993
Who cares?

135
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,397
How long you boys planning
on keeping us here?

136
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,799
If people could just learn to keep
their secret underground hatches locked...

137
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:30,673
So much for two separate cultures.

138
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:41,072
What am I going to do?

139
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:51,515
- I'm getting a weird vibe all of a sudden.
- I agree.

140
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:55,039
I've never seen the Genii behave this way.

141
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,678
Listen, we're just gonna step outside

142
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:05,074
and see if Major Sheppard
and Dr McKay are back.

143
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,155
- No one must leave.
- There's a Wraith ship in the area.

144
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:11,838
Wraith? Are you serious?

145
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,842
- We must warn our friends.
- You'll draw them to us.

146
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,880
Everyone must stay indoors.

147
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:36,915
Can we be careful with that?
It's fragile and if it...

148
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:41,034
We have a problem.

149
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,671
Then we have something in common.

150
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:46,801
Normally you would be shot
for discovering our secret.

151
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,636
And our people would question
our disappearance.

152
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,873
We would say the Wraith took you.

153
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:55,160
With no evidence to the contrary,
they would believe us.

154
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,439
You were saying.

155
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:03,482
You have technology,
knowledge new to us.

156
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:07,238
- This C4 of yours...
- It's not for blowing up stumps.

157
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:11,636
We have a more sophisticated
application for it.

158
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:15,273
What you people do with your C4
is none of our business.

159
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:17,434
We just need food.

160
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,993
As far as your secret
down here goes, well...

161
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:23,961
We say,
"What giant underground bunker?"

162
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:27,678
I want more than that.

163
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:30,596
Well, maybe we can give you more.

164
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,913
You have weapons
more powerful than C4?

165
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,551
Are you kidding? Weapons R Us. We...

166
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,363
We might.

167
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:42,276
What if I wanted more than weapons?

168
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:46,436
Did I mention that I know almost
everything about almost everything?

169
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:50,994
For Teyla Emmagan to have joined you,
you must have something much more.

170
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:55,873
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
we're looking for allies against the Wraith.

171
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,079
How about you guys?

172
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,558
- We wanna go outside.
- We can't let you.

173
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:10,036
- It's not safe.
- We can take care of ourselves.

174
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:13,001
- <i>Tyrus, please respond</i>.
- Receiving.

175
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:17,438
- <i>Bring them</i>.
- Understood.

176
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,878
Relinquish your weapons.

177
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,474
You will not be harmed.

178
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,797
You guys are full of surprises.

179
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,633
You missed
a hell of a harvest ceremony.

180
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,759
I can imagine.

181
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:51,721
- Oh, Teyla.
- I'm as surprised as you by all of this.

182
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm pretty surprised.

183
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:57,631
Teyla knows us only
as the simple farmers we show outsiders.

184
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:01,876
The secrecy of who and what we are
is our only defence against the Wraith.

185
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,596
One day all that will change.

186
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,521
You think you can do that
with an atomic bomb?

187
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:16,034
Now it's you who surprise me.

188
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,717
Radioactive readings,
a fascination with C4...

189
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:22,478
- You're just mentioning this now?
- It just came to me.

190
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:26,477
I assume you hope our C4
will solve your supercriticality problem.

191
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:28,395
- Will it?
- It might.

192
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,713
Depends on your designs.

193
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:34,876
- You know how to make an A-bomb?
- Most of my school chess team could.

194
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:39,116
The hard part is having sufficient
fissional materials of appropriate grade.

195
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,275
- And we do.
- You do?

196
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:46,197
The Genii were once
a great confederation of planets.

197
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:51,391
Millennia ago the Wraith had driven us
to the brink of total annihilation.

198
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,434
Our forefathers sought the protection
of bunkers like these,

199
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,436
originally created for wars long forgotten.

200
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:02,118
And it was here
that a small number of our people

201
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:04,751
managed to survive undetected.

202
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:11,122
Over the course of many, many years,
generation after generation,

203
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:15,401
we have made technological
developments here in secret.

204
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:19,602
So the whole farmer thing is just a front?

205
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:23,073
- So the Wraith do not suspect?
- More than that.

206
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,360
We do have many mouths to feed below.

207
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:28,593
I want to show you something. Come.

208
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:33,041
That thing you so carelessly threw
on the table. Can I take that along?

209
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,074
Come.

210
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,994
Stay as you are.

211
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:54,554
Down below, our military trains
as our scientists create weapons for them.

212
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:59,319
With our atomic weapon we believe
we can defeat the Wraith once and for all.

213
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,600
You realise long-term exposure
to radiation is dangerous?

214
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,993
Our scientists tell me otherwise.

215
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,836
- Well, they're wrong.
- Are we in danger now?

216
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:12,394
It would take weeks at these levels,
but I assume the Genii spend weeks here.

217
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:15,361
Many of our people
have spent their entire lives here.

218
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,514
Their entire short lives.

219
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:21,915
We'll be fine, as long as
you weren't planning on having children.

220
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,596
You're on the right track.
We're about 60 years ahead of you.

221
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:31,551
That is if you survive.
This shielding is woefully inadequate.

222
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:35,238
Now, uranium. How much do you have?

223
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:38,315
- Much more.
- It's nowhere near weapons grade.

224
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,917
We have had problems
in our purifying efforts.

225
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,597
The molecular structure
of the unwanted material

226
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,674
is like that of the desired material.

227
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:48,482
Diffusion. You must separate
the 235 from the 238.

228
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:52,841
If you remove the barrier between
two substances they split at different rates.

229
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:54,994
- You could do this?
- Of course.

230
00:18:55,163 --> 00:19:01,682
I think the real question is, right now,
are we allies or are we still prisoners?

231
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:10,036
We give thanks to our new friends.

232
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:12,433
We give thanks.

233
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,234
Please eat.

234
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,959
- You think there's lemon in this?
- I'm sure it's delicious.

235
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,796
- Have you seen anaphylactic shock?
- Eat.

236
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:36,117
I hope that by sharing in this meal
we can make up for past offences.

237
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:38,843
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

238
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,758
What method did your people use

239
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:47,233
to initiate fission reaction
in your prototype devices?

240
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,200
There's two different approaches.

241
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,354
Implosion and a gun-type bomb.

242
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,991
- Both create a supercritical mass.
- Obviously.

243
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:57,360
Either way you go
you need an amount of refined 235,

244
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:01,357
roughly equivalent to the size of my fist.

245
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:03,514
Or his fist, actually.

246
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:07,073
Well, our dreams may soon be a reality.

247
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,716
With your help, before the next culling,

248
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:14,602
we plan to vaporise the Wraith
as they sleep.

249
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:21,592
What exactly is your plan?

250
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,994
We intend to take advantage
of their overconfidence.

251
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:28,553
- That is their weakness.
- Overconfidence.

252
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:31,760
They hibernate between cullings
aboard their great ships.

253
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:33,720
Sometimes for centuries at a time.

254
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,955
Wraith watch over the sleepers,
but they're small in number.

255
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,875
Small enough to be overpowered.

256
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:42,240
- We will sneak aboard with weapons.
- It may not be possible.

257
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:46,476
Teyla, we should listen to their whole plan
before poking holes in it.

258
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:49,441
If we are to work together,
they need to trust us

259
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:51,833
and we need to trust them.

260
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,756
Please explain.

261
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:58,154
I and several of my people
were captured by the Wraith.

262
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:02,001
It was a rescue mission to save us.

263
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:05,121
I am only alive today thanks to them.

264
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:10,159
- As a result of that rescue...
- You awakened the others.

265
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:13,360
They found out there were more people
where we came from.

266
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,277
- Father, they will all awaken.
- We took one of them prisoner.

267
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,880
- The next culling should be decades off.
- They said they'd take their time.

268
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:26,434
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

269
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,554
Do we have that much time?

270
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:35,116
Do we?

271
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,319
No.

272
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,280
- Cowen.
- They may detect the radiation.

273
00:21:57,443 --> 00:22:00,833
We must shut down the reactors,
survive the culling, plan for the next.

274
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,995
You're forgetting something.
We're on the same side.

275
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:09,396
Ha! Once we have extracted
all the information we can from you,

276
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,758
you will be left on the surface.

277
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:14,517
You'll be the first the Wraith feed upon.

278
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,755
- I've won against Wraith ships.
- I've seen your weapons.

279
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:20,801
I'm talking about a ship.
One that flies through space.

280
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,523
With weapons
beyond anything you've ever seen.

281
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,833
You wanna turn down that kind of help?

282
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:30,394
- I think you're trying to save yourself.
- You're damn right I am.

283
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:34,442
I say we work together,
then maybe help save each other.

284
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,561
We both want the same thing.

285
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:44,521
We were confident
the Wraith would not appear for years.

286
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,480
They will detect us like you did.

287
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:48,838
- If we work together...
- You've done enough!

288
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:52,040
We haven't started.
I can get your programme back on track.

289
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:56,196
- How?
- I built an atomic bomb in sixth grade.

290
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,082
- You could do that in Canada?
- Not a working model.

291
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:03,521
I was questioned by the CIA who thought
I was part of a secret organisation...

292
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,954
Major Sheppard has convinced me
that we may yet prevail.

293
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,636
He has?

294
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,321
If we work together.

295
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:29,594
Many generations ago, during a culling,
the Genii shot down a Wraith dart.

296
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:32,277
Although many lives were lost that day,

297
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:36,231
the ability to resist,
even in some small way,

298
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:39,873
gave the Genii the seeds of hope.

299
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,914
This data storage device
was recovered from that Wraith dart.

300
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:49,122
- Like flash memory in a jump drive.
- It has information about the hive ship.

301
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:52,753
Tyrus and his daughter
successfully accessed that information.

302
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,879
- How?
- Through this interface.

303
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:58,362
Really?

304
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:03,313
We believe this is
where a Wraith ship still sleeps.

305
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,522
The Wraith tend to self-destruct.
It's rare to get something like this.

306
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,516
- Can you access other data?
- With this interface device,

307
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,993
we believe we can access
the Wraith ship's data core.

308
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,314
This is what your plan is based on?

309
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:19,599
How does access to their computer help?

310
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:23,438
With this interface device we can learn
all the Wraith ships' locations.

311
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:26,037
So you know
where to deliver your new bombs.

312
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:29,593
- Makes sense.
- Assuming this ship is still there.

313
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:33,472
If the Wraith are in no hurry
to rally their forces, it will be.

314
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:36,715
This ship is nowhere near the Stargate.

315
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,636
Approaching it undetected by foot
is impossible.

316
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:43,398
That is where your ship comes in,
Major Sheppard.

317
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:51,121
Always wondered where my ship
would come in.

318
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:55,196
- No. How's that for an answer?
- It's pithy. I'll give you that.

319
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:59,038
- I'm sure you already agreed to this.
- We'll get something out of it.

320
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:03,116
- We do need allies.
- But they were ready to string you up.

321
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:07,117
- How can you trust them?
- Hey, I don't trust 'em.

322
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:11,799
They insisted McKay and Teyla stay there,
not just to help with the bomb.

323
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:14,193
We have something they need
and vice versa.

324
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:17,161
- I thought that's what negotiating's about.
- It is.

325
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:19,791
But I stop short
of offering nuclear weapons.

326
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:23,922
- They were building them anyway.
- Why didn't you just say so?

327
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:28,682
You realise
I originally sent you out for food?

328
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:32,521
- I think we can still get that.
- I don't see why not.

329
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:36,312
We kind of moved past it
with the atomic bomb thing.

330
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,312
Bottom line. Can you pull this off?

331
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:42,474
We'll have to watch our backs.

332
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:46,636
But I wouldn't put my team at risk
if I didn't think so.

333
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,440
OK, go.

334
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:55,640
And then maybe we'll talk
about making nuclear bombs.

335
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,603
The encasement directs
the explosive forces inward

336
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,880
and the implosion
creates extreme compression.

337
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:09,115
The subcritical mass
becomes supercritical.

338
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:11,080
- Ingenious.
- I know.

339
00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:13,803
Can you believe
I didn't win the science fair?

340
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:17,433
The adaptation of equipment
and resources will be the challenge.

341
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,718
You're destined to become a hero
among our people, Dr McKay.

342
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,874
Right.

343
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:29,036
As long as Major Sheppard
returns with the C4.

344
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,323
I'm a dead man.

345
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:38,043
We have surprised each other.

346
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:41,400
- The Genii are not the people I thought.
- And look at you.

347
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,123
I'd never have thought
you'd leave your people.

348
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:46,478
No, I do this for them.

349
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:50,431
John Sheppard and his people have
brought new hope to our stars, Sora.

350
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:53,595
They have the spirit of explorers
and hearts of warriors.

351
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:56,755
They have accepted me. But look at you.

352
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:59,642
How many harvest ceremonies
did I make you endure?

353
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,873
Never again, I promise you.

354
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:14,758
You respected us for who we were.
That gave us reason to trust you.

355
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:18,598
I'm saddened you could not trust me
enough to share in your secret.

356
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:23,883
- That is our way.
- Our deception is a matter of survival.

357
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:27,399
It is a secret we are born into
and take to our graves.

358
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,441
- Still...
- Have we not traded fairly with you?

359
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:34,760
We have not dealt with others
so graciously.

360
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:38,516
Perhaps this new alliance
will open your eyes.

361
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:42,642
That we can only stand against the Wraith
if we do so together.

362
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,993
We'll have to see if your friends
live up to their promises.

363
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:08,672
Well? Do you see?

364
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:15,518
Let's get in and out as fast as possible.

365
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,880
- I've studied these plans all my life.
- Good.

366
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:22,718
We'll follow your lead. We'll cover you
during the breach and download.

367
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:25,522
- Exit plan?
- As we came in. Stay with the jumper.

368
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,435
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going with you.

369
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,673
We could end up in a fire-fight.

370
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:34,314
Sora is a skilled fighter
and expert marksman, Lieutenant Ford.

371
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:39,716
Still, she must stay here
to carry on if we don't come back.

372
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,555
We need you to deliver the C4
you promised us before we proceed.

373
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,078
We need to get the proper intel first.

374
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,679
No use in building a bunch of nukes
if we can't put them to use.

375
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:10,153
- Those are your terms?
- I'm sure you understand.

376
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:14,714
I do. It seems we have no choice
but to trust each other.

377
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,876
How many of these ships do you have?

378
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:40,514
Just the one.

379
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:51,594
There.

380
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,641
- Have they awoken?
- I don't see any activity.

381
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,357
Same as last time.

382
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,640
All right, here we go.
Right through the front door.

383
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,756
- Hey, hold the fort.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,914
Good luck.

385
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:09,879
Oh, God.

386
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:21,959
These people were cocooned for a later
feeding. Some of them may still be alive.

387
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,359
- We don't have time for this.
- They could be your people.

388
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:36,157
Teyla, take care of this. We'll meet you
back at the ship. McKay, you're with me.

389
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:45,632
I'll stay with her. Go.
We'll meet you back at the ship.

390
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:32,202
This is it.

391
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:36,402
But the ship's plans I memorised
did not show how to operate this door.

392
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:41,482
Blowing this door
will make too much noise.

393
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:45,079
So find another way. OK.

394
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,356
Can I get some light here?

395
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,598
Beautiful.

396
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:32,117
Please!

397
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:34,922
- Help me!
- We're gonna get you out.

398
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,835
- Help me!
- What are you doing?

399
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:38,994
- We can save none of them.
- What?

400
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:40,881
Please help!

401
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:44,160
- You'd let him die?
- The Wraith must not know we were here.

402
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,757
I said no!

403
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:48,436
I beg you!

404
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:59,875
- McKay, we don't have...
- I don't even know if this is gonna...

405
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,314
..work.

406
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,277
Bingo.

407
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,673
All right.

408
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:19,198
I'll cover your six. Go.

409
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:30,278
- If you free him, they will know.
- You are not the man I thought.

410
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,435
The Genii will be the first to die
if they awaken.

411
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,753
- Help me!
- I said leave him.

412
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,483
- No!
- Be silent!

413
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:56,031
<i>Major, we've been discovered</i>.

414
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:57,841
We gotta get outta here.

415
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,394
We've got it.

416
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,673
Wraith guards. Hurry, more are coming.

417
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:38,115
- Where's Tyrus?
- He was struck by a Wraith weapon.

418
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:41,434
- He may have been stunned.
- The Wraith will be upon him.

419
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:49,557
- Go. Go!
- All right. Hang on.

420
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,832
Where is my father?

421
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:41,034
He did not survive.

422
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:44,832
How? What happened?

423
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,471
I think we should find out.

424
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:50,514
Take aim!

425
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:07,593
Cowen, I thought we were learning
how to get along.

426
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,721
- She killed Tyrus.
- No.

427
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:14,432
By leaving him to die
you may as well have killed him yourself.

428
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:18,835
- He shot the man we tried to save.
- It was a mistake to save anyone.

429
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,119
It jeopardised the mission.

430
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:27,552
We will keep this intelligence information.

431
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,634
You're the one making a mistake.

432
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:33,637
And your ship. And whatever quantities
of C4 you possess.

433
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,112
That is all you ever intended. To use us.

434
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:40,322
And for your efforts I will spare your lives.

435
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:42,474
Generous of you.

436
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,077
I guess the tava beans are off the table.

437
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:49,521
- Your weapons.
- No. I don't think so.

438
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,353
We have the advantage, Major.

439
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,954
Yeah.

440
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,159
This is what your father died for?

441
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:06,474
In the name of people who would lie
and steal from those they call friends?

442
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:13,281
I lied too.
Jumpers Two and Three, execute.

443
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:26,517
You didn't really think
we had one ship, did you?

444
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:30,198
Tell your people to get back
and nobody gets hurt.

445
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,353
Jumper Two, prepare to fire on my mark.

446
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,878
Wait!

447
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:42,757
Do you promise to leave?

448
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:46,038
Well, that's the plan.

449
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:50,873
I guess we'll have to go somewhere else
to find our tava beans.

450
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:55,992
But I think it's only fair
we end up with something.

451
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,318
You do not want
to make an enemy of the Genii.

452
00:39:02,483 --> 00:39:07,079
You know what? Same here.

453
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:35,313
Major, I thought you might like to see this.

454
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:40,719
A lot of the information from the device
was encrypted, so we're still working on it.

455
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:42,202
It's not easy.

456
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:46,959
We've discovered 21 Wraith hive ships
in our quadrant of the Pegasus galaxy.

457
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:50,354
- 21?
- There are indications of more elsewhere.

458
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:53,674
- How many more?
- There's no way of knowing for sure.

459
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:56,596
Perhaps 60... or more.

460
00:39:57,923 --> 00:40:00,756
- A lot of ships.
- Some appear to be on the move.

461
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:03,801
- Toward us?
- We're still working on that.

462
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:06,716
Even if we helped the Genii
build nuclear warheads...

463
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:10,193
We only could have nuked
a handful of them simultaneously.

464
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:13,355
There's too many Wraith ships
for a coordinated attack.

465
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,993
The Genii plan never would have worked,
with or without our help.

466
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:20,155
- I'll see what else I can find.
- Thank you, Peter.

467
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:29,551
Sergeant Bates brokered a small trade
agreement for food while you were gone.

468
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:33,841
- Oh, he did, did he?
- Yes, he did, but it's not a competition.

469
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:38,633
- So who are these people?
- Traders. They call themselves Manarians.

470
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:45,874
I'm sorry you weren't able to find
the allies you were looking for, John.

471
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,238
We gathered some valuable intel.

472
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:51,839
Huh. Are you trying to convince me
this is good news?

473
00:40:52,003 --> 00:40:54,995
I much prefer to know
what we're up against than not.

474
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:58,121
60 ships... or more.

475
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:04,231
I just hope they don't all come at once.

476
