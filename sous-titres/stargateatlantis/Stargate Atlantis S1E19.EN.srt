1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,479
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:09,873
The last line of defence before Atlantis.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:14,036
- Knocked out in the Ancients' last stand?
- Its power source is depleted.

4
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:18,116
There's an unidentified craft the size
of a Wraith dart heading for the city.

5
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:19,602
It's scanning us.

6
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:22,072
- What are those?
- Wraith hive ships.

7
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,440
If they maintain speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.

8
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:30,752
The Wraith were conducting experiments
on your ancestors.

9
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,960
- You have some Wraith DNA.
- She can see what's happening.

10
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:37,081
I am on a ship.
I am in some sort of control room.

11
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:41,236
- You are all so pathetic.
- That's not Teyla talking.

12
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:44,520
Chances are Teyla gave away
our location to the Wraith.

13
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:48,119
Atlantis is the only way
to get to a new, rich feeding ground.

14
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,841
Earth.

15
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:06,160
Teyla has ascertained that the Wraith
are more interested in Earth than Atlantis,

16
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:09,121
which is, you know, terrifying.

17
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:13,879
She realised the hive ships will go
right past the only surviving satellite.

18
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:17,479
The last of what we assume
were dozens of defence satellites,

19
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:20,362
destroyed during the Ancients' last stand.

20
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:23,242
Yes. We think we can use it
to our advantage.

21
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:27,191
- She said it was dead.
- It is, but we think we can bring it back.

22
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:29,957
If we are right about what is wrong with it.

23
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,762
Yes, if we're right
about what's wrong with it.

24
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:37,474
But if we're right and it's just out of power,
the Wraith have been ignoring it.

25
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:42,797
Estimates indicate a single naqahdah
generator could bring it back online.

26
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:45,875
Why can't generators
get our weapon systems working?

27
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:49,831
Because they were designed
to be powered by the zero-point module.

28
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,837
- The satellite isn't.
- It could take out a Wraith hive ship?

29
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,915
It should be able
to take out all three when charged.

30
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,438
Ancient technology was far superior.

31
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,753
They lost the war
because they were outnumbered.

32
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,960
- We're outnumbered.
- And outgunned.

33
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:08,274
But they don't see the satellite.
Our strength.

34
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:14,757
In military parlance,
surprise is an element on our side.

35
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:20,075
- What do you need?
- The satellite's 15 hours away by jumper.

36
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:24,680
We should put together a small crew,
say myself, Grodin and a pilot.

37
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,834
- I'll go.
- Miller can handle it.

38
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:31,679
I need you to keep searching for
alternate Alpha sites just in case this fails.

39
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,961
The hive ships will be
in range of the satellite in 49 hours.

40
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,353
We'll need every last second
of that time.

41
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,195
Questions?

42
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,199
OK, let's get on it.

43
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:49,675
Well, Rodney, I don't mean
to put any undue pressure,

44
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:55,839
but right now that satellite is the only thing
standing between the Wraith and Atlantis.

45
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,517
No undue pressure.

46
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:09,832
- I am fine.
- I wanted something more enthusiastic.

47
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,712
- I'm ready to be put back on active duty.
- I'm sure you think so...

48
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:18,161
- Tell him I'm fine.
- She is. No reason to keep her here.

49
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,641
All right. You're back on active duty.

50
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:37,238
I think I can handle this alone, Radik.
Can't you do anything else?

51
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,758
- I think I should go.
- Yes, I agree. Go.

52
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,517
- I mean on the mission.
- Why?

53
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,755
- You know more about the satellite...
- You've noticed?

54
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:49,120
- ..but a lot more about the city than me.
- I see.

55
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:53,401
For whatever reason there is
problem there, it should be me, not you.

56
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,361
- There won't be a problem.
- You don't know that.

57
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:59,879
If it seems like we can't fix it,
we'll just come back.

58
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:03,672
- I realise I am invaluable everywhere...
- I take it back.

59
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:06,994
You can't. You've just admitted
I'm smarter than you are.

60
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:11,554
- I admitted no such thing.
- The truth shone through and you spoke.

61
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:17,036
- You are a miserable little man.
- Let's not ruin the moment here.

62
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:25,921
Now... keep an eye on my city for me
when I'm gone, hm?

63
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,592
- Good luck.
- Right.

64
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,674
Right.

65
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:38,038
MA5-393?

66
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:42,435
No. We've only been there at night.
It gets ridiculously hot during the day.

67
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,594
Not really an option.

68
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:48,438
The damn Alpha site we picked
had to be marked by the Wraith.

69
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:51,959
- They're a real pain in the ass.
- Yes, they are.

70
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:56,002
- How about M4H-212?
- Crawling with Genii spies.

71
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:59,553
You know that for a fact
or is your Spidey Sense just tingling?

72
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,714
It's a fact, sir.

73
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,955
Here we go. M1M-316.

74
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,193
Stackhouse reported lush surroundings,

75
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:11,117
and as far as his team could tell,
it seemed uninhabited.

76
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:15,322
- I'll get my team and check it out.
- Good. Remember, we don't need ideal.

77
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,156
- We'd all settle for close.
- I'm on it.

78
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:29,358
- Major, is Teyla coming with you?
- You're not seriously asking me that?

79
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,435
- That's a bad call, sir.
- Here we go again.

80
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,242
We don't fully understand
her Wraith connection.

81
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:38,873
I don't think we should expose her
to secret information,

82
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,238
especially the location of our evac site.

83
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:45,078
- She has a clean bill of health.
- Good. But if she can't control...

84
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,313
- You don't know that.
- That's right.

85
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:51,954
She saw everything they saw. They could
do the same with her, see what we see.

86
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,683
- If she's been compromised...
- She's in my team.

87
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:58,756
Period. End of story. We're done.

88
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,403
This is a simulation
I've put together.

89
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:10,795
It shows how the city will be destroyed
once we trigger the self-destruct.

90
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,672
I'm so glad you felt I needed to see this.

91
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:32,119
My nightmares are gonna be more vivid.

92
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,155
- It's not going to be enough.
- What?

93
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,998
The self-destruct plan.
It's nowhere near effective enough.

94
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,113
That seemed pretty effective to me.

95
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:49,037
Atlantis is more than a city.
It is an intergalactic spacecraft.

96
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,559
Teyla said the Wraith are not interested
in destroying Atlantis.

97
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:57,035
They're coming here to get to Earth.
They have to go through the Stargate...

98
00:07:57,203 --> 00:08:00,275
Which means stealing the city,
so we self-destruct.

99
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:04,152
Yes, but if they are even
the least bit resourceful,

100
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,598
which I must assume that they are,

101
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:12,042
they can reverse-engineer their own
intergalactic engine from the wreckage.

102
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,592
We need to break into smaller pieces?

103
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,118
Yes, well, that would certainly help.

104
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,353
I'm concerned
about the Ancient database.

105
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:23,801
Its ability to back up data
is incredibly redundant.

106
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:27,000
- Incredibly redundant?
- That will never get solved.

107
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:31,236
If the Wraith recover even a small spot
of the Ancient database...

108
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,673
That is my concern, exactly.

109
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,962
How hard would it be
to destroy all the database terminals?

110
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,318
Impossibly hard.

111
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:48,238
We need to figure out a way
to delete the Ancient database.

112
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,634
- Can you do that?
- We can find out.

113
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,840
OK, find out,
but before you wipe anything out...

114
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:57,961
- <i>Dr Weir</i>.
- Yes?

115
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,638
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation</i>.
<i>Major Sheppard is coming in hot</i>.

116
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:09,953
- What's going on?
- They ran into resistance. I think Wraith.

117
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:13,001
- You said this planet was uninhabited.
- It was.

118
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,391
I told you she was a liability, sir.

119
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,680
I won't let your feelings
endanger this facility any longer.

120
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,162
What?

121
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:29,713
The Wraith must be getting information
from you.

122
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:33,034
What? We ran into a... What was that?

123
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,320
- It looked like a T-Rex.
- Yeah, it wasn't even a Wraith.

124
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,519
So check those accusations.

125
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,151
You don't recommend the planet
as an Alpha site?

126
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:47,193
Not my first choice. If McKay doesn't
get the satellite online, we're screwed.

127
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,995
Dr Weir, this is Miller.
We're approaching the satellite.

128
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:59,396
You're on the other side
of the solar system. Be careful out there.

129
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,554
Understood.

130
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:09,717
OK, close the bulkhead doors.

131
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:11,874
- Good luck.
- Right.

132
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,034
Good luck.

133
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:31,796
- Sergeant Bates.
- What is it?

134
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,193
You accused me
of disclosing our position.

135
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:35,682
Yes, I did.

136
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,755
- Clearly you were wrong.
- That's yet to be determined.

137
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:40,720
- Excuse me?
- Look.

138
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:44,114
You may not be in control
of what information you give away,

139
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:48,754
but you should not be allowed to move
freely around this base of operations.

140
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:54,873
Being accused of serving the Wraith
is the greatest insult among my people.

141
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:58,274
- I am aware.
- What the hell's going on here?

142
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:01,792
- I was stating an opinion.
- She attacked me.

143
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,760
- For good reason.
- What reason?

144
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,232
- My guess would be the Wraith.
- Walk away.

145
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:09,042
- Sir!
- Walk away.

146
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:13,599
- This isn't over.
- I would be disappointed if it were.

147
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:17,995
What the hell are you doing?
You don't deck the head of security.

148
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:20,233
- He said...
- I don't care what he said.

149
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,439
He says a lot of things.

150
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,322
You just stay away from him.

151
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,359
- <i>Are you OK?</i>
- Yes. Why?

152
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:11,514
You're breathing pretty heavily.

153
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:14,072
<i>I'm feeling a little claustrophobic</i>.

154
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,916
- How much air do these things hold?
- Eight hours.

155
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:22,076
That's enough, right?
I mean, even with heavy breathing?

156
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:25,633
- <i>They calculate that in, right?</i>
- You're going to be fine.

157
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:29,113
You don't have an eight-hour ceiling
on your breathing.

158
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,681
- It's completely dead.
- We thought as much.

159
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:18,997
I'm gonna hook up the naqahdah
generator, get some life support going.

160
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,482
- Halling, hello.
- May we speak?

161
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:48,203
Please, have a seat.

162
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,952
- How is the evacuation on the mainland?
- We'll be ready.

163
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:56,717
Good.

164
00:13:56,883 --> 00:14:01,559
Dr Weir, what is there as a plan in place

165
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,032
to destroy Atlantis?

166
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:11,871
The Wraith will be able to make it to Earth
if the city is left intact.

167
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:16,559
But I assure you that plan will only
be executed in a worst-case scenario.

168
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:21,080
Such as three hive ships
flying towards Atlantis?

169
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,076
We believe we can destroy them
before they arrive.

170
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:28,600
I understand you fearing
for the well-being of your people.

171
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:32,551
But it is not reason to destroy
the city of the Ancestors.

172
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:38,355
Atlantis is a sacred place. To consider
destroying it merely for self-preservation...

173
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:41,879
- Merely for self-preservation?
- This place is all that remains

174
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,682
of the greatest race
ever to inhabit the stars.

175
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,721
You would prefer it fell
into the hands of the Wraith?

176
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:51,398
I would have faith that the Ancestors
would not allow it to happen.

177
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:55,442
They have been able
to preserve Atlantis for 10,000 years.

178
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,073
- Is it not possible...
- No, I don't think it is possible.

179
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:03,236
Not if you're suggesting the Ancients
will return in time to save their city.

180
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,201
You cannot know their plans for Atlantis.

181
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,402
They have made all the plans
they are going to make.

182
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:12,554
Now it's up to us.

183
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,837
I thank you for your thoughts, Halling,

184
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:20,315
but I have to do everything I can to make
sure the power and technology of Atlantis

185
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:23,202
does not fall into the hands of the Wraith.

186
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,560
And yes, to ensure
they never make it to my galaxy.

187
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,440
Even if it means
sacrificing the future of this one?

188
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:46,998
The idea is simple enough. The execution
is proving to be very difficult.

189
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:50,519
- You're creating a virus?
- Yes. A plain old computer virus.

190
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,993
Once introduced into the system,
wipe the database clean.

191
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,473
It could be downloaded
as part of the self-destruct countdown.

192
00:15:57,643 --> 00:16:01,636
Might even affect the Wraith's systems
if they try to access it.

193
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,754
How much of it could we save?

194
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,278
- I'm sorry?
- Of the database.

195
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:11,640
We brought a lot of hard drives.
How much can we transfer?

196
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:16,354
- You mean back it up? Take a copy?
- Yes, exactly.

197
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:23,113
Using McKay's compression codex,
I'd say maybe seven or eight per cent.

198
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:26,478
- That's it?
- Yes.

199
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,118
Here we go.

200
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,317
Primary power online.

201
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:59,041
Looks like life support's
now at 100 per cent.

202
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,516
I think I found the switch
to initialise the gravity.

203
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,277
Great. Just give me a second to... Whoa!

204
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,719
Oh, yeah.

205
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:13,398
Yeah, that's permanent back damage.

206
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:16,441
Sorry, I assumed
it would come on more slowly.

207
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,197
Well, you assumed with my life.

208
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:23,072
- You'll be fine. It was just a little bump.
- What you got?

209
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:28,760
Looks like every system is back online.

210
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,562
- Except for the weapon.
- Oh, details.

211
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,078
Here... let's get to work.

212
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,594
Oh, thank you.

213
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,797
Thank you.

214
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:48,161
Yeah. That's vertebra damage.

215
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,520
That's a life of pain.

216
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:54,554
What about M1K-439?

217
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:58,238
- Which one's that?
- The one with all the waterfalls.

218
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:03,158
Waterfalls. Why don't we just
call it Planet Waterfall?

219
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,962
What? I say we should
just give them names.

220
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,433
We got a list of five planets here.

221
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,720
That should be enough
potential Alpha sites.

222
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:17,876
<i>Major Sheppard, we have</i>
<i>a situation at Generator Station One</i>.

223
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,042
- What's the problem?
- It's Bates, sir. He's been attacked.

224
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,717
Get a medical team down here.

225
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:44,158
- Is he gonna be OK?
- It's still hard to tell.

226
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,077
He's got five broken ribs, a fractured
collarbone and severe concussion.

227
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:50,234
- When can we talk to him?
- We can't.

228
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:54,282
I put him in a coma until the subdural
haematoma can be dealt with.

229
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,877
We won't find out
what happened from him yet.

230
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,603
Teyla and Bates got into it
pretty bad yesterday.

231
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,357
Fist-fighting and this
are a long drive apart.

232
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:06,755
I understand, but they were in a fight
and both looking to continue it.

233
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:12,316
- Anything pointing to who did this?
- I'm having a forensic exam performed.

234
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:16,476
Let us know what you find out.
Let's go get her side of the story.

235
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:32,003
It's not a power generation problem. The
naqahdah's pumping out enough juice.

236
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,358
Then why isn't it...?

237
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,560
OK. All right.

238
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:41,318
Let's just step back here, think about it.

239
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:44,680
This baby is
a directed energy-beam weapon.

240
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:47,880
Runs off a relatively low-yield charge
like our generator.

241
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:52,082
It's got to be continually building up
a charge with a buffer or a capacitor

242
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,722
until it's discharged.

243
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,602
I think I've found something. I like that.

244
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:03,838
Yes, here it is.
Right now the buffer's at 90 per cent.

245
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:08,076
OK. So power's getting to the buffer
but not to the actual weapon.

246
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:12,441
Let me try and find a diagnostics program.
There must be one here.

247
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:16,721
We got 29 hours till show time,
so let's hope we don't have to order parts.

248
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:22,152
You do not think
I had anything to do with it?

249
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:24,883
- Of course not.
- You and Bates did get into it.

250
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:27,603
You know me.
I never would have taken it that far.

251
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,516
I know. Let's see
if we can't rule it out altogether.

252
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:39,040
- Where were you last night?
- I was here, in my room.

253
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,000
- The whole night?
- Yes.

254
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,358
We don't know if you blacked out.

255
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:45,514
I have no way of proving it, no.

256
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,436
But I did not leave this room last night,
I am sure.

257
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,955
I did not leave this room.

258
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,840
You asked to see me?

259
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:02,712
We have found a suitable Alpha site
so we'll be able to evacuate.

260
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:06,319
- That's good.
- That's not why I wanted to see you.

261
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:09,714
You have to get me more than
eight per cent of the database.

262
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:12,681
- There has got to be a way.
- Maybe nine per cent.

263
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:15,835
How do I choose
between zero-point module research

264
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,153
and their work on ascension?

265
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:21,872
Between weapon schematics
and their notes on space travel?

266
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:25,194
Invaluable information's gonna be lost

267
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:28,241
and that is just
information we've deciphered.

268
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:31,679
We know we have barely even begun
to scratch the surface.

269
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:34,562
What if we destroy the cure
for all disease?

270
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:38,318
Or even information that could lead
to the downfall of the Wraith?

271
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:43,034
I will try to improve
on McKay's compression ratios, but...

272
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:47,242
We are at war, Elizabeth.
In war there are casualties.

273
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,198
Ah. Schematics, anyone?

274
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:03,318
It looks like power runs internally
from the buffer to the weapon.

275
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,838
The hit disrupted the main power conduit.

276
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:10,633
We need to re-route the power from
our buffer to the weapon so it will arm.

277
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:15,797
Your masterful grip on the blatantly
obvious continues to impress me.

278
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:18,272
- Thank you.
- All right.

279
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:23,715
We need to route power
around these damaged circuits.

280
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,317
If we do that, we should be laughing.

281
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:29,236
Right... I'm disorientated.
Where are these?

282
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:34,959
- They're outside.
- What?

283
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:38,434
Look.

284
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:43,355
- See?
- Oh, great.

285
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:46,879
- Someone will need to EVA.
- There's nothing to hang on to.

286
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:51,434
- I'm not saying it'll be easy or safe.
- OK. So who goes?

287
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,513
- We could draw straws.
- OK, Miller, break out the straws.

288
00:22:56,683 --> 00:22:58,958
It doesn't have to be straws.

289
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:01,398
We could do rock, paper, scissors.

290
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,360
OK. On three.

291
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:05,878
One, two, three.

292
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,676
OK, rock, paper, scissors
doesn't work with three.

293
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:16,756
- Anyone have a pencil?
- Yeah, I think I got one. Here.

294
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:19,198
Well, get on with it.

295
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:23,834
OK.

296
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:27,277
- Shorter piece goes.
- You go first.

297
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,954
Hm. Well done. Good for you.

298
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:41,838
Miller?

299
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:46,438
- Yeah.
- You're the best qualified to fix it, sir.

300
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,356
Plight of the dead man. Good.

301
00:23:54,323 --> 00:24:00,319
There's no love lost between her and
Bates, but I can't see her beating him up.

302
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:04,002
- Ford?
- Ma'am?

303
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:06,961
What do you think?

304
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:11,242
I worry about
what she might have done unknowingly.

305
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:14,395
The Wraith connection
and her nightmares make me nervous.

306
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:18,556
What are we gonna do, stick her
in the brig? We're talking about Teyla.

307
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,841
- We have a situation on our hands.
- What's going on?

308
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,881
The tests found DNA
in Sergeant Bates's uniform.

309
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,954
- It's not Teyla's?
- No, Major.

310
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:30,479
- Who is it?
- I ran the test twice to be certain.

311
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:34,522
It's conclusive.
We have a Wraith in the city.

312
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:50,193
How is this possible?
How can a Wraith get inside the city?

313
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,082
- They didn't gate in.
- The dart.

314
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,996
- What?
- The Wraith dart. It scanned us.

315
00:24:57,043 --> 00:25:00,080
It made its way through the city,
scanning as it went.

316
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:03,440
The second it was done,
it self-destructed.

317
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,157
- They beamed into the city.
- Can they do that?

318
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:12,475
The technology used to sweep people up
into their ships works the opposite way.

319
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:17,353
The Wraith dart pilot scanned us,
transmitted information to the hive ships,

320
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:19,514
beamed down and destroyed his ship.

321
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:23,961
- It seems possible.
- That's when I started to sense the Wraith.

322
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:28,992
- No wonder you were having nightmares.
- What's he been doing here all this time?

323
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:32,951
Bates was attacked near the naqahdah
generator that powers this tower.

324
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:37,560
Maybe the Wraith's job is to knock out
the power before the hive ship gets here.

325
00:25:37,723 --> 00:25:42,114
- Leave us dead in the water.
- Or ensure our self-destruct plan failed.

326
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:44,797
- Maybe a combination of both.
- Exactly.

327
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:48,558
We do know for sure that
we have a Wraith intruder in the city

328
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,157
that we have to track down.

329
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,120
I have an idea.

330
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,559
<i>How far away?</i>

331
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:07,352
It's not much more than 30 metres away.

332
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:10,640
<i>We're in position, sir</i>.

333
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:15,877
Vent the atmosphere and disengage the
artificial gravity in the rear compartment.

334
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:28,357
OK. Open the rear hatch.

335
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:49,314
Oh, my.

336
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:54,194
Rodney?

337
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:59,236
- Rodney, did you make it?
- I haven't left the rear of the jumper yet.

338
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:02,952
- Do I need to remind you of the time?
- Yes. Please do. Remind me.

339
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,081
- Are we on a tight schedule?
- Just stating the obvious.

340
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,234
<i>OK. Thank you</i>.

341
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:10,997
One small step, huh?

342
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:28,602
One giant leap.

343
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,197
Sorry?

344
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,513
- <i>I made it</i>.
- Good.

345
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:38,080
Let's take a look at this first panel.

346
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:44,479
This is a biometric sensor
we've had online for a month or so.

347
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:47,919
It detects irregularities in biometric rhythm
and reports them.

348
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,917
- Wouldn't it have picked up on the Wraith?
- It requires a lot of power.

349
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,792
We've narrowed its field of focus
to scan solely in the gate room,

350
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:59,638
figuring that was the only place
that the Wraith,

351
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,192
or any other alien,
would enter the city from.

352
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:04,877
- OK. So that was wrong.
- Yup.

353
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:09,639
Now, if I could only
expand the scanning field to... My God.

354
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:12,317
- What?
- That's him. Look.

355
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,039
It works like the life-signs detector,

356
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:19,763
but it's able to distinguish
different life forms.

357
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:21,402
- That's him.
- That's him.

358
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:23,633
- We can track him in real time?
- Yes.

359
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:27,239
Ford, Teyla, we need two teams.
Let's go get him.

360
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:28,802
Yes, sir.

361
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:37,233
This is bad. Very bad.
I'm not sure I can fix this.

362
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:40,281
- You can fix anything.
- <i>Who told you that?</i>

363
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:45,437
- You did on several occasions.
- Good thing I drew the short straw.

364
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,594
<i>That's more like it</i>.

365
00:28:57,923 --> 00:29:01,040
The main power conduit's been severed.

366
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:05,560
I may be able to re-route it
through secondary conduits.

367
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,521
<i>Like a quadruple bypass</i>.

368
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:12,437
I should be able to help identify
potential secondary conduits.

369
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:17,119
We're only gonna have time
to try this once. Let's get started.

370
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:22,400
- Is he still in place?
- Yes, he's still in the same room.

371
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,952
Hasn't moved since we located him.

372
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:29,677
Let's hope he's still sleeping.
Ford, Teyla, you in position?

373
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:31,834
<i>Almost</i>.

374
00:29:34,563 --> 00:29:36,554
My team's ready.

375
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:41,152
We're gonna breach through
from different directions.

376
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,837
If he tries to get out the other door,
take him.

377
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:46,597
<i>Understood</i>.
<i>We'll be a couple of minutes</i>.

378
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:49,197
All right. Stand by.

379
00:30:14,043 --> 00:30:16,557
OK. That's all I can do from here.

380
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:18,953
<i>Is power getting through?</i>

381
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:22,195
- Yes, the power's getting through.
- Oh, thank God.

382
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:27,312
OK. We're coming in. We're gonna
pick you up and get the hell outta here.

383
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:30,759
- <i>Sounds like a plan</i>.
- Right.

384
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,756
Nothing will keep us
from our new feeding ground.

385
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:02,562
You're on vox, sir. We heard
the whole thing and double-timed it.

386
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:07,600
We got him, Major.
You're going to be OK.

387
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,401
Peter, we're having trouble
docking with the satellite.

388
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,555
See what you can do from your side.

389
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,918
- Oh, dear.
- <i>Oh, dear, what?</i>

390
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,881
When we re-routed power
from the buffer to the weapon,

391
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:35,481
we inadvertently routed power away
from the docking station in the airlock.

392
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,634
That's going to be a problem.

393
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:40,476
We'll do it manually
like we did the first time.

394
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:44,192
You had a spacesuit then. I don't.
The airlock isn't pressurised.

395
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:49,592
Then we'll...
I'll go back and re-route the power.

396
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:53,477
There isn't time.
The Wraith ships are too close.

397
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:55,838
- I know what I'm doing now.
- <i>Rodney</i>.

398
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:59,991
- Leave me.
- We're not doing that.

399
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:04,714
Get to a safe distance, then get me once
the satellite's dealt with the Wraith ships.

400
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,920
- Peter...
- <i>It's the only option and you know it</i>.

401
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:12,395
Besides, this way I can power down
the satellite until they're within range.

402
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:16,158
There's no way the Wraith will realise
we brought it back online.

403
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:21,556
We'll cloak and come back for you
after it's done.

404
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:25,714
After it's done, then.

405
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:52,001
Good to see you on your feet, sir.

406
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:54,552
- How you feeling?
- Pins and needles.

407
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,078
Hate getting stunned
by those damn things.

408
00:32:57,243 --> 00:33:00,315
- Has he said anything yet?
- No, sir. Not yet.

409
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:08,237
Have you got a name?

410
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:12,800
OK, we'll go with Bob.

411
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:17,081
Bob, I'm gonna need to know what you've
been doing here the past two weeks

412
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,438
and I'm gonna need to know now.

413
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:43,914
If you're not already powered up,
now would be a good time.

414
00:33:47,523 --> 00:33:49,673
Powering up.

415
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,673
We should be weapons-hot
in 60 seconds.

416
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:05,201
Dr Weir, it's McKay.
The satellite is armed and ready.

417
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:09,322
It should fire within the next minute or so.
Keep your fingers crossed.

418
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:11,792
Fingers crossed.

419
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,954
Good luck.

420
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,279
I don't think he's in a talkative mood.

421
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:29,913
I need to know if he's been transmitting
back to the hive ships.

422
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:35,237
- Wouldn't we pick up the transmission?
- He could send secure messages.

423
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,678
Maybe I can try and connect with him.

424
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,835
I don't think so.

425
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:46,833
If the Alpha site has been compromised,
we need to know.

426
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,200
OK, see what you can do.

427
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,360
Switching over from manual
to automatic firing mode.

428
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:26,960
Stand by.

429
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:30,397
Standing by.

430
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,081
Yes. We have a kill.

431
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:56,074
- We copy that, Rodney.
- <i>One down, two to go</i>.

432
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,793
What are you doing, human?

433
00:36:10,483 --> 00:36:12,997
You're trying to get inside my mind.

434
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,954
Allow me.

435
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:27,356
Teyla! Stop him!

436
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,754
Are you OK?

437
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:40,792
- My wounds will heal.
- Yeah, but for how long?

438
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:46,437
I need to know
what you've done to this city.

439
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,803
Listen, Bob.

440
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,080
I have no problem
with killing you whatsoever.

441
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:05,875
Come on. Hit 'em again.

442
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:09,512
- We have a problem.
- <i>What? What problem?</i>

443
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:15,158
It looks like the circuit we re-routed
is overloaded.

444
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:19,680
The weapon can't fire again.
I'm trying to find another pathway.

445
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:22,562
- We're coming to pick you up.
- Stay where you are!

446
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:27,114
- We're cloaked. They won't see us.
- There's no time. Get the hell out of here.

447
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,842
- I'm sorry.
- Get us back to that satellite.

448
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:47,034
Oh, God.

449
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:51,158
I'm not screwing around, Bob.

450
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:53,917
Did you sabotage this base or not?

451
00:37:57,923 --> 00:38:03,236
Those who feed upon you
will know what you've done to me.

452
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:11,201
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Sir, maybe we've gone a bit too far.

453
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:13,399
I don't think we've gone far enough.

454
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:16,794
Atlantis, this is McKay.
We have lost the satellite.

455
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:26,917
- Did you take out any more ships?
- <i>Negative. Two hive ships are intact</i>.

456
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:31,832
Elizabeth, Peter Grodin
was aboard the satellite.

457
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,476
Understood.
What's the status of the other two?

458
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:42,111
<i>They're not coming any closer</i>.

459
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:45,958
At the very least,
he's bought us some time.

460
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,753
<i>You can't do any more out there</i>.
<i>Return to Atlantis</i>.

461
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,914
On our way.

462
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,794
Put me on city-wide.

463
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,836
May I have your attention, please?

464
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:15,153
This is Dr Weir.

465
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:21,115
Our plan to stop the Wraith armada
has failed.

466
00:39:21,283 --> 00:39:23,672
They will make it to Atlantis.

467
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:27,199
Therefore we must begin
our evacuation plans.

468
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:31,436
<i>I wish I could tell you all</i>
<i>that this is a fight that we will win,</i>

469
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,913
<i>but I can't do that</i>.

470
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:39,952
I wish I could tell you we will find
a safe harbour when we leave here.

471
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:43,001
I can't promise you that either.

472
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,752
I can tell you this.

473
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:52,235
Up to now you all have accomplished
extraordinary things,

474
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:55,793
and I believe that
even in the face of an uncertain future,

475
00:39:55,963 --> 00:40:00,161
as long as we stay together
we have a chance to continue to do so.

476
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:04,476
Now we all have our evacuation duties,

477
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,634
so thank you,

478
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,158
and I'll see you on the other side.

479
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:15,961
Dr Zelenka,
put the virus program in standby.

480
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:39,514
I will tell you this.

481
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:46,717
No matter where you flee,
we will find you,

482
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:50,717
just as surely as we will find Earth.

483
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:59,601
And when we do, we will feast.
