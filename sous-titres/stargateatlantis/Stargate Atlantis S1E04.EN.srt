1
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,511
- How we doing?
- I got it lined up pretty close.

2
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,550
No such thing as close.
Thread the needle or we're dead.

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,862
You can do it. Nice and easy.

4
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:26,423
- OK. We're close enough to dial the gate.
- Yes! Hurry up and get us back!

5
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,060
- Get this damn thing off me.
- We can't.

6
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:42,668
- Cut it off.
- Radio back that we've got an emergency.

7
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,788
There must be something we can do.

8
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:48,945
There's an emergency first-aid kit
behind the pilot seat. Get it.

9
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:53,985
Everything we do to try to remove it
makes the pain worse. Try and be still.

10
00:00:55,872 --> 00:01:00,263
- Is there no way to go faster?
- He's trying to get us back in one piece.

11
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,507
Atlantis Base, this is Ford.

12
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:13,187
Jumper One is inbound with
a medical emergency. Please respond.

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:26,182
- What's going on?
- The team has a medical emergency.

14
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,628
- Dr Beckett is on his way.
- Put on Major Sheppard.

15
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,181
He's the one who's injured.

16
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,743
- What am I expecting to find?
- Something for the pain.

17
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:43,348
- He needs a doctor. How much longer?
- Almost there.

18
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:46,151
Flight, Jumper One on final approach.

19
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,825
This is Weir.
What's Major Sheppard's injury?

20
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:54,508
Some sort of alien bug attached itself
to his neck. He's completely immobile.

21
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:59,666
- What's it doing to him?
- We don't know, but we can't get it off.

22
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:02,790
You understand the risk
of bringing it back to Atlantis?

23
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:05,022
Yes, ma'am, but we don't have a choice.

24
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,070
Understood, Lieutenant. Good luck.

25
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,421
Quarantine the jumper bay.

26
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,901
It's all automatic from here.

27
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:26,063
Here we go!

28
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,707
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

29
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,069
The gate's still active.
They should be through by now.

30
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:36,824
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

31
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:42,385
The drive pod... The wing things
that stick out must have failed to retract.

32
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:45,385
That or the Stargate shrank,
which I highly doubt.

33
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,383
This is a big problem.

34
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,146
- What can we do?
- I don't see anything we can do.

35
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,941
This is a... a very, very big problem.

36
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:59,661
Give me a hand.

37
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:04,870
What the hell was that?

38
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:08,263
- That's strange.
- Yes, it is.

39
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,708
- That is the...?
- Yes, it is.

40
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:14,261
That scraping sound... We're stuck.

41
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:17,708
Yes, we are. The engine pods
failed to retract in time.

42
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,306
It's a square peg, round hole.

43
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:24,147
- Can we pull the others out?
- Our hands would dematerialise.

44
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:27,384
It's... There's no way to reach for them.

45
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,030
The major.

46
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,831
He must have been knocked
unconscious by the impact.

47
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,823
<i>This is Weir. What's your status?</i>

48
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:39,870
This is Ford. The four of us are still here,

49
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:44,628
<i>but Markham and Stackhouse</i>
<i>are inside the event horizon.</i>

50
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,625
- Say again?
- Ma'am...

51
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,386
Jumper One is lodged in the Stargate.

52
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:54,022
Teyla, Dr McKay and I are
in the rear compartment with the major.

53
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:56,183
He's in bad shape.

54
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,912
Markham and Stackhouse
are in the forward section.

55
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,540
- How did that happen?
- Engine pods.

56
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,988
We think it was one of the engine pods.

57
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,871
- There's no way to be sure.
- It is the only possibility.

58
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,502
You won't be able to access
the flight controls.

59
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:15,426
An intriguing conundrum,
one I would love to discuss in detail

60
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,662
until this ship is cut in two!

61
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:20,141
Rodney, calm down. Rodney!

62
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:23,190
If I'm gonna be any help,
I need to catch up.

63
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:27,391
Lieutenant Ford, back it up for me.

64
00:06:28,912 --> 00:06:32,825
We couldn't ID the Wraith base
of operations from space like last time,

65
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,907
<i>so we went to the same landing</i>
<i>coordinates as before to get a closer look.</i>

66
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,348
- It's gone.
- What?

67
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:04,744
- I thought it was in a mountainside.
- It was. We were inside it.

68
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,664
Let's move.

69
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:31,067
- This was the spot.
- It's more a hole than a mountain, really.

70
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:34,622
- Could it have been destroyed?
- This is not a blast crater.

71
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:39,343
No. It's like they just picked up and left.
So, ship?

72
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:42,231
The mountainside was covered in trees.

73
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:45,145
But the Wraith hibernate
for centuries, right?

74
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,621
So a lot of trees could have overgrown.

75
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:52,229
Then we were held prisoner inside
one of the great ships in the drawings.

76
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:54,952
They've left to begin culling worlds.

77
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,551
There's movement down there.

78
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:04,104
Go!

79
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,987
- She hardly meant begin at the beginning.
- She needs to know.

80
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:19,383
- We have less than 38 minutes.
- Why 38 minutes?

81
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:23,101
That's the maximum amount of time
a Stargate can remain open.

82
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:26,469
It's one of the more immutable laws
of wormhole physics.

83
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,271
Look at the time.
It's now more like 35 minutes!

84
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,663
- I get it. What do you need?
- Help.

85
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:37,189
Let me put Kavanagh, Grodin and Simpson
in a room, see what they come up with.

86
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,229
And the Czech whose name
I never remember.

87
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:42,190
- Dr Zelenka?
- That's him. We'll work it at our end.

88
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,741
We'll call you. Thank you.

89
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,744
- Where's my patient?
- There's been a problem.

90
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,870
Keep a channel open.
And turn that damn alarm off.

91
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:08,943
Hi, Teyla.

92
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,546
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

93
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:20,224
Something tells me
we haven't made it to Atlantis yet.

94
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,383
No.

95
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,143
Ford?

96
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:37,020
- What is that?
- We're stuck, sir.

97
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:40,389
- We're what?
- In the gate.

98
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:44,147
You mean my day just got worse?

99
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:50,986
We're going with the assumption
it was one of the drive pods.

100
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,746
It was damaged as we tried to take off.

101
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,263
We're taking fire.

102
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,425
- Let's get some altitude!
- I'm trying, sir!

103
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:12,392
There's no way of knowing, but if you
know a way of retracting the mechanism...

104
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:17,262
- Cockpit on the left.
- The cockpit is demolecularised.

105
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:20,504
How about somewhere back here?

106
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,469
- No.
- I didn't think so.

107
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,704
I'll be a foot and a half over there
taking some readings.

108
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:29,421
Feel free to talk amongst yourselves.

109
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:42,230
You've been briefed.
We have less than half an hour.

110
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,941
- Where's Dr Zelenka?
- He's working up a simulation.

111
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,387
- That's good.
- If there was time it would be.

112
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:51,669
Let's not admit defeat yet.
There are six people on that ship.

113
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:54,949
Forgive me if this is a stupid question.

114
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:59,549
If they step through the event horizon,
won't they come through the front part?

115
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:04,467
- The front half won't rematerialise here.
- The Stargate transmits in discrete units.

116
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:09,581
The front half cannot rematerialise until
the whole ship crosses the event horizon.

117
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,064
The Stargate is essentially waiting
for the jumper and everyone inside

118
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:18,350
to enter completely
before it can transport them.

119
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,628
The gate sends things through
in one piece.

120
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,430
Sorry.

121
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:27,143
The Stargate won't transmit the matter
until the demolecularisation is complete.

122
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,340
When it shuts down, the forward section
and the men inside will cease to exist.

123
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:36,744
- And what about the others?
- The ship will be severed instantaneously.

124
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:40,905
They'll be exposed to hard vacuum...
in 29 minutes.

125
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:46,511
What if they close the bulkhead door?

126
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,266
The rear of the ship
would remain pressurised.

127
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:51,343
It would leak atmosphere like a sieve.

128
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,787
- We could send a second jumper.
- And do what?

129
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:59,345
Figure it out. Contact Jumper One
and make the recommendation.

130
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:18,665
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Here.

131
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,949
<i>- Jumper One, this is Atlantis.</i>
- Still here.

132
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,421
<i>We recommend</i>
<i>closing the bulkhead door.</i>

133
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:28,904
- Good thinking. What else?
<i>- We're still working on the problem.</i>

134
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:33,463
<i>- We'll get back to you. Atlantis Base out.</i>
- Thanks for calling

135
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:38,230
- Anybody else claustrophobic?
- Why'd you close the door?

136
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:42,385
So when the Stargate shuts down,
we're not directly exposed to space.

137
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:46,181
- Will it hold?
- I just prefer hypoxia to decompression.

138
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:50,027
- It's a personal thing.
- The air's gonna get thin. Calm down.

139
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:53,343
Wait till you see how thin it gets
in 27 minutes. Vacuum!

140
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:57,505
- Knock it off.
- I truly comprehend how screwed we are!

141
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:00,140
Don't talk to me about screwed!

142
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:11,991
And let's not give up
on Markham and Stackhouse either.

143
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:14,461
There's plenty of time to solve this thing.

144
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:18,022
Stop using your mouth
and start using your brain.

145
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:25,023
I'm sorry. I'm just... I react
to certain doom a certain way.

146
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,626
It's a bad habit and...

147
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,626
- Maybe we can manually retract it.
- Yeah, maybe.

148
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,063
Here.

149
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:45,182
- You seem stronger.
- It's just the pain's not so bad now.

150
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,741
- That's good.
- No, it isn't.

151
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,631
I can't feel my legs.

152
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:54,102
Hands and arms are numb.
I can barely move 'em.

153
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:57,230
The feeling's creeping up.
Look, Lieutenant...

154
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:02,910
What I'm trying to say is if you don't
get this damn thing off me...

155
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,064
I have even less time than you do.

156
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:25,742
Dr Zelenka.

157
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,631
Apologies for not attending your briefing.

158
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,910
I need to know what you're working on
so I can communicate it to Jumper One.

159
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,348
We are attempting to retract the, um, uh...

160
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:40,551
the drive pod back into the fuselage
from inside the rear compartment.

161
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,111
Anything yet?

162
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:47,062
Ancient technology makes it dangerous
for them to experiment in this way.

163
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:51,669
They might accidentally open the rear
hatch or shut life support off entirely.

164
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:55,620
Which is why we are attempting
to isolate the correct control pathway.

165
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,785
- Understood. What could I do to help?
- Stop talking, please.

166
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:11,102
Lieutenant, get your knife out
and cut this damn thing off.

167
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:15,026
- It can't hurt as much as it did last time.
- We almost lost you.

168
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:20,664
- You're gonna lose me anyway.
- We tried when we were on the planet.

169
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,743
We tried everything.

170
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,903
You ready, sir?

171
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,983
Here we go.

172
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:39,910
Everything we did just hurt you more.
The thing just heals itself.

173
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,145
- It feeds on your strength... like a Wraith.
- You had to say that.

174
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:47,543
My father often told stories
of a creature such as this.

175
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:51,785
I thought he was just trying to keep
the children from straying from our camp.

176
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,671
Great. Did he tell you how to kill it?

177
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:58,427
- I'm not sure we can.
- Well, I could use a second opinion.

178
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:01,390
Get Beckett on the radio.

179
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,982
Affirmative. Over here, sir.

180
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,712
This mike is open.

181
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:09,669
How's our patient?

182
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:13,108
<i>He's conscious,</i>
<i>but the creature's still latched onto him.</i>

183
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,662
- How d'you feel about house calls, doc?
<i>- Would if I could.</i>

184
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:22,111
You'll have to settle for long distance.
I'm told you have something of a cling-on.

185
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:28,988
That's funny. It's like the ugliest
damn tick you've ever seen.

186
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:33,270
- How did it attach itself?
- We were on our way back to the jumper...

187
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,981
<i>with the Wraith shooting at us.</i>

188
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,268
- Go tell Markham to get ready for take-off.
- What about you?

189
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,821
I'll be there in a minute. Go!

190
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,431
<i>Major, we're cut off from the jumper.</i>

191
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:19,062
There's one at your three o'clock.
I drew the other two this way.

192
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:21,223
<i>They're all around us.</i>

193
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,667
They make you see things
that aren't there.

194
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:26,824
The path in front of you is clear.
Now move!

195
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,787
- Can you describe it to me?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

196
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:39,740
Two feet in length, including the tail.
That's wrapped under his armpit.

197
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:43,302
It's got two sharp spiny things in his neck.

198
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,702
I'll need more than that, son.

199
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:51,071
Four legs. I guess you could call them that.
They're... wrapped around his throat.

200
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,223
I can't see any eyes.

201
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:56,782
It's got a hard shell, but there's
a soft leechy part underneath.

202
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,341
Major, what are your physical symptoms?

203
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,026
<i>At first it felt like a knife in the eye.</i>

204
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:06,788
Since then I've lost all the feelings
in my extremities. Can't move.

205
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,911
So it incapacitates
first with pain, then paralysis.

206
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:14,030
I need to be able to move around
to help McKay.

207
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:17,264
Markham and Stackhouse
are dead if I don't.

208
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:20,469
- What have you tried?
- To cut it off, burn it off.

209
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,863
I even tried to shoot it off.
Nine mil, point-blank.

210
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:26,910
Not much worse I can do
without killing the major.

211
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,791
I believe the creature
is related to the Wraith.

212
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,544
- Really?
- How so?

213
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:35,500
It healed itself by sapping life
from Major Sheppard,

214
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,345
just as a Wraith would.

215
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:43,028
The Wraith evolved from something. It's
probably some sort of prehistoric cousin.

216
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:49,471
The major's getting worse.
We gotta do something right now.

217
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:53,830
You said the creature had an underside
of exposed soft tissue like a leech.

218
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,950
I tried to cut into it.
It practically strangled him.

219
00:18:57,112 --> 00:19:02,061
Son, you don't cut leeches off.
You pour salt on them.

220
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:05,702
- If you activate the field, they'll die.
- They may fix the problem.

221
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:08,830
- They may not have time.
- We could destroy this facility.

222
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:12,667
You're supposed to be
working on solutions.

223
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:17,901
We think the jumper must be damaged
for this to have happened.

224
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:20,905
Ancient systems are too advanced
for pilot error.

225
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:26,100
So we can't rule out a catastrophic
power feedback in the drive manifold.

226
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:27,830
Without the technobabble.

227
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,983
There's a very slim chance

228
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,110
that when the control is interrupted
and the pod damaged,

229
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,069
the main drive could overload.

230
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,746
She means to say explode.

231
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:42,588
Especially if McKay starts nosing around
inside the control conduits.

232
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,663
And he will. I know I would.

233
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,300
And Zelenka is working on simulations.

234
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:49,747
If there is a catastrophic overload,

235
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:52,551
the explosion will break up the jumper,

236
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:55,749
follow the burning fragments
through the Stargate like a bomb.

237
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:02,828
You think the risk
of this happening is minimal?

238
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:05,984
In my opinion... yes.

239
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,781
You all agree?

240
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:14,232
Then we take the chance.

241
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:19,990
- It was important to point out the risk.
- Fine. You did.

242
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:25,146
Now, please, worry a little bit more about
their lives and less about your own ass.

243
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,743
23 minutes.

244
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:37,343
- Dr Weir.
- I don't have time.

245
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:40,185
Neither do those people
trapped aboard the ship.

246
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,149
News travels fast.

247
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:45,145
I was speaking with someone
who was called to help.

248
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,746
Then you are aware
we are very short on time.

249
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:52,190
I am. Still... this is important.

250
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,711
OK.

251
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:58,306
You do not know this,
but among our people

252
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:02,181
there is a ritual prayer said
when one knows death is upon them.

253
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:05,071
- We don't know it is.
- I am told it is inevitable.

254
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:08,030
- By whom?
- It is not important.

255
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:11,741
What is important is that Teyla
be allowed to prepare for death.

256
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:17,191
Knowing the time and place of one's end
is a very rare thing among our people.

257
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,741
It will not take more
than a few moments...

258
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:24,747
Halling... We need to concentrate
all of our efforts on saving them.

259
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,346
At the risk of forsaking Teyla's beliefs?

260
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:30,584
It is important that we use
what little time we have...

261
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,949
I would ask you not to tell me
what is important.

262
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:36,831
- I can't have this conversation.
- Why not?

263
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,870
- We are wasting time.
- Time Teyla could use to prepare.

264
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,183
You perceive death a certain way.
I accept that.

265
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:47,027
In fact, I respect that.
But we do not prepare for death.

266
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:50,821
We do everything we can to stave it off.
That is who we are.

267
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,381
I am not asking you
to suspend your efforts.

268
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:57,989
You want me to tell everyone on that ship
that they should expect to die?

269
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,143
I will not send them that message.

270
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:03,588
And if you feel that
that violates Teyla's personal rights,

271
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:05,868
I apologise, I truly do.

272
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:10,025
But there's nothing I can do about that
right now. I have to go.

273
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:25,425
<i>We've got everything</i>
<i>from the jumper manifest laid out here.</i>

274
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:30,712
<i>- What's your personal inventory?</i>
- OK, we got a Swiss Army knife.

275
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:36,786
<i>Some chocolate, some water,</i>
<i>matches, emergency kit.</i>

276
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:40,865
<i>We have alcohol, iodine, painkillers.</i>

277
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:42,829
What is this?

278
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,301
Teyla found a portable defibrillator.

279
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:49,545
The major would receive the same
electric shock. It would likely kill him.

280
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:52,704
<i>Try everything, one item at a time.</i>

281
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,510
- Dr Weir.
- I hope you've got something to tell me.

282
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,663
Yes, I do.

283
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,665
- What the hell was that?
- Excuse me?

284
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:10,871
I left the SGC because I had
had it up to here with the military.

285
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:15,822
- You just busted me like a private.
- The air force doesn't have privates.

286
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:21,020
Neither do I. You just cut them off.
Right in front of my research team.

287
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,628
- You're embarrassed?
- Humiliated would be more accurate!

288
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:27,386
I haven't worked up to humiliation yet!

289
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:31,784
I just assumed that with a civilian
in charge there would be a little bit more...

290
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,183
A civilian is in charge,
and we are cut off from Earth,

291
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:38,025
which makes Atlantis
like a colony, doesn't it?

292
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:40,581
- I suppose.
- I'm governor of that colony.

293
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,665
- That's all very well and good...
- Do you have a problem with that?

294
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,551
- You're missing my point.
- You're missing mine.

295
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,183
If you waste one more minute which could
be used to help the people on that ship

296
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:54,149
because of your ego,

297
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,145
I will dial the coordinates
of a very lonely planet

298
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:01,624
where you can be as self-important
as you wanna be.

299
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,347
You think I'm kidding?

300
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:09,630
- You wouldn't do that.
- Kavanagh, get back in there.

301
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:16,390
- We'll talk about this later.
- Never again. Go.

302
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:20,746
Go!

303
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:45,182
Dr Zelenka to Control Room.
I think I have something.

304
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:50,623
We're receiving.

305
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:54,228
Jumper One, this is Weir.
Dr Zelenka's come up with something.

306
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:59,785
- Why can I never remember that name?
<i>- He's identified how to retract the pod.</i>

307
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,670
I'm relaying the schematics.

308
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,187
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- What?

309
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:07,230
Zelenka's identified
the pathways to the engine pod,

310
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:13,262
increasing my chances of fixing this
from one in a million to one in a thousand.

311
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:16,387
- It's something. Elizabeth.
- Yes?

312
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:20,989
<i>I'll only have nine seconds to warn you</i>
<i>if I trigger a catastrophic overload.</i>

313
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,906
If I tell you to raise the shields,
don't hesitate.

314
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:29,350
We're aware of the risk, Rodney.
Do your best.

315
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:41,391
Starting with iodine.

316
00:25:56,552 --> 00:26:00,067
<i>- Scratch iodine.</i>
- What else have you got there?

317
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,302
- You got any food?
- You're kidding?

318
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:04,463
I have 20 minutes to save our lives

319
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:08,591
and I am on the brink
of a hypoglycaemic reaction, so...

320
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:11,903
Thank you.

321
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:18,991
Here.

322
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:25,869
- Gonna try alcohol now.
<i>- Place a few drops on the soft tissue.</i>

323
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:28,990
- Save some for me.
- Wrong type of alcohol, sir.

324
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:32,224
What's the good of that?

325
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:38,706
Not much, sir.

326
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:41,902
No reaction to alcohol.

327
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,950
Right, what next?

328
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,672
Did the doctor not say to pour salt on it?

329
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,266
I think that was a metaphor.

330
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:53,230
But it doesn't matter. Just try everything.

331
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:18,626
Water. Give me water.

332
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:35,144
Sir? Sir!

333
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,187
Sir, are you all right? Sir! Major!

334
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:45,508
<i>Sir, are you all right?</i>
<i>Sir! Major! Major!</i>

335
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:48,232
What's happening?

336
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:58,145
What's happening?

337
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,188
- It reacted to either the salt or the water.
- Or both.

338
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,468
- Did it loosen its hold?
<i>- Negative.</i>

339
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:17,226
- It dug in more.
- Don't do that again.

340
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:22,512
- I won't, sir. I'm sorry.
- A primitive defensive reflex to salt water.

341
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:25,391
We moved.
When you fell, I crossed a circuit.

342
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,703
The engine fired for a microsecond
but it stopped.

343
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,623
- Oh, no.
- What?

344
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,663
What?

345
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,584
- So much for Plan A.
- What?

346
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:45,583
When the Stargate closes now,

347
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:49,108
every molecule of air
is gonna rush out through there.

348
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:53,986
We slid in further.

349
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:01,309
15 minutes.

350
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:12,149
- Ford, what can you tell me?
<i>- The jumper has shifted.</i>

351
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,224
The rear compartment
has breached the event horizon.

352
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,304
Dr McKay... Dr McKay...

353
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:24,587
is still hopeful he can retract
the drive pod in time.

354
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,861
Understood.

355
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:38,422
We haven't come up with anything yet,
but there's still time.

356
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:40,469
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

357
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:43,465
- How is Major Sheppard?
- I'm still here.

358
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:47,821
Hang in there, Major.
We're working on the problem.

359
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,983
I know you are.

360
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:53,183
Listen...

361
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:59,471
- I'd like to say something while I still can.
- Don't. You're gonna get through this.

362
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:05,143
If I was...

363
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,588
he wouldn't have let me go.

364
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:10,743
Who wouldn't have let you go?

365
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,511
The Wraith.

366
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:42,070
I guess he just saw me as good as dead,
'cause he just walked away.

367
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,030
So... what I wanted to say was...

368
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,752
Save your strength, John.
Tell me in person.

369
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,301
This is important.

370
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:54,985
I'm listening.

371
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,583
We should send him through.

372
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:01,301
If Dr McKay figures it out,
we can fix him up on the other side.

373
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:04,464
- If he doesn't, we're all dead anyway.
- No pressure.

374
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,431
He would effectively be
in suspended animation.

375
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,867
- We can't risk that.
- Why not?

376
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:15,025
If it reacted that violently to water,
how will it react to Stargate travel?

377
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:17,831
He can't come through
with that thing on him?

378
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:19,550
Then we must do something now.

379
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:31,584
Hit me with the defibrillator.

380
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:39,425
- You may be onto something, Major.
- You said that might kill him.

381
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:42,186
- That's the idea.
- I don't understand.

382
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:43,671
<i>Teyla.</i>

383
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:46,585
- You said this creature was like a Wraith.
- Yes.

384
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:51,542
Then how would it respond if, God forbid,
Major Sheppard were to die right now?

385
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:57,424
- It would stop feeding.
<i>- Exactly. As a Wraith would.</i>

386
00:31:57,592 --> 00:31:59,787
How is that an idea?

387
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:03,991
We fool it into thinking its prey is dead
by stopping the major's heart.

388
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:08,509
- If I'm right, it should let him go.
- Then we give him another jolt.

389
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,823
<i>If it doesn't work,</i>
<i>send him through the event horizon.</i>

390
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:15,064
He'll keep there as good as a deep freeze.

391
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:24,709
- John, are you sure you wanna do this?
- I want this damn thing off me.

392
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:29,981
Prepare for a code blue.
Lieutenant, do you know how to do this?

393
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:32,712
Yes, sir. Cut his shirt open.

394
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,022
- What?
- Cut his shirt open!

395
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:44,426
Charging to 200.

396
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:48,107
Move his tags. Move his chain to the side.

397
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:51,264
Place the lubrication right on the paddles.

398
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:57,271
Ready to go. Once the bug falls off,
I'm gonna have to kill it.

399
00:32:57,432 --> 00:33:00,549
I'll wait for it to charge up
and give him another jolt.

400
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:04,944
If we can't restart his heart,
I'll need that bulkhead door open again.

401
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:07,626
Done.

402
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,784
- One of us will have to get him through.
- I will.

403
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,909
Do it!

404
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,382
No pulse.

405
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:37,144
- It won't come off.
- Settle.

406
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,987
It may take a moment.

407
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,104
Lieutenant?

408
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,388
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

409
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:26,941
Let's get him through.

410
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,740
- Got him?
- Yes.

411
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:44,228
The creature has been removed
from Major Sheppard,

412
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:46,383
but we were unable to revive him.

413
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:50,306
He and Teyla are now
on the other side of the event horizon.

414
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:53,103
Thank you, Lieutenant.

415
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:57,389
Rodney, you have seven minutes.

416
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:21,821
I'm only halfway through the pathways.
We're never gonna make it.

417
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:25,951
- There's still time.
- You should consider the event horizon.

418
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:28,990
I'll keep trying,
but that's a far better way to go.

419
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,701
- And leave you here with that thing?
- You checked it was dead?

420
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:35,784
- It's dead.
- Explosive decompression with that...

421
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:37,908
- Work!
- Sorry.

422
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,625
- Time?
- Two minutes, 20 seconds.

423
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,306
- Rodney, two minutes.
- I know the time.

424
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:51,750
- Still got over two dozen circuits to try.
- Just pick one at random.

425
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:55,268
- And attempt to activate a circuit twice?
- Just try!

426
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:59,311
There's no way I can...

427
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:02,111
Wait...

428
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,261
I think I did it.

429
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:19,101
Elizabeth, I think
the engine pod's retracted.

430
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:31,708
Then why haven't you shown up?

431
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:39,271
She's right. Why aren't we moving?

432
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:43,391
It's inertia. We've shed
all our forward momentum.

433
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:52,182
You're wasting your time. For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

434
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,946
Then what are we gonna do?

435
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,102
One minute.

436
00:37:03,712 --> 00:37:06,272
Wait. The rear hatch.

437
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:10,264
Blow the rear hatch.
It should give you enough thrust.

438
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:15,586
That could do it. But the only mechanism
to blow the hatch is back here.

439
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:22,908
- Go through. I'll do it.
- You'll get blown into space!

440
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,063
Go!

441
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,903
30 seconds.

442
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:19,701
I'll be in the jumper bay.

443
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,623
Again.

444
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,781
He's gonna be fine.

445
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:00,668
- Well done, Rodney.
- We'll see.

446
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:05,387
We've got a pulse.

447
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:13,069
Getting stronger.

448
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,549
He's going to be OK.

449
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,062
- How are you feeling?
- Starving.

450
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:04,669
He's got quite the hickey, but Dr Beckett
says he'll be fine in a few days.

451
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:07,300
- We should let you rest.
- No, get me food.

452
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,270
- We can arrange that.
- Welcome back, sir.

453
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:15,904
- I have to admit, it is a pleasant surprise.
- By the way, what were you gonna say?

454
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:19,747
- When?
- Before, when you thought, you know...

455
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:25,021
- Oh, that.
- I didn't want you to say at the time.

456
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:27,262
But now I'm curious.

457
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:29,468
I was gonna say, um...

458
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,742
Take care of each other.

459
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,269
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

460
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:46,184
- And indeed we did.
- Yes, you did. Thank you.

461
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:48,946
- Again.
- You're welcome.

462
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:51,103
Good night.

463
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,905
You weren't really gonna
say that, were you?

464
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:01,381
I have no idea what you're talking about.

465
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:05,750
I didn't think so.
