1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,877
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis</i>...

2
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:09,874
- It's heading here.
- What's it doing?

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,876
It's scanning us.

4
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:17,195
The dart sent a transmission into space
and self-destructed before we got to it.

5
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:19,831
- We scanned the area...
- What are those?

6
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,358
- Wraith hive ships.
- Where are they headed?

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:27,722
If they maintain direction and speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.

8
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:36,238
We knew they were coming.
Now we know when.

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,394
- That's something.
- That's something?

10
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:43,000
It means there's still time, Rodney.
There's no reason to panic... yet.

11
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:46,235
- Where there is time, there is hope.
- So, recommendations?

12
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,837
- Other than panic?
- Other than panic, yes.

13
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:53,716
I realise this might not be cool,
but we should consider M7G-<i>6</i>77.

14
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:59,239
- As a possible evacuation site?
- No. I'm suggesting we take their ZPM.

15
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:04,238
Their only protection from the Wraith?
A planet populated mostly by children?

16
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:06,394
He raises a valid point.

17
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:09,919
The ZPM is nearly depleted,
but it could be of some use to us.

18
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,802
You asked for suggestions.
It's a matter of survival.

19
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:16,922
I see. Well, we're not quite there yet,

20
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,995
and as long as I'm in charge
we will never be there.

21
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:25,237
I agree. If this is to be our end, it is best
we face it with both dignity and honour.

22
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:28,679
- I have an idea... in addition to panic.
- Let's hear it.

23
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:32,472
It's a long shot,
but I think it's most likely worth the effort.

24
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,237
- It'll mostly be my effort, so...
- What is it?

25
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:38,281
We can send a message to Earth
through the Stargate.

26
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:41,003
- Excuse me?
- Do we have enough power?

27
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:44,041
Not to send a person.
We couldn't maintain the wormhole.

28
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:47,354
If we tied together
all our power-generating capabilities,

29
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:51,914
we <i>might</i> be able to establish a wormhole
long enough to send a message.

30
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:57,237
- How much time are we talking about?
- Approximately 1.3 seconds, give or take.

31
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,871
- That's not much time.
- Time to say SOS.

32
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:05,356
It's enough time to send a message in
the form of a high-compression data burst.

33
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,720
I helped refine the encoding
for the US air force.

34
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:11,716
Colonel Carter can decipher it
on the other side.

35
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,681
- You're suggesting this now?
- It probably won't work

36
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,118
and could overload
our naqahdah generators.

37
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:21,356
Well, then, we can't take the risk.
No power, we won't have a chance in hell.

38
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:26,551
There are three Wraith hive ships on the
way. This calls for desperate measures.

39
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:30,113
Besides, I've been working out
ways of minimising the risk.

40
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:35,162
Assuming it's possible,
how much information could we send?

41
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:41,114
Everything. Mission reports
from all the senior staff, stuff on Atlantis...

42
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:44,116
- All that. One second?
- 1.3.

43
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:48,196
If I finesse the compression ratios,
you'll be looking for things to add.

44
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,793
- Do it.
- Doing it.

45
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:14,321
Elizabeth, you realise that if Stargate
Command was able to send help...

46
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,474
I know. They would have.

47
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:21,080
But we must report what we've learned
here, about Atlantis, about the Ancients.

48
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,996
- The Wraith.
- Exactly. We have to warn Earth.

49
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:28,554
- Even if it's the last thing we do?
- Especially if it's the last thing we do.

50
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,951
They don't seem threatening
as dots on a screen.

51
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:38,593
We need to do recon
and see what we're up against first-hand.

52
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:40,719
- How?
- I've tracked their progress.

53
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:44,432
The Wraith ships
go in and out of hyperspace periodically,

54
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,719
because their technology is limited...

55
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:52,196
- Or they're stopping to feed along the way.
- The point is, the pattern is predictable.

56
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:55,594
I can guess with some certainty
that they'll be making stops

57
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,641
here, here, and here.

58
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:02,637
The ships are light years away. How
will you reach them by puddle jumper?

59
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,398
We take a route where Zelenka thinks
they'll drop out of hyperspace

60
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,554
and we watch them pass by.

61
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:11,237
- That's good.
- You know, I have my moments.

62
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:14,236
Teyla and I were just deciding
which planet to go to.

63
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,553
I know the people of this world.

64
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:20,511
Their Stargate is in the open
and so accessible by ship.

65
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:24,198
You can remain undetected by the Wraith
as they go by your position?

66
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,593
Stealth mode.
They won't know we're there.

67
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:31,154
OK, go, get what intel you can, and get
back before Rodney sends his message.

68
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,235
- I need you here.
- Won't even stop at the duty free.

69
00:05:57,563 --> 00:06:00,999
If you get the idea to take
the Wraith ships on yourself, Major,

70
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:02,960
I am hereby ordering you not to.

71
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,353
- Believe me, you don't have to.
- Still...

72
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:10,039
Don't take on an alien armada
single-handedly. Understood.

73
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,921
Father, Teyla's here!

74
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,439
- Teyla.
- Orin. It has been many days.

75
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,152
Too many. Look at you.
You're so different.

76
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,362
Much has changed since my last visit.

77
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:54,675
- This is Major John Sheppard... and Orin.
- Pleased to meet you, uh...

78
00:06:56,163 --> 00:07:00,122
- The harvest is still months away.
- Yes, I know.

79
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,400
We have not come to trade,
but to deliver a warning.

80
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:06,677
We believe the Wraith
may be on their way.

81
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,957
We don't know that,
but we're about to find out.

82
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:13,195
Yes.
It seems they're awakening everywhere.

83
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:16,480
Tell your people to take precautions
in case they do come.

84
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:20,192
I will, but you know as well as I do, Teyla,

85
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:23,161
that the Wraith will track us down
wherever we go.

86
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,713
- There will be no escape.
- What about through the Stargate?

87
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:31,195
The cullings are taking place
on many worlds. None are safe.

88
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,319
Even we have taken in refugees.

89
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,558
If they do come, stay far from the Stargate.

90
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:41,035
Take your family to the far tree line there
and wait for us.

91
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:44,195
- Teyla.
- One family, Major. That is all I ask.

92
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:53,877
- I'm sorry, Orin, I can't make that promise.
- It will be the very least we can do.

93
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,242
- If there's time.
- Then we must hurry.

94
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:11,402
Children, we must prepare.

95
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:14,680
We have our city specs, mission reports

96
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:18,153
and tactical assessments all ready to go.
What else?

97
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:22,157
I've included data we've been able
to decipher from the Ancient database.

98
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:25,121
Really? That is incredible.

99
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:29,834
- My algorithm is extraordinarily efficient.
- Oh, please.

100
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:33,279
It must be in order to fit all that data
into 1.3 seconds.

101
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,593
.3 seconds, actually.

102
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:39,915
- We have a whole extra second to fill?
- Mm. A whole extra one, yes.

103
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:47,163
Is it enough
to include personal messages?

104
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:53,034
Uh... sure. I mean, several hours of video.
Much more if it was strictly audio.

105
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,354
I think it'd do wonders for morale.
Especially now.

106
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:59,242
I could tell my grandma
what I've been up to.

107
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,678
If your grandmother
had security clearance.

108
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:05,472
But for now you can tell her
that you're well and that you miss her.

109
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:09,636
This is all very charming,
but I have work to do. Shouldn't I, um...?

110
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:12,840
Lieutenant,
maybe you'd like to handle this.

111
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:16,791
Give everybody a few minutes
to send a message to their loved ones.

112
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:19,796
- I'd love to, ma'am.
- Off you go.

113
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,280
When Zelenka and I tie
Jumper Four's engines into the grid,

114
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:29,435
- we'll be able to do a low-power dry run.
- Good.

115
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,400
- Rodney?
- Mm?

116
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:34,396
- You don't want to send a message?
- You know what?

117
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:37,873
Maybe with all my spare time,
I'll record a message myself.

118
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:40,921
- You?
- Yes.

119
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:45,201
Good, good.

120
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:54,042
This wasn't supposed to be
a rescue mission.

121
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:58,401
- Orin was a good friend of my father.
- I agreed to warn him.

122
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:03,478
If someone close to your family, a dear
friend, was in danger from the Wraith,

123
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:08,273
- would you have not done the same?
- Not if it jeopardised the mission.

124
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,560
So we give up that
which makes us different from the Wraith?

125
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:18,322
I agreed to stop and pick him up if there
was time, but only if there was time.

126
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,156
I'd like to be saving everyone
in the damn galaxy.

127
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:25,521
- It's just one man and his children.
- I agreed to help if there was time.

128
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:30,038
You can only fight the battles you can win.

129
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,873
Whoa.

130
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:12,275
Let me get this thing turned around.

131
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,881
They're heading for the planet.

132
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,957
OK, recording. Plenty of battery.

133
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:31,752
So why am I not seeing anything?
Oh... stupid.

134
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,200
OK.

135
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,241
Hi, Grandma, Grandpa.

136
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:52,042
It's me, Aiden... obviously.

137
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:56,401
I'm talking to you
from a place far, far from home.

138
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:59,760
I'm good, though.
You don't have to worry.

139
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:03,632
Life here is... pretty routine.

140
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:17,516
I'm hoping that I'll be able
to get home sometime soon,

141
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,959
but, you know,
if... if I'm stuck here a while,

142
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,592
I want you to know that I'm good.

143
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:28,392
I'm doing things...
I'm seeing things I never thought I'd see.

144
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:46,154
I wish I could tell you all about it.
Who knows?

145
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,837
One day, maybe, I'll be able to,

146
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:53,155
but I want you both to know...
that you're right here.

147
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,397
Always. All the time.

148
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:05,515
Even flying full out,
we're just ahead of the armada.

149
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:08,914
- I can't risk putting down for Orin.
- I see.

150
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:15,359
I'm gonna take us out of stealth mode
for the pass-through. Dial the gate.

151
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,956
Hang on. Incoming wormhole.

152
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:31,959
The Wraith dial in to prevent victims from
using the Stargate as a means of escape.

153
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,715
So we're stuck here.

154
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:37,353
Once the ship is rendered invisible again,
we will be safe.

155
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:40,754
I need to get the intel
about the Wraith fleet to Atlantis.

156
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:44,598
They will keep dialling in through the night
at the very least,

157
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:48,438
but if we wait where
I told Orin and his family to meet us...

158
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,958
That's where I'm headed.

159
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,954
I'm not very good at this.

160
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:03,842
The only people to see it
will be your family.

161
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:08,076
- Aye, and you and the US military.
- Well, give it a shot.

162
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,599
- What shall I say?
- Uh... Uh...

163
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:15,597
- "I miss you. I wish you were here."
- I wish who was here?

164
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,800
- Who do you wish was here?
- Nobody. I wish I wasn't!

165
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:20,954
I've got a lot of people to get to.

166
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:26,880
All right, er...
I suppose I could say hello to my mother.

167
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:30,160
Good. There you go. All right, you ready?

168
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:33,281
OK, go.

169
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:37,277
Hello, Mum.
I hope this message finds you well.

170
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,962
I trust your petunias
are in full bloom by now.

171
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,557
I hope you're keeping up
with that ointment.

172
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:48,717
If you've adhered to the regime,
the fungus should have cleared up by now.

173
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,317
- What's wrong?
- Dude, fungus?

174
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,555
On her toenails.
You said no one would watch this.

175
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,521
- Yeah, but fungus?
- What, then, shall I talk about?

176
00:14:57,683 --> 00:15:01,358
- It's your mother. Tell her you love her.
- I can't. I get emotional.

177
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:05,198
- So?
- She's very delicate, my mother.

178
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:09,197
As sweet a soul as you'll ever meet,
as pure as the driven snow.

179
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:12,116
If I get upset, she'll get upset.
I can't have that.

180
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:16,435
We're not live. If you don't like
what we put on tape, we can do it again.

181
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:19,117
- We can?
- Sure.

182
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:23,595
Oh. Well, I suppose I could do that, then.

183
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:25,754
All right.

184
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,437
Here we go.

185
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:31,197
Um... Mum...

186
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,914
I miss you terribly.

187
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,040
I can't do this!

188
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,757
Come on, Orin, show up.

189
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,562
What?

190
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:06,112
Not long ago,
you would have left him behind.

191
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,399
Well, the situation has changed.

192
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:15,233
Lieutenant Ford suggested
we steal from a community of children.

193
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,361
They have a ZPM
and we can bring them back.

194
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,593
Only to face death in Atlantis?

195
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:25,439
Ford and I are military. We've spent
a lot of our lives learning how to survive.

196
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:27,912
I have spent my life surviving the Wraith.

197
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,519
Part of that training is knowing
who you can and can't save.

198
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,833
And that decision is yours alone?

199
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:39,157
I said that I'd wait for your friend
if there was time. Now there's time.

200
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:44,192
- What else do you want from me?
- Too much, I fear.

201
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:51,394
It's gonna be a long night.

202
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,795
Failsafe.

203
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,921
You didn't say anything that
would require security clearance, did you?

204
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,313
Security clearance?

205
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:16,081
- This is hard to sit and watch.
- There's nothing we can do.

206
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:20,156
We could do a lot.
It would just be the last thing we ever do.

207
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:23,395
We are far outnumbered
and the gate is still inaccessible.

208
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:29,320
But if we save Orin and his family,
we will have done something.

209
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:33,194
Something.

210
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm gonna miss you, kiddo.

211
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:42,035
I can't wait to take you
to a basketball game

212
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:46,355
and watch Kobe and Shaq
take another title home for the Lakers.

213
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,962
That's it.

214
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:56,354
- That's it?
- What else am I gonna say to a kid?

215
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,912
- It's your brother.
- I may not see him again.

216
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,075
- Why make it any worse?
- That's not what this is about.

217
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,076
That's exactly what this is about.

218
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:10,239
Don't sweat it. I'm happy
I got the chance to say goodbye.

219
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,634
- Yeah, but you didn't say it.
- Not in so many words.

220
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,643
- Lieutenant Ford.
- Ready to record your message?

221
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:27,557
Already done. Actually, I took the liberty
of doing mine in private.

222
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:30,157
- Now, it may require some editing.
- Editing?

223
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,757
Yeah, I went on a bit.
I used the entire tape.

224
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,562
- You talked for an hour?
- I found it therapeutic.

225
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:38,362
I've come up with
several valuable insights,

226
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:43,233
but I've only slept six hours
in the last few days, so, um...

227
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,758
- Who's it for?
- Humanity, my sister...

228
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:48,232
I don't expect you to cut it down too much.

229
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,236
There is gold in here.
So just make sure mine's last.

230
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,999
If the gate holds the connection,
we won't have wasted the time.

231
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,758
- Well, I'll look forward to it.
- Well, enjoy.

232
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,874
Gold.

233
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:15,032
And in five... four... three...

234
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,154
This is Dr Rodney McKay speaking

235
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:22,235
from my base of operations
in the lost city of Atlantis,

236
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:25,873
located deep within the Pegasus galaxy.

237
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:30,400
I record this message
on the eve of our darkest hour.

238
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,192
As I speak, an alien armada
of biblical proportions is on its way,

239
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:39,517
bent - dare I say hell-bent, in keeping
with the metaphor - on our destruction.

240
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:42,436
We will do our best
to stave off their attack,

241
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:45,561
but I am afraid that defeat
is all but inevitable.

242
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:51,878
i and the other members of my team
face the most horrific deaths imaginable

243
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:58,755
as our very lives are... are sucked
from our chests in a... in a... horrific...

244
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:02,558
OK, um...
OK, starting again, starting again.

245
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:05,157
Um, Ford, just cut that, all right?

246
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,759
What about, uh...?

247
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:18,119
- What is that?
- I've never seen such a thing.

248
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:24,316
- I'm gonna check it out.
- You may be discovered.

249
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,474
- I'll make a point not to.
- Major.

250
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:28,952
I just want to see whatever that is.

251
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,762
Just stay here
until Orin and his family show up.

252
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,234
And in five, four, three...

253
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:56,712
My friends, I'm Dr Rodney McKay
of the Atlantis expedition,

254
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,955
and as the facts of our heroic struggle
against the Wraith

255
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:03,195
and our untimely demise
are already known to you,

256
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,641
in that light,
I'd like to pass along some final thoughts.

257
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:13,793
Now, my extensive education, training
and experience in the field of astrophysics

258
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:17,194
has given me a unique perspective
that few on Earth,

259
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:21,151
or, well, on any other planet,
for that matter, can match.

260
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:25,714
I'd like to take a few moments now
to pass along that perspective to you.

261
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll begin with a few observations
on a subject

262
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,156
that is both near and dear to my heart.

263
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:36,674
Leadership.

264
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:40,882
Mr and Mrs Markham,
my name is Dr Elizabeth Weir,

265
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,511
and your son
was a member of my expedition team.

266
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:48,193
It is with deep regret that I inform you

267
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:52,356
that he was killed in the line of duty
just a few days ago.

268
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:57,278
<i>He died in the defence of others, and</i>
<i>his sacrifice may have saved many lives</i>...

269
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,037
..and her keen curiosity
are some of the qualities

270
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:05,561
that your daughter displayed during
her duties as a scientist on my team.

271
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:09,602
She and several of her colleagues
died suddenly just a few weeks ago.

272
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,596
I am not at liberty
to reveal the cause of her death,

273
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:15,323
but I can tell you
that during her time here,

274
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:19,237
<i>Dr Dumais was a part</i>
<i>of something very profound</i>.

275
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:23,032
<i>She saw and did things</i>
<i>she never would have dreamed of</i>...

276
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,876
He died bravely, while defending others.

277
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:28,921
I confess I didn't know him
as well as I could have,

278
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:33,042
but I know he was well liked
and respected among his peers.

279
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,196
<i>And I was told of how often</i>
<i>he spoke of his family</i>.

280
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:40,274
<i>I do wish I could tell you more</i>.

281
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:46,113
I'm sure you understand,
as a military family.

282
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,833
Are you done, ma'am?

283
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:02,035
Just give me a moment,
please, Lieutenant.

284
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:04,797
I am keeping busy with my job.

285
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:09,957
I work hard, like everyone else,
to ensure the success of this expedition,

286
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,637
and to please
the leader of our science team...

287
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:16,478
No, no, no, no, no. This sequence first,
and then the secondary code.

288
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:19,396
Unless you're trying to blow us up.
If so, good work.

289
00:24:19,563 --> 00:24:24,318
He does not always remember my name,
but I have enjoyed working for him.

290
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,873
What is this? Kiwi?
Who made this? Did you make this?

291
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:30,762
He's a very honourable and brave man.

292
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:35,235
Ow! Ow! OK, cramp,
cramp, cramp, cramp, cramp... Ow!

293
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:39,112
Until then I will continue
to serve at his pleasure.

294
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:42,798
I once caught mono
kissing a girl in algebra club.

295
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:45,158
I missed an entire month of school.

296
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:49,839
Still, the kiss was... something,
so it was probably worth it.

297
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,039
April Bingham. Cute blonde.

298
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:58,835
God, see, I love blondes. Especially
with the, uh... the short hair. Mm...

299
00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:06,359
Samantha Carter, if you're watching,
the torch is still burning.

300
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,878
Sadly, soon to be extinguished,

301
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:14,879
but, you know,
you should know I think you are just so...

302
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:19,595
Well, you're great,
you're really, really great,

303
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:23,153
and you're the hottest scientist
I've ever worked with.

304
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,918
There's probably not a night
that goes by that I don't find myself...

305
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,392
OK, Ford, let's lose that,

306
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:35,911
and let's get back to, uh... leadership.

307
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,756
Run, children! Run!

308
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,399
Hurry!

309
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,994
- Who will be watching this?
- Anyone you're sending it to.

310
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,154
Family, friends, loved ones.

311
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:44,521
- Will anyone from Atlantis be viewing it?
- No, messages are private.

312
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,755
- You can get as mushy as you want.
- All right.

313
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:53,956
Uh, this is a message for General
Jack O'Neill of Stargate Command.

314
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:58,275
It is my duty to inform you of what I
consider to be serious errors in judgement

315
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:03,153
among the leaders of this expedition,
most notably Dr Elizabeth Weir.

316
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,996
Her actions have
repeatedly and recklessly

317
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,155
exposed the people of this expedition
to extreme danger,

318
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:13,555
leading us directly to the grave situation
we currently find ourselves in.

319
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,441
You know what?

320
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:17,958
How about you record
your whining in private?

321
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:20,921
Fine.

322
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:28,479
I've recorded her questionable activities,
which I would like to detail for you now.

323
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:38,237
Quickly! Quickly!

324
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:52,636
Run for the trees!

325
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:06,392
Never cared for dogs. Too much work,
too needy, too unpredictable.

326
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,396
You leave one door open
and they're gone.

327
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,360
You look for them, it's no use,

328
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,162
and since your father
refused to buy a licence,

329
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,757
the animal shelter can't track them.

330
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,391
God knows what happened
to that little guy.

331
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:22,236
Now, cats...
now, that's a whole different story.

332
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:26,442
Cats are self-sufficient, dependable.
You shake the box, they come running.

333
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:30,755
A cynic would say it's because of the food,
but my cat, he enjoys my company.

334
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:33,153
It's very comforting
to come home from work

335
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:36,121
and have a familiar face waiting for you.

336
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,672
Still, I digress. Where was I?

337
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:43,519
Uh... right. Leadership.

338
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,432
Keep going! Keep going!

339
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:21,473
Over here!

340
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:25,602
It is all right. I am a friend.
Please, hurry. This way.

341
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,754
Hurry. This way.

342
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:46,798
- How many of you are left?
- I don't know. The Wraith are everywhere.

343
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,557
Here, drink this. It is water.

344
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,920
Orin... Have you seen him?

345
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,200
Not since before the Wraith arrived.
Thank you.

346
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,639
- We must go. The Wraith will find us.
- No, they will not.

347
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:05,682
Our ship has a shield which makes it
invisible to them. You are safe here.

348
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:08,357
Just rest.

349
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,514
We will leave soon.

350
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:24,478
I'd like to say something to the families
of every member of this expedition.

351
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:29,717
I wish I could tell you more
about what your loved ones are doing,

352
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:34,513
and someday I hope you find out,
because you will be amazed,

353
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:42,238
but I will tell you that I could not be more
proud of each and every one of them.

354
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:45,361
Their heroism has amazed me.

355
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,877
Their resourcefulness has staggered me.

356
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,880
- Rodney, go!
- Going!

357
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,874
Now!

358
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:35,994
We face a terrible enemy
and an uncertain future,

359
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,478
but if we are never heard from again,

360
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:43,682
know that your loved ones
did not face that uncertainty alone.

361
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:47,516
We are facing our future together.

362
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:09,554
Major.

363
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:15,322
It's pretty ugly out there.

364
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:18,122
- Is this Orin's family?
- No.

365
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:22,677
They have not seen Orin
since the culling began.

366
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,880
The village is wiped out.

367
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:37,274
The gate just shut off.

368
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:42,351
We should be able to get out of here
before the Wraith can do anything.

369
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:45,037
Please, Major. Give Orin more time.

370
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:50,152
If he was able to get here, he would be
here by now. We've got to get back.

371
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:54,157
Go. I will stay and search in the daylight.
You can return for me later.

372
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:56,962
- You can't do that.
- I consider Orin as family.

373
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:00,638
- I am sorry if you do not understand...
- That's not the point...

374
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:04,512
With you or without you, I am staying.

375
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:09,593
You won't make it.

376
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:12,914
Then I ask that you stay as well,
just a little longer.

377
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:17,079
Allow something good to come of this.

378
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,511
All right. We'll give it a little more time.

379
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:33,118
I know you worry about me, Mum,

380
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:36,400
but somehow we've found a way
to rise to each challenge,

381
00:33:36,563 --> 00:33:38,633
so I wouldn't fret about my safety.

382
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:43,319
It's the people here, from dozens of
countries, all connected by a single bond.

383
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:45,599
We represent the people of Earth,

384
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:50,518
and if there's one thing I know about
we Earthlings, we're a scrappy bunch...

385
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:54,312
You can't say Earthlings.
Your mother doesn't have clearance.

386
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,316
She knows I'm from Earth.
It's not a bloody secret.

387
00:33:57,483 --> 00:34:00,122
- Oh, right.
- Sorry, Mum. Anyhow...

388
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:03,241
Authorised using a prisoner
to test an experimental drug,

389
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,633
in clear violation
of the Geneva Convention.

390
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:07,600
Lowered the Stargate shield

391
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:11,039
when the authenticity
of incoming travellers was in question.

392
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:13,842
That's another sight
I'll die without having seen.

393
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:16,119
When you've travelled as much as I have,

394
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:19,434
you'd think that missing Niagara Falls
would be no big deal.

395
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:21,719
There's a lot of movies I wish I'd seen.

396
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:24,955
Never saw <i>Grease</i>, even though
I fancied Olivia Newton-John.

397
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:29,674
Always wanted to see <i>Gandhi</i>.
Only saw the first half of <i>The Sixth Sense</i>.

398
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,162
My sister...

399
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:38,521
Ford, if you cut everything else,
just, um... keep this part, OK?

400
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:42,272
Jeannie, it's your brother, Rodney.

401
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,314
Obviously.

402
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,678
I want to say, um...

403
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:51,313
I want to say something. Uh...

404
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:55,682
Family is important.

405
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,279
I've come to realise that, because
the people here have become a...

406
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,798
kind of a surrogate family to me.

407
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:06,275
I know I've never really been
the poster child for that kind of sentiment,

408
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:11,517
but when one's contemplating one's
own demise, one sees things more clearly.

409
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:17,921
I really do wish you the best, you know,
and I'm sorry we weren't closer.

410
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,840
Perhaps, um...
if by chance I make it out of this,

411
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:26,836
perhaps one day we can be,
and I would like that.

412
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:34,239
Now, if there's time, I'd like
to go back to the subject of leadership.

413
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:38,362
Someone's coming.

414
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,120
Orin!

415
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:57,238
- Orin!
- How big is his family?

416
00:35:57,403 --> 00:36:00,042
- He must have met others.
- That'll be a problem.

417
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:03,400
- I didn't think you'd be here.
- We would not have left you.

418
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:06,475
We found others on the way,
and more further behind.

419
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:09,760
- How many more?
- 12, perhaps more.

420
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:13,472
In here! This way!

421
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,599
Quickly!

422
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:18,197
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

423
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:26,999
- We'll fit as many people in as we can.
- Hurry! Come on!

424
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,354
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.

425
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:37,721
- Hurry.
- Come on!

426
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:42,320
- Run!
- It's all right. It is all right.

427
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:47,357
Get down!

428
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,475
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

429
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:52,233
- Are our guests comfortably settled in?
- Yes.

430
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,394
Good.

431
00:37:55,563 --> 00:38:00,432
- So tell me. How bad is it?
- Bad.

432
00:38:03,243 --> 00:38:05,711
Each hive ship acts like a carrier group,

433
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,876
with cruisers
and hundreds of darts escorting it.

434
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:13,479
Grodin's downloading the sensor readings
right now.

435
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:16,282
I have never witnessed a culling
that took so many.

436
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:19,401
We saved a few. That's worth something.

437
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,558
Rodney, are we ready
to send our message?

438
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,759
- When you are.
- OK.

439
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:37,156
Lieutenant Ford is recording personal
messages from all the team members.

440
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:40,121
- If you'd like...
- I'm good.

441
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,602
OK.

442
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:43,754
Along with a short note of my own,

443
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:47,154
I recorded messages
to the families of the people we've lost.

444
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:51,760
- That's a good idea.
- There's one I thought you'd like to do.

445
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,602
OK, whenever you're ready,
sir, go ahead.

446
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:06,518
I'm not sure
if Colonel Sumner's parents are still alive.

447
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:10,278
I'm not sure he even has a family
back there. Not all of us do.

448
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:14,152
But if he does have a family,
they should know

449
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:19,317
that he died with honour and courage
in the performance of his duty.

450
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:24,478
He carried the burden of a leader
and he carried it well.

451
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:31,921
I didn't get the chance to know him well,
but I know this.

452
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:37,314
Considering the type of man he was
and what we're up against,

453
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,678
yeah, I wish he was still here.

454
00:39:42,203 --> 00:39:45,832
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of you, Simon.

455
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:51,953
There's so much I want to tell you
and share with you, but I can't.

456
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:56,838
I know this is unfair.

457
00:39:57,003 --> 00:40:01,076
So much you don't know,
and putting your life on hold for me...

458
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,473
so don't.

459
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:10,839
All I ask is you take care of yourself,

460
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:15,838
and know that, wherever you are,
my heart is looking after you.

461
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,234
So take care of yourself, lots of sleep,

462
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:25,033
remember your daily walks
and keep up with your prescription.

463
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:27,000
Well, that's about it.

464
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,358
I'll say goodbye now...

465
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:33,999
and, Mum, I do love you.

466
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,836
Bye, Grandma, Grandpa. I miss you.

467
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:38,561
Goodbye, bro.

468
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:43,234
Goodbye.

469
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,359
Goodbye, Simon.

470
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,991
Goodbye.

471
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:58,762
We have unscheduled off-world activation.

472
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,312
Linking now.

473
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:05,915
Receiving transmission.

474
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,119
Who's it from?

475
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:15,196
Atlantis.
