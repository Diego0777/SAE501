1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,274
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:10,321
Major Sheppard,
who are all these people?

3
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,872
I am Teyla Emmagan,
Daughter of Tagan.

4
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:16,115
If the Wraith haven't touched your world,
you should go back.

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,875
We'd like to, but we can't.

6
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:21,274
I don't see a life form like this
dying of natural ageing.

7
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:26,153
You trespassed upon our feeding ground.
You don't know what you have done.

8
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:42,839
- It's Major Sheppard's IDC.
- They've only been gone a few hours.

9
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,393
<i>Atlantis, this is Sheppard</i>.
<i>We're coming in hot</i>.

10
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:49,714
Lower the shield.

11
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:15,238
Raise the shield.

12
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:17,871
McKay!

13
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,798
Medical team to the gate room!

14
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:27,431
I got a pulse.

15
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,920
How you feeling?

16
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,200
I can't feel anything. I can't talk.

17
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:47,241
- You can't talk either.
- That's what I said.

18
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:51,396
Your body experienced an overload
to its sensory and motor nervous system.

19
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,201
What?

20
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,196
You took one of those Wraith stunners
in the face.

21
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:58,160
It's quite fascinating, actually.

22
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:01,121
The Wraith weapon
impedes a fire of neurons...

23
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:05,401
- I'm paralysed?
- The paralysis is only temporary.

24
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,282
Don't worry.
You'll be up and about in no time.

25
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:12,721
Good thing that Wraith weapon is only
designed to incapacitate, or he'd be dead.

26
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,158
What?

27
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,678
Major, could I see you for a second?

28
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,879
Hello? Hello?

29
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,477
- He's gonna be fine.
- I've heard.

30
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:33,553
- I want to know what happened out there.
- The same old thing.

31
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:37,079
Which makes it the fifth time
your teams encountered the Wraith

32
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,757
out of how many missions?

33
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:44,439
Nine. So probably not a coincidence.

34
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:49,961
I think it's pretty damn obvious now.
We've got a spy in Atlantis.

35
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,679
Could you please not do that here?

36
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,073
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me.

37
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,598
At least your mouth still works fine.

38
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,554
All right, let's get started.

39
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:22,752
- Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?
- Teyla wasn't invited.

40
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,515
She's a member of my team.

41
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,594
- She's also an Athosian, sir.
- So?

42
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:29,800
If we've been compromised,
as indications suggest,

43
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,954
one of them is probably responsible.

44
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,114
We're talking about Teyla.

45
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,274
- I don't like it either...
- Good.

46
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,322
..but the safety of this base
and its personnel are my main concern.

47
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:43,236
As they should be yours.

48
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,362
The Wraith have shown up on five
of the nine planets your team has visited,

49
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:50,356
and given that
two of those worlds were unpopulated,

50
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:54,596
we can assume they have been alerted
to your missions by someone on this base.

51
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:57,835
If that is so,
then why hasn't Atlantis been attacked?

52
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:00,122
Good point.

53
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,081
Maybe we should stop
using the Stargate indefinitely.

54
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:04,756
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

55
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:08,359
- We need ZPMs to power this place.
- They seem to be running fine.

56
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:12,562
When the Wraith do show up, and
they will, how do we defend ourselves?

57
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,156
Or get back to Earth?

58
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,599
This is the only Stargate in the galaxy
that can reach Earth.

59
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:21,517
We'll have to use the self-destruct
before the Wraith take the city.

60
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:25,038
Bottom line, we need to use the gate.

61
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,717
We've got to find out
who's responsible ASAP.

62
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:32,434
We should confine all non-base personnel
to the south side of the complex.

63
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,833
- Are you kidding?
- That's the minimum.

64
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,642
- If Colonel Sumner was still...
- He's not.

65
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,560
- I am.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:46,875
We're not gonna start
treating anyone like prisoners.

67
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,556
Well, that's good.

68
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:54,992
But steps should be taken to safeguard
the more sensitive areas of this facility.

69
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,960
It's only reasonable.

70
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,762
No-go zones should start
with Stargate operations.

71
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:02,073
Labs, power generation
and the jumper bay.

72
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:04,996
I'd like to meet
with every Athosian on this base.

73
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:07,313
I only know a handful by name.

74
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,951
I'll set up interviews
when we're done here.

75
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:15,595
In the meantime, all gate travel
is suspended until further notice.

76
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:28,313
- Sorry, you can't come up.
- I'm on my way to see Dr Weir.

77
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:32,715
- That area's off limits.
- Since when?

78
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:37,761
I believe there's been a misunderstanding.

79
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,472
I was unaware a meeting had been called.

80
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:44,157
Let's take a walk.

81
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:50,482
- What is happening?
- There may be a security leak on Atlantis.

82
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,556
- Are you certain?
- Not certain certain, but pretty certain.

83
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:58,238
- We have to take temporary precautions.
- Such as?

84
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:01,873
Like suspending gate travel,
tightening security...

85
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,631
getting to know your people a little better.

86
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,713
You suspect an Athosian?

87
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:11,443
Dr Weir wants to meet them.
It's not personal.

88
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:14,800
It is in the sense that
she wants to meet them personally...

89
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:18,558
You know the horrors my people
have faced at the hands of the Wraith,

90
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,520
yet you question their loyalty?

91
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:24,961
Teyla, that's not fair. People are running
around Atlantis that she's never met.

92
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:28,638
I know each one of them.
I would stake my life on their innocence.

93
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:33,035
Perhaps you've noticed that
every time we step through the Stargate,

94
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,353
bad guys try to kill us.

95
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:39,311
- I'm getting tired of it. How about you?
- That does not mean...

96
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:45,001
Look, all we're asking for
is a little cooperation, that's all.

97
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,157
You shall have it.

98
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:58,235
Halling, how's Jinto?

99
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:03,114
Well enough for a boy
confined to his living quarters.

100
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:08,482
I'm sorry. It's temporary,
but it is a necessary precaution.

101
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:12,043
So I've heard.

102
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:15,559
Then I assume you know
why we've arranged these meetings?

103
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:19,602
The same reason my people cannot
go offworld or enter parts of the city.

104
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:24,791
- You no longer trust us.
- The truth... We don't know who to trust.

105
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,280
Information about offworld excursions
has obviously found its way to the Wraith.

106
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,641
- Obviously?
- They can't be lying in wait everywhere.

107
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:38,239
They are tracking our movements
and we need to find out how.

108
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,917
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

109
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:45,761
Then by all means.
How can I be of assistance?

110
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,242
Thank you.

111
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,792
You've been offworld three times?

112
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,717
I've been a guide for Sergeant
Stackhouse's reconnaissance team,

113
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:58,513
helping establish relations between your
people and our former trading partners.

114
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:02,517
Stackhouse reported he lost track of you
on a couple of these outings.

115
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,992
I did visit some close friends.

116
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:10,191
Interesting. Two of your visits predated
Wraith attacks by approximately a day.

117
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,831
- What are you suggesting?
- Nothing.

118
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:16,473
You think I would betray my own people?
Jeopardise my son's life?

119
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,840
- No one is making accusations.
- I disagree.

120
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,563
You have concluded
an Athosian is responsible.

121
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:25,601
Because it can't possibly
be one of our own people.

122
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:27,913
No?

123
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,358
We just need to clarify a few things.

124
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:35,994
Then allow me.

125
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:40,441
I lost my closest friend in the Wraith attack
that forced us from our home world.

126
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:44,920
Selana, the woman you just spoke to,
lost both her parents.

127
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,278
You'd be hard pressed to find an Athosian

128
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:51,356
who has not experienced loss
at the hands of the Wraith.

129
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,519
These are the people you accuse.

130
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,074
We are not accusing anyone.

131
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:01,632
I came here expecting an interview.

132
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:08,914
Not an interrogation.

133
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:24,121
- I don't think it's too much to ask.
- What is it?

134
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,200
- Buck up. I'm trying to run a diagnostic.
- Sorry.

135
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:36,322
We are stranded
with limited resources in another galaxy.

136
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:39,555
The nearest Bob's Big Boy
is 300 million light years away.

137
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,999
If you have to eat my favourite food
twice in a row, so be it.

138
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,872
- You enjoy military rations?
- I know, it's weird. Hospital food, too.

139
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:50,399
I don't like airplane food
because you can't get seconds...

140
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,155
Hello.

141
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:56,236
- What is it?
- A new command subroutine.

142
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,320
What is its function?

143
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:02,793
I don't know
because I've never seen it before.

144
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:06,512
I'm gonna cross-reference this
with the Ancient database.

145
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:09,243
I'm gonna grab the...

146
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,200
- What did you touch?
- Nothing.

147
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,002
No, I...

148
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:38,956
- I had no idea the roof could do that.
- Neither did I.

149
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,597
The gate room has been closed to us.

150
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:50,278
We no longer have access
to the medical facility without escort.

151
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,196
We're under constant surveillance.

152
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:57,276
- How long must we put up with this?
- It's already been too long.

153
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,593
I'd have expected
to be included in this.

154
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,482
As we would have expected you
to take a stand for us.

155
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,477
They will protect everyone on this base.
That includes all of you.

156
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,282
A Wraith collaborator threatens us all.

157
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:18,437
- You support the decision to confine us?
- Halling, we are their guests.

158
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:24,075
We're more like their prisoners, but
unlike prisoners we can choose to leave.

159
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,758
- Where would you go?
- Do you not mean, where would <i>we</i> go?

160
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,797
Our friends in other worlds
would take us in.

161
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:36,842
For how long? Good trading partners
do not necessarily make good hosts.

162
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:40,040
- There are many worlds.
- No world is safe.

163
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:44,196
Nor is it safe to remain. They will
continue until they find someone to blame.

164
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,002
You know none of our people
could be responsible.

165
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:51,076
- Of course.
- Then we have nothing to fear.

166
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:57,393
- You trust Dr Weir that much?
- I do.

167
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,952
- More than you trust your own people?
- No.

168
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,956
I understand her responsibility.

169
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:09,153
Halling, we have met with the Wraith
offworld so often and so quickly,

170
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,201
there must be a reason
beyond coincidence.

171
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,877
Give them a chance to find it.

172
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:28,031
I do not approve
of some of their measures,

173
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:32,116
but I do know that in the end
they will help to prove our innocence.

174
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:35,355
Atlantis is far more than shelter. It is hope.

175
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,152
Not only for us, but for everyone
who would stand against the Wraith.

176
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:43,437
We must not abandon that hope.

177
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,914
They may reside here, Teyla,

178
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,074
but they are not the Ancestors,

179
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,803
no matter how much
you wish them to be.

180
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,717
- Sir?
- Ford.

181
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,192
They got the sunroof open
on the jumper bay.

182
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,923
- Yep.
- You're planning to take a jumper out.

183
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,722
I figure that's what
the door on the roof is for.

184
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,113
Anyone else call shotgun?

185
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,036
Just gonna drive around the planet,
check it out.

186
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:18,878
You're just checking out the planet?
Never mind. That's cool.

187
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:24,197
I got better things to do than
cruise around the planet in a spaceship.

188
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,036
- You're like a kid, you know that?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,763
- I brought something to eat on the ride.
- What?

190
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:32,153
How about a nice turkey sandwich?

191
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,994
Let's go.

192
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,873
Send in whoever's next, please.

193
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:53,755
Teyla. I wasn't expecting you.

194
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:56,960
I was surprised to be left off your list.

195
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:00,115
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case.

196
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:05,238
On the contrary.
You should have spoken to me first.

197
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,274
You're right. I should have.

198
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,674
I can tell you anything
you need to know about my people.

199
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:19,994
Is it possible you don't know them all
as well as you think?

200
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,360
I empathise with you, Dr Weir.

201
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:28,435
As leaders, we often
have to make difficult decisions

202
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,434
in the interests of those we serve,

203
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:34,642
but many of my fellow Athosians
are not so understanding.

204
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:38,318
I know. But there's nothing
I can do about that now.

205
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:41,953
People can suspect my motives
for these meetings all they want.

206
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:44,637
You and I need to agree
that we have a problem.

207
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,034
I have to do what I can to solve it,

208
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:51,559
and right now that means
talking with every single person here.

209
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:54,840
You should know
there is talk of leaving Atlantis.

210
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,279
I hope it doesn't come to that.

211
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:10,158
Not all change is for the worse.

212
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:28,117
This is Jumper Three.
We are go for bay launch.

213
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,432
<i>Jumper Three, you are good to go</i>.

214
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,400
Yes, we are.

215
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,034
It's strange not pulling any Gs.

216
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,592
Yeah. Kinda miss it.

217
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,835
Although at this rate of acceleration,
we'd be dead by now.

218
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,402
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

219
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:01,715
Without inertial dampening, we'd be hit
by so many Gs our eyes would pop,

220
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:05,842
skin would come off our faces,
our brains would hit the back of our skulls

221
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,996
and our internal organs
would be crushed into these chairs.

222
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,471
What about that sandwich?

223
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:21,831
We're orbiting the planet. We'll advise
when we're back in radio range.

224
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,801
<i>Copy that, Jumper Three. Good luck</i>.

225
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:29,195
- We still haven't named the planet.
- I'm sure the Ancients have a name for it.

226
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:32,560
How about Atlantica,
something like that?

227
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:36,033
Didn't we agree you weren't
gonna name anything any more?

228
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,514
Sir...

229
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:45,112
Is that... land?

230
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,440
Yes, it is.

231
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,322
I wonder how big it is.

232
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,997
- Big.
- Really big.

233
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:58,233
- It's huge.
- Define huge.

234
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:03,033
15 million square miles. Well, give or take.

235
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:07,594
That would make it the size of...
I have no idea, but it sounds huge...

236
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:11,392
- How long would it take us to get there?
- 25 minutes by jumper.

237
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,918
I saw some sweet breakers
on the south tip.

238
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,960
There may be surfing in our future.

239
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,432
We should get soil and water samples.

240
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:21,640
Arable land could solve
our food-production problems.

241
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:24,476
- I was thinking of something else.
- Not surfing?

242
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:28,795
No. We can't resume offworld missions
while the Athosians remain in the city.

243
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:30,840
You want to dump them
on the mainland?

244
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,995
- We're not sending them to die.
- How would you know?

245
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,631
- It looked wild.
- Just now we were going surfing.

246
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:42,673
That was after we check for monsters
and bugs and other space-related things.

247
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:45,311
I can't imagine it's worse than their home.

248
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,201
That may be failure of imagination.

249
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:50,161
A survey would tell us
what we need to know.

250
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:56,157
You're not seriously thinking about this?

251
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,402
We're the reason
they had to leave their planet.

252
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:04,355
- This is a complicated situation.
- What does that mean?

253
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:09,074
It means I'm not about to rule anything out
at this point.

254
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:21,759
Dr Weir. Is it true
you've discovered land on this world?

255
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:24,153
Yes, it is.

256
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:29,795
- My people wish to explore it.
- You would?

257
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,238
- We're not welcome here.
- That's not true.

258
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:35,918
It will make us useful as long as
we have no access to the gate.

259
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,359
- We don't even know if it's safe.
- We can determine that...

260
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,074
for both our people.

261
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:46,433
Up until now you've been insisting
on access to the Stargate.

262
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,356
Now you're proposing
to cut yourself off from it?

263
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,878
We cannot leave... and we cannot stay.

264
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,112
- The mainland gives us a third option.
- I see.

265
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,717
- You said this was a temporary measure.
- Yes.

266
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:06,195
You have the means to assure us passage
between Atlantis and the mainland

267
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:08,923
when you decide
to resume use of the gate.

268
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,517
If we resume our missions
through the Stargate

269
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,800
and stop encountering
the Wraith at every turn,

270
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,397
it will prove
that there is an Athosian spy.

271
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,476
And when you continue to encounter
the Wraith at every turn,

272
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:24,032
it will only prove our innocence.

273
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,876
Have you discussed this with Teyla?

274
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,797
Teyla has made her decision.

275
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:03,552
I understand you're not coming with us.

276
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:21,237
Dr Weir has arranged for communications
between Atlantis and the mainland.

277
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:23,234
Should you ever need assistance...

278
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:25,394
Thank her for us.

279
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,519
I hope...
I don't want anyone to believe that I'm...

280
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,674
Teyla.

281
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,919
The time has come.

282
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:59,154
Go safely.

283
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:02,154
And you.

284
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:25,833
I've never been separated
from my people before.

285
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:29,234
It must be hard,
but you know you'll see them again.

286
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,631
Do you doubt
you will one day return to Earth?

287
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,873
I can't afford to have doubts.

288
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,642
You mean you cannot afford
to let them show.

289
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,760
You're still a leader, Teyla.

290
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:49,996
You're doing this
for your people and for their future.

291
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,074
They know that.

292
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:13,359
Anxious to step through the gate again?

293
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,320
- Yes, I am.
- We all are.

294
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,758
- Like us to bring back anything?
- No.

295
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:23,714
- Groceries? A new outfit?
- No, just yourselves in one piece, please.

296
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:26,033
Dial it up.

297
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,194
Be safe.

298
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,880
Well, good stuff?

299
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:56,603
I can't begin to tell you
how fascinating this is.

300
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:59,323
Anthropologist fascinating
or actual fascinating?

301
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:01,553
Maybe fascinating isn't the right word.

302
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:03,520
Maybe not. How much longer?

303
00:24:04,203 --> 00:24:07,798
We'll probably need to come back.
There's just so much here.

304
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:11,035
I can see that.
Is there any way to speed things up?

305
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:14,240
Sure. Find me someone
to translate some of the runes.

306
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:18,715
- Did you say there were natives here?
- They are very shy.

307
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:21,272
They've probably gone into hiding.

308
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,355
Can you coax them out,
have them give us a hand?

309
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:26,957
It is unlikely, but I could try.

310
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:29,762
Lieutenant, go with her.

311
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:35,475
- It would be better if I went alone.
- You will be alone. With Ford.

312
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:09,474
Maybe they're not around.

313
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:15,955
They are near,
but you are a stranger to them.

314
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:18,637
They will not come out if you are with me.

315
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:24,122
They are not a dangerous people,
Lieutenant. I will be fine.

316
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,393
All right. I'll wait here.

317
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:39,917
Call me on the radio if you need me.

318
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:04,754
Wraith! Get back to the gate now!

319
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,880
Teyla!

320
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,681
Major, what's the situation?

321
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:30,712
We're taking fire. You'll have to
circle around to get back to the gate.

322
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:34,000
- Teyla's not with me. She went to...
- Find her. Get back.

323
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,674
Move out!

324
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,393
Argh!

325
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:04,352
Yamato! McKay! Grab the major.

326
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:08,641
- What about Teyla and Ford?
- Now!

327
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,681
Shut it down.
They're right behind us.

328
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:29,914
OK. On three. One, two, three.

329
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:35,952
- We have to go back.
- Teyla? Lieutenant Ford?

330
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:38,921
- Still there.
- You have Wraith all over the gate.

331
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,960
We can't just leave them there.

332
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,796
- How many?
- It's hard to say.

333
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:49,954
We need to mount a rescue operation.

334
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:54,036
I am not gonna send anyone
through that gate until I have all the facts.

335
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,558
How did Teyla and Ford get separated?

336
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:59,078
They went to make contact
with the natives.

337
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:04,271
- And whose idea was that?
- Mine. She was following my orders.

338
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:09,563
- Shouldn't you be back in the infirmary?
- No, I'm fine. I didn't take a full blast.

339
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:14,399
- Why didn't you go with them, Major?
- The natives are easily spooked.

340
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,713
Teyla thought we'd scare 'em off.

341
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:19,317
- Teyla did.
- What's that, Sergeant?

342
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:21,713
She was absent during the ambush.

343
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:25,239
- So was Ford. Maybe it was him.
- I'm just stating a fact.

344
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,713
Sergeant, I am only
gonna say this once.

345
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:31,522
With all due respect,
reprimand me if you wish,

346
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:34,595
but it's been six times
your team's been compromised.

347
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:38,153
Only one Athosian
knew about this last mission.

348
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:43,434
Unscheduled offworld activation.

349
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:47,833
It's Teyla's IDC.
Receiving a radio transmission.

350
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:50,801
<i>This is Teyla</i>.
<i>Lieutenant Ford has been wounded</i>.

351
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:53,318
<i>The Wraith are closing in on our position</i>.

352
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,555
Put down that shield
and we could have a Wraith attack.

353
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:59,112
<i>Atlantis, please let us through</i>.

354
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,598
Lieutenant, can you confirm the situation?

355
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:13,323
<i>He is unconscious</i>.
<i>Our situation grows desperate</i>.

356
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:16,043
<i>We have no choice</i>
<i>but to go through the Stargate</i>.

357
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:19,081
Who knows what
she'll bring through that gate with her.

358
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:24,680
Open up the damn gate!

359
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:35,315
Lower the shield.

360
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:56,799
If she were helping the Wraith,
why bother bringing Ford back?

361
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,079
In fact, why bother coming back at all?

362
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:03,236
She's of more use to them in Atlantis.
As for apparently rescuing Ford...

363
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,917
She carried him through the damn gate!

364
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,234
- We still don't know what happened.
- Oh, that's enough.

365
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:12,600
- It's my job to express concerns.
- I've heard enough.

366
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,880
I believe you're putting
your personal feelings...

367
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,999
You're dismissed.

368
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:27,233
Yes, sir.

369
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:47,482
- What?
- I put him in charge of security.

370
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:52,353
Yes, you did, and if you want
to dismiss me, go ahead.

371
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,553
Why don't you go and see
how Lieutenant Ford is doing?

372
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,559
You want me to go through her stuff?

373
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:25,799
We're looking for weapons,
transmitters, recording devices.

374
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:28,921
Anything beyond
the Athosians' level of technology.

375
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,358
And then we move on to a strip search?

376
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,553
Just do it.

377
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:46,118
We were on our way back when
we came under fire. Didn't even see them.

378
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:49,639
We returned fire then broke for the gate.
I was hit from behind.

379
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:52,078
- She saved my ass.
- Of course she did.

380
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,440
Major... Ford, how are you feeling?
Pins and needles all over?

381
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:56,922
Welcome to the club.

382
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,120
No, I managed to dive out of the way
of the stunner blast.

383
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,843
- I hit my head on the way down.
- Hit your head?

384
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:05,198
Major, I need you to see something.

385
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:09,839
I'll be fine.

386
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:22,553
- What the hell is this?
- It was a request from Sergeant Bates.

387
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:25,681
I'm gonna bust him.
Teyla has nothing to do with this.

388
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,720
The thing is, he was right.

389
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:33,752
- Bates was right?
- I was as surprised as you are. Look.

390
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:40,713
It's her locket. It's a transmitter.
It's been broadcasting a signal.

391
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:44,000
- I wouldn't even have noticed...
- I found it.

392
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,836
- What?
- Back on her planet the first time we met.

393
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:51,793
Teyla took me to the old ruins.
That was half-buried in dirt. I gave it to her.

394
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,722
I lost this years ago.

395
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:02,035
The locket isn't powerful enough
to send a signal far through subspace.

396
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:05,036
My guess is there are relay devices
on certain planets

397
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:07,922
that pick up the transmission
and alert a hive ship.

398
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,758
- The planets where we were attacked.
- We owe a few people an apology.

399
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:15,875
Teyla had no idea
she was giving away your position?

400
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:19,399
It was a present from her father.
She lost it when she was a kid.

401
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:22,282
It was dormant
until Major Sheppard picked it up.

402
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:24,877
How come they weren't attacked
back then?

403
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:28,160
- I said it was dormant.
- But if it was activated by touch?

404
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:31,554
You're not listening.
I said Major Sheppard activated it.

405
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:35,079
To the Wraith,
Teyla is just another human being.

406
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,916
They have no interest in her.
Now, Major Sheppard...

407
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,472
- Has the Ancient gene.
- Exactly.

408
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,441
At one point the Wraiths
and the Ancients were at war.

409
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,958
The Wraiths made a device
to detect Ancients.

410
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:49,911
Some Athosian thought
this would make a nice little necklace?

411
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:53,041
How could I know that?
What am I, Answer Man?

412
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:56,752
It wasn't Teyla.
Or any other Athosian, for that matter.

413
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,312
If that's the case...

414
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:03,992
we can use it against 'em.

415
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,998
- You seem nervous.
- No, I'm doing this.

416
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:16,882
Yes, you are.
I just said you seemed nervous.

417
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:19,682
I thought you said,
"You don't have to do this."

418
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:24,155
I'm doing this, despite the fact that feeling
hasn't returned to my extremities.

419
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:31,756
- You're late.
- Sorry.

420
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:35,836
Now, given the Wraiths'
regenerative abilities,

421
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:38,278
killing one
requires some amount of effort.

422
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,399
Capturing one live is another deal.

423
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:43,760
For these options to work,
your Wraith must be on the ground.

424
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:48,792
The ruins around the Stargate should
force the Wraith to come through on foot.

425
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,672
In which case...
you'll be able to use these.

426
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:57,402
This is a stun grenade.

427
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,679
It contains aluminium
and potassium perchlorate

428
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,403
that, when ignited,
produces a high-pressure wave

429
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:06,078
that will overwhelm the target
with intense light and sound.

430
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:12,077
If that doesn't get his head ringing,
in addition... you've got your taser.

431
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,153
<i>With a range of 15 to 20 feet,</i>

432
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,234
<i>it delivers a high-voltage charge</i>

433
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:22,397
<i>that limits the body's electrical signals,</i>
<i>temporarily paralysing the victim</i>.

434
00:35:22,563 --> 00:35:24,554
<i>Major, this is Ford</i>.

435
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:27,476
What you got, Lieutenant?

436
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:31,837
We got company.

437
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:34,482
Four of them.

438
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:42,840
- All right, then. We go as planned.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:53,719
- You still seem nervous...
- No, no. It's good. All good.

440
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:19,922
Teyla.

441
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:00,123
This one's ours, boys. Tasers!

442
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:39,834
Self-destruct. Take cover!

443
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:52,999
Major! Dr McKay!

444
00:37:57,923 --> 00:38:01,996
- You OK?
- I'm fine. This is... This is fun for me.

445
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,880
Easy. Don't go blowing yourself up.

446
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:43,038
Teyla. Excuse me.

447
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:46,320
I hoped to catch you
before you headed back to the mainland.

448
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,553
- I hear they're doing well.
- Very well.

449
00:38:48,723 --> 00:38:51,715
Halling says they're planting crops
for the next harvest.

450
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:55,478
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I will tell them what has happened.

451
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:59,113
Hopefully we will be able
to put the past week's events behind us.

452
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:04,960
Yes. I am aware that the last few days
have been particularly difficult for you.

453
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:10,880
I believe, Dr Weir, that in your place
I would have done the same.

454
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,478
Thank you.

455
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:48,557
Again? Your kind is persistent.

456
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:51,191
I would have thought
you'd given up by now.

457
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:57,836
Hell, I've got all the time in the world.
Now, you, on the other hand...

458
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,961
The Ancients were pretty good at shields,
weren't they?

459
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:10,200
I give you a week. Maybe two, tops.

460
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:15,312
You waste your time.
I will provide you with no information.

461
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:18,839
I wonder what hurts more:
the gunshot wound or the hunger?

462
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:22,791
Because I'd love to help out,
but how did McKay put it?

463
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:28,040
We can't meet your dietary requirements.

464
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:35,277
When I am free,
you will be the first that I feed upon.

465
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,434
Okey-dokey.

466
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:40,720
I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich.

467
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:43,716
Human.

468
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:48,800
You think you've won a victory
by my capture,

469
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:53,514
but by bringing me here
you've only hastened your own doom.

470
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:58,882
It's only a matter of time before
the others of my kind come to rescue me,

471
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:05,560
and when they do, there'll be
nowhere in this world you can hide.

472
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,513
Stay positive, now.

473
