1
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,873
7,549.

2
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:11,752
Oh, please. Prime. 4,021.

3
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:13,959
Nice try. Not prime.

4
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:16,637
Lieutenant Ford, 599.

5
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:19,875
- I don't care if it's a prime number or not.
- Yes or no?

6
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:22,682
- No.
- It's incredible. 10 for 10.

7
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:25,232
- He is terrible.
- I suck at Prime, Not Prime.

8
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:29,362
- Somehow I'm gonna sleep tonight.
- It's gone way beyond prime numbers.

9
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:33,721
It's a true/false game. Just by guessing,
you should get at least half right.

10
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:35,680
993.

11
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:37,640
- Prime.
- That's an easy one.

12
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:41,079
- You hearing this, Hays?
- Not really. Too busy doing my job.

13
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:45,475
We've been through this section of
Atlantis, Dr Killjoy. It's structurally sound.

14
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,111
Lieutenant Ford,
would you mind being a subject

15
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,956
of research paper
on statistical improbabilities?

16
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:55,753
This is payback for guys like me beating
up guys like you in high school, right?

17
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:08,157
<i>What's it like</i>
<i>out in the suburbs?</i>

18
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,359
With the exception
of the storage room,

19
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,879
which the lovely Dumais informs me
is in no immediate danger,

20
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:16,034
it appears in relatively good shape.

21
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:19,957
- Even after all the flooding?
- It's dark, damp and smells terrible.

22
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,512
But from an engineering standpoint,
we're good.

23
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,072
- Head back.
- Heading back.

24
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:29,395
All right, you clowns. I don't often get
a chance to say this, so savour it.

25
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:32,475
Good work, boys and girls. Let's go home.

26
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:36,158
Wait, wait, wait.
We're missing Johnson and Wagner.

27
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:39,918
Wagner, Johnson, what's your position?

28
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,278
<i>We need backup! They're coming at us!</i>

29
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:47,399
- What?
- Where are they?

30
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:49,633
- Down this corridor.
- We're on our way!

31
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:00,991
Johnson. Johnson, you OK?

32
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:05,796
McKay. He's dead.

33
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:08,352
- Johnson, what happened here?
- They got him.

34
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,832
Who got him?

35
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,520
Calm down. There's nothing here.

36
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:20,676
- Can't you see them? They're everywhere!
- I need a medical team here stat!

37
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,157
Ah! Aagh!

38
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,477
It's no use. She's gone.

39
00:03:57,163 --> 00:04:00,280
This is Dr Beckett.
What is the nature of the emergency?

40
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:04,232
It's too late. They're gone.

41
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:07,395
- Who's gone? How?
- Wagner and Johnson.

42
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,918
- <i>I need a containment team</i>.
- I'm sorry?

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,678
- A containment team? Why?
- People don't see things and drop dead.

44
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:18,234
We've been surveying unexplored areas.
I think they were exposed to something.

45
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:22,635
If they were infected, there's
a very good chance that we were too.

46
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:26,716
- I recommend level-four quarantine.
- Agreed. Carson, you hear all that?

47
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,795
We'll get into our hazmat gear
and head down. Sit tight.

48
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:32,431
- I'll make sure Dr Weir's briefed.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

49
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,242
You heard the man. Follow me.

50
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,439
We're just gonna stay here?

51
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,876
- That's the plan.
- May I say it's a terrible one?

52
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:44,001
- No, you may not.
- We should get the hell outta here.

53
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:46,233
If it is airborne, we may be infected.

54
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,554
Heading back would only endanger
the rest of the population.

55
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,078
- What if we're not?
- There's no way to know.

56
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:55,519
- But I feel perfectly fine!
- End of discussion.

57
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:58,072
Peterson, we're staying here.

58
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,357
Actually, wait a second.

59
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,991
Everyone follow me.

60
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,996
They've begun to institute
a level-four quarantine.

61
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,916
It can't really be
a biological infection, can it?

62
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,392
I have no idea what it is.

63
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:28,273
But we should play it safe and initiate
self-regulated quarantine in the city.

64
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:31,958
- That's pretty severe.
- The Ancients suffered from a plague.

65
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,160
If McKay's team have stumbled upon it
and become infected,

66
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:38,360
we need to take every precaution
to prevent an outbreak.

67
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:42,994
We will suspend any and all gate activity
and keep everyone where they are,

68
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:48,442
just until we have a clearer picture of
exactly what killed Wagner and Johnson.

69
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:24,161
Agh!

70
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:30,118
- You have not been practising.
- Yes, I have.

71
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:34,674
- If this was really a fight...
- I would have shot you by now.

72
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:43,835
No matter how many hours I put into this,
you're still gonna kick my ass.

73
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,918
It is not for the winning that we practise.

74
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,278
What's the point?

75
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:53,036
<i>May I have everyone's attention?</i>

76
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,763
<i>We have run into</i>
<i>a questionable medical situation</i>.

77
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,561
<i>At Dr Beckett's suggestion,</i>

78
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:01,602
<i>we have decided to put the city</i>
<i>into a self-regulated quarantine</i>.

79
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:06,796
For at least the next couple of hours,
I need everyone to stay where they are

80
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:10,672
<i>and report anyone</i>
<i>moving freely through the halls</i>.

81
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:13,232
I hope you'll understand. Thank you.

82
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,763
What the hell is this?

83
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:21,594
Did you bring your radio?

84
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,151
This is the section
Wagner and Johnson explored?

85
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,473
- Yes.
- So we're retracing their steps?

86
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:30,555
My motivations are based
on self-preservation.

87
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:35,319
Wait, wait. Ford's right. Doesn't this
increase our chances of getting infected?

88
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,951
Let me spell this out for you, OK?

89
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:41,274
If there is a bacterial agent
and it is not airborne,

90
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:45,231
it should be safe for us to look around
as long as we take precautions.

91
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:48,520
However, if it is an airborne agent,

92
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,243
there's a good chance
we've already been infected.

93
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,394
Shouldn't we wait for Dr Beckett?

94
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:55,679
Those men were only there
for 12 hours.

95
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,960
That's an alarmingly short
incubation period.

96
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:01,842
If anyone else is infected, as in maybe us,

97
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:05,075
seconds are gonna count, Lieutenant.

98
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,121
All right, light. Let's go.

99
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,163
Everybody stay here. Ford.

100
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,677
- You just told...
- Everybody except Ford.

101
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:30,880
You think I'm going in there by myself?
Uh-uh.

102
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:48,354
Don't touch anything.

103
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,360
This is not good.

104
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,798
- I'm ranking military officer here.
- <i>I'm aware of that</i>.

105
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,477
You were off radio
and we had to act quickly.

106
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:17,841
This is all protocol put into place
long before this expedition even began.

107
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,881
Bates and I agreed
this was the best plan of action.

108
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,001
All right. Teyla and I
are coming up to join you.

109
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,314
We are in quarantine.
Everyone stays where they are.

110
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,758
We're nearly a mile away on the east pier.

111
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:33,359
Do you really think I'm in any danger
walking to the control room?

112
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>where they contracted the virus</i>.

113
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,080
<i>This is a medical situation</i>.

114
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,076
Only authorised personnel
in hazmat suits roam freely.

115
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,757
Those rules apply to everyone,
including you.

116
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:48,155
Well, then, get someone
to bring me a hazmat suit.

117
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:52,282
Everyone in hazmat is configuring
the lab to deal with a possible outbreak.

118
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:55,674
If an opportunity arises,
I will send someone to come get you.

119
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:59,119
In the meantime,
radio contact will have to do.

120
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:03,879
All right. Just... keep us in the loop.

121
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:06,034
<i>Will do</i>.

122
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:12,275
Any of these open containers could have
released the virus that killed them.

123
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:14,638
How would it survive for all these years?

124
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:17,112
Viruses can remain dormant
for long periods.

125
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,116
I'm hoping the answer
will be found in the database.

126
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,274
- OK, I think that...
- Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:25,719
It's not networked in
with the rest of the Ancient systems.

128
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:30,911
It only contains information about the
experiments that took place in this room.

129
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,313
- Weir, it's McKay.
- Go ahead, Rodney.

130
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:37,396
- Where's Beckett?
- It takes time to load a team into suits.

131
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:40,680
We've stumbled across
something... a little troubling.

132
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,834
That's not what I wanted to hear.

133
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,073
We may have found an Ancient viral lab

134
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,234
where Wagner and Johnson
were exposed.

135
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:51,396
There's no way of knowing whether the
Ancients were just studying the viruses

136
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,633
or actively creating them.

137
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:57,000
The storm's done quite a number
on this place and I've got...

138
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,596
Dumais. Dumais?

139
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,354
- Dumais!
- What the hell are you?

140
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,195
Dumais! Dumais!

141
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:32,602
Tell Beckett to pick up the pace!
I've just lost another member of my team.

142
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:34,833
- Where's Peterson?
- What?

143
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:36,322
Peterson!

144
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,321
I think we have him.
He's trying to make his way back.

145
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,874
Grodin is locking all the doors in the
hallway and killing power to the section.

146
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,398
You need to send someone to stop him.

147
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:58,635
- <i>It's under control</i>.
- No, it's not under control.

148
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,636
<i>He knows as much</i>
<i>about Ancient technology as I do</i>.

149
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:05,193
At the very most, what you're doing
will just slow him down.

150
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,918
- Where does that hallway lead?
- Straight here.

151
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:34,479
<i>Peterson, this is Elizabeth Weir</i>.
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

152
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:38,679
I can't imagine how frightening
this whole ordeal must be,

153
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:43,837
but Dr Beckett has reached the rest
of your team and begun to treat them.

154
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,801
<i>I think the best thing for you to do</i>
<i>is to head back</i>.

155
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:50,797
<i>If Beckett gives you a clean bill of health,</i>
<i>you can get back to the city</i>.

156
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,357
- Are you sure he can hear me?
- Positive.

157
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:03,198
Can you do anything to make it harder
to get through those doors?

158
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,354
I can try.

159
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:23,039
- You seem perfectly fine.
- Dumais seemed fine, until she wasn't.

160
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,671
I've had them set up a small field station.

161
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:28,118
- We've started the autopsies.
- Any ideas?

162
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:31,992
- You're all in good shape.
- Stop trying to convince me I'm fine.

163
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,961
I think we all know better.
Are we done here?

164
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,516
- Yes.
- I'll see what I can get from the database.

165
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,992
Let me know what the autopsy shows up.

166
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:44,872
Oh, and tell your pathologist
to start with their heads.

167
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:17,719
- Someone has to do something.
- We are doing something.

168
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:20,113
- Grodin's working...
- <i>Not good enough</i>.

169
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:23,719
Someone has to go out there
and stop him. Teyla and I are ready.

170
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:28,001
Peterson isn't thinking straight and
he's endangering the entire population.

171
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:32,475
We don't yet know the nature of the virus.
This is still a medical situation.

172
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:35,476
- We don't have time. I'm heading out.
- Seal the gym.

173
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:44,792
- What the hell is this?
- You are the ranking military officer.

174
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:49,241
- I can't chance you getting infected.
- I can't chance you getting infected. Bates.

175
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,633
- Yes, sir?
- Unlock the gym.

176
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,554
- Yes, sir.
- Stand down, Bates.

177
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:58,762
- You are not in command here, Major.
- <i>We'll agree to disagree</i>.

178
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:00,641
Bates, open the door.

179
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,672
- Don't.
- <i>He's heading right for you</i>.

180
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:08,119
So we'll stop him.
We'll talk him down, block his way.

181
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:12,993
Bates, I am ordering you to open the doors
between the gym and the med lab now.

182
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,794
We're heading out.

183
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,112
I'm sorry, ma'am.

184
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,439
It doesn't really matter now, does it?

185
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:52,835
Dr Beckett, I have the preliminary
autopsy results on the first two victims, sir.

186
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:56,962
- <i>Anything of interest?</i>
- They both died of a brain aneurysm.

187
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,478
In itself, it isn't all that remarkable.

188
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:04,512
<i>The chances of two people next to each</i>
<i>other dying of it is statistically improbable,</i>

189
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,595
but it's not the smoking gun
we were hoping for.

190
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:10,800
- <i>You said</i>...
- Get to the good part, Dr Biro.

191
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:15,275
What is truly interesting is both ruptures
happened in exactly the same place,

192
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,559
right above the visual cortex.

193
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,714
<i>And the third one</i> - <i>Dumais?</i>

194
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:22,681
Just getting to her now, sir.
I'll let you know.

195
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:25,277
- She did say brain aneurysm?
- That's right.

196
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,401
Best news I've heard all day.
Let me show you something.

197
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:37,471
You should not have undermined
Dr Weir's authority in front of Bates.

198
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:42,319
Sometimes Elizabeth makes a decision
and gets locked into it. That's a problem.

199
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:47,196
She is not the only one
who suffers from that affliction.

200
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:53,636
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard.
Teyla and I are ready to head out.

201
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,794
<i>What's Peterson's location?</i>

202
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:03,482
Elizabeth.

203
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:07,877
He's in section E19, level three.

204
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,714
Let's go.

205
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:58,000
I haven't read the entire entry,
but it looks like our guy.

206
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:02,600
Six-hour hibernation, reoccurring visions,
and best of all, so I left it till last,

207
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,560
brain haemorrhage or aneurysm.

208
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:06,554
That definitely sounds familiar.

209
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,998
Maybe there's something here
about how to...

210
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,558
No!

211
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:22,801
Sorry.

212
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,242
Rodney?

213
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,037
I've been seeing things.

214
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,194
Since when?

215
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:40,791
About an hour. First, you think
it's just your eyes playing tricks...

216
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:43,193
They get worse.

217
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:46,272
You too?

218
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,240
They come right at you.

219
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,239
- It's like a ghost.
- I've been over the survey schedule.

220
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:57,042
Johnson and Wagner
started off on their own

221
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,512
but crossed paths with Dumais
an hour later.

222
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,951
Dumais died almost exactly
an hour after Johnson and Wagner.

223
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:09,116
- Who did they meet up with next?
- My greater concern is who Dumais met.

224
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,478
Dumais? Who'd she run into?

225
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,635
Me.

226
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:25,840
She ran into Hays and me.

227
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:30,354
We're next.

228
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,961
- Dr Peterson, I presume.
- I'm not going back there.

229
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:47,717
You don't have much of a choice.

230
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:51,274
Easy.

231
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,631
I go back there,
I get infected, that's murder.

232
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,318
Once we ensure you are not infected,
you can go back into the city.

233
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:02,362
Until then, you are a threat
to the rest of the population.

234
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:08,078
- You won't shoot one of your own team.
- You will not be allowed back to the city.

235
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,803
Just wait a second!
Take me back to the med lab.

236
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,523
Quarantine me there. I'll go voluntarily.

237
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:16,038
Just please don't make me go back there.

238
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:23,161
Really, I'm fine. I feel perfectly fine.

239
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:28,757
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard. Peterson
has agreed to go back to the med lab

240
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,517
until we can get this situation resolved.

241
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,878
Stop!

242
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:47,080
Oh, my God. Is he all right?

243
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:49,234
He's been shot.

244
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,634
- What's going on?
- Ancient controls are unresponsive.

245
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:17,476
Peterson transported into the mess hall.

246
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:22,194
- For some reason we can't follow him.
- The city has put us into a lockdown.

247
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,479
- Override it.
- I can't.

248
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:27,521
Atlantis must be designed
to respond to outbreaks.

249
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:30,880
It locked down when Peterson
transported out of the east side.

250
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,477
Why not when Johnson and Wagner
were infected?

251
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:37,716
The detection systems might have been
affected by the flooding in those areas.

252
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:42,081
Once Peterson entered the mess hall,
the pathogen was instantly detected

253
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:44,632
and the city protected itself.

254
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:49,236
- What are my options?
- Limited.

255
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:53,316
As of now, we're completely
locked out of the mainframe.

256
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:05,481
I am about to die of a brain aneurysm.
How does a heart monitor help?

257
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,952
If you die, we'll have a better idea of how.

258
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:12,321
- At that point, I will cease to care.
- A lot of other people live in the city.

259
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,519
Yes, the living.

260
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:24,717
I thought we were in a lockdown.
Why did that open up for us?

261
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:31,559
Weir, this is Sheppard. Are you able
to get the transporters online?

262
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:35,716
Doesn't look promising. Atlantis itself
seems to have sensed a threat

263
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:37,919
and taken over most of the controls.

264
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,881
- So it's shut down the transporters?
- <i>That's right</i>.

265
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:45,321
- I wish we would have thought of that.
- We did think of that, Major!

266
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:49,192
That entire section had to be powered up
to open the door to Peterson.

267
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:53,675
If you hadn't gone after him, he wouldn't
have been able to use the transporters.

268
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:57,832
Do you still feel it was a good idea?

269
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,836
- Where'd he transport to?
- The mess hall.

270
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,598
Everyone else respected the quarantine.
There were only a few people.

271
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:08,119
- You made your point.
- Make your way back to the city.

272
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:11,195
Wait in Beckett's lab
for further instructions.

273
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,678
- Dr Beckett.
- <i>Any progress, Dr Biro?</i>

274
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:24,918
Just finished Dumais' autopsy. Would it
surprise you to learn it was an aneurysm?

275
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,995
- No, it wouldn't. Thank you.
- <i>Didn't think so</i>.

276
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:31,121
The position of the rupture
could explain the visions.

277
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:34,958
Swelling in that area
could account for the hallucinations.

278
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,239
I'm no MD, but wouldn't brain swelling

279
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:40,554
just mean that we experience
weird visual anomalies?

280
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,079
- It would depend on the person.
- Our visions are so similar.

281
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:47,713
Wouldn't the visions we experience
be more random?

282
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:52,399
- Most likely.
- The things we're seeing are identical.

283
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,554
You think it might have something...

284
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:56,600
No! No!

285
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,233
Hays, remember, it's not real!

286
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,882
No! No!

287
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:05,960
They're coming right at us!
Can't you see them?

288
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,637
His heart might resynchronise.

289
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:12,478
- He's not fine! Do something!
- There's nothing to do.

290
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:21,558
One, two, three, four, five.

291
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,319
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Stop.

292
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:31,833
It's not his heart. Just... stop.

293
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,672
How are you feeling?

294
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,075
I'm...

295
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,715
I'm...

296
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:05,481
I have a sister. We're not close.
I don't even know how you'd find her...

297
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,555
- Don't talk like that.
- She's the only family I have.

298
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,635
Someone should tell her what happened.

299
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,601
And make it sound good, OK?

300
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,153
Tell her I... I died saving someone.

301
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:21,156
Kids. I died saving kids, a bunch of them.

302
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:25,714
I've got some theories on looping the
power in the gate to charge a dummy ZPM.

303
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:29,193
It probably won't work,
but you should have someone look at it.

304
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:33,072
- We'll look at it together.
- Stop interrupting my last thoughts.

305
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:36,758
This is important stuff you need to hear.

306
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:43,197
Now, if you're here for more than a year,

307
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:47,641
I've left some notes on how to roll
blackouts to maintain your power.

308
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:51,842
And, oh, tell everyone that I was inches
away from a theory of unification,

309
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:56,394
but the notes, they were lost
when I died saving the...

310
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:58,554
- Kids.
- Yeah.

311
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:16,554
OK.

312
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,113
I should be dead now.

313
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,316
- You ran into Dumais at the same time?
- Exactly.

314
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:30,917
Then, yes, you should be dead.

315
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,715
Oh, God.

316
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,598
- I'm still here.
- Yes, you are.

317
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,151
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

318
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:49,712
- Don't take this the wrong way, but...
- Why?

319
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:52,033
Exactly.

320
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:54,398
I don't care.

321
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,952
I mean, I really don't care.

322
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:07,838
- <i>Dr Weir</i>.
- Yes, Major?

323
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:16,000
We've reached the city,
but we haven't hit the quarantine.

324
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:19,553
- You sure it's locked you out?
- I can't get into my office.

325
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,600
It hasn't given us any trouble yet.

326
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:27,435
- Hazmat suits. They're protected.
- What?

327
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:30,879
The city must sense
they're in no danger of infection.

328
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:35,275
It makes sense. Atlantis allows protected
personnel to assist the infected.

329
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:39,721
We should make our way to the mess hall.
Everyone will be scared and confused.

330
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:43,512
<i>I agree. Get to the mess hall</i>
<i>and report back</i>.

331
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:49,554
Are you certain you wanna see this?

332
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,681
How could something organic
be that efficient?

333
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:57,473
Just because it's out of the ordinary for us
doesn't mean it's not commonplace here.

334
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,680
I don't buy that.
Most habitable planets we've encountered

335
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:05,075
are carbon copies of Earth
in terms of environmental conditions.

336
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:08,792
- Unless...
- I'll be back. What's up, Rodney?

337
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:11,682
Incubation to completion
is exactly six hours,

338
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,640
the visions are identical,

339
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:17,796
and the location of the aneurysm
is the same for every single deceased.

340
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:26,914
- Is that what I think it is?
- It's a nanovirus.

341
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,677
One manufactured to kill humans.

342
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,919
- A nanovirus?
- <i>That's right</i>.

343
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,551
Let's pretend I don't know
exactly what that is.

344
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:45,477
Nanotechnology, it's technology
that operates on a nanite scale.

345
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,238
- Around a billionth of a millimetre.
- They're microscopic machines.

346
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:52,156
They carry out very specific tasks.

347
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:56,714
The idea of swallowing a pill and having
a million robots cure whatever ails you.

348
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,632
You're all infected
with microscopic machines?

349
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:03,112
No bigger than a single-cell organism,

350
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,320
although instead of having
a purpose of curing a disease...

351
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,553
The virus terrorises its victims

352
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:12,636
by tapping into their visual cortex
and rupturing an artery in their brain.

353
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:16,318
- Infecting others along the way.
- But I doubt they can multiply.

354
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:19,202
I don't know how many
it takes to kill a human,

355
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:22,833
but eventually I imagine
they'll spread themselves too thin.

356
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:26,359
- Could it be Wraith?
- That would definitely be my first guess.

357
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:30,198
- I'm not so sure about that.
- But the visions, the shrill sound...

358
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:34,595
They're terrifying, but why would the
Wraith create the equivalent of a WMD?

359
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:37,277
They're killing us
not because they want us dead

360
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,479
but because they need us for food.

361
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:43,602
It would be like cattle farmers
creating mad cow disease.

362
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,402
You did come across it in an Ancient lab.

363
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,999
Wiping out the Wraith's food supply
is a last-ditch consideration?

364
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,961
The Ancients would never create
something like this.

365
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:58,516
- It doesn't explain the visions, either.
- Who built it is the least of our concerns.

366
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:00,594
Good point.

367
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:03,277
We have yet to determine
how one contracts it.

368
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:07,038
It is very possible
that none of you have been infected.

369
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:11,082
- Then why are you in hazmat suits?
- Just as a precaution.

370
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,394
- <i>Major Sheppard. This is McKay</i>.
- What is it?

371
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,952
<i>I could use your help at my lab</i>.

372
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,960
Go. I will be fine.

373
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,320
There's only one thing
that explains why I survived.

374
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:30,633
Rodney has the Ancient gene.
Hays did not.

375
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:34,842
- But Rodney's not an Ancient.
- But he's been inoculated with the gene.

376
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:38,040
You're saying the virus
is designed to only kill humans?

377
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,434
- Well, I'm human.
- Yes, we're making a point, Rodney.

378
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:44,640
- Give everyone the gene therapy.
- <i>It's not gonna do it</i>.

379
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:48,432
- I've been given the gene. It didn't take.
- I'm already on it.

380
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:51,561
The gene therapy is only effective
in 48% of recipients.

381
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:55,079
If I was given the gene shot,
how long would it take to kick in?

382
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:58,713
- A minimum of four hours.
- I don't have four hours.

383
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:02,000
I met McKay and Hays 90 minutes
after they met Dumais.

384
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:05,155
I have a little under an hour
before my brain explodes.

385
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,713
Aiden, listen to me.
You've been up for almost 20 hours now.

386
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,875
- You're not thinking straight. Stay calm.
- Calm?

387
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:16,275
I have a million tiny robots in my veins
whose only purpose is to kill me!

388
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:19,355
- You stay calm.
- We are about to have hallucinations.

389
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:22,754
We are infected, Carson.
How do you expect us to act?

390
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,040
- There's gotta be another way.
- I am working on it.

391
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:32,073
- <i>McKay, I'm here</i>.
- You see it?

392
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:35,553
- <i>The big thing in the middle of the room?</i>
- That's the one.

393
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:38,237
Should I pay attention
to all these warnings?

394
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,394
<i>Not today, no</i>.

395
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:43,634
What are you gonna do?

396
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:46,795
The virus is effectively a machine
run by a computer.

397
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:50,638
The best way to knock out a computer
is with an electromagnetic pulse.

398
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,360
We're through shutting down
the electronic gear from Earth.

399
00:31:58,523 --> 00:32:01,913
We're still locked out
of the Ancient controls, though.

400
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,802
The Ancient technology
works differently than ours.

401
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:07,602
An EM pulse shouldn't have
any long-lasting effect.

402
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:10,323
We're ready.

403
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,474
We're all set, Rodney.

404
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,840
OK. Here we go.

405
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:18,881
Wait! How are we gonna know if it works?

406
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:22,877
Sheppard's dialling up the most powerful
pulse the generator can manage.

407
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:25,796
It should affect most of the central tower.

408
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:29,922
Once it wipes out the virus,
the city should end the lockdown.

409
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,472
- It won't make it here?
- If the pulse works,

410
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:36,682
we'll walk you to my lab, sit you in front
of the EMP and repeat the process.

411
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,993
- Major.
- <i>It's working</i>.

412
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:43,634
- When should I hit the discharge button?
- <i>There should be a red overload light</i>.

413
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,439
- I see it.
- Wait till it comes on,

414
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,673
give it a ten count and then discharge.

415
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,555
- Ten count?
- <i>Don't worry</i>.

416
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,793
I've been around more EMPs than anyone.

417
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:59,636
This is gonna be...
I'm gonna be fine, right?

418
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:03,079
Yes. That's a yes. You'll be fine.

419
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:41,681
- <i>Anything?</i>
- Is it possible it might take time?

420
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,842
Doubtful.

421
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:50,603
<i>Are you still locked out</i>
<i>of the Ancient mainframe?</i>

422
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,360
Got any other ideas?

423
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:08,356
29 minutes.

424
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:23,233
It didn't work! It didn't work!

425
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:26,918
- It's still unclear.
- What? Either it worked or it didn't!

426
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:31,554
- They're trying to determine...
- They're... They're everywhere.

427
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:34,032
You are experiencing a hallucination.

428
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,959
Oh, my God.

429
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:59,755
- I've already tried that. It's blown.
- Before we reset the sub-switch.

430
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:02,118
Maybe we shouldn't have overloaded it.

431
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,002
It's fixable. We just need
to use trial and error.

432
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:08,838
Even if we get it working, who's to say
the pulse is gonna get bigger?

433
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:12,234
Ford and Zelenka have 20 minutes
before their arteries rupture.

434
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:20,403
Are you sure an EMP will kill this thing?

435
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:24,595
- Yes.
- All right. I have an idea.

436
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,914
- What do you mean, no?
- <i>It's too dangerous</i>.

437
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,517
You'd rather lose a third of our population?

438
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:40,038
- We're not there yet, Major.
- <i>We are there!</i>

439
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:45,357
Ford and Zelenka are next. The people in
the mess hall have a little over three hours.

440
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,991
People are gonna keep dying
unless we do this.

441
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:50,233
Even if we get the EMP generator online,

442
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:53,554
the chances are slim
we would ever get it powerful enough.

443
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:56,317
Can we bring the infected
to the generator?

444
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:59,122
The city won't let
infected personnel through.

445
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:03,481
The major is right. The only way to create
an EMP strong enough is to...

446
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,680
To detonate a nuclear explosion
in the atmosphere. I heard.

447
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:08,515
<i>It sounds severe,</i>

448
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:12,642
but if the major was able to overload
a generator 20 miles above the city,

449
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,112
we'd be safe
from a radiological standpoint,

450
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:18,832
and the blast would create a devastating
electromagnetic shock wave,

451
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:20,834
<i>enough to knock this virus out</i>.

452
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:23,756
Hopefully without destroying
our computer equipment.

453
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,835
It's worth the risk.

454
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:32,521
OK. You have a go.

455
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:07,632
- I'm almost in position.
- <i>Understood</i>.

456
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:10,636
Will the EM pulse have any effect
on the puddle jumper?

457
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:14,193
I'm hoping not.
I'm more worried about the shock wave.

458
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,923
- Good luck.
- You too.

459
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:21,554
You'll only have 30 seconds once
you release it. Get as far away as you can.

460
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:26,113
Get as far away from
the nuclear explosion as possible.

461
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:29,036
- That's good advice. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

462
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:31,000
<i>I'm releasing the generator</i>...

463
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,274
..now!

464
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:43,914
Detonation in 25 seconds.

465
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:49,633
<i>20 seconds</i>.

466
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,434
<i>15 seconds</i>.

467
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:59,436
<i>Detonation in ten, nine,</i>

468
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:03,357
<i>eight, seven, six,</i>

469
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:07,072
<i>five, four, three, two,</i>

470
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,234
<i>one</i>.

471
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:31,873
Major Sheppard, come in.
This is Weir. Please respond.

472
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,035
Communications may have been
disrupted by the blast.

473
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:38,834
Major, do you read me?

474
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:55,400
This is Sheppard.
I've cleared the blast. I'm returning home.

475
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:00,159
- Glad to hear it, Major.
- Did it work?

476
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:02,314
We're about to find out.

477
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:11,475
We should know almost right away. The
pulse only lasts a couple of microseconds.

478
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:15,921
The city's already ahead of us, Rodney.
You have a green light to return.

479
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you OK?

480
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,472
Yeah, just a little nuke. Nothing, really.

481
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,680
The naqahdah generator plan
was very clever. Good work.

482
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:46,756
Thank you. Now I'm going to bed.

483
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:50,162
We need to discuss what happened earlier.

484
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:52,154
Now?

485
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,353
That can never happen again.

486
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,640
Look, I'm sorry about...

487
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:03,271
You're expertised in military matters,

488
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:07,152
and I should defer to those expertised
in such situations.

489
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,881
Thank you.

490
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:13,275
But you are not the one who decides
what is and what is not a military situation.

491
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,718
General O'Neill and Colonel Sumner
warned me

492
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,841
that you don't respect
the proper chain of command.

493
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:22,234
- Sometimes I see a situation different...
- No, listen to me.

494
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,440
You endangered yourself
and the lives of many others.

495
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:28,640
Because I thought it was
the best course of action to take.

496
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,795
- And, by the way, I saved your ass.
- I know you did.

497
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,272
But you have to trust me.

498
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,039
- I do.
- Do you?

499
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:44,323
You have a minute? We've spent some
quality time with the nanovirus samples.

500
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,635
- They've all been incapacitated.
- Well, that's good news.

501
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:52,557
Yes. Also I think we can rule out
that they were created by the Wraith.

502
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:55,556
They're different than
any Wraith technology.

503
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:59,636
If not the Wraith... then who made 'em?

504
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:02,192
I honestly don't know,

505
00:41:02,363 --> 00:41:05,594
but whoever they were,
let's hope they're not still around.

506
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:11,592
Let's hope.
