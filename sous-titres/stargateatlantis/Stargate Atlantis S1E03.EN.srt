1
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:15,100
- Have you got your eye on anyone?
- Not really.

2
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:17,866
Actually, I was talking to the mouse,

3
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:21,547
but now you mention it,
some of those Thosian women are hot.

4
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:25,751
We did just save them from the Wraith,
so we gotta trade on that.

5
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:27,948
Sit down. I'm ready.

6
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:35,112
I'm surprised you're so eager to volunteer.

7
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:38,981
- You know me, always eager to help.
- Right.

8
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:42,747
Any questions about the process?
I mean, you are a scientist.

9
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:47,906
Yeah. I'm sorry. Medicine is
about as much of a science as voodoo.

10
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:53,944
I need it to enable me to use Ancient
technology like Major Sheppard or you.

11
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:57,104
Yes, hopefully.
You are the first human trial.

12
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:02,030
Why now? We knew we'd need as many
people with the gene as we could get.

13
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:06,265
Without proper FDA approval
it was virtually impossible on Earth...

14
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,990
Let's just say
it's legal in the Pegasus galaxy.

15
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,349
- And completely safe?
- As far as gene therapy goes.

16
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,866
- I am manipulating your DNA. Here we go.
- Tell me more.

17
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:24,709
We believe Ancient Technology Activation
is caused by one gene that's always on,

18
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:29,309
instructing various cells to produce
a series of proteins and enzymes

19
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:32,669
that interact with the skin,
the nervous system and the brain.

20
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:36,427
We're using a mouse retrovirus
to deliver the missing gene.

21
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:39,186
- A mouse retrovirus?
- It's been deactivated.

22
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:43,186
- Are there any side effects?
- Dry mouth, headache.

23
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:46,867
- The urge to run on a small wheel.
- That's very amusing.

24
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:50,422
- How long till it starts working?
- Some time. What is that?

25
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,311
Something I found
in one of the research labs.

26
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:56,464
Something the Ancients
were experimenting with.

27
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:00,625
- Do you know what it is?
- Uh... pretty sure.

28
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:05,141
It's desalinising the sea water
and storing it for the whole city.

29
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:07,303
Fresh water won't be a problem.

30
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:10,350
Some Ancient technology
requires users to have the gene.

31
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:15,745
Other things require initialisation. Once
activated, anyone can make them work.

32
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:19,461
- Good morning, Dr Weir.
- Morning. Careful.

33
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:23,022
- We need to designate recreational areas.
- Yes.

34
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:26,787
We need to clear the hallway
as soon as possible.

35
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,910
Can we lose
the 10,000-year-old dead plants?

36
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:34,145
Of course. We're still making sure
everyone has living quarters.

37
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,587
Major Sheppard
seems to be taking his time.

38
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:39,664
- The safety and security...
- I'm ready.

39
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:43,784
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,908
- Did you see that?
- Yes. What the...?

41
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,463
I'm fine.

42
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,142
Look. Beckett's gene therapy worked.

43
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:58,509
I activated this personal shield.
Acts like a protective skin.

44
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:02,665
It must have inertial-dampening
properties too. Watch this.

45
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:06,620
- Hit me.
- Ow! God!

46
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:10,580
You didn't have to swing so hard.
Notice he didn't even hesitate.

47
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:15,701
Why did you test this device by
having someone throw you off a balcony?

48
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:17,863
That's not the first thing we tried.

49
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,902
I shot him.

50
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,744
In the leg.

51
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,064
I'm invulnerable.

52
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:30,306
Don't you always say how proper
scientific procedure must be adhered to?

53
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:34,465
- Invulnerable.
- Take it off. Let's go have this meeting.

54
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,385
- You're just jealous.
- Yes, green with envy.

55
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,428
This could be a problem.

56
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,781
I can't get at it.

57
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,783
Just checking.

58
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:03,621
- I'm thinking Mr Invincible.
- Captain Untouchable.

59
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,226
- That's good.
- You guys done?

60
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,622
I've been working on this for months.

61
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,831
Forgive me for wanting to celebrate
the fact that it worked first time.

62
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,425
Let's have a toast.

63
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:22,308
Just a thought, but have you tried
eating or drinking since you put that on?

64
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:41,265
That's great.

65
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,067
This may be more serious
than I suspected.

66
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:49,191
I'm hungry. What am I gonna do?
I'll be dead by the end of the day.

67
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:52,549
- You can live for days without water.
- I'm talking about food.

68
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,749
What did the Ancient texts say
about taking it off?

69
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:58,380
There were instructions
which I chose to ignore.

70
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,544
Some Ancient technology
uses a mental component.

71
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,510
Shut up. I'm thinking.

72
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:11,542
Is there any chance
that the gene therapy isn't permanent?

73
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:14,863
- It's possible.
- I'm a dead man.

74
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:19,025
We can probably maintain security
in this area with our limited personnel.

75
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,581
- My people can help.
- Thank you, Teyla.

76
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,550
We'll find other ways
the Athosians can contribute.

77
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,189
- You do not trust us?
- It's not that, it's just that...

78
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:31,424
..we need to train your people
in our weapons and tactics.

79
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,983
- You invited me to be in your team.
- We value your knowledge and expertise.

80
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:38,143
As we value all the Athosians.

81
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:42,510
For now there should be more
than enough living space for everyone.

82
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,867
We have lived
in the shadow of the Wraith,

83
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:48,183
but my people have never been
in a place such as this.

84
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:52,664
They are afraid. Some believe
the ghosts of the Ancestors remain.

85
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:57,860
I don't think so, but we're gonna need
more time to explore the entire city.

86
00:06:58,032 --> 00:07:01,661
We're very cautious
intergalactic explorers.

87
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:04,869
We don't want anyone else getting hurt
the way Halling did.

88
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:09,867
No one must touch anything unfamiliar
unless it's been cleared first.

89
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:15,743
It's very important. Even a tiny little
innocuous thing can... kill you.

90
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:20,305
Dead man talking.

91
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:26,024
- Carson.
- Dr Weir.

92
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:31,183
Grodin's team's going through the Ancient
research material with the shield device,

93
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:35,504
but McKay didn't find anything helpful
and he is the smartest guy here.

94
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,742
So he likes to tell us.

95
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:40,665
Listen. I feel terrible.

96
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,949
It may have been a result
of artificially imposing the gene.

97
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:46,228
I have another theory.

98
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:50,021
We know there is a mental component
to using Ancient technology.

99
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:54,390
I experienced it first hand
with that drone weapon back on Earth.

100
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:59,831
Exactly. Don't you think McKay should be
able to shut this thing off with his mind?

101
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:02,222
Are you suggesting he doesn't want to?

102
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:06,146
We may be settling in here,
but this place is still pretty intimidating.

103
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:10,544
A giant abandoned city full of things
way beyond our level of understanding.

104
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,987
Impending threat of attack from the Wraith.

105
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,871
No question.
It gets bloody creepy here at night.

106
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:20,389
I'm not saying it's conscious,
but perhaps subconsciously...

107
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,747
I don't think he wants to die
of dehydration.

108
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:25,824
No, neither do I, but he's not there yet.

109
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:30,143
You think the shield
will just shut itself down?

110
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:34,464
The Ancients were smart enough to build
fail safes into their other technology.

111
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:38,750
This entire city rose from the deep
of the ocean when danger was imminent.

112
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,824
Why design a personal shield
that could kill you?

113
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:45,143
I certainly hope you're right.
For Rodney's sake.

114
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:53,111
The self-destruct system
requires two separate codes.

115
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:56,344
Each code is unique
and everyone must memorise their code.

116
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,185
Don't bother giving me one. Sorry.

117
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:03,903
This is the only Stargate in the Pegasus
galaxy capable of dialling Earth,

118
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:06,506
making it the last defence
against the Wraith.

119
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,028
If they attack,
which we must consider a very real threat,

120
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,660
we cannot let them gain control
of this complex.

121
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:17,144
If both codes are entered, the naquadah
generator will overload in 30 seconds.

122
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:20,987
- Will it do enough damage?
- Ever see a 20-kiloton nuclear explosion?

123
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,143
I have.

124
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:25,710
Not up close.

125
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,625
I think we should tell Teyla
what's going on here.

126
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:33,183
We still don't know if one of the Athosians
tipped off your arrival at their planet.

127
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:37,265
- I trust Teyla.
- So do I. But Teyla trusts her people.

128
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:42,142
If we tell her, she'll want to tell them,
and I need more time to get to know them.

129
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:51,382
Well, they thought he was finally dead,

130
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:54,502
but when they turned their backs to go,

131
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,232
his cold, dead eyes opened
beneath his hockey mask

132
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:59,269
and he rose up with his knife...

133
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,026
What's a hockey mask?

134
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:08,709
Hockey's a game... Guys skate around
the ice and try to put a puck into the net.

135
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:14,507
The goalies wear masks. It's really...

136
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,388
..scary.

137
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,020
- Tell us more of this game.
- Can we play it?

138
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,342
I don't really see the attraction.

139
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:28,390
Now, football...
Football's a real man's sport.

140
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,429
We'll save that for another time.

141
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:33,265
Yes, time for bed.

142
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:39,746
Remember, tomorrow night, kids, another
tale called <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>.

143
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,703
All right, children, let's go.

144
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,343
Thank you, Major.

145
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:51,946
I hope I didn't scare 'em too much.

146
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,307
I don't think so.

147
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,463
Good.

148
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,230
Good night. Good night.

149
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:05,383
Listen, Teyla.

150
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:10,031
Don't tell McKay what I said
about hockey not being a real man's sport,

151
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,070
'cause it's a Canadian thing,
they're touchy about it.

152
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:18,431
I'm interested in hearing more about
this football you say you love so much.

153
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,311
I can do one better. Come here.

154
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:29,268
Father? Do you think we are safe here
from the Wraith?

155
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:38,024
I think there's nothing certain in life...
except my love for you.

156
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,785
- Do you miss the wind?
- Yes.

157
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:48,671
But if you're very quiet
you can hear the ocean.

158
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:56,261
- Do the ghosts of the Ancestors live here?
- Jinto. Go to sleep.

159
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:06,826
- Funny.
- Here it comes. Watch this.

160
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:12,271
<i>Flutie is back. Four seconds,</i>
<i>three seconds, two seconds, one.</i>

161
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,710
<i>Flutie throws. This game is over.</i>
<i>Hail Mary. It is caught!</i>

162
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:19,989
Oh! That is beautiful!
Can you believe that?

163
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,631
Should I not?

164
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:26,627
The defence didn't think
the quarterback could throw that far.

165
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,384
They seem very happy.

166
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,703
They won one of the best games
of all time against all odds.

167
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,432
- Flutie won the Heisman.
- And played in Canada.

168
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,583
He played hockey too?

169
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,704
What are you guys doing?

170
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:43,706
Teaching Teyla how football
is the cornerstone of Western civilisation.

171
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,386
- You didn't invite me?
- You like football?

172
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,270
No, not really.

173
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:53,870
Come on. It's real, unpredictable,
it's full of passion and... beer, hot dogs.

174
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,351
Cheerleaders.

175
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:59,664
I can't understand. You're allowed
one personal item and you chose this.

176
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:06,510
It's a metaphor. This entire expedition
is the biggest Hail Mary in human history.

177
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:10,426
- What is a Hail Mary?
- It's a play that you just saw.

178
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,943
It's named after a prayer.

179
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:16,661
There's this woman
and her name is Mary and she...

180
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:19,300
Did I mention how much
I like Ferris wheels?

181
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,428
Psst.

182
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:39,302
- Your turn to be the Wraith.
- You can be the Wraith.

183
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:42,703
- I get to be Major Sheppard.
- Ohh.

184
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:51,466
One, two, three...

185
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,908
..four, five, six...

186
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,783
Wex?

187
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:39,583
Jinto?

188
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,787
Jinto's missing. I can't find him.

189
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:03,467
I told him to be careful.
Anything he touches could be dangerous.

190
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,385
- What if there are monsters here?
- We'll find him.

191
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,465
Jinto's missing. Teams of two.
Floor-to-floor sweep.

192
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,146
Start with the jumpers. Full gear.

193
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,268
Yes, sir.

194
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:20,151
- He's not in the living quarters.
- I'm with you.

195
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:24,544
- You gonna be OK with that leg?
- He's my son.

196
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:34,222
Can we use the sensors to locate him?

197
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,587
Not enough power to activate the city.

198
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,708
And the sensors don't distinguish...

199
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:41,871
..individuals.

200
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:44,705
There may be shielded areas
or malfunctioning sensors.

201
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:48,706
We are getting a strange energy reading
in one of the unexplored areas.

202
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:53,309
- Activate the communication system.
- Done.

203
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:56,544
Jinto, this is Dr Weir.

204
00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:00,270
<i>If you can hear me, please respond.</i>

205
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,108
<i>Jinto?</i>

206
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:07,261
If you're lost, if you can't...

207
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:11,831
- We've lost power.
- We've still got lights.

208
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:19,509
I don't know why that happened.

209
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,311
That wasn't me.

210
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,863
Shut it down now.

211
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,942
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

212
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:46,946
- This hasn't happened before.
- We've only been here a few days.

213
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:51,583
This stuff is pretty old.
It's that, or there really are ghosts.

214
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:06,182
This is Sheppard. Lights just went out.

215
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:09,105
We're experiencing
some technical malfunctions.

216
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:20,628
It could be the interfaces
between our generators and the city.

217
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:24,102
Or certain systems
could be causing erroneous operations.

218
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:27,105
I'll run a diagnostic on the power flow.

219
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:29,149
Strange that you believe in ghosts.

220
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:34,432
I never used to until I learned how Wraiths
suck the life out of you with their hands.

221
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:38,828
- Dr Weir?
- Teyla. I'll be right there.

222
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,027
- Do what you can.
- Right.

223
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:48,381
Dr Weir, this is Marta.

224
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:52,185
Pleased to meet you.

225
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:55,469
It's all right. Tell her what you saw.

226
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:57,145
A shadow.

227
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:03,262
The Wraith project them,
make you see things that aren't there.

228
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:06,026
Are you sure?

229
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:08,983
Yet I sense no Wraith here.

230
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:12,667
Have you ever been wrong about that?

231
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,309
Major, this is Weir.

232
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:19,511
<i>One of the Athosians is claiming</i>
<i>to have seen what she calls a shadow.</i>

233
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,712
She does not believe me?

234
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:29,021
Teyla says she senses no Wraith here,
but I'm still concerned.

235
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,707
All teams fall back to the gate room
and wait for instructions.

236
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:37,388
- We can't stop searching.
- We need to establish a proper perimeter.

237
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,864
I secured access to the control towers
and living quarters.

238
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,988
Two more Athosians saw shadows.

239
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,586
That means the Wraith would be here.

240
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:02,381
- You don't think so?
- I don't think they wanna scare us.

241
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:05,988
When they come, they're gonna blow
the crap out of this place.

242
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:10,703
- The Athosians are just seeing things?
- Like Teyla said, it's scary for them.

243
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:13,909
- Not just for them.
- Halling wishes to speak with Jinto.

244
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,063
Please.

245
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,223
Go ahead.

246
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,744
Jinto.

247
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:30,664
If you can hear me, I'm not angry.
I just want to know that you are safe.

248
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:36,983
<i>So if you are lost or hurt,</i>
<i>stay where you are.</i>

249
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:42,429
Make some noise if you can.
We will find you.

250
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,547
- Is that Latin?
- It's Ancient.

251
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,510
The Fathers of Light
of the Everlasting Temple?

252
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,902
It is a prayer to the Ancestors.

253
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:05,031
If you are angry that we have
unrightfully inhabited your great city,

254
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,422
we humbly apologise.

255
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:11,062
We mean no harm.

256
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,541
We will leave if it is your wish.

257
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,180
But I will not go without my son.

258
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,023
- He fainted.
- Is there a better word?

259
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,151
- Faint is the proper medical term.
- I passed out from manly hunger.

260
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,143
Well, hang in there.

261
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:45,906
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard.
McKay's OK. He... he fainted.

262
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:49,951
Very sympathetic.
Let's all mock the dying man.

263
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:52,990
Thank you.

264
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:20,822
It didn't look like the phantoms
the Wraith make you see, but I understand.

265
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,267
- What did it look like?
- It looked like...

266
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:24,751
Darkness.

267
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:28,746
It surrounded the generator and grew,
like it was feeding off the energy.

268
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:33,110
When you shut it down,
the whole whatever it was went away.

269
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:40,422
If it feeds on energy, we could be in big
trouble, or you could, as I won't be around.

270
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,504
We need to figure out
what it is and what to do.

271
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:46,470
- It's attracted to energy.
- Shut down the generators?

272
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,543
People give off heat energy.

273
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:51,021
It's negligible compared to a generator,

274
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:53,581
but take away
the other obvious food source...

275
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,391
- It could come after us?
- I know one thing.

276
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,225
Flying darkness that eats energy
is very bad.

277
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:01,428
OK, we keep the power on.

278
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:03,708
Grodin, figure out a way to detect it.

279
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:06,591
Major, establish surveillance
on all the generators.

280
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,346
If one is targeted,
we'll shut it down remotely.

281
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:13,790
Hopefully we can keep this thing busy
until we find a way to get rid of it.

282
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:15,465
Everyone, this is Weir.

283
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:19,466
We need you all to remain in your quarters
unless otherwise instructed.

284
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,782
- If you see anything...
<i>- Hello?</i>

285
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:24,944
<i>Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?</i>

286
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,342
- Jinto?
<i>- Major Sheppard!</i>

287
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,742
- Are you OK?
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

288
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,982
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

289
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:35,064
Tell us how you got to where you are.

290
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:38,861
<i>I was in the hall outside my quarters.</i>

291
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,985
- Where did you go next?
<i>- I can't remember.</i>

292
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:50,462
He's used to the forest,
being able to see the stars at night.

293
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:53,271
<i>I found a small room</i>
<i>filled with boxes from Earth.</i>

294
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:06,422
- No boxes.
<i>- They're here with me.</i>

295
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:09,823
Someone thought
it would make a nice closet.

296
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:16,422
It's definitely not a closet.

297
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:18,822
- Did the panel glow?
<i>- Yes!</i>

298
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,391
- Did you touch it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

299
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:24,022
- What exactly?
<i>- I don't remember.</i>

300
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:27,707
Before he disappeared we got
an unusual energy reading from here.

301
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,225
Wait. No.

302
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,702
- It must be a transporter.
- We can name it later.

303
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:53,268
Major Sheppard!

304
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,231
- Jinto! Are you OK?
- Yes.

305
00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:01,190
<i>We've got Jinto. He's OK.</i>

306
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:12,145
- Any idea what this place is?
- A research lab. We've seen a few of them.

307
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:16,942
These access the computer system,
so Jinto could have caused malfunctions.

308
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,910
I need to know everything you touched.

309
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:27,184
As far as I can tell, there's only one entity.

310
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:29,820
The blue spots
are the naquadah generators.

311
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:32,984
This blob is our entity.
We had to calibrate the sensors.

312
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:38,943
Your idea works. I anticipate his approach
to the generators and shut them off.

313
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:43,185
Here, watch. I've got it going in circles.

314
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,547
- Good job.
- Thanks.

315
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,146
I hope we're not making this thing mad.

316
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:54,266
Lieutenant, this is Dr Grodin.
I'm tracking the entity heading your way.

317
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,502
You might want to get out of the hall.

318
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,742
Roger that.

319
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,105
<i>This is Ford.</i>
<i>A bulkhead just blocked our way.</i>

320
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:13,105
<i>There's no panel on the wall to open it.</i>

321
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,830
- Roger that.
- McKay?

322
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:18,189
We didn't touch anything.
The entity may be causing malfunctions.

323
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:22,823
The proximity to that large a disturbance
could make the technology go haywire.

324
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:26,462
Lieutenant, double back
and try the door on the east of the hall.

325
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,782
- This door won't open.
- Here it comes.

326
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:38,262
<i>Pull open the console on the wall.</i>

327
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,226
- Hurry.
- What next?

328
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:45,223
- What do you see?
- Three crystals.

329
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:48,623
Take out the middle one.
Move the top one down.

330
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:57,589
If this door opens, go.
I'll be right behind you.

331
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,549
- Not working.
- Use the middle one to bridge the others.

332
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:05,670
- You sure about this?
- Not exactly.

333
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:12,622
Go!

334
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,141
Man down. I need a medical team.

335
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:36,706
Right, hang in there.

336
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:42,830
- Are we in any danger here?
- I wish I could tell you.

337
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,381
- How's Ford?
- Like he was hit by lightning.

338
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,908
- He's gonna be OK?
- He's a tough kid.

339
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,623
Sir.

340
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,145
Hi.

341
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,346
Tell him
there's nothing he could have done.

342
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:11,505
- There is nothing you could have done.
- I could have pulled him out.

343
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:15,506
- Then we'd both look like this.
- You don't look so bad.

344
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:19,745
Dr Beckett says you're gonna be back
to pretty boy in no time.

345
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:27,711
- Apparently it's also an elevator.
- We can stop taking the stairs.

346
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,022
- How nice for you.
- What you got?

347
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:35,391
Jinto didn't touch anything
of any consequence other than that.

348
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:41,351
It must have its own power source
like the jumpers.

349
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:45,585
- What is it?
- A containment vessel for the creature.

350
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:48,744
- And Jinto released it?
- It seems that way.

351
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:52,302
As I suggested, the entity's
been causing our technical problems.

352
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,781
It was captured for observation.

353
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:57,830
The Ancients were researching Ascension.

354
00:28:57,992 --> 00:29:00,904
- Really?
- What exactly is Ascension?

355
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,304
At some point during their evolution,
the Ancients reached a stage of being,

356
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:09,067
where they rid themselves of their bodies
and rose to a higher plane,

357
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:12,349
one in which they live as pure energy.

358
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:18,269
This is the first indication that there
may have been evolutionary intervention.

359
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:20,423
Gene therapy of their own.

360
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,790
I haven't read all the notes,
but I do know the entity is energy.

361
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:26,829
It feeds on energy. Ford's lucky.

362
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:31,349
The more it feeds, the bigger it gets and
the more charged and deadly it becomes.

363
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:35,585
- Is it intelligent?
- According to the research, it is sentient.

364
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,471
But you'd have more luck
talking to a shark.

365
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:43,626
This thing will suck the power
out of our generators and then kill us all.

366
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,430
What do we do about it?

367
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:48,106
It's been trapped here
since the Ancients left.

368
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:50,740
- I know I'd be pissed.
- And hungry.

369
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:56,350
This device was designed to attract it,
capture it and hold it for observation.

370
00:29:56,512 --> 00:30:00,790
We may still be able to get it back inside.
I need more time to figure out how.

371
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:15,507
- Hi.
- Jinto has something he wishes to say.

372
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:20,587
I'm sorry.
What happened to you was my fault.

373
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:25,826
Where I come from we got a little saying.
Stuff happens.

374
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:30,110
It's a little different, but you
didn't mean for this to happen, did you?

375
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,550
No. You're a good kid.

376
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:38,341
You weren't doing anything wrong,
which means this isn't your fault.

377
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:46,230
The same as
when we came to your planet.

378
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:49,748
We didn't mean for the Wraith to show up.
That's why you're here.

379
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:52,551
Your home was destroyed.
You almost lost your dad.

380
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:56,910
- I don't remember you getting mad at me.
- Stuff happens.

381
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:13,423
- It's not falling for the same tricks.
- How smart is it?

382
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:17,107
- Rodney?
- This is much simpler than I thought.

383
00:31:17,272 --> 00:31:19,069
It's like a mousetrap.

384
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:22,907
This button makes it emit
an energy signature to attract the creature.

385
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:24,790
This one shuts it in.

386
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:28,342
The only downside is that
someone has to press the buttons.

387
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,950
- I'll do it.
- OK.

388
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:35,785
Wait, Rodney.
You're still wearing the shield.

389
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:39,149
If something went wrong,
would that protect you?

390
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:54,108
I had a feeling.

391
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:57,230
What do you mean?
Had a feeling about what?

392
00:31:58,112 --> 00:32:01,991
You think I wanted it to come off?
I'm not scared. I'll do this.

393
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:03,983
That's OK. You might faint again.

394
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:07,861
It's just not working any more.
It doesn't work on you either.

395
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:10,182
I meant it wasn't gonna let you die.

396
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:12,866
It is a coincidence
that it stopped working now.

397
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,148
I need a drink.

398
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:17,303
Go.

399
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:35,184
You always told me
I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.

400
00:32:37,432 --> 00:32:39,502
I was wrong.

401
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:43,665
I can't sleep now.
What if the darkness comes?

402
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:45,868
It won't.

403
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:48,341
How do you know?

404
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,503
Because...

405
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,707
..it's afraid of fire.

406
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,183
The darkness is afraid?

407
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:05,910
Everything is afraid of something.

408
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:35,665
So the shield device
just came off by itself?

409
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:38,141
Yeah. It just stopped working.

410
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,908
- He even tried it on Sheppard.
- It wouldn't work on Sheppard.

411
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:45,632
- Why not?
- McKay didn't tell you?

412
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,829
The text we studied
said the shield imprints on the wearer.

413
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:51,904
If we're right,
it wouldn't work on anyone else.

414
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:56,948
Are we ready?

415
00:33:57,112 --> 00:34:01,947
You realise we're going to lose
the sensors? We won't be able to track it.

416
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,910
We have security personnel
around the living quarters.

417
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:07,222
At least we have some warning.

418
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:14,264
Teyla told the Athosian children
that a candle would help protect them.

419
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,191
- You're doing it because...
- It's gonna get dark.

420
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:26,230
OK, Major. Go ahead.

421
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:36,743
Now.

422
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:40,907
Shutting down power.

423
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,351
It's coming.

424
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:15,142
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.

425
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,951
<i>- Size doesn't matter.</i>
- It's a myth.

426
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,546
It'll fit. The device traps it in subspace.

427
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,829
<i>Make sure it gets all the way</i>
<i>inside the containment vessel.</i>

428
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,308
All right, come on.

429
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:46,943
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

430
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,309
- What happened?
<i>- It took one look and went away.</i>

431
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:54,310
It's a lot smarter than we thought.

432
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:04,104
- We need to know where it is.
- We'll have to turn the power on.

433
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:07,901
- We can't do that.
- Do it. Just the operations tower.

434
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:13,871
- What now?
- It's headed this way.

435
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:16,387
- You turned the power on.
- We can't go on.

436
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,702
Do you think it wants to be here?

437
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:24,990
- What do you mean?
- It's been trapped here alone.

438
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:28,747
- It's not alone any more.
- It thinks about eating, that's it.

439
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,380
- You would know.
- If we stay, it will kill us.

440
00:36:31,552 --> 00:36:33,782
- Unless we kill it first.
- I don't see how.

441
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:36,625
Then either we must go or it must.

442
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:39,181
Maybe it wants to go.

443
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,065
If we open the Stargate...

444
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:52,149
- This is a bad idea.
- You said that already.

445
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,701
Well, it's worth saying again.

446
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,951
It's coming.

447
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,182
An open Stargate is a huge power source.

448
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,741
It didn't get trapped in the Ancient vessel.

449
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:11,665
Why should it follow
a naquadah generator?

450
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,790
You got a better idea?

451
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:19,907
- Good luck.
- Are you OK?

452
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,468
It's almost here.

453
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,625
- Do you have an address?
- M4X-337. Barren wasteland.

454
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,783
Dial it.

455
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,829
That was good thinking.

456
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:16,469
It's not going anywhere.

457
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,987
I can't see if the MALP got through.

458
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:23,270
- It could have drained the battery.
- It could be feeding off the Stargate.

459
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:26,026
Shut it down.

460
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:31,146
- I can't.
- The consoles are dead.

461
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:35,988
There must be something we can do.

462
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,586
We don't know
if the MALP is still down there.

463
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:43,667
The entity could go through the gate once
it's depleted the energy in the generator.

464
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:46,824
Or it could continue to feed
off the gate's energy.

465
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:10,390
McKay?

466
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,791
Rodney!

467
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,906
McKay?

468
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:26,506
The power must have been drained
by the entity.

469
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:28,503
Medical team to the gate room.

470
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,027
He's not burnt. He's breathing.

471
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:38,469
McKay? McKay.

472
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:41,305
- Hey.
- What happened?

473
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,862
- You did it.
- I did?

474
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,750
It went through the gate.

475
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:52,385
You must have passed out.

476
00:40:52,552 --> 00:40:55,146
Thanks for not saying the other thing.

477
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:01,741
That was a Hail Mary.

478
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,430
Thank you. Take your time.

479
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:17,703
Man down.
