1
00:00:05,363 --> 00:00:07,479
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:11,192
The hive ships will be in range
of the satellite in 49 hours.

3
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:14,639
That's the only thing standing
between the Wraith and Atlantis.

4
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:16,873
You think it can take out a hive ship?

5
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,796
It should take out all three
when fully charged.

6
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:23,956
This is bad, very bad!
I'm not sure I can fix this.

7
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:28,116
They do not want to destroy
Atlantis. They want to get to Earth.

8
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:31,241
Which is why we have
a self-destruct in place.

9
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,678
Having trouble docking with the satellite.

10
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,676
There isn't time. Get to a safe distance.

11
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:40,631
Come get me once the satellite
has taken care of the Wraith ships.

12
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:44,833
We have a kill.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,200
There's no time! Get the hell out of here!

14
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,116
This is McKay. We have lost the satellite.

15
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:56,162
- Did you take out any more ships?
- <i>Negative. Two are intact</i>.

16
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:00,316
<i>You can't do any more out there,</i>
<i>Rodney. Return to Atlantis</i>.

17
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,878
- Welcome back, Rodney.
- Where are we?

18
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:14,116
Our scanners show the hive ships are
moving, though their pace has slowed.

19
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,433
You gave them something to think about.

20
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:19,037
If they get here in two hours or two days,

21
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,922
it doesn't change the fact
that we're out of options.

22
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:27,794
We can't hope to fight them, so unless
either of you have any more ideas...

23
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,593
The last group is assembled
and ready for evac.

24
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:36,835
All right, then. Let's get this done.

25
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:42,682
Ready?

26
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,874
Self-destruct is armed.

27
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:03,119
Prepare to load the virus
into the Ancient mainframe.

28
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:06,798
- Rodney, dial the Alpha site.
- Dialling.

29
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,919
We got an incoming wormhole.

30
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:27,081
- Receiving an IDC.
- Who is it?

31
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,996
- Stargate Command.
- Are you sure?

32
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,482
Positive.

33
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:33,634
Lower the shields.

34
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:50,393
- Dr Weir.
- Yes.

35
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:53,760
- Colonel Everett, US Marine Corps.
- You should know...

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:59,839
General O'Neill sends his compliments
on a job well done. You are relieved.

37
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:03,359
- We're about to evacuate.
- Without a fight?

38
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,798
- Yes, sir.
- On my order.

39
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:08,477
That evacuation order's rescinded.

40
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:11,077
I assume you've armed
the self-destruct device.

41
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:15,122
- Yes, but as Dr Weir was...
- I need you to disarm it immediately.

42
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:18,355
I don't think
you fully grasp our situation.

43
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:22,482
Three hive ships are bearing down,
and you've nothing to defend yourself.

44
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:25,919
- That about sum it up?
- You got our message.

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,758
- We got your message.
- It's two hive ships. We destroyed one.

46
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:33,040
Good for you.
That should make my job easier.

47
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:37,082
- What exactly is your job, sir?
- Is that not obvious?

48
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:40,519
We are going to defend Atlantis
at all costs.

49
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:47,233
- Colonel...
- Signed by General O'Neill.

50
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:56,836
We appreciate the thought,
but if you had read the report,

51
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,278
you'd know there's not much we can do.

52
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,594
I read your report
cover to cover, Major.

53
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:05,800
You must've found a ZPM
to dial in from Earth.

54
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,477
Archaeologists
discovered it in Egypt.

55
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,157
It's been under our noses
the whole time.

56
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:16,192
Fantastic.
Wait, how did you bring the ZPM here?

57
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:20,356
It is being transported up
to the <i>Daedalus</i>, our new battle cruiser.

58
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,559
I didn't know it was finished.

59
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,716
With a ZPM boosting her engine,
she should be here inside four days.

60
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,716
That is how long
we have to hold this base.

61
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,955
Dial Pegasus Alpha site.
Recall all military personnel.

62
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:37,913
As well, any civilians who'd like to help
in damage control are welcome.

63
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:42,713
When you've done that, please join me
to discuss our tactical position.

64
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:47,274
Colonel Everett! Fine, you're in charge,
but I should be at that briefing.

65
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:53,518
Any other aspect, I'll include you.
We're talking about our tactical position.

66
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:55,674
- I understand that...
- Good.

67
00:05:55,843 --> 00:06:00,075
Somebody wanna please
turn off that self-destructor?

68
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:05,836
This schematic is based
on your information. Is it accurate?

69
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,995
- Yes, sir.
- Deploy Alpha 2.

70
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,074
Sergeant, Alpha 2.

71
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:15,122
- Deploy what exactly?
- We brought along some rail guns.

72
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:18,992
They were originally slated
for <i>Prometheus</i> on the next re-fit.

73
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:22,951
They will deliver an impact velocity
of Mach 5 at 250 miles.

74
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:26,115
A standard magazine will hold
10,000 rounds.

75
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:29,514
- Self-destruct has been aborted.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,243
Did you contact the Alpha site?

77
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,595
I asked him to wait
until I had a talk with you.

78
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,594
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir.

79
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:41,641
Major, dial the Alpha site.

80
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:44,271
Colonel, you've been here five minutes.

81
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:49,836
I have been responsible for people's lives
on this base for several months.

82
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:54,956
I won't put them in jeopardy
until I know how you'll defend this city.

83
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,355
I don't need to explain myself to you,
and I don't need your cooperation.

84
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:02,993
But you could probably use mine... sir.

85
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:06,473
So please answer Dr Weir's question.

86
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,838
- Is that a threat, Major?
- No, sir.

87
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:13,713
You need a clear chain of command,
but if you cut Dr Weir out of the loop,

88
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,841
you'll alienate the people
whose trust she's earned,

89
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,393
which is everyone on the base,
including me.

90
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,679
Is that a fact?

91
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,878
Have a seat.

92
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:40,042
I should be in that meeting.
I am the expert on defence capabilities.

93
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:43,593
When the military steps in,
scientists take a back seat.

94
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:48,393
Till they need us. They don't think
they need us, till they need us!

95
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:50,633
Then they need us.

96
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,953
Take a look at this.

97
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:02,719
Six naqahdah-enhanced
nuclear warheads.

98
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,319
They emit almost zero EM
and are invisible to radar.

99
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,793
Once deployed,
they will detonate by proximity fuse.

100
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,954
- Space mines?
- Right.

101
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:16,002
We use jumpers in stealth mode
between the armada and Atlantis.

102
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,634
- We hoped you could help us with that.
- Yes, but keep some in reserve.

103
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:24,239
- Negative. We only get one shot.
- Consider the possibility...

104
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,634
Four of my men are pilots
with the gene inoculation.

105
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:32,240
Familiarise them with the jumpers
and they'll become our fighter screen.

106
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:34,837
- Along with me.
- I've another job for you.

107
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:38,359
This base is equipped
with a chair weapons-platform

108
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,753
like the one we found in Antarctica.

109
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:43,995
- Yes, but we've no way of powering it.
- We do now.

110
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,279
We brought a Mark Il
naqahdah generator.

111
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,321
We can increase power output by 600%.

112
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:52,953
It should be able to power the chair
for as long as we need it.

113
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:57,753
- It's beginning to sound like a plan.
- I'm glad you approve.

114
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:02,758
This is a long shot, but we have
to hold out until the <i>Daedalus</i> gets here.

115
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:06,757
Then we can use the ZPM
to power the city shield.

116
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,478
Any questions?

117
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,562
All right, then.

118
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,521
Now that Dr Weir's
been informed of our plans,

119
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,881
I would greatly appreciate it
if you'd execute my order

120
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,876
and contact the Alpha site.

121
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:31,998
And Major!

123
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:36,634
This is the last time
I give you an order twice.

124
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,282
Understood.

125
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,274
You must be Teyla.

126
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,834
And you are Colonel Everett.

127
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,801
Major Sheppard spoke highly of you
in his report.

128
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:35,717
Of course, a more recent report
has me a little concerned.

129
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:38,522
That I may fall under the influence
of the Wraith?

130
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:43,837
He assures me that won't happen,
but I need you to stay out of the way.

131
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,882
Do you not need every able body
to help defend Atlantis?

132
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,841
I think we can handle it.

133
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:58,240
- He's not even trying.
- We've tried a dozen times.

134
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:01,281
- Never with this power.
- Major Sheppard's your man.

135
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:05,436
Of course, but he's training pilots,
so we're stuck with you.

136
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:09,881
Listen carefully, do what I tell you
and no one'll get hurt.

137
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,840
There must be someone else.

138
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:15,757
Concentrate on powering up the chair.
Nothing else, nothing but!

139
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:19,233
- Don't think...
- Don't tell me, or I'll think about it!

140
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,678
Please power it up.

141
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:26,835
Good.

142
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,800
Good.

143
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:30,362
Good.

144
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:34,675
- And... Oh, no.
- What? Did I do something wrong?

145
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,841
So, see? Nothing to worry about.

146
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,914
Get him out of the chair.

147
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:57,033
Elizabeth. I've hooked up the generator
and the chair platform is operational.

148
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,194
- That's good news.
- Not so much.

149
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,082
- What's wrong?
- We're down to a few dozen drones.

150
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,881
You just found this out?

151
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:08,321
There was no way of determining that
until the chair was initialised.

152
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,441
The chair in Antarctica controlled
thousands of them.

153
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:15,960
I know. They were probably used
against the first Wraith attack.

154
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:19,195
Even a few dozen
will help us keep them at bay.

155
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,160
What is it?

156
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:25,919
- Incoming. They appeared all of a sudden.
- What's going on?

157
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,802
We just detected objects
approaching the planet.

158
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:30,555
- How many?
- Hundred plus.

159
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,238
How come they weren't detected
by the long-range sensors?

160
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,871
Because they're rocks. Asteroids.

161
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:41,002
The Wraith must've harvested them
and accelerated them at us.

162
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,313
The mainframe's just seen a threat.

163
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:48,352
- Can they do much damage?
- Yeah. But that's not why they're doing it.

164
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:52,277
- They're headed to the mines.
- Can they be deactivated?

165
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,081
No.

166
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:09,235
Well... that's that.

167
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,521
Your mines make one hell of a bang.
I'm sure the Wraith's ears are ringing.

168
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:15,480
Status of the hive ships?

169
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,635
No way of knowing.
Detonation overloaded the sensors.

170
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:23,240
- How long till they're back up?
- There's a lot of residual radiation.

171
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,793
- It'll keep us blind for hours.
- They're still out there.

172
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,353
We just lost our primary line of defence.

173
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,314
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

174
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,317
I was told I could learn
a lot about Atlantis history in this room.

175
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,951
We don't use it
because of the power required.

176
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,672
I'd like to see how the Ancients
lost the first time,

177
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,311
try to avoid their mistakes.

178
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:59,122
Yes, sir. We could do that.

179
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,435
This is the status of the Pegasus Galaxy

180
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:14,039
before the Ancients
encountered the Wraith.

181
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:19,675
The blue stars represent systems
inhabited or protected by the Ancients.

182
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:24,121
Then... this is how it looked,

183
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:27,320
after they fought for almost 100 years.

184
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:30,759
- Until Atlantis was all that was left.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:33,596
That's when the siege began.

186
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:38,594
For several years,
the Atlanteans held off their attackers,

187
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:43,553
relying on the city shield and superior
weaponry, including the satellite system.

188
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:48,194
No matter how many Wraith ships
they destroyed, more kept coming.

189
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:53,357
They could win almost every battle
but they saw no way to win the war.

190
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:57,436
So... they submerged the city and left.

191
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:05,831
That's it. That's the story.
But the picture is pretty clear.

192
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:09,154
- You think this is a no-win situation?
- No, sir.

193
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:14,192
What I mean is, even if we beat them
this time, they'll come back.

194
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:24,677
Major, I think i should tell you,
Colonel Sumner was a friend of mine.

195
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:27,403
We served together a lot of years.

196
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:33,199
I cannot figure how you could go
as far as you did and not save him.

197
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:36,161
- That close...
- By the time I reached him...

198
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:39,599
Worse, you admit to firing
the shot that killed him.

199
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:44,041
Because I believe
that's what he wanted me to do.

200
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:49,072
- You knew him that well, did you?
- You weren't there, sir.

201
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:56,356
I wish for his sake I was.

202
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:08,197
There isn't a night where that moment
doesn't play in my head. When it does...

203
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:10,672
Control room.

204
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:16,912
- This is Colonel Everett reporting.
- <i>We've detected a wave of darts inbound</i>.

205
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,554
I'm on my way. Back to the chair.
We'll finish this later.

206
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:27,479
- What's happening?
- Multiple signals, closing fast.

207
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:32,080
The nukes damaged the sensors.
We couldn't see them.

208
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,801
- Gunners in position?
- Yes.

209
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,318
- Damage-control portals?
- In position.

210
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:39,441
All right. Darken the city.

211
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:54,199
Remember, short and steady bursts!

212
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,756
Positions!

213
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,273
Here they come!

214
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:51,115
- OK, fire it up.
- It'll take a minute.

215
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:56,516
- We don't have a minute.
- It operates in barely controlled overload.

216
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,800
- Just get the damn thing working.
- I'm trying.

217
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,751
- Colonel, it's Radner.
- Go ahead.

218
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:11,677
<i>Looks like some of them</i>
<i>are starting to make kamikaze runs</i>.

219
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,594
- What happened?
- We lost primary systems.

220
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:21,962
Go, go!

221
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:52,435
One of our gun positions is dark.
Ferrell, why aren't you firing?

222
00:19:55,683 --> 00:20:01,041
- Ferrell, report!
- This is Ford, near Ferrell's position.

223
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm on it.

224
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,192
You got power. Go!

225
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:46,076
The long-range scanners and the sensors
are down, but we're working on it.

226
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:50,759
- I want the status of those hive ships.
- They're coming!

227
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:55,758
Tomorrow, the day after, the day
after that... Eventually they'll get here.

228
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,518
The chair is out of drones.
How do we handle the next wave?

229
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,197
- I'm open to suggestions.
- Really?

230
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,802
- We target the hive ships.
- With what?

231
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,318
Fly the puddle jumper
down their throats.

232
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:16,831
- Volunteering for a suicide mission?
- Not if we remote-control the jumpers.

233
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:22,237
- Can you do it?
- I knew this would happen.

234
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:26,442
You show up with your guns,
but when it comes to saving the city,

235
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:29,595
you turn to the scientists
and ask the impossible.

236
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,799
When was the last time you slept?

237
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:33,555
- I have an idea.
- The chair.

238
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:36,476
Of course. How do we tie
in the jumper systems?

239
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:41,034
- Without overloading the generators?
- Using the drones as propulsion.

240
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:45,719
- While maximising the dampening.
- Possibly, possibly...

241
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:48,351
- Is that a yes?
- No, it's a "possibly".

242
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:50,673
How much damage
can a puddle jumper do?

243
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:56,156
I got an idea about that, too. I think
I know where we can get another nuke.

244
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,995
I don't know how sympathetic
the Genii will be.

245
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:04,678
- The Genii?
- Now's their chance to test their weapon.

246
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,913
Let me past!

247
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,672
I need to talk to Dr Weir!

248
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:13,915
Teyla? What's the matter?

249
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,916
The Wraith. They are in Atlantis.

250
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:30,438
The Wraith piloting the kamikaze
ships beam in before they hit.

251
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:34,073
- They're trying to take the city intact.
- How many crashed?

252
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:37,758
Between 20 and 30.
Internal sensors are still down.

253
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,993
Well, we have this.

254
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:43,599
We can't differentiate
between Wraith and human,

255
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:47,881
but the blips that show up out of bounds
will be the likely targets.

256
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:51,672
- Let me see that.
- No good. You need the gene.

257
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:55,921
I got the gene therapy, too.

258
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:59,233
We wish to help.

259
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:05,399
This is a large city. You need
as many people searching as possible.

260
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:09,920
She is the one who sensed
the Wraith presence in the first place.

261
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,675
Captain...

262
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:18,234
- ...get some weapons for these people.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:29,317
There are other people
that possess the gene.

264
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:32,680
Dr Kusanagi would relish
the opportunity to help.

265
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:35,198
I am exhausted and starving,
so sit down.

266
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:39,515
It's out of drones. You couldn't do
any damage if you wanted to.

267
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:41,799
Thank you. We're in business.

268
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:45,956
Head down to the jumper bay.
Radio me when you get there.

269
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:17,233
- You OK?
- Yeah.

270
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,156
How about next time
you can be the bait?

271
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:22,598
Yeah, maybe. Next time.

272
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,997
Right, this way.

273
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:33,996
- We received a response from the Genii.
- Let's hear it.

274
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,398
<i>This is Prenim of the Genii</i>.

275
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,476
<i>We welcome the opportunity to open</i>
<i>a dialogue between our two people</i>.

276
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,874
<i>Send your representative</i>.
<i>One person, unarmed</i>.

277
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,193
- Is that all?
- Yes, ma'am.

278
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:52,402
Colonel Everett, the Genii have
asked us to send a representative.

279
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:56,954
- I'm set to go.
- I can't imagine anyone more qualified.

280
00:26:57,123 --> 00:27:00,832
- Pull this off, I'll buy you a drink.
- You got a deal.

281
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,800
Dial the gate.

282
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,394
Dr Weir.

283
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:42,123
I am Prenim of the Genii.

284
00:27:42,283 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm rather surprised, no, astonished,

285
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,031
that you would have the audacity
to come here.

286
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:51,195
You heard our message.
The Wraith are at our doorstep.

287
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:56,073
And we are understandably delighted
at the prospect of your demise.

288
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,040
That may be so.

289
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:01,639
But still, we have something
that you want.

290
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:04,397
- C4.
- More than that.

291
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:08,440
We have an opportunity
for you to test your weapon

292
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:13,472
at no risk to yourselves,
and a chance to strike at the Wraith.

293
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:19,036
- You have no idea how close they are.
- The Wraith have come, Doctor.

294
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,679
Six days ago.

295
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:32,196
Fortunately, we detected their approach
and shut down our reactors in time.

296
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:34,877
Hundreds of lives
were lost on the surface.

297
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:39,116
But thousands were saved because our
underground complex went undetected.

298
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:44,152
So, you see, the threat to the Genii
has come and gone.

299
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:52,198
So far as the Wraith are concerned,
this planet is no longer of interest.

300
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,480
We have the design that
Dr McKay provided for us,

301
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:59,875
and our prototype bombs
are nearly complete.

302
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:03,001
So why would you ask me
to come here?

303
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:08,191
So that we may trade the C4
for your life.

304
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,562
Damn it.

305
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,882
This is Everett. The Wraith just
took out one of our generators.

306
00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:08,241
- What's the nearest generator station?
- Number 3. Teyla's closer.

307
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,200
- Teyla?
- Already on our way!

308
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:11,921
Meet you there.

309
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:17,111
- I have already offered you the C4.
- You want our weapons in exchange.

310
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:22,198
- That's not a bargain for the Genii.
- What would you do with the C4?

311
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,877
Incorporate it into your weapons
and test them?

312
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:27,432
Of course.

313
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:32,518
I am offering you the chance to test your
weapon design on a Wraith hive ship,

314
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:37,677
at no risk to your own people,
and still have enough to build more.

315
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:40,232
- If you're too proud or stupid...
- Careful.

316
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:44,999
I am way past careful! You know
what the deal is and it's a good one.

317
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:47,631
So, take it or leave it.

318
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:03,834
- Yeah, that's it.
- OK. Let's give it a test.

319
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:06,073
<i>Standing by</i>.

320
00:31:09,123 --> 00:31:12,877
Carson, clear your mind
and think about the puddle jumper.

321
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:15,796
Think about bringing it online.

322
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:20,517
Come on, come on, come on.
Any time now.

323
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:26,235
Carson, I know you can do this.
Just activate the puddle jumper.

324
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:34,882
Yes!

325
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:38,240
Yes, yes! Rodney, it works.

326
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,394
Thank God.

327
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,474
Give me a radio.

328
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,402
Thank you.

329
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:58,712
This is Weir. I've got the prototypes.

330
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,999
Prototypes. Right.

331
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:34,954
Well, that should be the last of them.

332
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:40,913
- Colonel.
- Well done, Doctor.

333
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,995
I have to admit it, I'm impressed.

334
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:47,954
Well, maybe there's hope for me yet.

335
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:51,195
- I'm in your chair.
- Thought it was your chair.

336
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:55,402
Well, I... I don't sit much.
I was just going over the...

337
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:59,800
- We have a problem.
- We have a lot of problems.

338
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:03,922
The Genii nuclear devices are
incomplete. It'll take time to finish.

339
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,233
- How much time?
- About a day.

340
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:12,160
- We don't have a day, Doctor.
- Like I said, we have a problem.

341
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:28,235
- You want to see me?
- I need to keep awake.

342
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:30,963
- I gave you something.
- We're building bombs.

343
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:35,514
- Staying awake is a prerequisite.
- Snappy. I'll get you another stimulant.

344
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,516
- Carry on.
- Thank you.

345
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:49,911
- I'm sorry you lost some of your people.
- Many have died, Colonel.

346
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:53,280
<i>This is Jumper Four</i>.
<i>We have a visual on the hive ships</i>.

347
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:58,642
This is Everett. The Wraith hive ships
are approaching the planet.

348
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,113
Defence team, to your positions.

349
00:34:02,763 --> 00:34:04,082
Doctor...

350
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,962
- Defence team moving.
- Let's prepare.

351
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:08,442
Thank you.

352
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,680
This is Weir.

353
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,562
I know how tired you all are

354
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,033
and how much we've asked of you
these past few days.

355
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:26,153
<i>Hopefully, the</i> Daedalus <i>will arrive soon</i>.
<i>Until then, our fate is in our own hands</i>.

356
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:31,875
<i>If during this battle our mission fails,</i>
<i>I will give the order to evacuate</i>.

357
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,681
We all hope it won't come to that.

358
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:39,233
But if it does, don't hesitate.

359
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,240
That is all.

360
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:51,673
- Time's up.
- What a coincidence. We're done.

361
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,793
So... chair room?

362
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,682
Right.

363
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:08,558
Colonel, we're heading to the bay
to load up the jumpers.

364
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,156
<i>Understood</i>.

365
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:20,678
Remember... I owe you that drink.

366
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:36,002
Slow, slow, slow. Right here.

367
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:49,756
Sheppard, are you ready?

368
00:35:55,883 --> 00:35:59,762
- Rodney...
- The generator's not powering up.

369
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:38,113
They're sending in another wave.
Major, we need to go.

370
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:11,835
- McKay.
- Power levels are dropping.

371
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:20,002
Rodney, nothing is happening.

372
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:31,198
- Why are there no jumpers in the air?
- We must've exhausted the energy.

373
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:34,958
- So long, Rodney.
- There's gotta be a way to...

374
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,442
Major!

375
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:50,155
Heads up, people. They're in the base.

376
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:56,237
- Colonel, we have a problem.
- What is it?

377
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:58,917
We may need
to give the order to evacuate.

378
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,039
Elizabeth, wait!

379
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:06,282
- You can't!
- I have to, and you know it.

380
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,195
John...

381
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:14,719
Go.

382
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:28,958
What's the status on that damn jumper?

383
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,954
It's on its way.

384
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:58,200
- <i>Sheppard is taking the jumper</i>.
- I'm aware of that.

385
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,877
Start prepping Jumper Two.

386
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:05,597
Teyla, I'm hearing gunfire.
What's your status?

387
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,111
<i>Teyla, do you hear me?</i>

388
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,602
<i>Teyla?</i>

389
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:33,876
Hopefully, if I take this one out,
the other one will back off.

390
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:37,240
Go, go, go!

391
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:44,872
- We can't stay here.
- They're beaming in all over the place.

392
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:47,273
We're not going anywhere.

393
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,240
Not yet.

394
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:02,361
You know, if this works,
somebody might have to do it again.

395
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:03,842
Understood.

396
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:07,237
Come on, keep up!

397
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:10,601
Over there!

398
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,795
You let Sheppard fly that jumper?

399
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:34,194
Help me arm the self-destruct
in case this fails.

400
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:00,361
They haven't detected my approach.

401
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:04,441
Weapon is armed and ready.

402
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,320
I'm going in.

403
00:41:37,523 --> 00:41:39,639
