1
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:13,353
Anything look familiar to you, Teyla?

2
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:16,640
I do not believe
this is a world I have visited before.

3
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:21,923
- No landmarks. How can you tell?
- It is difficult, but every world is unique.

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,120
I've heard reports from SG teams
on missions like this,

5
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:28,673
specifically the mission reports
of Colonel Samantha Carter.

6
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:32,313
She and I worked together
to avert global catastrophe.

7
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:35,475
She and I... Ay, ay, ay.

8
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:38,032
- What was I saying?
- Mission reports.

9
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:41,400
There's similarities
between worlds that support life.

10
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:45,761
Makes sense. For example,
the colour of the sky is just a product...

11
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,281
- What was that?
- Turbulence?

12
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:52,276
Seems to be OK now.
I wonder what that was.

13
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,554
Getting conflicted readings.

14
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,557
It looks like a powerful energy field
about 2,000 yards over there.

15
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:03,362
- Over where?
- 18 degrees from our heading.

16
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,241
It's worth checking out?

17
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:08,076
Significant energy emission
indicates technology.

18
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:11,041
So you think it's worth checking out?

19
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:14,915
I'm sorry. Yes. Energy field good.

20
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:21,357
- Maybe not.
- It's getting worse.

21
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:23,912
That's enough. I'm getting outta here.

22
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,954
We're not gaining any altitude.

23
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:29,921
Controls are unresponsive.

24
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,078
The drive just went offline.

25
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,082
We're going in.

26
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:52,754
- Nice landing, sir.
- Thank you.

27
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,357
- What happened?
- You took us too close.

28
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:59,311
- Whose idea was that?
- Let's not get caught in the blame game.

29
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,043
OK, can you fix the ship or not?

30
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,280
- None of my equipment's working.
- The sun is still high.

31
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:10,402
- What does that mean?
- We can make it back before dark.

32
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:14,158
- We should start now.
- Zelenka and I can return and fix it.

33
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:17,838
No, it's not just the jumper.
None of my equipment's working.

34
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,797
All right. Let's gear up.

35
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,721
Check it out, sir.
I think my compass has gone wonky.

36
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:42,114
You brought a magnetic compass
to another galaxy?

37
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:45,753
You have no way of knowing
if this planet's magnetic field is...

38
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,642
Wait a second. Let me see that.

39
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:55,197
The disturbance is electromagnetic,
which is why all our equipment's out.

40
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:58,594
- Which direction is the gate?
- You're the one flying.

41
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:01,641
All right. We should be able
to figure this out.

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,722
I believe it is this way.

43
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,434
Let's move out.

44
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,234
- Hey, can we go that way for a bit?
- Why?

45
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:29,520
The compass is acting weird.
I might be on to something.

46
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:32,675
- I'm glad I brought it along.
- How prescient of you.

47
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,274
Hello, hello.

48
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,357
Oh, yeah. Definitely this way.

49
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,161
- Didn't fly over this, did we?
- I don't know.

50
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,837
I was busy trying not to get us killed.

51
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:10,076
- These ruins are very old.
- Several hundred years, maybe more.

52
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,518
So, the population here's extinct?

53
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:17,072
- Check this out.
- OK, I give up.

54
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:21,475
If the disturbance is man-made,
it's emanating from within these ruins...

55
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:24,715
somewhere... over there.

56
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,714
If we find it, can we shut it off?

57
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:30,317
If we can, we won't
have to walk to the gate.

58
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,520
I was thinking more of saving
a good puddle jumper.

59
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:36,072
That too.

60
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:40,441
All right, guys. We'll stay here
for a second, see if McKay can...

61
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,237
- They're kids.
- With weapons pointed at us.

62
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,792
Lower your weapon, Lieutenant.

63
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:59,602
Hey... kids.

64
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,516
We are not here
to harm you in any way.

65
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:06,153
That's right. What she said.
We're friendly, OK?

66
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:09,838
We arrived through the Stargate.
We were only trying to return home.

67
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,878
- I don't think they understand.
- I believe they do.

68
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,035
- Why are they pointing arrows at us?
- You're a full-grown.

69
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,081
- Excuse me?
- You need to see the elders.

70
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:25,797
Elders... sound good.

71
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,557
Just lead the way.

72
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,834
Full-growns?

73
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:13,401
Look what they're wearing.
What are they holding?

74
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,634
Major.

75
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:29,601
- Now, where'd they get that?
- It looks like a shrine.

76
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:35,040
- They don't worship the Wraith?
- That'd be a first.

77
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:38,001
That'd be disturbing.

78
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,154
Wraith bones.

79
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,875
Yeah, we know.

80
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:47,480
Its death bird fell out of the sky years ago.
It reminds us of how life used to be.

81
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:50,555
- Used to be?
- Before.

82
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:52,679
Fell out of sky.

83
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:56,199
- I picked up on that.
- What knocked us down knocked it down?

84
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,638
- If so, we need to find it.
- Why?

85
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,875
Anything that can knock out
a Wraith dart, it's a big deal.

86
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,637
That would be nice to have.

87
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:11,197
The elders are ready.

88
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:49,234
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Keras, one of the village elders.

89
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:53,316
I'm Sheppard, and this is
Rodney and Teyla and...

90
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,475
- Did you say you're one of the elders?
- Yes.

91
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,714
How old are you?

92
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,434
24.

93
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:06,561
- And that makes you an elder?
- How did you get here?

94
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:11,160
We used the Stargate to travel
from our world to visit yours.

95
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:16,522
- You do know of the Stargate?
- It's a big, round... thing.

96
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:22,196
No one has come through the well
for nearly... 500 years.

97
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:25,673
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
We're a little lost.

98
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:29,074
And you are all older than 24?

99
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,234
Ford, how old are you?

100
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,917
- 25, sir.
- I guess so.

101
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:39,794
Is that a problem?

102
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:45,312
Please... sit.

103
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:50,240
They're trespassers.
We don't have to explain ourselves.

104
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,155
I apologise.

105
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:13,721
- You are familiar with the Wraith?
- Yes.

106
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:17,671
Well, we're not friends
or anything like that.

107
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:19,913
The Wraith used to farm our planet

108
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,802
as we used to farm livestock
and beasts of burden.

109
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:27,081
- Only, we were their herd.
- They seem to do that everywhere.

110
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:31,714
Our ancestors fought them, but...
our weapons were not strong enough.

111
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:35,478
Our people tried to hide from them,
but they were always found.

112
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:39,158
None died peacefully.
None could enter into the eternal rest.

113
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,995
Eternal rest?

114
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:46,601
To die at the hands of the Wraith,
to breathe your last breath amongst such...

115
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,038
hatred and evil...

116
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:55,114
There's no way to move peacefully
into the next world when that is your fate.

117
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:59,955
My ancestors decided that to beat
the Wraith, we must think as they think.

118
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:05,243
We ensured that we would never provide
the Wraith with a crop worth picking.

119
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,679
- By...?
- None of us passes the age of 24.

120
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,232
How do you manage that?

121
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:15,832
On the eve of our 25th year,
we make the sacrifice,

122
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:21,202
both for our people and for our own
safe passage into the eternal rest.

123
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,232
- What?
- You kill each other?

124
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:27,554
No. We take our own lives.

125
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:35,276
And so the Wraith have not returned
for nearly 500 years.

126
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:55,922
Never in my life have I ever felt so... old.

127
00:11:56,643 --> 00:12:00,431
This is without a doubt the most
screwed-up way of life I can imagine.

128
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,720
- They seem to accept it.
- They're kids. What do they know?

129
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:07,592
- They don't want us around.
- Because we may bring back the Wraith.

130
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:12,075
They can't be right. Would the Wraith
just ignore them 'cause they're young?

131
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:15,562
I don't eat veal,
but it can't be the same thing.

132
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,714
Of course not. Veal is delicious.

133
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:22,957
The Wraith don't come by because
the electromagnetic field takes them out.

134
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,195
Why do they not land outside
and take the village by foot?

135
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:30,072
Perhaps I'm not being clear.
Nothing works here.

136
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:34,395
Not their stunners, their darts. Even
their shields wouldn't function correctly.

137
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:38,078
Why risk it when there's a smorgasbord
through some other Stargate?

138
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:41,792
- Our guns still work, right?
- They're relatively primitive.

139
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:47,482
- We must tell them.
- Not before I've looked at those ruins.

140
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,634
They're sacrificing themselves.

141
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,478
What are we gonna tell them, Teyla?
"Everything you believe is wrong."

142
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:56,919
"Trust us, because we've been here
for almost an hour."

143
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:02,193
We've talked it over.
You can stay until you've fixed your ship.

144
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,160
But you must work quickly.

145
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:07,633
Your being here
makes our people uncomfortable.

146
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,398
Fair enough.
We'll work as quickly as we can.

147
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:16,239
There may be something in the ruins
that caused us to lose control of our ship.

148
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,792
- They should be watched at all times.
- Aries.

149
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:21,761
That's fine. Totally understandable.

150
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:25,359
I'll choose two of the villagers
to keep an eye on you.

151
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,600
- Casta says you're 100 years old.
- Who's Casta?

152
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:33,721
- Me.
- Where do you get your information?

153
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:37,114
- Why are we going to the old city?
- I gotta check something.

154
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,716
- What?
- Grown-up stuff.

155
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,796
- What's a grown-up?
- Someone who's older than you are.

156
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:46,638
- I'm three days older than Cleo. Tell me.
- You're not a grown-up.

157
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:49,954
You just said someone
that's older than me is a grown-up.

158
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,512
I don't need you to tell me what I just said.

159
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:55,834
- OK.
- So, why are we going to the old city?

160
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,838
- Ford, a little help here.
- You're a natural.

161
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:04,962
Let's see how long we can
be quiet. Who can be quiet the longest?

162
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:08,081
- I'm not a quiet person.
- That's talking.

163
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,632
I'm not a quiet person. I talk a lot.

164
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:19,514
- Do you have young?
- Me? No. Not yet, anyway. You?

165
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:22,516
Oh, yes. They're raised
in one of our other villages.

166
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:25,561
- Other villages?
- To keep family lines apart.

167
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,714
Got it.

168
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,763
How many villages are there like this?

169
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:35,474
12. There are a few larger than this one,
but more are small in number.

170
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:40,080
- And they all make the sacrifice?
- Yes, we all do, as have many before.

171
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,438
No one ever...?

172
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,477
- What?
- Decides not to go through with it?

173
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:49,032
Takes off? Runs away?

174
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,837
- There has been hesitation.
- I bet.

175
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,882
We can be... persuasive
when the time comes.

176
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,757
I know what that means.

177
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:11,633
Look... I gotta tell you,
I don't understand this at all.

178
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:16,877
Where I come from, we value life
more than almost anything else.

179
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:22,239
You know what Lieutenant Ford would've
missed if his life was over a year ago?

180
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,678
We're not all that different.

181
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:30,839
It's just that... I would rather have
24 years of peace than a life of fear.

182
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,676
Yeah, but what if there's another way,

183
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,834
naturally, when the time comes?

184
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,642
- The time comes.
- Of course it does.

185
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,522
- That's part of being alive.
- I mean for me.

186
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,481
Tomorrow's the first day of my 25th year.

187
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,396
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

188
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:51,112
That's why I lead the council of elders.
I'm oldest among the 24s.

189
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,195
- You mean, tomorrow you, um...
- Tonight.

190
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,672
Tonight?

191
00:15:56,843 --> 00:16:00,199
Our way was put in place long ago,
and it works.

192
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:04,322
It's not for me to question it.
Tonight I die.

193
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:15,918
- How many?
- Four, but there may be more.

194
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,278
He's given them time to prepare the ship?

195
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:22,197
- Against my strong objection, yes.
- So this is Keras.

196
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:25,594
Who should be readying himself
for his sacrifice.

197
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:29,199
I will be the eldest by tomorrow,
but that might be too late.

198
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,160
What do you wanna do?

199
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,201
They came through
the Wraith well, Pelius.

200
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:38,515
If they stay, the Wraith will come back
and our sacrifices will be for nothing.

201
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:42,471
- They must be forced to leave.
- I need time to talk to the villages.

202
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,873
- We have little of it.
- You know the laws.

203
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:49,594
A forced sacrifice must be
agreed upon by all the villages.

204
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,754
Leave us!

205
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,233
Talk with who you need to talk.

206
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:03,318
I will give them to the end of this day
to leave. If they do not...

207
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:17,481
Hey, hey. Coming through. Thank you.

208
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,440
- What's that?
- A compass.

209
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,879
- What's that?
- Used for determining direction on Earth.

210
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,762
- Where's Earth?
- Listen, Cleo...

211
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,436
- Casta.
- Whatever.

212
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:30,754
Aren't you supposed to be observing?
Know what that means?

213
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:35,678
- Observing?
- You stay out of my way and watch.

214
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,356
- Why?
- Because.

215
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,354
- Because why?
- I say so.

216
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:40,842
Why?

217
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:43,881
I can't work with you two
asking stupid questions!

218
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,432
Now, sit down and shut up!

219
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,638
Oh, don't. Don't.

220
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,121
You're mean.

221
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:56,352
Thank you for finally noticing.
You wanna go, huh?

222
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:59,037
OK, OK, OK.

223
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,434
You got a real gift with the kids.
You do birthday parties?

224
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:06,198
I have a purpose here. You deal with them.
Excuse me. Thank you.

225
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,760
It's OK. He's upset
'cause you're smarter than him.

226
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,562
You guys know what chocolate is?

227
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:18,157
No? This is gonna be huge. Come with me.

228
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:22,316
We're gonna go over here
and we'll leave the mean old man alone.

229
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,034
Oh, yeah.

230
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,394
OK.

231
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,074
Hello, hello.

232
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:14,956
It's really good, huh? Want some more?

233
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>Major</i>.

234
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,358
McKay? My radio's working.

235
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,993
Which is how I'm able to speak with you,
yes. You have a second?

236
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:27,520
- Tell me you found the field generator.
- <i>I found it</i>.

237
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:30,993
- And obviously the off switch.
- Better than that.

238
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:33,154
It's powered by a zero-point module.

239
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:36,235
<i>It's possible the EM field's</i>
<i>been online for centuries</i>.

240
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:40,282
Only a ZPM is capable of powering it
that long. I've shut it down.

241
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,752
- <i>You've disabled the shield?</i>
- Temporarily.

242
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:45,073
I need to get the ZPM back to Atlantis.

243
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:48,952
We cannot just take it. It is their only
protection against the Wraith.

244
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,239
<i>The Wraith haven't been here in years</i>.

245
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,681
If this is a functioning ZPM, we bring 'em
back to Atlantis. How hard is that?

246
00:19:55,843 --> 00:20:01,520
Hard. But the ZPM could give us the power
to make a lot of problems go away.

247
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,117
Exactly. I need to get it back to a lab.

248
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:08,435
- How do you plan on doing that?
- You've given me a flying lesson.

249
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,515
It's gonna take more
than a five-minute lesson.

250
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,322
Listen, I'm not gonna
be dogfighting Wraith darts.

251
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:16,997
Ford and I can handle it.

252
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:21,076
All right, fine. You can go.
But get back to me before tonight.

253
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:24,360
We sort of have a... a deadline.

254
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,162
Right.

255
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:30,360
I think it is dangerous
to leave the villages unprotected.

256
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,991
The Wraith haven't been around
in a long time.

257
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,723
This is reckless. You must see that.

258
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:39,239
What are the odds they're gonna show up
in the next few hours?

259
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,756
- Why were the guides sent back?
- Were they?

260
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:04,040
- Yeah, they were.
- Must have been nap time.

261
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:11,121
- You think this is a joke, Sheppard?
- I don't find much here to be that funny.

262
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,398
- What's wrong?
- Two of the full-growns are unwatched.

263
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:19,556
- It's fine, Aries.
- You should get ready for tonight, Keras.

264
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:24,274
- The cleansing ceremony is set to begin...
- Fine. I'll go ready myself.

265
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:39,920
- What were they talking about?
- He's sacrificing himself tonight.

266
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,753
- Keras?
- I tried to talk him out of it.

267
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:46,552
- If we tell them about the field...
- I'm working on that.

268
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:51,114
But we can't do anything until
we figure out what to do with the ZPM.

269
00:21:57,603 --> 00:22:00,242
- This is a very bad call.
- Why?

270
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:04,191
You just told me this ZPM powers
their defences against the Wraith.

271
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:05,921
Yep.

272
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,917
- You don't see the problem in stealing it?
- Not stealing, so much as...

273
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,756
If it's of any good to us,
we can bring them here.

274
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:15,915
For one, we don't even know
how many of them there are.

275
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,155
- I hardly doubt more than a few hundred.
- What?

276
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,314
We're barely getting by ourselves.

277
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,713
This is a big city.
We have the mainland.

278
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:28,638
We can't just visit planets, take away
their defences and bring 'em back here.

279
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:33,638
- If they have a ZPM, yes, we can.
- How morally superior you must feel.

280
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:39,082
They live in trees. Plus they could stop
killing themselves for no good reason.

281
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:41,552
They kill themselves for no good reason?

282
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:46,319
Yes. The EM shield is what's keeping
the Wraith away, not the sacrificing.

283
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:51,955
OK. You said that the sacrifices began
at the same time the shield went online.

284
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:53,442
More or less.

285
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:57,152
If the people who built the shield
implemented the suicide pacts,

286
00:22:57,323 --> 00:23:01,316
perhaps the two things aren't
as disconnected as you think.

287
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:07,122
Maybe.

288
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:13,440
One more day, that's all I need.
I'll have a much clearer picture then.

289
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:16,322
- Clearer picture of what?
- Long story.

290
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,474
Stick around and I'll tell you.

291
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,238
I'll be honest with you, Sheppard.

292
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:26,476
There's nothing I'd like more than
to spend more time talking with you.

293
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:28,634
But it's not possible.

294
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:33,992
What if you're wrong?

295
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,678
What if a day doesn't matter?
What if a year doesn't matter?

296
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:40,357
And what if it does?

297
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:45,074
I'd never rest peacefully knowing I was the
reason the Wraith returned to this planet.

298
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:48,713
- You can live a full life.
- You're a warrior among your people.

299
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:51,477
One who is trained
to defend and protect them.

300
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:55,602
- I guess you can say that.
- Would you give your life if necessary?

301
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:00,083
It'd have to be really necessary.

302
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,041
How is the sacrifice so different?

303
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:05,922
So this is just gonna go on for ever?

304
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:11,152
As long as the Wraith don't return, yes.

305
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:20,879
Would you stand witness?

306
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,034
Me?

307
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,880
What do I have to do?

308
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:29,921
Just be there as I prepare.

309
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:35,355
We gather the strength from those
close to us for the sacrifice to come.

310
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,674
Dr Weir.

311
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:49,122
The bad news is it looks like the device
harnesses M7G-<i>6</i>77's unique EM field.

312
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,958
- Probably wouldn't work for us.
- Assuming we considered stealing it.

313
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:56,081
Not much point to that, either.
ZPM's almost depleted.

314
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:59,392
- So it's worthless?
- I wouldn't say that.

315
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:03,272
Enough to give us the shield
at full power for a few hours,

316
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,559
handy if the Wraith ever attack.

317
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:09,921
- It could do what it was doing...
- It is of more worth to them than us?

318
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,994
Probably.

319
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:14,472
- Definitely.
- Fine.

320
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:18,433
- There's another thing.
- Uh-huh?

321
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:21,401
I think I have a theory
about the suicide pact.

322
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,078
- Yeah? What is it?
- I'm not sure how much power this had,

323
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:29,759
but whoever built the device knew its field
wouldn't cover the whole planet for long.

324
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:34,041
- So it was built to protect a smaller area?
- The area round the villages.

325
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:36,512
But if the population got much larger,

326
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:40,722
the kids may move out of the field and
become susceptible to a Wraith attack.

327
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:44,319
- So the suicide pact is...
- Population control.

328
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,758
- Wow, that's a little severe.
- A little?

329
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:51,121
They believe if they die in turmoil,
they don't go to their version of heaven.

330
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:57,392
While this guarantees that they die in
peace, it's a religion, and a ridiculous one.

331
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,793
That's not a judgement
we can make for them.

332
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,521
- No?
- No.

333
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:07,440
- No.
- Return the ZPM and get the device online.

334
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:29,038
<i>Sheppard, it's McKay</i>.

335
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:33,279
This is Teyla.
Major Sheppard is... unavailable.

336
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:37,402
- <i>What does that mean?</i>
- He's taking part in the ceremony.

337
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,997
- That doesn't sound good.
- <i>Are you back?</i>

338
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,358
I'm just gonna put the ZPM back.

339
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:46,198
- I'll let Major Sheppard know.
- The jumper's outside the EM field.

340
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:49,878
We should be able to leave
as soon as I've finished.

341
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:58,794
Teyla!

342
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,555
We've found a Wraith bracelet
that is transmitting.

343
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:11,272
<i>We need that field returned</i>
<i>as soon as possible!</i>

344
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,553
Stop him!

345
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:27,917
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

346
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,993
McKay, we need it on now!

347
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:34,232
- Move!
- I'm coming!

348
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,477
- What are you waiting for?
- That should be it.

349
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,555
- What?
- Far be it for me to cause a panic, but...

350
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,679
What did you do?

351
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:58,072
- What did you do?
- In my haste, I may have broken it.

352
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:05,153
How dare you defile our remembrance!

353
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:07,234
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

354
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,712
You broke the laws!
You must be punished!

355
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:12,443
- That's not up to you!
- Neither is it up to you!

356
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:19,202
You've had enough time.
You must fix your ship and go!

357
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,875
How long do they expect us
to play chance with our lives?

358
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,151
Every second a full-grown is in our village

359
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:31,679
is a second we are no longer safe
from the Wraith.

360
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,038
They must leave now!

361
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,591
I'll take you to the well.
You're not safe here.

362
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,675
- McKay and Ford are in the ruins.
- We'll pick them up.

363
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:43,403
- They put the ZPM back?
- There's been a setback.

364
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:46,555
- What did McKay do?
- Friends, please!

365
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:53,639
The full-growns have agreed to leave
and never come back.

366
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,033
I will take them to the well myself.

367
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,123
All this will be over soon

368
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:02,480
and we can get on with the ceremony.

369
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,712
Make sure they get there.

370
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:30,674
- Please tell me you have this working.
- These things are usually plug-and-play.

371
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:35,280
- Get to the point.
- There is a sequence which I haven't got.

372
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:38,674
None of that matters now.
Grab what you can and come with me.

373
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,913
Aries will be sending men behind us.

374
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:45,201
- What made the bracelet broadcast?
- I do not think it was anything we did.

375
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,878
It may be an emergency beacon
that activated when the dart crashed.

376
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,682
The EM field's been
keeping it quiet ever since.

377
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:56,234
It must have begun transmitting
as soon as McKay turned off the field.

378
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,076
Listen to me. We have to move on. Now!

379
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:02,440
- We cannot do that.
- Keras, this is hard to explain.

380
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:05,356
We can't go anywhere
till we fix this device.

381
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:08,196
Abandon your ship.
You're risking your lives.

382
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:12,675
This is not about our ship.
It's about the protection of your villages.

383
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:14,754
What?

384
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:18,393
The reason our ship went down,
the reason the Wraith dart crashed,

385
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,077
it's because of this device.

386
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:25,680
It renders all electromagnetic-based
technology inside the shield inert.

387
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,515
I don't understand.

388
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:30,561
The Wraith didn't stay away
because of your sacrifices.

389
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:33,317
They stayed away because of this shield.

390
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:37,117
- That can't be true.
- It's not entirely true.

391
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:39,672
The shield doesn't protect
the whole planet.

392
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:41,993
I believe the sacrifices were brought in

393
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:44,961
so your society never left
the confines of the shield.

394
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:50,197
The sacrifices play a part in your survival,
but not for the reasons you believe.

395
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:53,560
- It's impossible.
- I can prove it to you.

396
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:57,796
But you have to give us time
to bring this device back online.

397
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,914
Keras is weak.

398
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:04,032
I doubt his oath to the sacrifice.

399
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,317
The full-growns have clouded
his judgement.

400
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,279
They've stopped in the old city.

401
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:23,641
Gather the bows and the spears. We will
rid ourselves of them once and for all!

402
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:25,794
Yeah!

403
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,798
Coming through. Excuse me.

404
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:34,755
All right. And again.
Still in the way. Thank you.

405
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:41,434
- This'll never work.
- We don't have much of a choice.

406
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:56,913
- This is not the well, Keras.
- It's my fault.

407
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:02,396
We just received word from McKay
that our ship's just been repaired.

408
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:05,714
In fact, he's back there
right now waiting for us.

409
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,795
We were just saying goodbye to Keras.

410
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,601
- You think I'm a fool?
- No.

411
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,152
I just think you're a little cranky.

412
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:21,959
Look, if you wanna escort us back
to the ship, you can watch us leave.

413
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:29,560
Lead the way.

414
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:50,794
All right.

415
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:08,196
- Oh, you scared me!
- You scared us.

416
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,115
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

417
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:12,843
We came to see if you left any chocolate.

418
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:15,392
Yes, yes, of course.

419
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,833
What?

420
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:22,314
Oh, you want some.

421
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:28,162
You can have this... but you gotta
promise to let me work, OK?

422
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,834
- OK.
- All right.

423
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:32,994
- Quietly.
- Come on.

424
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,794
All right.

425
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:48,680
- Do you intend to leave McKay behind?
- We'll circle till he gets the device on.

426
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,322
He'll show up.

427
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:58,282
It's too late. We're too late!

428
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:19,442
- What the hell was that?
- Too small to be a dart.

429
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:21,594
It's a probe of some kind.

430
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,721
Probably came to check out
the signal from the bracelet.

431
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:27,875
We gotta take it down
before it gets back to the gate.

432
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,514
Boys...

433
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,592
Let us take it down or we're all in trouble.

434
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:45,039
Even if you were able to destroy it,
more will come.

435
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:49,162
- That is not true.
- Why do you think they're here?

436
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:53,874
You. The Wraith have sensed a crop worth
harvesting and they've come to claim it.

437
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,352
Keras, tell them
that we gotta take this thing down

438
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:02,912
before it gets back to the Stargate.

439
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,956
- Where's the other full-grown?
- Aries...

440
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:12,399
There's a device that shields us
from the machines of the Wraith.

441
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:15,441
- The sacrifices might...
- He'll be in the old city.

442
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:18,959
You've let your fear of the sacrifice
put our people in danger.

443
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:23,036
You have been protected
from the Wraith by a shield.

444
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,716
We turned it off by accident.

445
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:28,319
But if we get it back up,
the Wraith will never come again.

446
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:33,273
There's only one thing I have to do
to make sure they never come again.

447
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,434
Kill you.

448
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:43,274
Come on.

449
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:54,318
Somebody's coming.

450
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:05,078
What is this?

451
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:08,519
- You must come with us now.
- Can't do that. Listen.

452
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:10,674
I need to finish my work here.

453
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:13,403
The Wraith don't care how old you are.

454
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:18,239
I need to get this device turned on and
I am so close, so give me one more shot.

455
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:24,597
Both of you, go to your rooms!

456
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:28,923
You're not buying this, are you?

457
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,954
Hey!

458
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,562
No.

459
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,833
Sir, I don't like where this is headed.

460
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,994
Easy, Ford.

461
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,120
Nobody's shooting just yet.

462
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:00,832
- Yet.
- And nobody's going to, either.

463
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:04,712
Aries, you have no idea
what you're up against here.

464
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,833
Our weapons are more powerful
than any you have ever seen.

465
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:12,279
She's telling the truth.
They do more than make a lot of noise.

466
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:14,195
They will kill you.

467
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

468
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,554
- It works.
- Of course it works.

469
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,918
I must tell Aries. Come with us.

470
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,234
Hey, you guys OK?

471
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,792
Head back to the village. You'll be fine.

472
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:07,039
Your presence has brought the Wraith.

473
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,876
All our ancestors' sacrifices
you've undone.

474
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:14,002
- All because you refused to leave.
- It's not that simple.

475
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:16,836
Yeah, it is that simple.

476
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,273
- Aries, no.
- Keras!

477
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:27,762
- Sir?
- Hold your fire!

478
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:32,241
Look what you've done.

479
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,792
He's as guilty as you are.

480
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,393
- Ford.
- Ready, sir.

481
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,952
We will defend ourselves.

482
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:45,035
And, believe me, you don't want that.

483
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,438
Archers, ready!

484
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:56,758
It works! Aries!

485
00:38:57,523 --> 00:39:00,720
It works! The device works.

486
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,602
The device they speak of is real.
I've seen it.

487
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,122
What?

488
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:12,514
McKay fixed it and the Wraith bird
fell right out of the sky.

489
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,562
- That doesn't matter...
- Aries, it works.

490
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,034
You all right, McKay?

491
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,923
Trying to catch my breath.

492
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:38,520
Get the medical kit from the jumper.
You're gonna be OK.

00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:59,239
I was able to boost the coverage by over
50% without much of a power increase.

494
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:02,952
That should be enough
for a sizeable population growth.

495
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:06,160
Thank you. You have no idea
how long the shield will last?

496
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:10,999
There's no way of knowing, but there's
a good chance you'll be a grandparent.

497
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:14,522
We'd be happy to come back
and check in on you.

498
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:17,322
Ford could explain
how to be a 25-year-old.

499
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:21,158
- I'll look forward to it.
- You'll have to get used to a few things.

500
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:23,883
But we can talk about that
next time we visit.

501
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:27,922
- Just promise me you'll stick around.
- I will.

502
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,392
All the villages agreed
to suspend sacrifices?

503
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:34,112
They will require us to change some laws,
but for now, yes.

504
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,917
- Sir.
- Oh, right. Here.

505
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:42,962
What's this?

506
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:46,513
Where we're from, you get presents
when you turn a year older.

507
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:52,633
See him there.

508
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:54,998
Happy birthday.

509
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,674
Here we go.

510
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:07,232
Here you go. One for you.
