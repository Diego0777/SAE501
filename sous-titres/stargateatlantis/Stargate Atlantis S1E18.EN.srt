1
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,594
Major Sheppard.

2
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:30,234
Major!

3
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:20,881
- Continue.
- Going easy on me, huh?

4
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:23,841
I assure you, Major, I am not.
Continue.

5
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,434
You OK?

6
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,392
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

7
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,236
It's usually me
picking my butt up off the mat.

8
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,598
I have not been sleeping much.

9
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,402
I've been having nightmares
about the Wraith.

10
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,077
You're not the only one.

11
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:55,395
It has not been so bad
since my father was taken.

12
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,638
According to Dr Zelenka's calculations,

13
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:09,273
we have less than one week
before the Wraith arrive.

14
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,755
- I want options.
- Besides crying ourselves to sleep?

15
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,039
Not me. I haven't slept in days.

16
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:19,036
What do you have to show
for your sleepless nights?

17
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:22,718
We've uncovered defensive
weapons systems beyond the shield...

18
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:26,432
- Our best option is the control chair.
- I was gonna say that.

19
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:29,993
- You were taking too long.
- It may not be our best chance.

20
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:33,439
- Gentlemen.
- Power will be our biggest problem.

21
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:38,313
We haven't initialised the chair yet,
let alone determined if we have the power.

22
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,474
OK. Keep me posted.

23
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:43,396
Sergeant Bates,
where are we with our Alpha site?

24
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:47,602
We've completed the security sweep
and are ready to establish base camp.

25
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:49,879
Awaiting inspection by Major Sheppard.

26
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,477
- Right after lunch.
- Good.

27
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:55,396
Are the Athosians
prepared for an evacuation?

28
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:59,476
Yes, but many believe there is
no other world safe from the Wraith.

29
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:05,195
- They want to stay?
- There are cullings all over the galaxy.

30
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,194
We have spent our lives hiding.

31
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:10,833
The difference here being
we do intend to destroy the city

32
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:14,040
rather than let it fall
into the hands of the Wraith.

33
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:18,719
Anyone left on the mainland
will be cut off from the Stargate for good.

34
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,875
Thanks to Rodney's discovery
of the control crystal,

35
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:26,275
we can take that with us and hopefully
use it to access Earth in the future.

36
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,162
We understand that, Dr Weir.

37
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:30,722
I'm sorry...

38
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:36,037
The people of Athos wish you to know
that they too will help defend the city.

39
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,876
- That is very honourable, but...
- Please!

40
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:41,113
We can't possibly stay and fight.

41
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:45,435
I disagree. I think it's entirely
within the realm of possibility.

42
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:48,595
There are tens of thousands
of life-sucking aliens

43
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:51,675
in advanced spaceships
on their way to destroy us,

44
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:56,553
and we have 200 people, mostly scientists
who've never even fired a gun before.

45
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,511
Shockingly, for the first time ever,
I have to agree with Kavanagh.

46
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:04,392
All I'm saying is
let's not give up just yet.

47
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:08,476
What was that we were supposed
to all remember? Something important.

48
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:11,919
- The Alamo.
- Granted, you guys are scientists.

49
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,474
No one will put you on the front line,
but science can turn the tide of war.

50
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:21,034
- Look at the A-bomb.
- Not exactly our proudest moment.

51
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:26,835
The Wraith aren't here yet, and until then
remain focused on what you do best.

52
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:31,360
Like I said off the top,
if there are any options, I want them.

53
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,514
That's all.

54
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,640
Teyla?

55
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,714
Hi.

56
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,953
Kate Heightmeyer.

57
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,591
Yes, right. I knew that. I'm sorry.

58
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:01,277
No problem. Mind if I join you?

59
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,194
No, of course not.

60
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,080
Strange how the memory
just goes away when we're tired.

61
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:12,758
- You are a doctor, right?
- Psychologist, actually.

62
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:16,482
And that is different than Dr Beckett?

63
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,512
Quite, yes.

64
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,674
I deal with the mind.

65
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:24,038
I help people with emotional problems

66
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:27,718
like anxiety, depression,
post-traumatic distress.

67
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:31,193
Needless to say,
I've been pretty busy since we got here.

68
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,160
I can imagine.

69
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:37,441
I'm sure you do a lot of the same things
that I do for your people,

70
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:41,755
but it must be very hard on you,
always having to keep such a brave face.

71
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:44,039
From strength comes hope.

72
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:47,798
Without hope, my people would be lost.

73
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:52,479
You must feel you have to be
outwardly strong for us as well.

74
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:58,033
I know that your value and your loyalty
have been questioned by a few in the past.

75
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:02,719
What I'm trying to say to you is
if you ever need to talk, I'm here.

76
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,351
Did Major Sheppard ask you
to speak with me?

77
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:07,798
- Yes, he may have...
- I'm sorry.

78
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:12,320
I do not mean to be rude,
but I'm fine. Really.

79
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,594
I appreciate your concern.

80
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,153
Major.

81
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:36,712
- Teyla.
- What did you tell Dr Heightmeyer?

82
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:41,195
What you told me, that you couldn't sleep
because you were having nightmares.

83
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:45,800
- I confided in you.
- You're in my team, so my responsibility.

84
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:51,321
And I only told one person, whose job is
to deal exactly with this sort of thing.

85
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:55,362
- There is nothing wrong with my mind.
- Nobody said there was.

86
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:59,516
It's hard enough with your people
without them thinking I'm crazy.

87
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:03,153
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.
- That is not the point.

88
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:07,282
Look, Teyla,
you may wanna sit this one out.

89
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:10,435
- What do you mean?
- Rodney's staying back.

90
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:14,198
Ford and I are gonna check out
the Alpha site before we move in.

91
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:17,082
My people will be forced
to that planet as well.

92
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:20,041
And I'll make sure it's safe for everyone.

93
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:24,242
Look, I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with you, God forbid,

94
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:27,554
but you admitted that
you were a little off your game.

95
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:30,760
You snapped at Dr Weir
for no good reason.

96
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:35,553
Now you're biting my head off for caring
that it's three days since you slept.

97
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:39,193
I'm sorry, but I do not need any help.

98
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:42,002
The Wraith are coming.
I need to do something.

99
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:45,792
OK. Good. I suggest you take a nap.

100
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,753
- Teyla.
- Dr McKay.

101
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,594
I was just...

102
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:29,393
We're seeing each other.

103
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:33,756
You and Dr Heightmeyer?

104
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:39,313
Well, you know how much
I love women with great... minds.

105
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,122
Just don't say anything to anyone.

106
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:46,276
- Your secret is safe with me.
- Right. Very good. Excellent.

107
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,436
- Dr Heightmeyer?
- Teyla. Come in.

108
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,719
I'm sorry to bother you.

109
00:10:56,883 --> 00:11:00,592
- Is it all right if I...?
- Of course. Please, have a seat.

110
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:15,794
I guess I'm not really sure
how this is supposed to work.

111
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,915
Just relax.
Tell me whatever's on your mind.

112
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,552
I have been having bad dreams.

113
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,794
I feel...

114
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:36,479
Everyone is afraid.
I do not know why I'm bothering you...

115
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,918
Could you always sense the Wraith?

116
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,359
Yes. Since I can remember.

117
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:45,196
What does it feel like?

118
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:58,997
It feels like a deep cold
that comes from within.

119
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:03,436
I first felt it when I was a girl.

120
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,720
I could not breathe,
and I did not know why,

121
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:09,192
and then we heard the darts.

122
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,275
Do you feel that way now?

123
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:16,482
I have had a knot inside me
for some time now.

124
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:20,795
As I understand, their ships
are still a great distance from Atlantis.

125
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:24,558
Can you really sense them
from so far away?

126
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:29,274
This feeling is a little different
than in the past.

127
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:32,082
Perhaps it is because
it is always there now.

128
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:35,474
I am getting used to it.

129
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:39,682
Never before in my lifetime
have so many Wraith been awake.

130
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,232
Do many of your people have this ability?

131
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,200
Some.

132
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,959
Among those few, some can sense
the Wraith stronger than others.

133
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,717
I am among the first
to know they are coming.

134
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:55,239
That makes you special.
How does that make you feel?

135
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:58,839
- I have not given it much thought.
- Why not?

136
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:01,915
Why do some people
have blue eyes and others brown?

137
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,674
Tell me about your nightmares.

138
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,634
It was me.

139
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,759
You were standing over yourself?

140
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:58,836
It was me, but it was not me.
I was a Wraith.

141
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,439
People waste a lot of time
trying to interpret their dreams.

142
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:06,721
They're just another way our brain thinks.
There are no hidden meanings.

143
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:09,522
We forget most everything
we dream about.

144
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,596
Our conscious mind is capable
of deciding what's most important to us.

145
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:18,883
The fact that, on some level, I see myself
as a Wraith is very disturbing to me.

146
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:23,559
I think this special ability you have,
this talent for sensing the Wraith,

147
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,237
connects you to them in your mind,

148
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:29,998
maybe in a way you would like to deny.

149
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:33,997
You said you hadn't given it
much thought. I don't think that's true.

150
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,802
What am I supposed to do?
I cannot change it.

151
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,673
Probably not,
but the unknown frightens us.

152
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:45,358
We all like to feel in control,
even though most of the time

153
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:48,959
our power over most things
is just an illusion,

154
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,637
but I find the more we know
about something,

155
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,591
the more we can convince ourselves
we are in control of it.

156
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,882
I ran every test I could on all of you.

157
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,432
You and your people
are the same as we are.

158
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,481
I have no explanation
for your special superpowers.

159
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,919
- I only have one.
- I've seen you fight, my dear.

160
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,912
This ability is something that
is passed on through family lineage.

161
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,120
- Does that not make it biological?
- It would seem so.

162
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,036
But without samples
from everyone in your family,

163
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:27,039
I would have little chance of identifying
what causes the anatomical response.

164
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:29,194
It'd be difficult.

165
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,678
Any chance you would have time
to fly me over to the mainland?

166
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:37,392
If you're willing to take your life
into your own hands.

167
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,554
I'd love a break.

168
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,359
You've changed, Teyla.

169
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,482
- My hair is shorter.
- It's more than your hair, dear.

170
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:06,398
I can still see the little girl
who used to paint me beautiful pictures

171
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,555
while she sang the songs of the Ancients.

172
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:11,953
I have not been her in a long time, Charin.

173
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:15,160
No, but even Teyla,
leader of the Athosians,

174
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:18,872
always found the time
to come and visit with poor old Charin.

175
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,477
I have missed your tuttleroot soup.

176
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:25,921
But I suspect it's more than my soup
that has brought you here.

177
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,599
You've come to pluck me from my tent
and take me to yet another world.

178
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,196
Not yet,

179
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:37,118
but it seems we may have to evacuate
again soon, at least temporarily.

180
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:41,391
Did you allow yourself
to expect differently?

181
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:46,114
I still believe that we can one day
be free of the Wraith.

182
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:52,199
You can save such stories for those
whose bones aren't failing them.

183
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:58,282
Charin, do you know
why I can sense the Wraith coming?

184
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:02,516
You were born to it. There have been
a few in every generation.

185
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:06,995
I know, but has no one ever wondered
how that is possible?

186
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:11,679
Some believe it was a gift
from the Ancestors.

187
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:13,561
And you?

188
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:18,674
Your father asked me not to tell you.

189
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:23,838
My father is not here any more.

190
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:31,673
No other living Athosian knows of this,
for good reason.

191
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,641
Please, tell me anyway.

192
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:43,638
My grandfather used to tell a story,

193
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:47,352
no one has ever heard the like
before or since,

194
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:51,357
about the few who once returned.

195
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:55,316
Returned?

196
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:58,236
There was a planet.

197
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:01,076
As was expected, every so often,

198
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:04,758
the Wraith came, villagers were taken.

199
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:08,120
But there, on this particular planet,

200
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:14,233
on several occasions,
the taken came back.

201
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,239
<i>Some believed the Ancestors</i>
<i>had returned their loved ones,</i>

202
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:25,600
that they had been blessed with a gift

203
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:28,197
that made them unwanted by the Wraith.

204
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:32,641
Others even told tales of how the taken
had somehow vanquished the Wraith,

205
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:35,317
but soon the taken began to be feared.

206
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:38,873
- Why?
- They spoke of hearing voices.

207
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:41,557
Many began to behave strangely.

208
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:45,272
Some became violent, even murderous.

209
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:49,231
Well, it doesn't sound like
the Ancients were responsible for that.

210
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,315
The villagers turned on the taken.
It was a massacre.

211
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:56,795
All but a few were killed.
The rest were ostracised and sent away.

212
00:18:56,963 --> 00:19:01,354
After that, no others that were taken
from that village ever returned again,

213
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,878
but those few who survived,

214
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:09,037
they are the ones
who Charin believes passed on the gift.

215
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:13,276
- And one of the taken that survived was...
- My lineage.

216
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,957
I have the address to the planet.

217
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:20,196
Charin says the village is long gone.
All that is left are ruins.

218
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:24,197
- Still I wish to go there.
- Now?

219
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,436
I believe this must be
coming to light now for a reason.

220
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,640
Maybe we can find evidence
of what really happened.

221
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,442
There are a lot of things
we need to get done.

222
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:38,278
Maybe there is a way to fight the Wraith
we have yet to discover.

223
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,436
Perhaps my ancestors
were simply not enlightened enough

224
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:45,675
to recognise their gift for what it was.

225
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,271
Doesn't hurt to take a look around.

226
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,477
- Sir, there's nothing here.
- I know.

227
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,636
- It's dark. Shouldn't we be getting back?
- Just give her a minute.

228
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,920
- Sir...
- I need her to put this behind her, sleep.

229
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,756
We all do, so whatever it takes.

230
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,351
- Rodney?
- I've got something here.

231
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,832
- Really?
- I don't know.

232
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:25,517
I've got a little...

233
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:30,876
You've got a little what?
Hey, McKay, you've got a little what?

234
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:34,474
What?

235
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:39,639
- It's OK when you guys make fun of me.
- Rodney?

236
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:44,831
Picking up a faint energy signal.
It's getting stronger.

237
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,836
- It's coming from here.
- There's nothing here.

238
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:52,841
- The magic Ancient device hasn't lied yet.
- It's solid.

239
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,439
- There's definitely something weird here.
- Weird how?

240
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:00,714
- How about that?
- Teyla! Teyla!

241
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:05,358
Maybe if you got a good running start,
really slam into it.

242
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,798
- How'd you do that?
- I do not know.

243
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:16,921
I was just looking for a way out.

244
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:31,997
- Looks like the inside of a Wraith ship.
- What the hell were they doing here?

245
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:48,158
- Rodney.
- Elizabeth.

246
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,359
You found a Wraith laboratory?

247
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:53,435
Looks that way.
Some sort of hidden secret facility.

248
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,232
It's obviously been abandoned
for a very long time.

249
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:01,282
I pulled this data recorder
from one of the computer consoles.

250
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:04,003
The Wraith were experimenting
on the people?

251
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:07,394
- No idea. Hoping this will tell us.
- Why the secrecy?

252
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:12,876
The Wraith can take people at will
and do whatever they want with them.

253
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:15,273
Here we go.

254
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:18,442
There.

255
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,676
Now... that means
absolutely nothing to me.

256
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:27,359
Last time I saw one of these, it showed
a galactic positioning system for ships.

257
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:31,072
- More pictures than symbols.
- I wonder...

258
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:36,039
Just so you know, you didn't
finish that sentence out loud.

259
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:39,559
- Well, this is obviously a language.
- Wraith language?

260
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:43,238
That would make sense.
I'd love to have a look through this.

261
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,476
Knock yourself out. I gotta get back
to the control chair anyway.

262
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:56,152
- Why could only you access the doorway?
- I don't know.

263
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:58,712
Only a Wraith can enter a Wraith facility?

264
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:04,037
- I'm not a Wraith.
- What does it feel like to be a Wraith?

265
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,319
I feel hungry.

266
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:19,763
Remember what happened
last time I sat in one?

267
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:23,916
- There's nowhere near enough power.
- Then why bother? It's quite late.

268
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:29,157
We are trying to determine how much
power is required to operate the systems.

269
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:32,235
- And it needs to be on.
- You have the gene now.

270
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:35,998
I can't analyse the data
while keeping the damn thing activated.

271
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:38,552
- You analyse it.
- Rodney doesn't think...

272
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:41,362
- Gentlemen, how's it coming?
- Well, not good.

273
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:44,560
- This won't help. Carson, I need you.
- Thank God.

274
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,839
- We're using him.
- Is someone hurt?

275
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,959
- You were right.
- Lovely. About what?

276
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:53,753
Your theory of the Wraith evolving
after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

277
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:56,198
- Pay up.
- How do you know?

278
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:59,719
- Wraith language is derived from Ancient.
- That doesn't...

279
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:03,671
Rodney, please.
That's not why I need to see you.

280
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,880
I've been able to translate
the first part of the log.

281
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,034
Really?

282
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:14,756
- We'll try Dr Kusanagi again. Now.
- OK.

283
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:16,800
Thank you.

284
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:29,595
Good morning. You look like I feel.

285
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:34,321
Well, we've been up all night.

286
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:36,838
You wanted to see me?

287
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:39,517
- You'd better sit down.
- What is it?

288
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:46,716
Well, I translated the first part
of the log you brought back and...

289
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:50,319
Are you sure
you don't wanna have a seat?

290
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,993
The Wraith were conducting experiments
on your ancestors.

291
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,279
It was just one Wraith, actually.

292
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:02,118
He was doing it against the wishes
of the other Wraith, in secret.

293
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,638
What was he doing?

294
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,397
I think he was trying
to make their food source

295
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:09,554
more compatible with their species.

296
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:13,318
- I do not understand.
- It was very easy to miss.

297
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:17,795
I couldn't even make the comparison
necessary to isolate the specific strand.

298
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:20,272
We needed Wraith cells, which we got,

299
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:24,277
but also a mapping of the genetic
code which wasn't 50% complete...

300
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:26,798
Please.

301
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:29,682
Tell me.

302
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:33,597
You have some Wraith DNA
in your genetic make-up.

303
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:40,515
- Teyla is part Wraith?
- A very small part.

304
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:44,358
She's as different from us as you
because of your Ancient gene.

305
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:47,595
- And some other things.
- Bates is gonna go nuts.

306
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:52,234
- Let's keep this one under our hat.
- Teyla is concerned how we will react.

307
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:56,635
You think this Wraith scientist
was trying to make humans more tasty?

308
00:25:56,803 --> 00:26:00,876
The log indicates that he wanted
to make the feeding more efficient.

309
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:04,638
You said they had genetic characteristics
similar to humans.

310
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:09,638
They do, but they're still closer to the bug
that attacked Major Sheppard than us.

311
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:12,522
- We weren't gonna mention that again.
- Sorry.

312
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:15,641
Also interesting is the fact
that the Wraith language

313
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:17,998
appears to be a derivative of Ancient,

314
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:22,475
which suggests that the Wraith evolved
after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

315
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:29,242
The Ancients unwittingly allowed humans
to evolve on a planet with insects on it.

316
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:34,272
At some point, the insects fed on humans
and incorporated our DNA into theirs.

317
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,513
The Wraith are an evolution of that.

318
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:40,198
So you're saying the Ancients
actually created the Wraith?

319
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:42,513
- By accident.
- Or negligence.

320
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:44,002
It doesn't matter.

321
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:46,438
The more we know
about Wraith physiology,

322
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:50,312
the closer we get to a weapon that can
attack them and leave us unharmed.

323
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:55,477
Yes, but all we know is that the Ancients
might have created the Wraith,

324
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,111
and why Teyla can sense them coming.

325
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,322
Fabulous, mystery solved,
but that doesn't stop them from coming.

326
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:05,759
Rodney's right. Let's get back to work.

327
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:08,474
Thank you.

328
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,640
I know it is not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.

329
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:18,194
The fact is, I'm really no different now
than I was yesterday or last week.

330
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:20,433
But you feel different.

331
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:22,594
Yes.

332
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:29,794
The thing that I am most worried about
is how people will perceive me.

333
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:34,878
My father told people that it was a gift,
I was special, but in a good way.

334
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:39,161
I could help my people by warning them
of the Wraith's approach.

335
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:44,795
He did it to protect me, but I think that it is
why they first turned to me as a leader.

336
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,239
As you said, you're no different
than you were yesterday.

337
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:51,873
Yes, but now they have reason
to fear me.

338
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,871
Even with Major Sheppard in the chair,
we weren't able to...

339
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:01,920
What? What is that?

340
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:07,795
Something you said made me wonder...

341
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:12,682
- There are more important...
- Why did that Wraith stop experimenting?

342
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:15,801
- What did I say?
- I don't remember.

343
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:19,842
It's a good point. I'm just wondering
what I said. What have you got?

344
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:22,358
At first I thought
the other Wraith caught him.

345
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,878
- They didn't?
- He stopped on his own.

346
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:28,240
Why didn't the Wraith want
these experiments taking place?

347
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:32,635
- Exactly.
- They were intended to improve things.

348
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,361
- That's it.
- I just said it.

349
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:37,595
- Will you stop?
- Here's the most interesting part.

350
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:41,039
The Wraith communicate
using a telepathic network.

351
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,795
I noticed that.

352
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:47,479
Thankfully, they can't seem to read
the minds of humans, though.

353
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,601
What does this have to do
with the experiments?

354
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:54,233
By combining even small amounts
of Wraith DNA with humans,

355
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:57,793
the scientist was giving the humans
Wraith mental abilities.

356
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:01,956
The subjects of his experiments
could hear the Wraith communications.

357
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,842
The voices that the people heard were...

358
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:09,121
Were Wraith. Exactly.
It must have driven them mad.

359
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:13,196
The Wraith scientist couldn't find
a way around it, so he gave up.

360
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:16,002
Why let them back
into the general population?

361
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:21,191
He thought that interbreeding with
normal humans might dilute the effect.

362
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:23,479
Before he realised, it was too late.

363
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:26,635
When the other Wraith did find out
what he had done,

364
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:29,795
they wiped out all the people on the planet.

365
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:34,834
But not before several test subjects
had been ostracised and forced to leave.

366
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:36,436
How does this help us?

367
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:41,518
Teyla may have more than just the ability
to sense the Wraith coming.

368
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:45,995
You think Teyla might be able
to tap into this Wraith psychic network?

369
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:50,953
If she can, we'll be able to gather
all the intel we ever needed about them.

370
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:01,240
I have never been able to hear
the thoughts of the Wraith.

371
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:05,635
According to the notes, those who were
given the Wraith DNA had the ability.

372
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:08,237
You've never actually tried before.

373
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:12,874
You didn't know you could read
Wraith minds. Who would want to?

374
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:18,281
I would not even consider
asking you to do this

375
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,992
if I didn't think it could provide us
with vital information.

376
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,677
I just do not know what to do.

377
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:26,879
Dr Heightmeyer has a theory.

378
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:30,274
I think it's possible
that through several generations,

379
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,957
people have developed a mental barrier

380
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:37,002
to the thought projections of the Wraith,
a self-defence mechanism.

381
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,313
- If we can get past that...
- How?

382
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:41,713
We have a process called hypnosis.

383
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,874
Dr Heightmeyer can lead you through it

384
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:48,275
and Dr Beckett will remain on hand
at all times to monitor your physiology.

385
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,877
The Wraith are far away, are they not?

386
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:54,877
Yes, and McKay has some doubts
about the range of this telepathy.

387
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:57,762
But, as you said,
you can sense the Wraith now.

388
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,359
If that's a bleed-through effect
of a greater latent ability,

389
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:04,321
then it may be worth
trying to break the barrier.

390
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:07,953
It's not something
I would ever recommend doing

391
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:10,557
under any other circumstances.

392
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:14,682
But these are far from normal
circumstances that we're in, Teyla.

393
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:20,201
If I can somehow provide us with
something, their strategy, a weakness...

394
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:23,036
...I see no other choice.

395
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:32,474
OK, I think we're ready.

396
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,918
Are you?

397
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,517
OK, I want you to breathe...

398
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,992
...nice and deeply, and try to relax.

399
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:42,916
Dr Beckett's going to administer
a mild sedative.

400
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,075
We should still be able to communicate.

401
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:49,997
We can wake you at any time
using a low-grade electrical current.

402
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:54,759
It won't hurt at all.
Just say "out" and we'll end it.

403
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,798
Now, focus on this light as I speak.

404
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:04,273
The feeling you get from the Wraith
is a cold, dark feeling deep inside you.

405
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,638
I want you to think about that.

406
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:09,033
Look for it in your mind.

407
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,512
Now, close your eyes and listen to it.

408
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:13,913
Don't resist.

409
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,472
Go to that place where it lives.

410
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:26,034
What do you hear?

411
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:30,714
Nothing.

412
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,917
Your father was taken by the Wraith.

413
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,597
Do you remember sensing it that day?

414
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:41,392
- Yes.
- Think back to that feeling.

415
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,994
Now listen.

416
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:47,796
What do you hear?

417
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:49,396
Noise.

418
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:52,396
Voices, so many voices, whispering.

419
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:55,635
Listen closely. Listen for one.

420
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:01,797
- I can see.
- Tell us what you see, Teyla.

421
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:05,035
I am on a ship.

422
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:08,036
- I am walking.
- She can see what's happening?

423
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:11,400
The Wraith's thoughts
may include what they're seeing.

424
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:15,078
There are other Wraith,
and they do not notice me.

425
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:21,391
I am in a room full of people being
preserved so that they can be fed upon.

426
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,074
Aargh!

427
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:29,553
I am feeding. I am killing him!

428
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:33,440
Stop. Beckett, stop.

429
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:37,437
It's OK. It's OK. You're here, in Atlantis.

430
00:33:37,603 --> 00:33:41,278
Teyla, I... I had no right
to ask you to do this.

431
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:48,431
- Get these things off of me.
- Settle down. I have to take this off.

432
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:51,515
I can't put her through this.
It's too much to ask.

433
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:55,358
You might feel differently
once the hive ships show up.

434
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:57,878
- Why did you make them stop?
- Excuse me?

435
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:00,432
I was on one of the hive ships
headed here.

436
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,993
I could hear them. I could see.
It was working.

437
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:07,314
- You were watching them feed.
- Yes.

438
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:10,475
I actually felt one of them feed,
but I can handle it.

439
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:13,237
- I can help us.
- I never should've...

440
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:15,473
I am going to try again.

441
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:28,921
I am walking through the ship.

442
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:35,361
<i>I am in some sort of control room</i>.

443
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,875
Er...

444
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,314
You are all so pathetic.

445
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:59,322
Something tells me
that's not Teyla talking.

446
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:01,838
Nothing can stop us.

447
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,800
Wake her up.

448
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,073
- You are all going to die.
- Now!

449
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:21,437
What happened?

450
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:26,954
Dr Beckett has her sedated.

451
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:30,672
I would like some time
to let what she's been through sink in.

452
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:35,121
She may be in shock. I have no idea
what the long-term effect will be.

453
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:38,673
She said she could see
some type of control room.

454
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,960
- She just needs to get a better look.
- You were there.

455
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,273
A Wraith had control of her.

456
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:50,954
Incoming wormhole.

457
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:59,517
Sergeant Bates' IDC. It's the Alpha site.

458
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:02,595
<i>This is Sergeant Bates. Code red</i>.
<i>We're under attack!</i>

459
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:04,754
Lower the shields.

460
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:16,032
Move it, move it!

461
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,837
- That's it, we're clear!
- Raise the shield!

462
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:24,719
Is everybody OK?

463
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,522
All off-world personnel accounted for.

464
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,560
That planet isn't safe any more.

465
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:33,033
They dropped a device by the gate
as we were leaving.

466
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:35,000
They're tagging the planet.

467
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:37,552
If we evacuate,
we need a new place to go.

468
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:40,191
It was uninhabited.
Why did the Wraith want it?

469
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,958
I don't know.
It's almost like they knew we were there.

470
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:53,957
I was close. I was so close.
I really think if I had another chance...

471
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:56,114
You don't have to prove anything.

472
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:59,480
I think this could make a difference.
I saw a hologram.

473
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:02,111
I think it was a map, maybe a battle plan.

474
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,513
Their battle plan is to wipe us out.

475
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:08,153
I'm not so sure that is true.
They want something from us.

476
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:11,918
- Yeah, they wanna eat us.
- No, something more.

477
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,074
- They are desperate.
- Really?

478
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:16,040
Yes, it is surprising.

479
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:19,320
They are confident
in their dominance over us,

480
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:21,951
but mainly because
there are so many of them;

481
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,159
too many to sustain for long.

482
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:28,794
They have all awakened early and
there is not enough food to go around.

483
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:32,876
It was just a feeling.
The voices were so hard to separate.

484
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,432
You don't remember
one speaking through you?

485
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:39,516
No, but I remember
the feeling just before it happened.

486
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:42,800
- Next time...
- Dr Weir won't let there be a next time.

487
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:53,679
If that's true, chances are it was Teyla
who gave away our location to the Wraith.

488
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:56,960
- There wasn't time.
- Maybe they had a ship in the area.

489
00:37:57,123 --> 00:38:01,196
I admit asking Teyla to connect
with the Wraith may have been a mistake.

490
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,718
With respect, there's no doubt about that.

491
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:08,195
Take it easy, Sergeant. It's not like
she wilfully gave away our position.

492
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:10,831
She wants to try again.

493
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:14,518
She was close to something big
she's convinced we need to know.

494
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:18,676
I'm sorry. I'm not sure Teyla's
thinking about what's best for herself.

495
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,674
She could compromise us further.

496
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:24,040
We have more to gain from the Wraith
than they do from us.

497
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:28,116
She wants to do it. There may be
nothing we can do to stop her trying,

498
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:32,196
so isn't it better if we're all there?

499
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:39,959
OK. Close your eyes and relax

500
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,512
and listen for the voices.

501
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,873
Teyla?

502
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,238
- Break the connection.
- It's not working.

503
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:09,520
- No!
- Teyla!

504
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:49,321
<i>I hope we haven't caused her</i>
<i>psychological damage</i>.

505
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:54,273
Teyla's strong. She's been able to hold it
together after what she's been through.

506
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:58,036
There you are. Major, Dr Weir.

507
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:00,034
Carson, how are you feeling?

508
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:02,433
Doozy of a headache, but I'll be fine.

509
00:40:02,603 --> 00:40:05,675
Teyla's awake.
She wants to see both of you.

510
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,074
Teyla, can I get you some water?

511
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:16,713
No. I am so sorry.

512
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:20,512
- I thought I could prevent...
- It's all right. Everyone's fine.

513
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,243
We are concerned
the Wraith can connect at will.

514
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,963
It has never happened before.

515
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,911
No, I am sure
I have to connect with them first.

516
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:34,955
I saw their plans, the route
their ships are taking to get here.

517
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,273
- That's good.
- There's more.

518
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:40,276
They do not just want Atlantis.

519
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:43,276
- They know about you.
- What do you mean?

520
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:47,118
Sumner. The female Wraith
wasn't just feeding on him.

521
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:51,276
- She was interrogating him.
- That is why they're all waking up.

522
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:53,673
That is why they are coming here.

523
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:58,439
They know that Atlantis is the only way
to get to a new, rich feeding ground.

524
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:01,722
Earth.
