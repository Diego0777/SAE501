1
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,619
- Dr Weir.
- Peter.

2
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,017
- You see? Nothing.
- Carson, get back here.

3
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:39,385
Nothing happens! It's a waste of time!
Excuse me, Dr Weir.

4
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:41,539
He's not even trying.

5
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,268
He discovered the gene
this technology responds to.

6
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,066
He wishes he never had it.

7
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,264
- Really?
- Can you believe that?

8
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:52,023
- We could test you a third time, Rodney.
- That's very funny.

9
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:56,386
We've only a handful of people genetically
compatible with Ancient technology

10
00:01:56,548 --> 00:02:00,143
and, despite your heroic efforts
to interface ours with theirs,

11
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:03,698
we need all of them
to sit in this chair, including Dr Beckett.

12
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,381
He's afraid of the thing.

13
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:10,463
This chair controls the most powerful
weapons known to us. <i>I'm</i> afraid of it.

14
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:15,383
But every time someone sits in it, we learn
something new about the Ancients.

15
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:20,941
- Dr Beckett should be proud of his genes.
- It is a random characteristic.

16
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:25,901
This really bothers you,
this whole gene thing?

17
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:28,866
Oh, clearly I am overcome with envy

18
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:31,417
Just the people I need to see.

19
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:36,945
Come with me.

20
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:44,024
We've gotten closer to locating the Lost
City, but were looking in the wrong place.

21
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,938
We thought we had a Stargate address -
six symbols

22
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,986
that determine where
the Ancients went after Antarctica.

23
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,821
Recently, we determined
a seventh symbol.

24
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:01,466
- The point of origin, Earth.
- That's not it.

25
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:05,416
- Then your address must be incorrect.
- Not incorrect. Incomplete.

26
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:10,144
What are you saying, Dr Jackson?

27
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,778
It's an eight-symbol address.

28
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:18,385
It's further away than we imagined,
but it's not out of reach.

29
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,937
- Atlantis?
- Atlantis.

30
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,099
I think we can go there.

31
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,539
Apache, Blackhawk, Cobra, Osprey.

32
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,657
It's a lot of training for the Antarctic.

33
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,137
The one continent I'd never set foot on.

34
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,822
It's one of my least favourite continents.

35
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:26,179
I kind of like it here.

36
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,619
- You like it here?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,338
Be there in about 10 minutes, sir.

38
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,217
We've been through this.
I'm not your man.

39
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,424
- Keep moving.
- I'm a medical doctor.

40
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:44,660
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- I break these things!

41
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:48,218
This has survived
for millions of years. It will survive you.

42
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,107
Now sit down,
close your eyes and concentrate.

43
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,227
Nothing!

44
00:04:57,388 --> 00:05:01,461
This time... just try to imagine an image
of where we are in the solar system.

45
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,747
I think I feel something.

46
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,105
- It could be lunch-related.
- Shut up and concentrate.

47
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,899
Watch out!

48
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:35,140
What did I do?

49
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:38,299
Get us back down there!

50
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:43,548
<i>All inbound craft,</i>
<i>we have a rogue drone</i>

51
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:47,906
<i>that could seek a target on its own.</i>
<i>Land immediately. This is not a drill.</i>

52
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,343
It's too late. Hang on!

53
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,220
Break right!

54
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:06,059
- I said right!
- I'm getting to that, sir.

55
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,779
- I told you I was the wrong person.
- Just do something!

56
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,620
- Like what?
- Carson...

57
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:22,781
concentrate on shutting that weapon down
before it hurts someone.

58
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:34,337
- I can't see it!
- Pull up. Pull up!

59
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,824
- What about now?
- Now's good.

60
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,899
Shut it down!

61
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,383
- Sir, what the hell was that?
- Wait for it.

62
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,380
Get out!

63
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:29,822
I think I did it.

64
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:43,943
- That was different.
- For me... not so much.

65
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:48,147
The drone appears
to have been incapacitated.

66
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:53,382
General O'Neill's helicopter
is unharmed and on its way again.

67
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:57,097
- Seven minutes out.
- Thank God.

68
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,986
Holy crap!

69
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,385
- Jack!
- Daniel!

70
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:08,540
- Warm welcome
- It wasn't me. How did you...

71
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,699
Keep my ass from getting blown up?

72
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:14,543
The exceptional flying
of Major John Sheppard. He likes it here.

73
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,906
- Exceptional? You like it here?
- Let's say you start talking real fast.

74
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,184
Weir's in here.

75
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,339
Hey! Don't touch anything.

76
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,100
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:35,664
I figure the Ancients packed up and left
between five and ten million years ago.

78
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,578
In their... flying city?

79
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,545
Yes.

80
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:44,899
What?

81
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,500
Flying city?

82
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:51,866
Well, keep in mind
this is the race that built the Stargates.

83
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,825
They did everything big.

84
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,899
So, why did they leave?

85
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,105
Um, who knows?
On Earth, they suffered from a plague.

86
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:03,978
Maybe some of them were trying to start
over, seeding life in a new galaxy.

87
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:07,379
- The point is, we know where they went.
- Pegasus.

88
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,346
Yes. It's a dwarf galaxy in the local group.

89
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,227
Is there any hope
of actually meeting them?

90
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:16,380
Well, who knows,
but isn't that reason enough to go?

91
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,905
I've been choosing members
for this expedition for months.

92
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:24,856
- I'm not the one who needs convincing.
- Well, I'm convinced.

93
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:29,623
- Have fun.
- It's a little more complicated than that.

94
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:32,905
We need the Zed PM to power the gate.

95
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:36,697
- What?
- The ZPM. He's... he's Canadian.

96
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:40,780
- I'm sorry.
- The Zero Point Module, General.

97
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,985
The power source
you recovered from Proclarush Taonas.

98
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,343
It's now powering the outpost defences.

99
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:50,103
I've determined it generates
its enormous power from vacuum energy

100
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,021
from a self-contained region
of subspace time.

101
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:56,180
That was a waste
of a perfectly good explanation.

102
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:59,426
The answer's no.

103
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:04,578
I shut my eyes and saw it.

104
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:08,741
I felt this power I've never had before.
I had it dancing across the sky.

105
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,626
It was magical, it really was.

106
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,585
I don't know where it came from.

107
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:16,343
I just tried to concentrate
and the drone shut itself down.

108
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,942
So you were the one?

109
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:20,427
Me?

110
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:23,902
You're the one who fired that thing at me.

111
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:27,140
Look, we're doing research,

112
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:32,018
working with technology light years
beyond us, and we make mistakes.

113
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm incredibly, incredibly sorry.

114
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,907
- Next time, be more careful.
- That's what I said.

115
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:40,946
- What the hell was that thing, anyway?
- The drone?

116
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,464
- The Ancients built it to defend the place.
- The who?

117
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,426
You do have
security clearance to be here?

118
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:49,579
General O'Neill just gave it to me.

119
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,777
- You don't even know about the Stargate?
- The what?

120
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,622
Gating to another galaxy
requires enormous power.

121
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,860
- Yes. Find another way.
- There's no other way.

122
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:06,900
You think there are
more of these... zed things in Atlantis?

123
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,059
Yes! And who knows what else.

124
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,538
This isn't just anyone.
These are the gate builders.

125
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,381
The potential wealth
of knowledge and technology

126
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:19,939
outweighs anything we've come across
since we stepped through the Stargate.

127
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:24,943
Well, with the amount of power you need
to make this trek, odds are it'll be one-way.

128
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:29,306
Yes, we know, but the benefit to humanity
is far greater than the risk, General.

129
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:33,017
A risk every one of
my expedition members is willing to take.

130
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:42,661
We think the gene was used
as a sort of genetic key, if you will,

131
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:48,061
so that only their kind could operate
dangerous or powerful technologies.

132
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:51,026
Some people have
the same genes as these Ancients?

133
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:55,386
The specific gene is very rare, but, on
the whole, they look very much like we do.

134
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,541
In fact, they were first.
We're the second evolution of this form,

135
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:04,020
the Ancients having explored this galaxy
for millions of years. Please, don't.

136
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,863
Why? What are the odds of me having
the same genes as these guys?

137
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,625
Quite slim, actually. Dr Weir!

138
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:15,585
Don't move!

139
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,905
Who is this?

140
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,860
- I said don't touch anything.
- I just sat down.

141
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:34,100
Major, think about
where we are in the solar system.

142
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,620
Did I do that?

143
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:52,301
We could be on our way to discovering
an entirely new Ancient civilisation.

144
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,461
Best-case scenario, we meet
actual Ancients who are willing to help us.

145
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:58,619
But if we don't...

146
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:01,302
General, we need him.

147
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:05,461
- Sorry, Doc. I need Daniel here.
- I'm talking about Major Sheppard.

148
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:12,102
Oh. Don't you have a dozen or so people
already who can use Ancient technology?

149
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:16,978
Yeah, with concentration and training,
but John Sheppard, he does it naturally.

150
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:22,416
- I checked into his record.
- The black mark in Afghanistan.

151
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:26,627
- He was trying to save lives.
- Disobeying a direct order in the process.

152
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,545
I have read your own file, General. Please.

153
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,107
Right.

154
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,827
OK. It's your expedition.
If you want him, you ask him.

155
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,297
That's the thing. I have.

156
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,505
Really?

157
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:54,176
This isn't a long trip,
so I'll be as succinct as possible.

158
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:01,106
- Well, that's pretty succinct.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:06,897
I told Dr Weir that, you know...
I'd think about it.

160
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,227
And?

161
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,583
So? Well? What?!

162
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:19,416
With all due respect, sir,
we were just attacked by an alien missile.

163
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:21,977
Then I found out I have some mutant gene.

164
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:26,983
Then there's this Stargate thing
and these expeditions to other galaxies...

165
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,742
This isn't about you, Sheppard.
It's a lot bigger.

166
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:34,379
Right now, at this very second, whether I
decide to go or not seems to be about me.

167
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,302
Let me ask you something.

168
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:49,103
- Why did you become a pilot?
- People who don't want to fly are crazy.

169
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:53,819
I think people who don't want to go
through the Stargate are equally whacked.

170
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:58,425
If you can't give me a yes by the time
we reach McMurdo, I don't even want you.

171
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:15,586
<i>Simon, if you're watching this,</i>

172
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,582
<i>it means the president was kind enough</i>
<i>to grant you security clearance.</i>

173
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:23,343
<i>I'm not going on a diplomatic mission</i>
<i>to another country.</i>

174
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,147
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to another planet in another galaxy</i>

175
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,424
<i>by means of a device called a Stargate.</i>

176
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:33,139
<i>Millions of years ago, there was</i>
<i>a race of beings we called the Ancients.</i>

177
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,903
<i>They created a network of these Stargates</i>
<i>throughout our galaxy</i>

178
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,377
<i>in order to travel freely</i>
<i>among their worlds.</i>

179
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:42,301
<i>We don't know why,</i>
<i>but they left for another galaxy</i>

180
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:44,698
<i>five to ten million years ago,</i>

181
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,177
<i>taking their entire city along with them.</i>

182
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,543
<i>That city was called Atlantis.</i>

183
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,906
<i>I have been assembling</i>
<i>an expedition team to try to find Atlantis</i>

184
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:59,017
<i>and, hopefully, the Ancients</i>
<i>who left Earth all those years ago.</i>

185
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:01,782
<i>I want to do this, Simon, with all my heart.</i>

186
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:06,146
<i>You know me well enough to know I could</i>
<i>never turn down an opportunity like this,</i>

187
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,503
<i>but I wanted the chance to tell you...</i>

188
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:18,902
<i>The cellular customer you wish</i>
<i>to reach is outside the coverage area.</i>

189
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:22,105
No kidding.

190
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:32,262
I narrowed it down to three things.
After a week, it just fell into place.

191
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,099
Does anyone else here speak whatever
language these guys are speaking?

192
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:54,177
I just need a couple of minutes
to finish my work and you're not helping.

193
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,340
You've got five minutes
to get it going or I'm leaving.

194
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:03,903
Everything in here has been
double-checked and triple-checked.

195
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,707
- Leave it alone.
- Colonel, I don't answer to you.

196
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:10,656
- He said the same to me, sir.
- That's what your side arm's for.

197
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:16,658
The eight-chevron address tells our gate
to look for a point outside of our galaxy.

198
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,819
We won't know until it locks.

199
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,821
- Are we there yet?
- Just waiting on Dr McKay.

200
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,097
It should work now. That's got it.

201
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:34,296
OK, Sergeant, give it a try. The ZPM
should light up when it senses the gate.

202
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,064
Oh, yeah!

203
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,267
Colonel.

204
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,702
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

205
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,104
All right, here we go.

206
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:16,657
We are about to try to make a connection.

207
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,423
We have been unable to predict
how much power this will take

208
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:24,979
and we may only get one chance,
so if we achieve a stable wormhole,

209
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,616
we're not gonna risk
shutting the gate down.

210
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:32,498
We'll send in the MALP robot probe,
check for viability and go.

211
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,659
Everything in one shot.

212
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:43,059
Every one of you volunteered for this
mission. You represent a dozen countries.

213
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:45,742
You are the world's best and brightest.

214
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:50,979
And in light of the adventure
we are about to embark on...

215
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,139
you are also the bravest.

216
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:58,860
I hope we all return having discovered a
whole new realm for humanity to explore,

217
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,019
but, as all of you know,

218
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,780
we may never be able to return home.

219
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:12,065
I'd like to offer you all one last chance
to withdraw your participation.

220
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,217
Begin the dialling sequence.

221
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,303
Let me make myself clear, Major.

222
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:33,459
You are not here by my choice.

223
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:36,620
I'm sure you'll warm up to me
once you get to know me, sir.

224
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,780
As long as you remember
who's giving the orders.

225
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,105
That would be Dr Weir, right?

226
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:52,464
Chevron three encoded.

227
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:01,617
- Chevron four encoded.
- Nice.

228
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,664
Thank you.

229
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,944
Chevron five encoded.

230
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:15,738
- Chevron six encoded.
- This is it.

231
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,745
Seriously, Doctor, calm down
You're embarrassing me.

232
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:25,025
I've never been so excited in my entire life.

233
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,504
Chevron eight is locked.

234
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,142
Send the MALP.

235
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,137
We have MALP telemetry.

236
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:04,618
- What is it we're looking at?
- Switching to zero locks.

237
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,539
The radar indicates a... large room?

238
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,381
Structurally intact?

239
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:15,540
Sensors say there's oxygen,
no measurable toxins.

240
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,302
We have viable life support.

241
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,302
Looks like we're not getting out of this.

242
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,904
Dr Weir, you have a go.

243
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,505
Thank you.

244
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:33,987
Sir.

245
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:38,065
Let's go, people! We don't know
how much power we've got.

246
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:40,617
Security Teams One and Two, up first.

247
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,586
All other personnel
will follow on our signal!

248
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:47,627
Once on the other side,
keep moving, clear the debarkation area!

249
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:50,586
- On my lead...
- Hold on, Colonel!

250
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,099
We go through together.

251
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,259
Fair enough.

252
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:25,417
- Jack, it's not too late for me...
- No.

253
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:28,739
- I can just grab my... kit.
- No.

254
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:37,583
<i>All clear. It looks good.</i>

255
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:45,066
Expedition Team... move out.

256
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,343
What does it feel like?

257
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:50,499
Hurts like hell, sir.

258
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,500
Whoo-hoo!

259
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:21,102
Teams One and Two,
secure the immediate area.

260
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:49,304
Everyone else, find an open space
and park it until instructed otherwise!

261
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,099
Who's doing that?

262
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,297
Security Teams, any alien contact?

263
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:13,063
<i>- Negative, sir.</i>
<i>- Team Four. Negative, Colonel.</i>

264
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:20,902
The lights are coming on by themselves.

265
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,219
That's everyone.

266
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:03,619
General O'Neill?

267
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:07,701
Atlantis Base offers greetings
from the Pegasus galaxy.

268
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:09,859
You may cut power to the gate.

269
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:09,337
They look like ships.

270
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:12,306
- Spaceships!
- I love it!

271
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:26,702
Dr Weir? You have to see this.

272
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:30,258
I have a lot of things to see.
Just be careful.

273
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,263
- I didn't touch anything.
- Relax, Major.

274
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:48,057
It's like the entire complex is sensing
our presence and coming to life.

275
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:51,220
This is the control room.
Obviously their version of a DHD.

276
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:54,266
- Obviously
- This could be power control systems.

277
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:58,023
- Possibly a computer interface.
- Hey, why don't you find out?

278
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:01,783
<i>Dr Weir, Colonel Sumner.</i>
<i>Can you meet me? Three levels down.</i>

279
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,745
Right away.

280
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,825
We've only secured
a fraction of the place. It's huge.

281
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:13,378
- So it might really be Atlantis?
- I'd say that's a good bet.

282
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,345
Oh, my God.

283
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,459
We're underwater.

284
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:28,779
I'd say we're under
several hundred feet of ocean.

285
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,223
If we can't dial out, it's a problem.

286
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,379
- Colonel. Dr Weir.
- We're underwater!

287
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:38,542
Yes, I was just coming to tell you.
Some sort of force field is holding it back.

288
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,423
That is impressive, isn't it?

289
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:51,660
Uh, Dr Beckett
has found something you should see.

290
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:03,499
<i>..in the hope of spreading new life in</i>
<i>a galaxy where there appeared to be none.</i>

291
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:06,626
<i>Soon the new life grew and prospered.</i>

292
00:28:08,508 --> 00:28:10,499
It's a hologram.

293
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,863
The recording loops. It's my second time.

294
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,098
- What have we missed?
- Not much.

295
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:17,657
<i>..exchange knowledge and friendship.</i>

296
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:23,179
<i>In time, a thousand worlds</i>
<i>bore the fruit of life in this form.</i>

297
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:28,217
<i>Then one day our people set foot upon</i>
<i>a dark world where a terrible enemy slept.</i>

298
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:32,427
<i>Never before had we encountered beings</i>
<i>with powers that rivalled our own.</i>

299
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:36,342
<i>In our overconfidence,</i>
<i>we were unprepared and outnumbered.</i>

300
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:40,103
<i>The enemy fed upon the defenceless</i>
<i>human worlds like a great scourge</i>

301
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,224
<i>until only Atlantis remained.</i>

302
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:46,700
<i>This city's great shield was powerful</i>
<i>enough to withstand their weapons,</i>

303
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:50,178
<i>but here we were besieged</i>
<i>for many years.</i>

304
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,623
<i>In an effort to save the last of our kind,</i>

305
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:55,586
<i>we submerged our great city</i>
<i>into the ocean.</i>

306
00:28:55,748 --> 00:29:00,344
<i>The Atlantis Stargate was the one and only</i>
<i>link back to Earth from this galaxy</i>

307
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:04,706
<i>and those who remained used it to return</i>
<i>to that world that was once home.</i>

308
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,544
<i>There the last survivors of Atlantis</i>
<i>lived out the remainder of their lives.</i>

309
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,620
<i>This city was left to slumber...</i>

310
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:16,098
<i>in the hope</i>
<i>that our kind would one day return.</i>

311
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,387
Huh.

312
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:21,539
So the story of Atlantis is true.

313
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,983
A great city that sank in the ocean.

314
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,820
Just not on Earth.

315
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:29,583
The Greeks must have heard it
from one of the surviving Ancients.

316
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:33,058
I don't like the fact
they got their asses kicked.

317
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:35,378
Let's see it again from the beginning.

318
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,460
Stop! Turn it off!

319
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:42,018
- Power levels are dropping like a stone!
- What does that mean?

320
00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:45,658
If we don't stop everything we're doing
right now, we're dead!

321
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:53,219
Please tell me this is not my fault.

322
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:54,787
- No.
- Thank you!

323
00:29:54,948 --> 00:29:58,736
The city is powered
by three Zero Point Modules.

324
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:01,547
Two are depleted,
the third is reaching entropy.

325
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,462
- When it does, it'll die too.
- Just tell me the bottom line.

326
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:11,385
The force field holding back the ocean has
collapsed to minimum sustainable levels.

327
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:17,020
Look, you can see here and here where
the shield's failed and the city is flooded.

328
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:20,578
This section is likely more protected
because of the Stargate.

329
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,659
What if it fails completely?

330
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:25,296
It's a matter of when, not if.

331
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:30,337
Colonel Sumner, order your security team
to stop searching the city immediately.

332
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,658
Security teams, back to the gate room.

333
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:37,106
- That's not gonna be good enough.
- How much time do we have?

334
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,657
Hours, days if we minimise
power expenditure.

335
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:42,706
- What about our own generators?
- We're working on it.

336
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,019
But the equations
are coming up far short.

337
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:50,147
- So we need to find more ZPMs.
- How do we do that if we can't search?

338
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:54,187
- If there were more, we'd detect them.
- Can we use the Stargate?

339
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:59,297
- Not enough power to reach Earth.
- Maybe somewhere in this galaxy.

340
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:03,467
That's relatively easy.

341
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:08,065
Fortunately, some Ancient technology
still uses good old-fashioned buttons.

342
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:12,062
We've accessed the Stargate controls
and a library of gate addresses.

343
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:14,947
That's not all. Look at this.

344
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:19,379
Just like the iris on the Earth gate.

345
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:22,540
Using power, using power, using power.

346
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,903
At least we won't have uninvited guests.

347
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:29,505
Colonel, assemble a team. We need
safe harbour or another power source.

348
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,705
Lieutenant Ford, gather security teams...

349
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:36,258
- Major, I'd like you to go along.
- Yes, ma'am.

350
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:40,940
All right. Pick an address and start dialling.

351
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:48,459
Chevron one encoded.

352
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:51,060
Rodney...

353
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,067
Fine.

354
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:04,465
Ready MALP 4 for o<i>ffw</i>orld recon.

355
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:33,459
The MALP reads full viability

356
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:37,462
and no immediate activity
around the Stargate, but it's pitch black.

357
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:43,260
We'll use the tried and true system
for identification of inbound gate travellers.

358
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,499
Let's move out!

359
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:43,982
Aaaargh!

360
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,944
Please! Don't hurt us!

361
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:55,265
Please! They're just playing!

362
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:03,183
- Everything OK here, Sheppard?
- Yes, sir. Just a couple of kids.

363
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,299
Halling.

364
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:20,459
- I don't know what that means.
- It's his name!

365
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,823
Oh. Halling. It's nice to meet you.

366
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:28,306
- Are you here to trade?
- Trade.

367
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,417
Yes. We're traders.

368
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:40,902
How many times have I told you
not to play in the forest after dark?

369
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:45,899
I'm just glad you're safe.

370
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,617
Teyla will wish to meet with you.

371
00:34:56,788 --> 00:34:58,779
Come.

372
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:02,783
Parker, Smitty, you're on gate duty.

373
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:07,260
Dial Atlantis Base and tell the doctor
we contacted the indigenous people.

374
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:17,063
Sir, if you don't mind my asking,

375
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:20,425
I noticed you got a problem
with Major Sheppard.

376
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:22,977
My problem, Lieutenant, is with his record.

377
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:27,107
I don't like anybody who doesn't follow
the proper chain of command.

378
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:28,860
Yes, sir.

379
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:35,982
- What was that mask you had on?
- It helps you see in the dark. Check it out.

380
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,903
- Whoa!
- Let me see!

381
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,702
- Whoa! Can I have it?
- No.

382
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:46,065
- What's the mask you've got on?
- This? Wraith.

383
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:49,299
Wraith? What's that?

384
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:53,063
- You don't know?
- What world do you come from?

385
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:55,822
- Can we go there?
- I'm afraid not.

386
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,582
I come from a galaxy far, far away.

387
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:23,098
- It's Halling. I bring men from away.
- Enter.

388
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,505
These men wish to trade.

389
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:44,627
Ah! It's...

390
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,779
It's nice to meet you.

391
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,418
I am Teyla Emmagan,

392
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,579
daughter of Tagan.

393
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:54,978
Colonel Marshall Sumner.

394
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:56,820
Major Sheppard.

395
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:58,626
Lieutenant Ford.

396
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:02,337
- We have very few specific needs.
- We do not trade with strangers.

397
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:06,740
- Is that a fact?
- Then we have to get to know each other.

398
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:10,827
Me, um... I like Ferris wheels

399
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:14,025
and college football,
anything that goes over 200mph.

400
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,418
Sir, that won't mean anything to them.

401
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:19,580
Feel free to speak up.
I'm just trying to break the ice.

402
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:23,218
They can't help us.
I'd rather not waste time.

403
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:27,063
Each morning, before dawn,
our people drink a stout tea

404
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:29,617
to brace us for the coming day.

405
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:32,382
Will you join us?

406
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:37,018
I love a good cup of tea.

407
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:40,463
There's another thing
you know about me.

408
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:44,142
We're practically friends already.

409
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,898
We didn't see it until the sun came up.

410
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:12,663
Looks more promising than anything else
these folks have to offer.

411
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:15,217
Plenty of shelter, nice little valley.

412
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:19,177
Location, location, location.

413
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,424
- The City of the Ancestors is not safe.
- We can handle ourselves.

414
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,227
- The Wraith will come.
- Who are these Wraith?

415
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,628
We have never met anyone
who did not know.

416
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:40,138
You have now.

417
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:43,778
If the Wraith have never
touched your world, go back there.

418
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,143
We'd like to, but we can't.

419
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,505
See, here's the thing, ma'am.
We've got into a bit of a bind.

420
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:53,785
We may need
a safe place to stay for a while.

421
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,499
We have long believed that the Wraith
will come if we venture into the old city.

422
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:03,744
But it is a belief
we've not tested in some time.

423
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,300
Gentlemen.

424
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:19,264
Look, I don't care what they say.
That city is worth a look.

425
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:24,422
Not to mention the possibility there could
be ZPMs there that they don't know about.

426
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:29,664
What if the Wraith are the enemy
in the Ancient hologram?

427
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:33,787
All the more reason for us
to have a defensible position.

428
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:38,705
Stay here and find out what you can.
Ford, report in to Weir.

429
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:41,666
Tell her we'll have answers in a few hours.

430
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:43,420
Yes, sir.

431
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,862
Well, I guess it's just you and me.

432
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,699
And him.

433
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:02,744
Your leader looks through me
as if I were not there.

434
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:05,819
Do I?

435
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,227
No.

436
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:14,627
- You truly cannot return to your world?
- No.

437
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,780
Then there is something you should see.

438
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,703
How much further is this place?

439
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,859
Not far.

440
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:42,461
- Tell me some good news, Rodney.
- I can't do that.

441
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:46,141
The shield has
held back the ocean for centuries.

442
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:49,345
And would have kept going,
but our arrival changed that.

443
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,544
It's nothing more than a thin shell.

444
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:56,418
- We stopped exploring.
- The damage is done. The city's flooding.

445
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,979
- Even occupying this room drains power.
- We need to evacuate as soon as we can.

446
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:03,298
You're saying we have to
abandon the city?

447
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:09,258
The sooner we leave,
the longer that shield holds.

448
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,947
I used to play here as a child.

449
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:24,262
I believe it is where the survivors hid from
the Wraith during the last great attack.

450
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:26,419
Let me, uh...

451
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:30,503
We mastered fire long ago.

452
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,465
I guess so.

453
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:57,099
What's this?

454
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:02,137
I lost this years ago.

455
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,947
- How did you...?
- It was just lying right over there.

456
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,827
It was reflecting off the light.

457
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:25,819
Someone's been busy, huh?

458
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:30,497
The drawings in the caves are extensive.

459
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:33,899
Many must date back
thousands of years, or more.

460
00:42:36,828 --> 00:42:39,900
Does this represent
the destruction of your city?

461
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:42,866
This drawing far pre-dates that.

462
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,067
So, what?
Someone knew it was gonna happen?

463
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:51,380
I believe it happens again and again.

464
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,338
The Wraith allow our kind
to grow in numbers.

465
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:58,942
And when that number reaches
a certain point,

466
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:03,067
they return to cull their human herd.

467
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:07,380
Sometimes a few hundred years will pass
before they awaken again.

468
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:09,698
We've visited many, many worlds.

469
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:12,860
I know of none untouched by the Wraith.

470
00:43:14,348 --> 00:43:17,021
The last great holocaust
was five generations ago,

471
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:20,021
but still they return, in smaller numbers,

472
00:43:20,188 --> 00:43:22,338
to remind us of their power.

473
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:27,137
It's a hell of a way to live.

474
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:31,096
We move our hunting camps around.

475
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:36,376
We try to teach our children
not to live in fear, but it is hard.

476
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,816
Some of us can sense the Wraith coming.

477
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:42,779
That gives us warning.

478
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:47,626
We should go. It will be dark soon.

479
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:50,784
Man, days are short here.

480
00:43:50,948 --> 00:43:53,542
<i>Major Sheppard, this is Colonel Sumner.</i>

481
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:56,461
Colonel,
Major Sheppard is out of radio range.

482
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:58,619
Where the hell is he?

483
00:43:58,788 --> 00:44:00,619
<i>Teyla wanted him to see something.</i>

484
00:44:02,468 --> 00:44:04,060
Defensive positions!

485
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,026
Colonel, we have gate activity here.

486
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:20,860
Colonel, three bandits headed your way.

487
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:28,138
Take cover!

488
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:43,619
What is it?

489
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,025
The Wraith!

490
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:54,425
Just leave it!

491
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:57,864
Jinto, come! Jinto!

492
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:14,784
Fire on that target!

493
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,746
Teyla!

494
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:43,018
<i>Colonel, they're on the ground!</i>
<i>They're all around us!</i>

495
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,620
Teyla?

496
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:00,339
They're not really there.

497
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:09,543
Do not trust your eyes. The Wraith can
make you see things that are not there.

498
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,699
We must hurry.

499
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:23,864
<i>This is Sheppard.</i>
<i>What you see on the ground is an illusion.</i>

500
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:27,100
<i>Concentrate your fire on the ships.</i>

501
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:30,747
Fire at the ships! Fire at the ships!

502
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:37,825
- Bates, snap out of it!
- They're everywhere, sir!

503
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,503
Take that thing down!

504
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:56,337
Teyla... Teyla?

505
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:00,217
<i>Sir, the colonel's been taken.</i>

506
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,827
The gate's coming on again.
Two enemy ships approaching.

507
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:13,617
<i>Let 'em go.</i>
<i>Look at the dialling device.</i>

508
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:16,256
<i>Burn those symbols into your mind.</i>

509
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,507
Son of a...

510
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:50,419
Help! Help me!

511
00:47:56,628 --> 00:47:58,619
I can't find my father.

512
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:11,700
- Here it comes.
- What am I looking for?

513
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:17,577
There. Another part
of the force field just failed.

514
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:20,546
I don't think we have much time.

515
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:28,941
How are we doing? If we can just
buy ourselves another day, maybe...

516
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:32,498
The city is sacrificing parts of itself
to maintain these areas,

517
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:35,660
but catastrophic failure is inevitable.

518
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:42,018
Not in my wildest dreams did I hope to find
the Lost City so completely untouched,

519
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:45,385
so pristine, and we have no choice
but to walk away from this?

520
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,982
- In order to save it.
- Save it for whom?

521
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:50,184
We don't have enough power
for a message.

522
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:55,706
- We'll just be missing, presumed lost.
- We'll find a power source in Pegasus.

523
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:58,897
We got no idea what's out there.

524
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:02,538
We can't wait. It is time to go - now.

525
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:12,901
Attention, all personnel. This is Weir.

526
00:49:15,548 --> 00:49:17,539
Stand by for immediate evacuation!

527
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,426
Dial the gate!

528
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:27,540
We've got an incoming wormhole!

529
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:32,263
Lieutenant Ford's identification code!

530
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,988
Let 'em in!

531
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:43,820
Step in, folks. Move away from the puddle.

532
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:48,225
Major Sheppard!

533
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,622
Major Sheppard, who are all these people?

534
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,507
Survivors from the settlement.
We were attacked.

535
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:58,466
Sumner and some men were taken.
What's going on?

536
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,620
- We are in no position to help anyone.
- What's going on?

537
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:04,939
- We're about to abandon the city.
- We can't go back there.

538
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:08,464
The shield is about to fail
and the ocean will crash in on us.

539
00:50:08,628 --> 00:50:10,346
Do you have a better place?

540
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,420
- Jinto, have you another address?
- Yes, many.

541
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:16,866
He's just a boy.

542
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:19,223
- I am Jinto.
- She's pleased to meet you.

543
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:24,623
The shield is collapsing!

544
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,459
I'm dialling an address!

545
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:42,379
- No! Wait!
- She's right.

546
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:49,223
We're moving!

547
00:52:02,788 --> 00:52:05,177
We're on the surface!

548
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,665
I was hoping for another day.

549
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:18,867
It looks like we just got
a whole lot more than that.

550
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:21,223
Let's not waste it.

551
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:42,104
People, listen up. No one sits down
until they clear two pieces of equipment.

552
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,065
Now, let's go.

553
00:52:45,388 --> 00:52:47,777
The last Zero Point Module is depleted,

554
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:51,543
but limited power has returned
now we're not holding back an ocean.

555
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,939
Life-support systems are working,
but the atmosphere is breathable,

556
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:57,497
notwithstanding the inevitable allergens.

557
00:52:57,668 --> 00:53:01,217
Can our generator supply enough power
for defensive purposes?

558
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:05,097
- Not even close.
- Without a shield, we're target practice.

559
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,828
I'm acutely aware of that, Major.

560
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:11,865
When can you tell me where the Wraith
took Colonel Sumner?

561
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:15,464
With the six symbols we got,
there are hundreds of permutations.

562
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:16,947
720.

563
00:53:17,108 --> 00:53:20,703
Yes. I knew that, of course.
I'm just surprised you do.

564
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,019
Take away the coordinates
you can't lock on and that's it.

565
00:53:24,188 --> 00:53:26,782
When you find it, send a MALP.

566
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:30,579
Major? A word.

567
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:47,907
Oh...

568
00:53:59,628 --> 00:54:03,223
Let me guess. You're not gonna
let me rescue my people.

569
00:54:05,948 --> 00:54:08,178
You don't even know if they're alive.

570
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:10,543
You don't leave people with the enemy.

571
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:14,337
The fact that we're having
this conversation in private lets me know

572
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:18,296
that you know damn well it's wrong
and will undermine your leadership.

573
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:22,984
- So as ranking military officer...
- All right, shut up and listen to me.

574
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:27,137
Come on.
What do we know about the Wraith?

575
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:32,621
One thing we do know is that they are
the enemy that defeated the Ancients.

576
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:37,020
When we first began to use the Stargate
on Earth, we got in serious trouble. Why?

577
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:40,942
- I don't need a history lesson.
- They didn't consider the ramifications.

578
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:43,622
They took our people! How should I react?

579
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:46,256
And we're defenceless!
You said so yourself.

580
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:51,661
How do you know some half-assed rescue
mission won't bring them right back here?

581
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:53,625
Maybe it will.

582
00:54:53,788 --> 00:54:57,701
But it's the right thing to do.
Why? Because it is!

583
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:03,138
- John...
- Let's turn tail and pack up. They'll come.

584
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:07,824
- You don't know that.
- Our people are in enemy hands, Doctor.

585
00:55:09,068 --> 00:55:13,220
It is just a matter of time before
the Wraith figure out this is our base.

586
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:15,379
I just need more information.

587
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:19,985
- Maybe we could negotiate a peaceful...
- Peaceful? Are you kidding?!

588
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:23,743
We weren't there for more than a few
hours before they showed up.

589
00:55:23,908 --> 00:55:27,457
Is it possible they came because of you?

590
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:30,506
And that one of these people
tipped them off?

591
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:34,502
- It's possible.
- That is the kind of snap decision I mean!

592
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:37,421
They're not all bad people.

593
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:43,267
If we're gonna stick around here,
we need friends.

594
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:51,377
OK. I see your point.

595
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,937
Now you see mine.

596
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:57,307
I will not authorise a rescue mission

597
00:55:57,468 --> 00:56:01,461
unless I am sure there is at least
a remote chance of success.

598
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:05,780
I'm not sending more good people,
including you, to their deaths.

599
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:07,620
OK.

600
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:25,817
- Are you all right?
- Where are we?

601
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:28,905
Any idea what to expect?

602
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:32,587
No.

603
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:36,502
Your friend said the Wraith would come
if we went down into the ruins.

604
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:40,581
- You should have heeded his warning.
- How do I know he didn't tell them?

605
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:46,817
Someone comes.

606
00:57:02,428 --> 00:57:04,419
I'm Colonel Marshall Sum...

607
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:18,666
No! Please!

608
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:24,780
- Take me in his place!
- No! Take me!

609
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,582
We're the ones you're after, right?

610
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:32,462
I'm their leader.

611
00:57:43,428 --> 00:57:46,818
They have no need to explain themselves.

612
00:57:46,988 --> 00:57:48,944
Yeah, I got that.

613
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:54,098
- We're receiving visual telemetry.
- I can't see anything.

614
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:55,986
No atmospheric readings at all.

615
00:57:57,748 --> 00:58:00,706
- Hey, what was that?
- Rotate the camera.

616
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:11,059
- Well, there goes that MALP.
- It's in space!

617
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:13,184
On the far side of the galaxy.

618
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:18,342
- You're sure this is the right address?
- It's the only one we could get a lock on.

619
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:22,106
Very well. Shut it down.

620
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:24,259
I'm sorry.

621
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:29,138
Come with me, Major.

622
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:04,821
- Think you can fly it?
- What do you say we find out?

623
00:59:19,428 --> 00:59:22,420
Dr Beckett, what was it
you wanted me to see?

624
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:35,941
These cells have none of the normal
human-inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

625
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:39,737
That gives them
an incredible ability to regenerate.

626
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:42,468
What about the movement
Major Sheppard saw?

627
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:44,619
As far as independent behaviour,

628
00:59:44,788 --> 00:59:49,657
I'd say it was from a residual command
language in the severed nerve endings.

629
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,659
All right. Anything else?

630
00:59:54,108 --> 00:59:56,576
The being this arm belonged to,

631
00:59:56,748 --> 00:59:59,342
if I was a betting man, I'd say it was old.

632
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:02,102
- Very, very old.
- How old?

633
01:00:03,428 --> 01:00:05,737
As long as the cells
are properly nourished,

634
01:00:05,908 --> 01:00:10,220
I don't see a life form like this ever dying
of natural ageing the way we do.

635
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:12,424
And they'd be bloody hard to kill.

636
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:14,579
I don't like the sound of that.

637
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,818
I don't blame you.

638
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:26,422
- What is that noise?
- I don't... He was right here!

639
01:00:26,588 --> 01:00:28,579
Major!

640
01:00:29,988 --> 01:00:32,377
You wanted a tactical advantage.

641
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:36,587
All right. So you can fly that thing.

642
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:39,467
It doesn't mean you can pull off a rescue.

643
01:00:39,628 --> 01:00:43,621
Doctor... this is why you brought me here.

644
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:50,819
- Ready?
- I have no idea.

645
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:55,186
This technology is so far beyond us,
we haven't a clue what we're dealing with.

646
01:00:55,348 --> 01:00:58,738
For all we know, we could... Yeah. Ready.

647
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:03,177
All right, boys. Get ready to go.

648
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,699
Gateship One, ready to go.

649
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:16,543
Gateship One?!
A little puddle jumper like this?

650
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,700
It's a ship that goes through the gate.
Gateship One.

651
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:22,257
- That's wrong.
- Dr McKay thought it was cool.

652
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,864
Oh, OK. Well, it's official.
You don't get to name anything...

653
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:27,427
ever.

654
01:01:28,348 --> 01:01:32,660
Flight, this is... Puddle Jumper.
We're go to launch.

655
01:01:32,828 --> 01:01:34,978
I thought we were going with Gateship.

656
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:37,742
<i>- Negative, Flight.</i>
- Stand by.

657
01:01:37,908 --> 01:01:41,821
It's a ship that goes through the gate. Fine.

658
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:44,183
<i>Puddle Jumper, you are clear for launch.</i>

659
01:01:44,348 --> 01:01:46,339
Dial it up, Lieutenant.

660
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:21,066
Be safe.

661
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:28,267
Wow!

662
01:02:28,428 --> 01:02:30,498
This is cool.

663
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:33,660
- Looks like you got the hang of it.
- I tell you what.

664
01:02:33,828 --> 01:02:36,979
A lot of fighter pilots
would kill to fly this thing.

665
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:39,378
It's like it reads your mind.

666
01:02:42,788 --> 01:02:46,986
- Did you do that?
- I was just wondering where we go now.

667
01:02:47,148 --> 01:02:49,139
I'll take that as a "yes".

668
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:53,301
- How do we find them once we land?
- I've been thinking about that, too.

669
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:06,020
Now I'm thinking
about a nice turkey sandwich.

670
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:11,261
Worth a try.

671
01:04:14,428 --> 01:04:16,703
Lock and load.

672
01:04:30,628 --> 01:04:32,619
All right. Teams of two.

673
01:04:32,788 --> 01:04:36,178
Learn what you can
and lay down defences as you see fit.

674
01:04:36,348 --> 01:04:38,578
I want to be able to light this place up.

675
01:04:38,748 --> 01:04:40,739
Two clicks, you're clear to talk.

676
01:04:40,908 --> 01:04:42,978
Do not engage the enemy!

677
01:04:43,148 --> 01:04:45,139
You're with me.

678
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:37,505
You must feel hunger by now.

679
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:57,022
I thought getting in would be the hard part.
That's the first one we've seen.

680
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,498
The moving dot should be him.

681
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:10,465
Go over there.

682
01:06:12,828 --> 01:06:14,819
Yeah, that's you.

683
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:18,458
So, we got ourselves a lifesigns detector.

684
01:06:19,468 --> 01:06:21,459
We can name it later.

685
01:06:30,228 --> 01:06:32,025
- Major?
- Shh!

686
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:36,258
- Are you all right?
- How did you find us?

687
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:40,023
- Is my son alive?
- He's well and waiting for you.

688
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:42,986
- Where's Colonel Sumner?
- Taken by the Wraith.

689
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:45,537
- We don't know where.
- How about when?

690
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,506
- Not long.
- I knew something had to go wrong.

691
01:06:48,668 --> 01:06:51,057
<i>This is Stackhouse. Go ahead, sir.</i>

692
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:54,618
How about a diversion in a little bit?
Make some noise.

693
01:06:54,788 --> 01:06:56,107
Yes, sir.

694
01:06:57,628 --> 01:07:01,416
Rig up enough C4 to blow a hole
and get these people out.

695
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:05,103
I can find the colonel with this.
There aren't many Wraith around.

696
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:10,296
I should be able to do this. If I'm not back
in 20 minutes, blow the cells and get out.

697
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:14,984
- You're the only one who can fly us out.
- And I'll fly us all out of here.

698
01:07:15,148 --> 01:07:19,619
- I'm saying I should be the one to go, sir.
- 20 minutes. I'll find him.

699
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,463
What do you call yourself?

700
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,659
Colonel Marshall Sumner,

701
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:31,705
United States Marine Corps.

702
01:07:33,908 --> 01:07:36,945
So little fear.

703
01:07:37,108 --> 01:07:40,066
Is it valour?

704
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:42,219
Or ignorance?

705
01:07:43,388 --> 01:07:46,619
We travel through the Stargate
as peaceful explorers.

706
01:07:46,788 --> 01:07:50,940
You must eat,
yet you resist your hunger. Why?

707
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:55,738
- Why did you take my people prisoner?
- You trespassed on our feeding ground.

708
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,699
Feeding ground?

709
01:08:02,868 --> 01:08:05,302
All living things must eat.

710
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:08,619
In this I am sure we are similar.

711
01:08:08,788 --> 01:08:11,177
You feel hunger even now.

712
01:08:12,428 --> 01:08:14,419
I can sense it.

713
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:17,219
Yet you resist.

714
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:20,543
- Why?
- Why do you care?

715
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:24,420
Hunger...

716
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,778
is distasteful.

717
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:34,707
It looks to me
like the food didn't agree with him.

718
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:38,065
There we are quite dissimilar,
Colonel Sumner.

719
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,219
We don't require...

720
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:45,865
our food to agree with us.

721
01:09:00,828 --> 01:09:03,740
What do you call your world?

722
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:10,107
What do you call your world?

723
01:09:10,268 --> 01:09:13,977
What do you call your world?

724
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:17,827
Earth.

725
01:09:19,468 --> 01:09:21,538
It is not among our stars.

726
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,737
- No.
- Tell me of Earth.

727
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:31,705
How many more are there of your kind?

728
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:35,100
Thousands?

729
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:36,906
Millions?

730
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:40,819
More?

731
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:49,546
Our feeding ground
has not been so rich in 10,000 years.

732
01:10:11,388 --> 01:10:13,379
Your will is strong.

733
01:10:14,988 --> 01:10:16,580
This one...

734
01:10:17,308 --> 01:10:19,458
begged for its life.

735
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:24,258
Is that the kind of treatment I can expect
for myself and my people?

736
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:28,580
As I have said,
all living things must eat.

737
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:30,943
Then we're done talking.

738
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:33,099
I think not.

739
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:37,457
Kneel.

740
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:43,380
Kneel.

741
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:46,659
Aaah!

742
01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:53,421
I have not tasted such strength...
in so long.

743
01:10:57,428 --> 01:10:59,623
Go to hell!

744
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,825
Earth first!

745
01:11:07,148 --> 01:11:12,142
How many years must I take from you
before you tell us what I wish to know?

746
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:18,302
Or shall I take them all?

747
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:31,019
Where is this new feeding ground?

748
01:11:31,188 --> 01:11:32,940
I won't!

749
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:40,379
Bring him!

750
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:52,657
How's the hand feeling?

751
01:12:56,108 --> 01:12:58,303
Much better.

752
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:00,902
I'm sorry to hear that.

753
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,656
How did this come to you?

754
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:13,864
I don't remember!

755
01:13:20,308 --> 01:13:21,787
Light it up!

756
01:13:29,908 --> 01:13:31,899
Cover!

757
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:45,778
That has to kill you.

758
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:59,379
- How did you find me?
- Tread marks. Standard issue. Let's go.

759
01:14:00,628 --> 01:14:03,586
You don't know what you have done.

760
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:09,141
We are merely
the caretakers for those that sleep.

761
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:13,699
When I die, the others will awaken.

762
01:14:17,028 --> 01:14:19,098
All of them.

763
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:30,418
What's she talking about?
How many are left?

764
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:46,419
Sir, we need to leave.

765
01:14:46,588 --> 01:14:49,944
- Bates, we're on the go.
<i>- So are we. Colonel Sumner?.</i>

766
01:14:50,108 --> 01:14:51,700
Negative!

767
01:14:55,468 --> 01:14:57,265
Dr Weir?

768
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:02,667
We're getting reports in from
all over the city. Pretty interesting stuff.

769
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:07,822
We've only provided power to certain
sections, but the things coming up are...

770
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:14,022
I should never have let them go.

771
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,225
For what it's worth,

772
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,777
you made the right decision.

773
01:15:21,508 --> 01:15:23,499
Give them time.

774
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:33,741
Major, the jumper is secure for
the moment, but we have a big problem.

775
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:37,662
Lieutenant, take our six.
I'll take them back to the jumper.

776
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:39,420
Be right behind you.

777
01:16:01,548 --> 01:16:04,016
- There's nothing there!
- I saw something.

778
01:16:04,188 --> 01:16:09,182
Only what the Wraith wish you to see.
Firing your weapon reveals our position!

779
01:16:14,628 --> 01:16:16,425
Get in!

780
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:49,663
- Thank you, sir.
- Try not to make a habit of it.

781
01:17:02,388 --> 01:17:04,265
We have incoming!

782
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:10,020
OK. Now what am I thinking?

783
01:17:18,028 --> 01:17:21,623
- Everybody OK back there?
- We are well enough.

784
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:30,137
I hope that was the hard part.

785
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:37,107
Crap!

786
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:41,698
I don't think
we've gotten to the hard part yet.

787
01:17:49,428 --> 01:17:51,225
What can we do?

788
01:17:51,388 --> 01:17:54,300
- We're safe if they can't see us.
- They don't have to.

789
01:17:54,468 --> 01:17:56,663
There's only one way for us to go.

790
01:17:56,828 --> 01:18:00,707
The minute we activate the Stargate,
they can shoot blind and blow us away.

791
01:18:00,868 --> 01:18:06,147
- Then how can we get through?
- Draw them away and double back.

792
01:18:15,468 --> 01:18:17,936
Be prepared to dial the gate on my mark.

793
01:18:29,988 --> 01:18:33,378
Do you see anything
like a weapons console over there?

794
01:18:48,108 --> 01:18:52,147
- Try and go invisible again.
- It must be damaged. Dial the gate.

795
01:18:56,828 --> 01:18:58,819
O<i>ffw</i>orld activation!

796
01:19:01,428 --> 01:19:03,703
Raise the shield!

797
01:19:13,108 --> 01:19:17,977
- Get ready to punch in your code.
- What's the range on these things?

798
01:19:18,148 --> 01:19:21,140
Do we have an identification code?

799
01:19:24,188 --> 01:19:25,587
Nothing yet.

800
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:32,657
Enter your code! Hang on.

801
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:38,379
- I'm reading Lieutenant Ford's IDC.
- Let 'em in!

802
01:19:58,748 --> 01:20:00,340
A few more seconds!

803
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,461
- We're going too fast!
- I know.

804
01:20:16,148 --> 01:20:18,264
Reactivate the shield!

805
01:20:35,628 --> 01:20:38,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Atlantis.

806
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:44,067
Please remain seated until the Puddle
Jumper comes to a full and complete stop.

807
01:21:02,428 --> 01:21:05,226
- I guess this is home now.
- I guess so.

808
01:21:08,828 --> 01:21:13,822
I'm thinking of a little place
with an ocean view. Out of the way.

809
01:21:18,028 --> 01:21:19,905
Major, Lieutenant.

810
01:21:21,028 --> 01:21:24,179
I thought the occasion
merited opening this.

811
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:26,623
Compliments of General O'Neill.

812
01:21:30,588 --> 01:21:32,385
Cheers.

813
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:42,179
- You did good, John.
- I don't know about that.

814
01:21:42,348 --> 01:21:45,818
Hey, there was no way
you could have saved Colonel Sumner.

815
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:50,942
I have to live with it.

816
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:56,863
I'm beginning to think you're right.
I have made things much worse.

817
01:21:57,028 --> 01:21:59,019
I haven't made us many more friends.

818
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:00,780
No?

819
01:22:02,308 --> 01:22:03,900
Look around you.

820
01:22:10,228 --> 01:22:12,423
I agree, Major Sheppard.

821
01:22:28,028 --> 01:22:32,021
You have earned both my friendship
and that of my people.

822
01:22:35,788 --> 01:22:38,985
With our help,
you will make many more friends.

823
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:44,183
How come I never make friends like that?

824
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:46,339
You need to get out more.

825
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:50,296
We're in another galaxy.
How much more out can you get?

826
01:22:51,308 --> 01:22:53,299
Is there lemon in this?

827
01:22:57,068 --> 01:22:58,865
One more thing, Major.

828
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:01,588
There's something I'd like you to sleep on.

829
01:23:01,748 --> 01:23:03,500
- I have thoughts...
- About what?

830
01:23:03,668 --> 01:23:06,421
Who the members of your team might be.

831
01:23:07,628 --> 01:23:11,303
- My team?
- You are the ranking military officer now.

832
01:23:11,468 --> 01:23:14,460
Or do you need to be reminded of that?

833
01:23:16,988 --> 01:23:21,106
We need to get back out there,
do what we came to do.

834
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:27,623
You realise that could get us
into all sorts of trouble?

835
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,027
Right?
