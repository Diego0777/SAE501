1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,472
Sophie, could you
come in here, please?

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,951
Yes, Damien?

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,156
(Scottish accent) I've been thinking.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,196
We've become rather staid recently.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,713
We haven't really produced

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,031
any truly interesting titles
for some time.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,873
We need some new...blood.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,511
Did you have anyone in mind?

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,511
I was rather hoping you might.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,955
How about Peter Gibbons?

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,234
I don't think so.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,075
Jason Murray?

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,230
Too...arty.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,357
- Tim Bisley.
- Bisley?

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,271
Why do I know that name?

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,396
'He came in last year.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,277
'You laughed him out of the office.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,475
'He had blond hair.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,675
'Small ears.'

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,196
Yes, Bisley. That's right.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,111
I remember his work now.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,351
All muscles and guns. Most amusing.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,431
Give him a ring, will you Sophie?

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,956
- Get me his portfolio.
- 0K.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,475
I think it's time we gave
young Mr Bisley another shot.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,993
# 0h, baby

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,312
# 0h, baby

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,796
# 0h, baby #

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,710
You idiot.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,231
- Morning. Coffee and Kilroy?
- No thanks.

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,912
- Tea and Tricia?
- No!

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,672
Why are you scrimmaging around?

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,196
- Sophie from Darkstar called.
- Sophie.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,191
Damien Knox wants to see
my portfolio.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,349
Sophie.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,193
No, Damien Knox.
The head of Darkstar Comix.

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,272
He wants to see my portfolio.
I am a little nervous.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,397
God, wow. He wants
to see your portfolio?

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,630
God, what a break.
That's brilliant.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,312
- Is it, Daisy?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,879
God, well done.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,428
That's excellent. Really good.
Well done, you.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,635
Well done.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,438
- What's that?
- I don't know.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,829
It's upstairs. Maybe it's Marsha.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,595
- Maybe it's Mike.
- Maybe it's Mike AND Marsha.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,796
Ready to go again, soldier?

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,075
Cock-locked and ready to rock.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,479
Got anything planned?

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,596
I have got a bit of a project.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,272
I'm gonna be
as inactive as I can

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,352
in order to get into the psyche
of someone unemployed,

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,192
vocationally and cerebrally,

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,114
to see if enforced passivity
exacerbates itself.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,395
Does inactivity breed laziness?

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,552
- You writing an article on it?
- No. I can't be bothered.

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,311
I'm not really a praying man and
I never really ask you for much,

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,472
so if you could see your
way clear to helping me today,

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,755
I would be really grateful.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,637
Thank you very much. Amen.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,236
"I'm a massive wanker."

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,551
It's all right.
It's my messenger.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,799
- That's weird.
- What?

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,110
- There's nobody there.
- 0i oi!

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,555
You lucky people.

66
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,234
0h, hi, Tyres.

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,676
I understand you two "friends"
wanted to talk to me.

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,957
I was wondering if you could run
my portfolio over to Darkstar.

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,712
I see. You don't
call me for weeks

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,756
and all of a sudden
you want a favour.

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,274
That's nice. The last time
I seen you, you said

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,873
you wished I was your da

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,791
and hugged me
for the entire length

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,348
of Josh Wink's Higher State
of Consciousness.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,238
And now you want me to ferry
round your "art"?

76
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,880
- Yes, please.
- 0K.

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,473
By the way, you owe me 20 quid.

78
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,676
0h, right. Yeah.

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,830
How are you,
my pocket Shakespeare?

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,354
Come up with any exciting
literary characters?

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,873
Yes, actually.

82
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,598
Dizzy Steinway.

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,033
I like it.

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,112
What is she, some sort of
crime-busting jazz singer?

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,156
No. It's the name
I'm using to sign on.

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,639
You want to get off your arse

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,757
and get a job, Dizzy,
or whatever your name isn't.

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,559
- Nice hair, by the way.
- There you go, mate.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,995
- Cheers.
- My livelihood is in here.

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,231
- Guard it with your life.
- As ever. You out this weekend?

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,915
I'm a bit strapped for cash actually.
Lend me 20 quid?

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,956
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,754
What's that noise?

94
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,592
Um...

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,478
- We don't know.
- I like it.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,473
You better get off.
That's got to be there by 11.

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,393
Right, sir. I've got a good
feeling about this parcel.

98
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,835
Hopefully things
might start going my way.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,912
You know what it's like.
Door, please, Timmy.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,115
Right.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,157
That was close.
He nearly went disco.

102
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,357
What is that noise?

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,112
I don't know. I'm gonna find out.

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,237
- Can you tell Mike I need him?
- What for?

105
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,470
No reason, I just...need him.

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,070
'Can you feel it
in your butt? That's good.'

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,434
Marsha?

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,078
Come in, kitten. It's open.

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,037
'..two, turn, one...'

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,190
- Morning, Daisy.
- Hi, Mike.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,236
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

112
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,550
- Tim wants you.
- Wants me or needs me?

113
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,710
Needs you.

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,915
Right. Ladies.

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,313
So what you up to, Marsha?

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,757
It's Cher's new fitness video.
Thong for Europe.

117
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,513
Mike reckons I got
between 15 and 20 years

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,229
to find hubby number three
and I want to look my best.

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,197
Why don't you come
for a jog with me?

120
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,271
0h, no. No.

121
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,316
Come on. It'll be fun.

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,472
Get off your ass.
Get the adrenaline pumpin'.

123
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,710
No, I shouldn't do sport
of any kind.

124
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,634
I'm actually allergic to endorphins.
I get very competitive.

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,188
Anyway, who wants
to look like these people?

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,159
Go to the gym all day, go to
some premiere in a low-cut dress

127
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,196
to get on the cover
of some magazine.

128
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,111
What kind of a life is that?

129
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,317
I'm happy right where I am.

130
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,395
There was a picture
of a man with a white eye

132
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,152
saying "I am a massive wanker."

133
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,515
And if you put it
in my portfolio I cannot begin

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,670
to describe the damage
you may have done.

135
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,079
Well, I...

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,038
We want this to be easy.
You're amongst friends.

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,553
- I just...
- What?

138
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,677
- What you done with it?
- Did you put it in my portfolio?

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,830
I put it in A portfolio.

140
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,955
What?!

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,156
I put it in your portfolio.

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,355
What?!

143
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,793
Did she say what I think?

144
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,950
- She put it in my portfolio.
- What?!

145
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,838
I thought you'd forgotten it.
I was trying to help.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,388
That was a picture of a man
who is about to decide

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,311
whether I work for Darkstar Comix.

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,992
You see why I left it out?

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,231
Yes! Yes, yes. And I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.

150
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,756
Don't! If you're going to help,
get off your ass and help yourself.

151
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,831
Why is everyone
talking about my ass?

152
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,354
Mike. We've got
to try and stop Tyres.

153
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,759
Don't worry, Daisy.

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,751
Tim's just really angry at you

155
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,230
because you've jeopardised
his future, 0K?

156
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,117
I was just trying to help.

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,470
God.

158
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,118
Ow, ow, ow.

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,236
- All right, Kitten?
- Yes!

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,151
Sure you don't want
to come for a jog?

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,356
- Yes.
- You got work to do?

162
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,829
No.

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,399
What you gonna do, then?

164
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,358
Sit around the house waiting
for Tim to come home?

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,158
I'll get my plimsolls.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,036
Is Brian there?

167
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,352
Why are you dressed like that?

168
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,476
Thought you might like
to come for a run.

169
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,120
Might ease your frustration.

170
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,270
What frustration?

171
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,114
Why? I like going out!
I want to stay in.

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,033
And have sex?
That's all you ever want.

173
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,918
I'm not here for one thing.
I want you to see me as a whole.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,070
- I do.
- Whole with a "w".

175
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,429
Just thought you might like a jog.

176
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,557
No, can't. Mum's coming,
we're going out for lunch.

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,870
Is that why you're
dressed like that?

178
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,235
She thinks I'm a lawyer.

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,753
Bloody 'ell.

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,435
I thought I knew
all your little secrets.

181
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,875
No wonder you're so tense.

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,557
Come on!

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,558
Come on!

184
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,119
What is the hold-up?

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,555
There's been an accident.

186
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,392
Somebody got hurt.

187
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,790
- Who?
- A lady.

188
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,197
- How d'you know?
- Because we hit her.

189
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,589
- Did we?
- Yeah. That's her there.

190
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,910
- Ah!
- What the hell are you doing?

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,228
It's broad daylight!

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,595
You have no consideration
for cyclists.

193
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,914
Pardon?

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,389
What the hell are you doing?
It's broad daylight.

195
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,198
You have no consideration
for cyclists.

196
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,238
All right.
What's your problem?

197
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,354
- You all right?
- Yeah.

198
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,874
- Think you can go on? Come on.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,274
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,237
Sure.

201
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,038
That's not gonna happen

202
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,156
cos he's a small fish
in a big pond

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,117
and I'm a big...shark!

204
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,634
Yes, yes. OK. Bye.

205
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,914
Hi, Mum.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
- Hello, love.
- Shall we go?

207
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,359
Aren't we going in?

208
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,352
No, I've got the builders in.
They're making a wall.

209
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,032
I know a good place to eat.

210
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,193
This is all right.

211
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,397
- What did I tell you?
- It's quite fun.

212
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,315
Shit, there he is.

213
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,992
Tyres!

214
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,075
What about you?

215
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,799
- Don't deliver that parcel.
- Why?

216
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,189
There's something
I don't want them to see.

217
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,633
Paperclips?

218
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,278
No. Where's my portfolio?

219
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,555
I delivered that half an hour ago.

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,394
Noooooooooooooooo!

221
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,708
Did you get it?

222
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,756
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

223
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,273
Tim Bisley's portfolio
has arrived.

224
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,112
Right.

225
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,877
Actually, I'll look
at it after lunch.

226
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,319
Couldn't we go get it?

227
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,470
Not even I can get
to the upper reaches.

228
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,791
Parcels are left at reception
and collected by personnel.

229
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,155
- Damn.
- They must let some people up.

230
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,196
- Not without an appointment.
- Shit.

231
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,431
How am I gonna get my
picture back? Mike, any ideas?

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,154
Tyres?

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,789
Yeah, but we'll need
another walkie-talkie.

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,678
0r two.

235
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,392
Can I have a large half-caff
frappuccino, please?

236
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,553
With whipped cream
and marshmallow dunkers...Mum?

237
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,758
Yes. I'll have one of those, too.

238
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,159
When in Rome.

239
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,518
- So how is everything?
- Good.

240
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,239
- How's Twist?
- Good. 0ut of town.

241
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,514
Can't wait to meet her.

242
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,919
Very busy.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,878
Well, fashion is big business
these days, Brian.

244
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,632
You know that.

245
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,596
0h, are they friends of yours?

246
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,875
Never seen them before.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,357
- Brian, what is it?
- Sorry?

248
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,590
- What is it?
- It's me again.

249
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,069
- I can see that.
- Third time today.

250
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,355
Have you got something to deliver?

251
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,237
I was thinking, I'm getting a bit

252
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,390
long in the tooth
with this cycling lark.

253
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,835
The old pins ain't
what they used to be.

254
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,433
What's your point?

255
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,876
I was wondering what it's like
to be a security guard.

256
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,315
I really look up to people like you.

257
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,549
Do you?

258
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,437
Yeah. How'd I get to be like you?

259
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,115
Well, tell you what,
give us your name and address,

260
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,236
and I'll send you
all you need to apply.

261
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,118
- Would you?
- Sure. Why not?

262
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,272
Brilliant. All right.
My name's Henry Krinkle.

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,794
K- r-i-n-k-l-e.

264
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,632
154, Hopper Avenue.

265
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,153
- Hopper?
- Yeah, Hopper.

266
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,920
Ow. Ow.

267
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,437
Colin! Stop her.

268
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,712
Who does he think he is?
Bob bloody Kane?

269
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,633
Tell him I'd make more money
pimping his grandmother.

270
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,679
How's Dad?

271
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,753
0h, you know him. Frustrated as ever.
He's taken up art classes.

272
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,796
- What?
- Yes.

273
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,599
I think he'd always fancied
himself as an artist.

274
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,159
He keeps it to himself.

275
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,038
We always hoped you might
go in for that sort of thing.

276
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,838
You were so good at it at school.

277
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,310
It might have given you something
to talk about with your father.

278
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,870
- Mum.
- What, love?

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,078
Something I should tell you.

280
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,718
What is it?

281
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
This is it. Fourth floor.

282
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,675
- You ready?
- I was born ready.

283
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,512
- But are you ready now?
- Yeah.

284
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,672
We've only got to get the
picture back and not get caught.

285
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,954
How hard can that be?

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,677
Tell Stan I'll speak to him later.

287
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,149
After I've put Bisley
out of his misery.

288
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,317
There it is.

289
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,197
- Shit.
- Is it locked?

290
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,395
No, I was joking.

291
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,518
- What are we gonna do?
- Er...there.

292
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,671
- What?
- Ventilation shaft.

293
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,988
Simple and classic.

294
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,999
0h.

295
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,834
- I can't believe this.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,117
- Why?
- I thought you'd be disappointed.

297
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,953
That's so silly.
We don't mind what you do,

298
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,632
so long as you're not gay.

299
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,358
I bet you made up Twist, as well.

300
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,398
I should've known.
What sort of a name is Twist?

301
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,075
- No, she's real.
- Well, that's something.

302
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,596
- So, you're an artist.
- Yep.

303
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,796
What sort of thing do you do?

304
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,393
Um, anger.

305
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,031
Aaaaaaaah!

306
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,678
Pain.

307
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,829
Ow!

308
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,558
Fear.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,035
Aggressión.

310
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,151
Watercolours?

311
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,474
Do you go clubbing much?

312
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,551
No, do a lot of night work.

313
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,279
I love night work.
I'm usually up all hours.

314
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,113
- Speeding through the night?
- Something like that.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,115
0K, stay out of sight.

316
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,236
If anybody comes,
warn me on the walkie.

317
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,548
- Roger.
- Let's go.

318
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,997
- How's your knee?
- I'll live.

319
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,640
My teeth hurt.

320
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,439
I wish I hadn't started this now.

321
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,717
I'm sorry, Marsha,
but I did warn you.

322
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,193
It was the same with netball.

323
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,508
At school.

324
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,517
'I remember playing a friendly
in the upper sixth.

325
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,989
'I played goal attack.

326
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,072
'And I had a wee rivalry with
the goalie on the other team.

327
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,628
'She was called Nina.

328
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,314
'I remember the goal shooter
took a shot

329
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,755
'and it was obvious
Nina was gonna save.

330
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,308
'So I did what I had to do.

331
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,436
'I saved the game.

332
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,871
'But I lost a lot of friends.'

333
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,990
I just shouldn't exercise.

334
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,390
It's not just bad for me,
it's bad for everybody.

335
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,598
I don't know.
I'm really feeling the benefit now.

336
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,477
Come on, let's fuck off home.

337
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,074
Hmm. I wonder if Tim's back.

338
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,075
What's Colin looking at?

339
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,429
Where's he off to?

340
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,432
0h, my God!

341
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,229
So, when did you decide
to become an artist?

342
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,754
I think it was,
you know, when the dog died.

343
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,434
0h, you never did get over that.

344
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,635
Colin!

345
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,597
Colin!

346
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,597
Pom-Pom!

347
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,753
Not again.

348
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,239
Colin!

349
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,309
Daisy!

350
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,308
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

351
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,789
0oh, um. Well.

352
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,997
- I...was just...
- Looking for this?

353
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,309
Yes. Yeah, um...

354
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,197
I had to get it back, you see.

355
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,398
I mean if Mr Knox saw it, then...

356
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,516
It wouldn't really
do you any favours?

357
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,113
No, no, no.

358
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,078
No, um.

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,354
How are you, Sophie?

360
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,714
Fine, thanks.

361
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,155
Good, good.

362
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,356
I forgot you worked here.

363
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,509
Really?

364
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,229
'Tim, that girl you fancy's
coming into the office.'

365
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,270
Thanks, Mike.

366
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,597
How's Damien?

367
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,831
I'm sorry. You just
ran out in front of me.

368
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,549
I know you.
You're a massive wanker.

369
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,312
I said I was sorry.

370
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,551
I've had enough of keeping fit.
It's too bloody dangerous.

371
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,474
If people throw themselves
in front of cars, what do you expect?

372
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,232
She could sue you.

373
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,992
For what?

374
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,195
Dangerous driving.

375
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,748
Bloody hell, you're not a lawyer?

376
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,718
No, he's an artist.

377
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,916
- Here's your picture.
- Thanks.

378
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,791
I think I'll keep this one.

379
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,633
Yeah, fine.

380
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,551
It was nice to see you again, Tim.

381
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,359
You're nice, too.
It was nice to see you, too.

382
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,110
- Tim.
- Yes.

383
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,555
- What are you doing on Friday?
- What?

384
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,315
Would you like to go out for a drink
with me on Friday?

385
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,198
Yeah.

386
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
Great. I'll give you a ring.

387
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,638
OK.

388
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,951
- See you Friday.
- See you Friday.

389
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,949
You get it?

390
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,917
That's not all I got.

391
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,150
Leave the coffee!

392
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,158
No, never been to Ibiza.

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,878
You should go, mate.

394
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,872
Went to Gran Canaria.
I got some pictures, actually.

395
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,478
- What the...
- The cat is out of the bag.

396
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,516
'Repeat,
the cat is out of the bag.'

397
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,556
Shit.

398
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,558
He's taking the stairs,
get the lift.

399
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,154
'He's taking the stairs,
get the lift!'

400
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,719
Shit.

401
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,793
Bisley.

402
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,677
Hi.

403
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,833
Well now. You're keen, aren't you?

404
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,913
Haven't had a chance to look
over your stuff yet.

405
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,036
0h, that's all right.

406
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,874
- Everything all right, Willis?
- Sorry, sir.

407
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,554
Thought I saw unauthorised
personnel on the monitor.

408
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,269
I haven't seen anybody.

409
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,396
I'll get back to me desk, then.

410
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,629
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello.

411
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,790
- What are you doing here?
- I'm with Tim.

412
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,677
Right. You coming to TA Saturday?

413
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,116
0h, yes. Stealth and tactics
weekend. I wouldn't miss it.

414
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,158
I've an idea for an
infiltration technique.

415
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,118
It involves draining a man's
blood, replacing it with Tizer.

416
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,509
Sounds great.
Look forward to that.

417
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,953
- See you Saturday.
- Yeah.

418
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,473
Sir.

419
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,120
Yes, right.

420
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,715
Good to see you looking
so enthusiastic, Bisley.

421
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,712
I'll let you know either way.

422
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,438
Thanks, Mr Knox.

423
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,559
- Damien.
- Thanks, Damien.

424
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,269
- Nice outfit.
- 0h, thanks.

425
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,475
He's nice, isn't he?

426
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,389
So, we happy?

427
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,595
Are we happy.

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,910
Right, mine's a pint
of the black stuff.

429
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,834
You can't drink
a pint of Bovril.

430
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,679
What do you think?

431
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,991
Very good. Very good indeed.

432
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,038
Schedule him in
for a meeting next Tuesday.

433
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,398
I think we're going to be seeing
a lot of young Mr Bisley.

434
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,432
- 0i oi.
- 0h. Hello.

435
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,351
Hi. Listen, I got that picture back.

436
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,510
- That's not all he got.
- Mike.

437
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,999
- I got off me ass.
- Did you?

438
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,274
- Yeah.
- What happened?

439
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,918
I bumped into a friend of yours.

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,309
Really? why don't you
tell me all about it?

441
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,152
- My ass?
- Yeah, if you like.

442
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,678
Where's Tyres?
