1
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,433
- I'm sorry.
- I'm hit!

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,238
- I'm blind.
- Buffy!

3
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,798
- Amber.
- Amber.

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,711
- Amber.
- Amber.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,518
Woof.

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,510
I knew this day would come.

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,957
Still. She had to go sometime.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,631
I met this girl
when I was travelling,

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,598
whose dad had to go to war,
but he was crippled.

10
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,035
Because she wasn't
what her parents wanted,

11
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,236
not that Amber
wasn't what you wanted,

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,709
but you know she was
different, like a tomboy...

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,713
So she stole her dad's armour

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,472
and went to war instead of him

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,516
and they won the war because of her.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,398
- That's Mulan.
- That's her name. Do you know her?

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,711
- It's a film.
- It's a Disney film. Yes.

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,917
And there's a song in it...

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,798
which is about how she wants
to look in the mirror...

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,348
# And see her real reflection #

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,479
I think that's probably
a bit how Amber's feeling.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,676
Like Mulan?

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,909
Yeah.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,719
Eddie Murphy does the voice
of the dragon.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,472
To my mind, his third best film.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,596
Does anyone want a drink?

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,912
Phew. Bit early for that, innit?
Yeah, go on, then.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,434
I'm thinking more like a tea.

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,598
Are you worried about Amber?

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,798
Nah. She's got three languages and a
Dutch cap. She'll be fine. Cheers.

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,190
You are so blind!
You so do not understand!

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,077
You weren't there at the beginning.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,515
You don't know how good it was.
How important.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,079
This is it for you.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
This jumped-up firework
display of a toy advert.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,439
People like you make me sick.
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,638
Now, I don't care if you've
saved up all your 50p's.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,314
Take your pocket money and get out!

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,196
What a prick.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,399
Tim, can I have a word in my office?

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,550
Yes.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,191
Have a seat, Tim.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,514
- Twiglet?
- Better not.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,830
I was like you once.

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,869
Blond hair. Scraggy little beard.
Child-like ears.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,791
Full of beans and spunk.

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,474
I let my principles
get in the way sometimes.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,278
I punched a bloke
in the face once

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,396
for saying Hawk the Slayer
was rubbish.

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,232
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,639
But that's not the point.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,439
The point is, I was defending
the fantasy genre

53
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,192
with terminal intensity,

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,158
when what I should have said is,
"Dad, you're right."

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,959
Let's give Krull a try
and we'll discuss it later.

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,318
The Phantom Menace
was 18 months ago, Tim.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,437
I know, Bilbo.
It just... It still hurts.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,238
That kid brought in a Jaja doll.

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,311
- Kids like Jaja.
- Why?

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,277
What about the Ewoks?

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,669
They were rubbish.
You don't complain about them.

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,469
Jaja Binks makes the Ewoks
look like fucking Shaft.

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,278
- I've had enough, Tim.
- Bilbo.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,033
I know how you feel, I do.
But this can't go on.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,076
What you trying to say?

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,516
I'm gonna have to let you go.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,750
Phew!

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,599
I thought you were gonna
fire me then.

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,593
I was like ergh... Phew.
Look at that.

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,273
Right, Daisy. 0ff to work.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,396
Should be back
in a couple of hours.

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,074
Mike. Mike, have you got any money?

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,230
If you mean actual currency, no.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,711
I was sure I had some,
but it just seems to have gone.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,678
0h, I should, you know, get off.

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,830
You didn't sort of borrow it?

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,195
You know, go through
my pockets and...

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,875
- Steal it?
- I'm sorry. That sounded really bad.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,916
- Did you steal it?
- No!

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,436
Sorry. No, you're right.
Have a nice day.

81
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,953
Thanks.

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,429
Mike, what do you do?
I've never asked.

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,512
If I tell you that,
I'll have to kill you.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,431
What, is it like secret?

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,999
No.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,268
Hi, Bri.

87
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,557
- Gone.
- What's gone?

88
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,394
- Can't paint.
- Yes, you can. You're very good.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,634
Mind's just blank. Haven't
painted anything in months.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,392
I don't know what's wrong.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,439
Maybe you should try approaching
the canvas in different ways.

92
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,317
I have.

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,590
How do you tackle
a creative block, Daisy?

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,717
Well, I'm actually
very, very fortunate.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,756
I rarely suffer from writer's block.

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,070
- I'm extremely prolific.
- Very lucky.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,151
Yeah, I know.

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,196
Have you got any money, Brian?

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,477
I've got to sign on today
and I can't afford the bus fare.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,471
Can't you go to the bank?

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,357
Please, just a tenner?

102
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,319
I haven't got a bank account.

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,551
They closed it. I'm really worried.

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,471
I haven't signed on for three months

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,755
and I didn't tell them
I was going away.

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,913
I'm sure you'll be all right.
They're reasonable people.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,594
Please! Just a tenner.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,435
Tim?

109
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,193
- Is everything all right?
- Yes! Why?!

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,599
No reason.

111
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,155
I've lost my job.

112
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,437
What? Why?

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,315
Not Phantom Menace.

114
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,835
- Better go.
- All right, Bri.

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,356
Good luck with your blockage.
0h, a letter came for you.

116
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,672
Thanks. Sorry
about your job, Tim.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,069
Yeah. I'm sorry
about your uncle, Brian.

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,436
Come on, mate. It's not as if
he hasn't fired you before.

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,953
He's a reasonable bloke.

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,634
If you talked to him
you could sort it out.

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,190
I don't think so. Someone's
got an interview this afternoon.

122
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,229
Well, one thing's for sure,
they'll be no Tim Bisley.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,314
Well, it all seems to be
in order. When can you start?

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,550
Come on, Tim.
There'll be other jobs.

125
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,234
Anyway, what about your comic?

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,992
I'm sure the comic industry's

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,072
desperately in need
of a giant, mutant bird

128
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,515
with special claws.

129
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,916
You've just got
to get out there.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,436
- Yeah, well, I'm scared.
- 0f what?

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,995
Nothing.

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,117
Come on. I was about
to go and sign on.

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,713
Why don't you come with me?

134
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,394
- OK.
- Lend me the bus fare?

135
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,552
- OK.
- Yeah.

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,517
You've got a very special talent.

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,876
Sooner or later it's going
to make you a lot of money.

138
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,712
Yeah, thanks, Daisy.

139
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,917
I wish I had another special
talent to fall back on.

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,032
'Dear Brian, I hope
this letter finds you well

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,237
'and that you're not finding
being a lawyer too stressful.

142
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,312
'Sadly, I'm writing with bad news.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,915
'Your Uncle Kevin died

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,072
'whilst driving to Staines

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,754

146
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,718
'to come to the funeral,

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,598
'Lots of love, Mum.'

148
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,788
I'm frightened.
What are you gonna say?

149
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,110
I'll tell 'em I was ill
and start crying.

150
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,159
- That's you. New claims.
- Where? 0h, yeah. 0K.

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,470
- Good luck.
- You, too.

152
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,871
Hello. I'm Daisy Steiner.

153
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,758
I had an appointment
at 10:30. I'm late.

154
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,873
Daisy Steiner, you must take
an AB form from the stand

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,234
and then join the queue.

156
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,392
How long will I have to wait?

157
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,756
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Just fill out the form.

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,358
How long have you been
unemployed, Mr Bisley?

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,112
About an hour and a half.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,589
Have you been looking for work?

161
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,392
That's good. No.

162
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,311
Why did you leave your last job?

163
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,709
- I got fired.
- Why?

164
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,233
Difference of opinion.

165
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,075
- The Phantom Menace.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,109
- Didn't you like it?
- No.

167
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,476
Well, leave this with me.

168
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,677
I'll get you some money out
in the next few days.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,955
Hello.

170
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,917
- Brian, it's me.
- Hello, me.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,434
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

172
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,196
- I miss you.
- Miss me, too.

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,953
Would you like to come out
for drinks later?

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,635
- Yes, please.
- 'I could stay at yours.'

175
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,632
I'm not working tomorrow.
We could stay in bed all day.

176
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,430
So don't forget
to wash your sheets.

177
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,432
- Right.
- And your penis.

178
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,512
- OK.
- 'Bye.'

179
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,312
Bye.

180
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,077
Ah, no. This is the Ab form.
You need the AB form, capital B.

181
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,593
But... What?

182
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,557
I've been here for over an hour.

183
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,073
Just over there on the stand.

184
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,355
Is this it?

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,718
0K. You wanna sign on again.

186
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,835
Yeah.

187
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,876
You last signed on three months ago.

188
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,916
What have you been doing since then?

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,309
I've been ill.

190
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,593
Do you have a doctor's note?

191
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,750
No, I lost it.

192
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,513
Look, this shouldn't be a problem.

193
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,353
I just want some money.

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,590
You've always
given me money before.

195
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,636
Sure you haven't been on holiday?

196
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,349
Me? God, no. I couldn't
afford that. Not on my income.

197
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,349
- You...bastard!
- What can I say? She liked me.

198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,034
How am I gonna pay the rent?

199
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,838
Just write some articles.

200
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,798
It's not as easy as that, Tim.
I can't just pluck

201
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,077
another Winter Skin Care
Dos And Don'ts out of the air.

202
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,673
Why?

203
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,996
Well, maybe poverty
will inspire you.

204
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,433
It's not that bad.

205
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,476
Mike's giving us
a few quid every week.

206
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,596
What if he wants to move out?

207
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,069
He doesn't at the moment.
He's happy.

208
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,594
It's not as if he's gonna
get a better offer

209
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,750
by the time we get back, is it?

210
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,193
Eh?

211
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,309
Mike, d'you mind...

212
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,753
What are you doing?

213
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,231
Marsha has kindly offered me
the position of lodger,

214
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,117
which I have duly accepted.

215
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,633
- But Mike...
- No, no.

216
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,711
You've been kind enough
to let me stay,

217
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,030
but now you're back,
I should move on.

218
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,917
But we like having you here.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,718
It'll be fine. I'm only upstairs.

220
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,552
We can see each other every day.

221
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,438
We'll be able to legitimately
use our walkie-talkies

222
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,839
without going to the park.

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,356
- Ready then?
- With you in one second.

224
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,716
Here he is, then. My new lodger.

225
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,153
Hardly see the other one.

226
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,835
Yeah, Brian's spending
a lot of time with Twist.

227
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,036
I mean, I hardly see her.

228
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,111
I sometimes hear her.

229
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,231
Yeah, he was up earlier on.

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,710
I think he's having some kind
of creative crisis.

231
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,633
Serves him right for getting
his knackers in a twist.

232
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,278
Come on then, Mike.

233
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm looking forward to having a
strong bloke round the house.

234
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,717
Who's that?

235
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
- You, you pillock.
- 0h, right.

236
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,911
0ooooooh, he's funny, isn't he?

237
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,033
Any thoughts?

238
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,157
I'll have to get some new
batteries for my walkie-talkie.

239
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,832
No, about our situation.

240
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,399
We're both unemployed.

241
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,869
I'm getting no benefit.
We need money.

242
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,679
How else am I gonna afford
aspirational magazines?

243
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,318
I'm gonna get a job.

244
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,153
Why? You've just signed on.
You don't have to.

245
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,231
I like working, Daisy.

246
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,788
The smell of the ink,
the taste of the biscuit.

247
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,598
Giving the littl'uns advice.

248
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,796
'People like you
make me sick!'

249
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,634
Yeah, well. So do I.
I love working.

250
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,837
I was a barmaid once. I loved it.

251
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,070
The hustle and bustle of a busy bar.

252
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,516
- Can I get some service, please?
- 0h, fuck you.

253
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,797
What can I say?
We are good with people.

254
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,871
- Absolutely.
- That's what writers do.

255
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,555
They take unrelated jobs
in order to make money

256
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,993
and...gain experience.

257
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,834
I temped in this office once

258
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,230
and there were some great
characters, real fodder.

259
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,197
There was this guy Tony...

260
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,872
0h, what did he say?

261
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,513
Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do.

262
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,036
Everyone does things they don't
want to do sometimes.

263
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,712
Mike isn't doing what he wants

264
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,791
- but he makes the best of it.
- Does he?

265
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,474
Move, move!

266
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,357
Don't look at me! Move!

267
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,193
I am gonna go to one
of those temping places

268
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,396
and put my name down for a job.

269
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,311
That's the spirit. New horizons.

270
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,315
- Pastures green. Change.
- And not the small kind.

271
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,675
- Why is that funny?
- I don't know.

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,956
You worked
in a comic shop before?

273
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,474
Yeah. The Fantasy Bazaar.

274
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,996
Fantasy Bazaar. That's
Bilbo Bagshot's shop, isn't it?

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,878
- Yeah.
- Why'd you leave?

276
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,953
- Difference of opinion.
- Phantom Menace?

277
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,998
Yeah. And I wanted a change.

278
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,198
- 0K. When can you start?
- I'm sorry?

279
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,078
When can you start?

280
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,917
So, what kind
of work can you do?

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,150
Sorry?

282
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,357
What kind of work can you do?

283
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,159
Well, I'm creative,

284
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,189
but I'm at home in the normal
office environment.

285
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,273
But equally comfortable in the
hustle and bustle of an eatery.

286
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,873
So that's anything?

287
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,793
Yes, yes. Anything. I'm desperate.

288
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,033
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs K.

289
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,315
Give us a shout
if you need anything.

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,549
OK.

291
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,312
Anything at all.

292
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,311
0K, then.

293
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,233
I like to think I'm
an approachable landlady.

294
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,435
0K, then.

295
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,598
- That's great.
- So anything you want.

296
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,558
Just ask.

297
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,200
There a key to this lock?

298
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,312
Hello, Brian.

299
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,631
Hello.

300
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,712
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

301
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,837
- Bit busy.
- Doing what?

302
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,630
Nice to see you've tidied up a bit.

303
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,313
Thanks.

304
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,915
Daisy was telling me
you're feeling a little dry.

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,513
Everything 0K?

306
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,071
- Mmm.
- Yes?

307
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,914
Don't know, Marsha.
Can't seem to get inspired.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,228
Used to come so easily.

309
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,356
Thought I'd cracked it this morning.

310
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,874
Got a letter saying
Uncle Kevin had died.

311
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,077
Next thing I knew, I was painting.
Couldn't stop.

312
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,153
Twist called and lost it. Just went.

313
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,038
You know what
your problem is, Brian.

314
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,509
What?

315
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,512
You're happy.

316
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,192
I think you'll find

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,159
you dried up the minute
you started seeing Twit.

318
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,756
- D'you think so?
- It's obvious.

319
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,594
You cannot have your cake
and eat her, Brian.

320
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,071
Contentment is the enemy
of invention.

321
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,559
0h, my God.

322
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,632
Funny, innit?

323
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,316
You were so prolific
when we was at it.

324
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,392
- This is awful.
- Innit.

325
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,438
- What a dilemma.
- Can't believe this.

326
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,990
It's so depressing, Brian.

327
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,072
You must be really worried.

328
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,311
- Yes.
- Angst-ridden.

329
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,076
- Yes.
- Inconsolable.

330
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,196
Yes.

331
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,035
Right, I'm off.

332
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,313
Mike's cooking beans,

333
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,518
then we're gonna polish his guns
and watch The A-Team, bye.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,150
I love it when a plan comes together.

335
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,795
Hello, Silent Reading.

336
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes, we do stock Jaja Binks
merchandise.

337
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,795
Yeah, we've got him in
cuddly form,

338
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,030
lunch box, action figure
and key ring.

339
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,031
No problem, bye-bye.

340
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,633
Well done, Tim.

341
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,076
You've just taken your first
step into a larger worid.

342
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,149
All right, Derek.

343
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,433
Bilbo.

344
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,239
I was wondering if I could
have a chat with Tim.

345
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,153
Certainly.

346
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,559
I'll put some tea on.

347
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,677
- Want a cup, Tim?
- Yes, please.

348
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,230
He should mount
his collector's editions

349
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
in full view, not hide 'em away.

350
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,393
Man's insane.

351
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,277
Why'd you want to talk to me?

352
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,828
So, how's it going?

353
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,194
Yeah, it's all right.

354
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,876
- What's Derek like as a boss?
- He's 0K.

355
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,236
I don't really agree with his
policy on vintage comic display.

356
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,794
Tim, I'm sorry I sacked you.
It was a mistake.

357
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,269
Things not working out
with the new guy?

358
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,396
You could say that.

359
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,879
Hawk the Slayer's rubbish.

360
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,748
- I see.
- Will you come back?

361
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,114
Well...I like it here.

362
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,555
What makes you think
I want to come back?

363
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,392
This.

364
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,956
'Bilbo, this is Tim.

365
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,032
'Please can I come back?
I don't like it here.'

366
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,193
- You got that?
- I would have come in anyway.

367
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,510
The place is just not
the same without you.

368
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,439
I'm already there.

369
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,158
What?

370
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,037
I mean, I'll come back.

371
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,591
0h, yeah. Yeah, you frightened
me for a bit there.

372
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,591
I'll have to give my notice here.

373
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,908
Can't you just get fired?

374
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,879
Derek, Babylon 5's
a big pile of shit.

375
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,359
Get out!

376
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,514
I got me job back.

377
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,278
I got me own room.

378
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,429
How's Brian doing?

379
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,080
He's standing in the garden
with no clothes on.

380
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,597
- What about Daisy?
- She got a job in a bookshop.

381
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,911
- Think she'll be all right?
- Erm... Yeah.

382
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,315
Excuse me, can you point me
in the direction of Personal Growth?

383
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,709
Fuck you.

384
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,391
'S'il vous plaít.'
