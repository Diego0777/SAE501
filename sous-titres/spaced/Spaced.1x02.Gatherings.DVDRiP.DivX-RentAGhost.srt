(There Must Be An Angel)

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,911
Morning, darling, I've made you breakfast.
Did you sleep all right?

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,829
Erm... yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,151
I had a really weird dream.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,555
Did you, babe?

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,637
I dreamt you chucked me
and I moved in with a girl I hardly knew.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,796
- I chucked you?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,434
- As if !
- Yeah !

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,550
- Aarrghh !
- Tim !

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,512
Shit !

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,357
Aarrghh !

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,231
Shit.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,271
Son of a bitch !

(The All Seeing Eye: The Beat Goes On)

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,954
Tim? I'm really trying to work.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,715
- What you telling me for?
- Well, I...

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,991
I can't concentrate with this mess,
I think it's time we unpacked.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,952
- I have unpacked.
- Have you?

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,912
<i>I'm not talking about your room,
I'm talking about this room.</i>

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,758
This is a shared area,
you've got stuff in here too.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,758
But it's under your stuff.
Soon as you clear up, I can do the rest.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,360
- I've got work to do.
- So you keep saying.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,432
I haven't seen you sit behind that typewriter
for longer than two minutes.

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,598
- What do you mean?
- I mean... I think you're avoiding work.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,436
Oh, really?

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,311
I just think we should draw up
some kind of a rota. All right?

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,035
- All right.
- We need to establish domestic equilibrium.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,071
- OK.
- We need to get used to each other.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,032
We don't know each other that well, do we ?

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,679
No.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,156
In the interests of making
this cohabitation charade work for us,

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,191
we should do everything we can

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,279
to try and make day-to-day life
as easy and enjoyable as possible.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,312
All right ! Look, I'm agreeing with you.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,673
Right. I'll get on with it, then.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,110
- All righty.
- OK.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,875
Right.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,913
I'm going to divide it
into kitchen, living room and...

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,959
Right, then.

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,634
Hey.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,716
It's OK, it's me.

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,751
- Gosh.
- How's it going ?

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,951
Fine. How long have I been going ?

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,119
- Two and a half minutes.
- Shit !

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,230
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- What ?

47
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,669
- Something I think you're gonna like.
- I've got to be getting on.

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,188
It's important, Daisy. Trust me.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,429
Hm. I'm glad we did that.

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
We had to really.

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,709
It was inevitable. I'm just glad
we did it sooner rather than later.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,673
I think there would have been a hell of a lot
of tension if we'd left it any longer.

53
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,153
You're telling me.

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,070
What shall we do now ?

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,194
I think we should descale the teapot.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,630
- You filthy bitch.
- You love it.

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,715
Here we go. Here we go.

58
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,310
Tim, what are you doing ?

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,440
We're having a sale on X-Men comics
at the shop.

60
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,759
Bilbo wants me to draw a picture of Wolverine
slashing prices with his adamantium claws.

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,234
- I'm also doing a poster...
- All right !

62
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,830
Oh ! Oh, my glasses ! Where are my glasses ?

63
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,431
Oh.

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,511
Right. Yes !

65
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,592
Let's have a party !
Let's have a house-warming party.

66
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,790
- What ?
- It'd be great !

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,230
I could make invitations
out of plastic and tinfoil.

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,748
We can invite Marsha and Brian.

69
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,670
- Yeah, all right. When ?
- Tonight ! Let's have it tonight !

70
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,473
Tonight ? ! That's a bit short notice.

71
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,274
It'll be great, I'll call all my mates,
it'll be like Warhol's Factory -

72
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,629
artists, writers, musicians,
dossers off the street,

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,673
all interacting and relaxing in our pad,
the new hub of north London.

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,790
The cutting edge ! You know ?

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,274
We could have a glitter ball !
I could make one out of tinfoil !

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,911
- All right.
- Yes !

77
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,597
- But your room's the coat room.
- OK.

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,156
Get this old thing out the way.

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,556
? Party, um-by-ay, party, um-by-ay...

80
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,358
<i>If we have it, they will come,</i>

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,911
I said yes.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,351
Leave me alone !

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,473
Holiday from what ? We'd all have
a bleedin' holiday, wouldn't we ?

84
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,432
Oh, hello. Everything all right ?

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,471
Teenagers, eh ?

86
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,717
She's not a teenager,
she's the devil in an A cup !

87
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,231
Well, us amiable bunch of 20-somethings,
us harmless happy-go-lucky lot,

88
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,317
we're having a party tonight,
very small, very quiet.

89
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,797
We wondered if you and Amber wanted
to come and throw coleslaw at each other.

90
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,389
She won't come, she's having a party
of her own up here tonight.

91
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,876
- You sure you want me there ?
- Oh, yeah ! We'd love it if you came.

92
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,591
Will Brian be there ?

93
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,359
I hope so, Tim's just gone to ask him.

94
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,960
- Do you like him ?
- He's all right.

95
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,911
Good legs.

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,272
- Who is it ?
- Father Christmas.

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,192
- Oh, it's you.
- Who'd you think it was ?

98
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,428
Daisy wants a house-warming party tonight

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,948
so she sent me to ask you
if you want to come.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,913
- Is Marsha coming ?
- I don't know, she's gone up to ask her.

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,269
What's the deal with you and Marsha ?

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,551
- You know about the deal ?
- What ? !

103
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,308
I'm busy, Tim, painting a triptych.

104
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,396
- Oh, yeah, what's it called ?
- Bad Sandwich.

105
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,998
- Really ?
- Yes.

106
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,795
It's a piece about violence in its immediacy,
the instancy of the event,

107
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,632
a synchronic rendering
of three explosive, aggressive expressions.

108
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,671
- There'll be girls at the party.
- Really ?

109
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,278
- Yes.
- Mm.

110
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,831
All right, mate ?

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,111
I don't think we're gonna need any security,
it's gonna be very low-key.

112
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,711
Well... Yeah, well, bring one.
Bring the Baretta. Yeah.

113
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,469
No, bring the Glock 17, yeah,
that's my favourite.

114
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,876
OK, I'll see you later. Bye.
Where have you been ?

115
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,036
Talking to Marsha. What's a Glock 17 ?

116
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,992
It's a gun.
You've been talking to Marsha for four hours ?

117
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,589
Did you know her husband once drummed
for Status Quo ? Who's bringing a gun ?

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,757
Mike. Is that what you've been talking about
for four hours ?

119
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
Why is Mike bringing a gun to our party ?

120
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,994
Security. Do you think she suspects
we're not a couple ?

121
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,431
I don't think so. Why do we need security ?
We're not organising a rave.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,270
It's not that kind of security, it's like
a gonk, a troll, a Linus blanket, you know.

123
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,312
Do we still have to hold hands in the corridor ?

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,638
- Not if you don't want to.
- I didn't say that.

125
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,148
We could probably cut down
on the fake sex noises.

126
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,710
Shame.

127
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,639
My friend Twist is coming.
Oh, you're gonna love her, she's brilliant !

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,673
She's brilliant, really intelligent, funny,
talented, funny, funny, interesting.

129
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,711
Forget all that. Is she fit ?

130
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,557
She ran half a marathon for Fashion Aid.

131
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,512
Have you managed to rustle up
any media types ?

132
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,551
- Oh, yeah.
- Who ?

133
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,989
- The paperboy.
- Smooth.

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,519
What about you ?

135
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,750
What with the Skaterama
at the East Finchley Uberbowl

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,839
and the Tripods convention in Swindon,
most of my friends are otherwise engaged.

137
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,190
Don't worry, Tim, it's gonna be great.

138
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,073
I'm just gonna go and try on a few outfits.

139
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,997
- Hello ?
- Oh, hi. Is Daisy there, please ?

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,350
Hang on, she's just getting her clothes on.
Daisy ! It's your boyfriend !

141
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,354
Shh ! Hi, Richard.

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,836
- What did he mean by that ?
- 'By what ? '

143
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,911
About you getting your clothes on ?

144
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,635
We're having a house-warming,
I was trying to pick some clothes.

145
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,877
- Oh, I see.
- 'How's it going ? '

146
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,675
What's that ? !

147
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,712
Daisy, I can hear sex noise !

148
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,671
Shh ! Not now !

149
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,591
I see it as a tribute

150
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,230
to Christo, the artist.

151
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,671
I see it as a waste

152
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,269
of Baco, the foil.

153
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,396
Party !

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,557
OK, whoo ! Whoo !

155
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,195
Music. Music ! We need warm-up music !

156
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,196
Warm-up music, warm-up music.

157
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,800
Party tape. Here we go.

158
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,992
? Hot dog, jumping frog

159
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,078
? Alma Cookies

160
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,914
? Hot dog, jumping frog

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,996
Come on !

162
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,512
Ooh, try not to eat too much,
there's quite a lot of people coming. Yeah ?

163
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,350
Hey, Brian, do you want some ice ?

164
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,960
Come on ! Come on !
Come and get some ice, go on !

165
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,352
Oh, God, I don't understand this !

166
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,474
I defrosted this earlier. It just eats up
electricity and frosts up really quickly.

167
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,672
I put half a Magnum in there this afternoon,
