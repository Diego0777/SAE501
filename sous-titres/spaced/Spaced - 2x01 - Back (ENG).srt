Enough.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,271
So how are you? How was Asia?

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,874
It was great.
I had a wonderful time.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,633
It was like, you know,
being in another country.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,996
It was a different worid,
another universe.

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,640
I feel very Zen. Very different.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,153
I don't know where to start.

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,639
Near the end?

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,472
Where's Colin?

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,153
Ah, erm...

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,037
0h, you bastard.

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,917
He's upstairs with Marsha.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,274
Is he all right?

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,396
He's fine. I'm sure he's fine.

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,076
Check out the tan.

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,799
Yeah, you look like Pocahontas.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,235
Thank you very much, Casper.

72
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,074
- You know, the ghost.
- 0h, right.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,550
So how are you, then,
you big bloody man?

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,996
I'm good. I'm good. I've had
a few things to work through.

75
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,469
- With Sarah?
- No, with George Lucas.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,275
Tim, it's been over a year.

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,590
It's been 18 months, Daisy.

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,398
And it still hurts.

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,948
I didn't think Phantom Menace
was that bad.

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,033
It's nice to see you, Mike.
What've you been up to?

81
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,111
I'm in the quarterfinals
of Robot Wars.

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,111
Wow!

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,634
But I've had to
move out of Mum's place.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,757
- Really?
- Things have been a bit...difficult.

85
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,832
She's been very overbearing
and I felt suffocated.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,876
I've got a lot to offer the worid,

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,599
and my mum's not ready
to accept that yet.

88
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,148
- Right.
- And I shot the cat up the asshole.

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,798
Right.

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,908
Well, we'll have to have
a party at your flat.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,755
Yeah... Actually, Daisy,
he's staying here. I spoke to Marsha.

92
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,876
She said, "The more the merrier."

93
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,428
As far as she knows, he's
staying in the spare room.

94
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,670
0h, right. 0h...my room.

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,079
- Yeah.
- I see.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,833
Sorry to spring this on you,
he had nowhere to go.

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,198
- There was a bed going, so...
- It's fine. Fine.

98
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,589
Hope you haven't made
too much of a mess.

99
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,635
He'll be on the sofa by tonight.

100
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,995
Fine! It's fine. It's fine.

101
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,152
I've been sleeping rough
for two months.

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,959
Another night's not gonna kill me.

103
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,079
Let's see your photos.

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,474
No need for photos.
Welcome to the 21st century.

105
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,792
I got this cheap in Singapore.
Here we go.

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,190
I've got three two-hour tapes.
I just couldn't stop filming.

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,272
I'm thinking about going
into documentary filmmaking.

108
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,079
Travelogues. A Michael Palin
for the millennium.

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,038
I could use this as a pilot.
See what you think.

110
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,599
See what you think.

111
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,080
'Hello and welcome to Bangkok.'

112
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,833
Yell if you get bored.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,158
'I've been here for about four
days. It's really early...'

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,591
- Who is it?
- It's Daisy.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,112
Hello, you.

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,556
- Hi.
- Go there.

117
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,475
- D'you want some tea?
- Yes, please.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,872
I got you some lapsang souchong
because I knew you were coming back.

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,279
Thanks.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,557
Did you have a great time?

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,518
Yes. Yes, I did. It was amazing.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,310
Incredible, you know.
So many different places and...

123
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,234
Is everything all right?

124
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,393
- Yes! Why?
- You seem different.

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,277
I feel different, Daisy.

126
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,669
- Are you on Prozac?
- No.

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,469
I'm just... I don't know...
I'm enjoying life

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,870
- and it's thanks...to you.
- Really?

129
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,678
It's because of you I met Twist.

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,832
I can't believe
I was single for so long.

131
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,957
Loooooove is
a beautiful thing, Daisy.

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,032
You should try it!

133
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,395
You two having fun, are you?

134
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,069
Well, Brian.
I'm very happy for you.

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,395
0ooooh!

136
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,869
Aaaaah!

137
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,029
Eeeee!

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,714
- Ow!
- Is this a new one?

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,075
- No, same one.
- 0ur one?

140
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,559
Yeah.

141
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,677
- Hello!
- Marsha.

142
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,432
Shit!

143
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,637
- Hello, kitten. Welcome home!
- Hello!

144
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,915
Hello, baby. How are you?
How's he been? Has he missed me?

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,709
He's fine. I had a bloke come
and put a dog flap out the back.

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,836
He loves it. He's never in.

147
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,311
That's cos Mummy's been away.
But she's back now, isn't she?

148
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,515
In your basket.

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,589
0ooh.

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,639
Well, come in. Come and sit down.

151
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,358
Hello, you two.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,560
Nice to have you back, Daisy.

153
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,993
I've got you something.

154
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,429
0h! Duty free! How did you know?

155
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,114
- How was it, kitten? Was it magic?
- 0h, yes. It was.

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,112
I just feel energised, you know.

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,317
I feel creative.
I feel absolutely good.

158
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,436
Did you behave yourself?

159
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,635
What d'you mean?

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,358
Well, you know.

161
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,750
Young woman away on her own
without her beau.

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,796
Never know what might happen.

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,556
Half a bottle of ouzo destructo
and ooh, the regret.

164
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,313
I didn't actually go to Greece,
I went to Asia.

165
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,039
I know. No, I was just saying.

166
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,270
I trust you didn't play away.

167
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,873
0ooooh.

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,475
Well, there was...
There was one guy.

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,673
Go on.

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,435
'He was called Steven.

171
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,913
'I met him at the airport
on the way home.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,070
'Nothing happened, just...

173
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,674
'He was really sweet.'

174
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,638
Ah, did he remind you of Tim?

175
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,756
Er, no. Not really.

176
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,675
'We just sort of found each other.

177
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,557
'Kindred spirits.

178
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,471
'You know...

179
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,075
'We talked for ages about
everything. It was great.

180
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,277
'He was so easy-going.

181
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,033
'I met a lot of really annoying
idiots on holiday.

182
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,430
'Going on and on,
but Steven just seemed...

183
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,751
'different.

184
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,152
'I don't know. He made
me feel relaxed. At ease.

185
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,071
'Like I could be myself.

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,676
'What can I say? He was like...
a real gentleman.'

187
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,990
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,514
'We were at arrivals,
just chatting.

189
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,309
'We were even gonna share a cab
and he just vanished.

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
'I must have lost him
in the crowd.'

191
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,952
0h, well. You know what they say,

192
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,749
why go out for hamburger when
you can have steak at home?

193
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,319
Get off me, you bummer.

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,598
0h, there she is,
duchess of the D grade.

195
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,148
Doing her A Levels, bless her.

196
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,878
Where the fuck have you been?

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,396
I don't mind you staying out late,
but at least you could phone.

198
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,113
Right, I'm off.

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,156
Hang on, I've got something else.

200
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,550
- It's video footage of me.
- 0h, good.

201
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,790
Just see what you think.

202
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,190
It's nice to have you back safe,
Daisy. You look really well.

203
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,158
A lot of people L0SE weight
when they're travelling.

204
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,910
- You all right?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,316
I just feel a bit weird. That's all.

206
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,757
This time yesterday,
I was in Delhi.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,594
- 0ooh!
- The most magical city in India.

208
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,196
Probably the worid...
and now I'm just back in London.

209
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,909
- Eeeeee.
- Where nothing ever happens.

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,598
It's not here.

211
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,319
We have the wrong bag?

212
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,715
Look.

213
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,158
Daisy Steiner, 23 Meteor Street,

214
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,832
Tufnell Park.

215
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,956
What do you want to do?

216
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,389
Get the car.

217
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,359
- Look.
- Look.

218
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,351
Kick-slam.

219
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,078
Come on, Daisy. Why don't you
come and have a fight?

220
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,553
No.

221
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,029
Suit yourself.

222
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,159
Can't we go down the pub?

223
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,434
The pub?

224
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,351
I REALLY want to go.

225
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,638
I fancy a pint of Guinness and
some salt and vinegar crisps.

226
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,393
I'm jet-lagged and I don't
want to fall asleep.

227
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,792
Daisy! Coming?

228
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,997
Yeah, just give me a second.

229
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,514
I'm wearing nothing at all.

230
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,875
What are you wearing?

231
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,955
0oh, Prada.

232
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,076
What's Prada?

233
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,193
- Is he coming?
- I left him a note.

234
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,430
Right, you can buy
the first round.

235
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,715
- I've only got rupees.
- God, all right.

236
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,995
- Mike can get the first round.
- What?

237
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,389
I just want to have
a nice, relaxing day.

238
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,758
- Yes?
- Daisy Steiner?

239
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,955
Yes.

240
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,999
- Are you Daisy Steiner?
- No.

241
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,832
Do you know where she is?

242
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,593
- No.
- Do you know where she is?

243
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,999
Why?

244
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,390
Miss Steiner is under suspición
of bringing a bag

245
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,517
containing sensitive materials
into the country.

246
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,715
Sensitive...

247
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,268
Can you tell us
where she is, Mr Topp?

248
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,511
How do you know my name?

249
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,830
It's written on the doorbell.

250
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,675
0h, right.

251
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,193
Where is she, Brian?

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,795
Brian isn't on the doorbell.

253
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,758
- Where is she?
- Er...

254
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,036
What pub?

255
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,034
Right, I'm off to point
the pink pistol

256
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,792
at the porcelain firing range.

257
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,079
0i oi.

258
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,392
Come on, Daisy. It can't be
that bad being back.

259
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,109
I'm fine. I was really
looking forward to coming back.

260
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,713
Seeing everybody.

261
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,679
Yeah, I've been looking forward
to seeing you, too. I have.

262
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,354
It's been really weird
since you've been away.

263
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,237
The flat's been very different.

264
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,950
- There's been... something missing.
- Really, what?

265
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,793
Um... The smell.

266
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,588
- Daisy Steiner?
- Yeah.

267
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,432
Would you come with us, please?

268
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,635
Where are you going?

269
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,790
Would you come with us, please?

270
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,199
No. I'm all right here.

271
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,669
Miss Steiner,
I don't want to tell you again.

272
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,512
I think you should go with them.

273
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,431
No. I don't know who they are.

274
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,476
Miss Steiner,
you are under suspición

275
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,154
of illegally bringing
sensitive materials

276
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,674
- into the country.
- What, a kite?

277
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,038
We have your partner in custody,
Miss Steiner.

278
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,271
- Your partner?
- A Mr Steven Edwards.

279
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,591
Who is Steven Edwards, Daisy?

280
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,795
Daisy!

281
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,317
'He was like a real gentleman.

282
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,914
'Gentleman. Gentleman.'

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,151
- Little shit.
- Who is Steven Edwards?

284
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,958
- We met at the airport.
- Did you?

285
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,952
- Miss Steiner.
- Do you mind? I'm... 0w!

286
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,278
Say hello to my little friend.

287
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,277
Huh?

288
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,510
Shit!

289
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,395
That just happened, didn't it?

290
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,357
Er, yeah.

291
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,232
'Here we are
going down the corridor.

292
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,390
'Hello.'

293
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,870
Stop walking in front of the
telly. Your tights are strobing.

294
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,632
You will go out looking like a...

295
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,632
Bloody hell!

296
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,269
Note to self.
Shoot first, quip later.

297
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,158
Where did you learn to take care
of yourself like that?

298
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,994
Let's say my time in Asia wasn't
just spent sightseeing.

299
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,268
I've changed, Tim.

300
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,992
Your front door's open.

301
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,435
- Brian.
- Welcome home, Miss Steiner.

302
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,190
They arrived just before you did.

303
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,952
You Lando.

304
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,553
Take a seat, Miss Steiner.

305
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,713
And let us not have a repeat
of our last encounter.

306
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,155
You're beginning to try my patience.

307
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,276
We have the bag, Miss Steiner.

308
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,397
- I didn't know I had it.
- There's no point resisting.

309
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,869
You have illegally carried goods
into this country,

310
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,428
contravening
every customs law there is

311
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,592
and we have all the evidence
we need to bring you in.

312
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,989
No, you don't.

313
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,038
- Marsha!
- Hello, everybody.

314
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,669
Hello, Brian.

315
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,475
What is this?

316
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,516
I think this
will clear everything up.

317
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,160
- We don't have time for this.
- 0i!

318
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,559
- Timmy!
- Wait!

319
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,875
Thanks for your help, Mrs Klein.

320
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,272
- It's Miss, actually.
- Miss Klein.

321
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,313
We'll keep this for study,
Miss Steiner.

322
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,392
Don't even think
about leaving the country.

323
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,278
Don't worry. I won't.

324
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,554
I can't afford it.

325
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,396
That's better.
You'd never know he'd been here.

326
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,835
Aw, he's like a giant baby.

327
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,797
With a moustache.

328
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,997
Thanks for letting him stay.
He won't be here too long.

329
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,036
That's 0K. I like having him here.

330
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,793
I'm sorry about your kite.

331
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,314
- My kite?
- Yeah. I got it for you.

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,879
- Did you?
- Yeah.

333
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,077
Sure you didn't get it
for Steven Edwards?

334
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,038
It was a weird day, wasn't it?

335
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,749
- Sort of...
- Slightly unbelievable.

336
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,310
- It's nice to be back, though.
- It's nice to have you back.

337
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,230
Get off me, you Joey.

338
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,956
'Hello and welcome to Bangkok.

339
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,431
'I am in the Phad Phang
Pang Pong Phankam...

340
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,229
'It's something like that...
Memorial Peace Gardens.

341
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,551
'I've been here
for about four days.

342
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,073
'It's early in the morning.

343
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,594
'It's about five
so it's quite chilly.'

344
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,791
I hate this job.
