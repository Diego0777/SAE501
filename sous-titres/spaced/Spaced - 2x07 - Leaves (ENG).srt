1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,193
# I would like to leave this city

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,159
# This old town
don't smell too pretty

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,597
# And I can feel the warning signs

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,639
# Running around my mind

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,188
# So what do you say?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,308
# You can't give me the dreams
that are mine anyway

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,631
# You're half the worid away #

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,271
'They say the family
of the 21st century

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,920
'is made up of friends,
not relatives.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,515
'Then again,
maybe that's just bollocks.'

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,276
This is the living room.

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,079
- It's really nice.
- It's a great flat.

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,555
What's going on?

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,756
- Hi. Are you the tenants?
- Yes.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,876
Mrs Klein gave me the key.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,154
What do you mean?

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,232
I'm sorry.
If you'll excuse me for a second.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,519
This is the guest bedroom.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,239
0bviously a bit
of a state at the moment,

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,595
but you can use it
for storage, utilities,

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,753
or if you want to bring
a little life into this worid.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,879
- It's perfect for a child.
- Yes, it's very...

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,951
- Homey.
- Yes, it's very homey.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,998
- Mmm.
- What's in here?

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,515
Would you mind telling us
what's going on?

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,433
Mrs Klein has decided
to sell the house.

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,751
It's a very good time, actually.
House prices are up.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,515
I believe this property
has trebled in value

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,195
- since its last purchase.
- Really. Wow!

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,158
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to get to the office.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,231
This place will get
a lot of attention.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,117
I'm sure Mrs Klein will give you

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,589
- the relevant details.
- You'd think.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,910
Goodbye.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,353
Excuse me,

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,078
how old are you?

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,310
I'm 25 and my wife's 24.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,958
Really.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,393
Yes.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,436
- Bloody hell.
- D'you mind?

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
- What are we gonna do?
- They were younger than us.

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,030
- What?
- They were younger than us.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,599
0nly physically.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,319
You heard the man.
The house has trebled in value.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,153
That's enough incentive
for Marsha to move,

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,356
besides being pissed off with us.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,793
Trebled. Really?

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,393
- Yes.
- Wow!

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,436
You find out what Brian knows.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,192
- I like your thinking.
- Thanks.

51
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,952
- Where are we?
- The cupboard.

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,758
- Why?
- I've no idea.

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,997
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe they got the wrong house.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,436
- Shh, Brian.
- Brian, you all right?

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,475
Yes.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,279
I'm having difficulty vocalising
my emotion, so I'm using this.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,316
This is a good bit.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,313
She's gone to Manchester.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,472
- Marsha's gone to Manchester?
- No, Twist.

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,597
- Thank Christ.
- Twist's gone to Manchester?

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,750
Said she needed some time to think.

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,115
You know, she likes
the gay scene up there.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,671
- When?
- Last night. Didn't she call?

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,913
Is that Conrad?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,754
No. No, it's Daisy.

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,513
Sorry. I didn't mean
to call you. I'm in Manchester.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,670
Loads to tell.

68
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,637
Speak soon. Bye.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,597
I love this one.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,716
Come on, boys. Woo!

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,633
0h, yeah. She did.

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,155
I thought you were upset
about the house.

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,153
Why would I be upset
about the house?

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,915
This house is the one thing
I can rely on,

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,797
the one port in a storm.

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,872
The one...thing

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,872
which isn't susceptible
to the whims of love.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,317
It's the solid core
of my otherwise painful...

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,228
..tortured existence.

80
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,880
I don't know what I'd do
without this old friend.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,318
This rock. This island of calm
in the ocean of life.

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,470
What did you want
to talk about anyway?

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,188
I wonder why she went.

84
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,838
We've got to convince her.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,718
- Twist?
- Marsha. We've got to find her

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,360
and say, "We're sorry.
I know we've done bad,

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,032
"we've hurt you, but please,

88
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,554
"for the sake of us, for
Brian, for the sake of...

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,029
"everything,
please don't sell the house."

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,509
- Not in such a whiny voice.
- 0K.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,789
Hello.

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,233
Hello, Mike.

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,108
How's Sophie?

94
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,159
- She's very well, thank you.
- Good. Good.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,549
Have you heard about the house, Mike?

96
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,712
- It's trebled in value.
- Half a million apparently.

97
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,109
What are you doing?

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,031
Baking.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,191
- Scone?
- No thanks.

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,759
Has Marsha contacted you?

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,319
Actually, I will have one.

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,515
Cream and jam inside.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,874
Look... Clotted cream?

104
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,598
- 0h, yes.
- I will, then.

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,272
Have you heard from Marsha?

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,590
Some guy on a motorbike
picked up her stuff.

107
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,671
Maybe she joined
the Hells Angels.

108
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,958
No, she was thrown out of the
Hells Angels in '82, lewd behaviour.

109
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,952
Where would she go?
Who does she know other than us?

110
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,554
Who would she turn to
in a time of need that is,

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,791
or might associate with,
a big guy on a motorbike?

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,352
Amber.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,398
Mum, where've you been?!

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,153
Shopping. We've got
to drink, haven't we?

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,437
I wanted to go out!

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,478
0h, moan, moan.
That's all it ever is with you.

117
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,552
- I'm telling you, Mum.
- Leave me alone.

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,311
I'm having no part in this.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,391
We have to find out
where Amber lives.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,710
- This is wrong.
- It's the only way.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,110
- Will you stop it?
- Do you wanna be homeless?

122
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,599
Buy Loot every morning?

123
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,797
Do you want to see
what Marsha's room looks like?

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,671
0oooh.

125
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,877
Wow, look at this.

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,837
Bloody 'ell.

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,718
Hey, is this what we're looking for?

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,910
42, Welwyn Terrace, Cricklewood.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,355
- Phone number?
- No. We'll surprise her.

130
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,398
- Can we take the van?
- We should start starting her.

131
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,072
Daisy, let's rock.

132
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,469
- Daisy.
- Look.

133
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,357
We don't have time for this.

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,634
There's Colin.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,308
Colin!

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,549
Colin!

137
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,552
Coliiiiiin!

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,353
Coliiiiiiin!

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,512
0h, my God. You go ahead.
I'm gonna go get Colin.

140
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,034
- He's got into the neighbours'.
- Sod Colin.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,473
I'm not gonna sod Colin.

142
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,279
Get your priorities straight.
This is our home.

143
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,512
- But he could get lost or run over.
- He can look after himself.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,477
When did you start giving a shit?

145
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,792
- Fine.
- Daisy...

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,075
No, it's fine. Excuse me.

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Well, that's just great.

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,196
We're supposed to be
a united front.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,317
It's not gonna look good
if it's just you and me.

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,834
Doesn't have to be
just you and me.

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,028
You got a tape player?

152
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,475
- No.
- Thank fuck.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
Hello?

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,828
Colin?

155
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,471
# How much is that doggie
in the window?

156
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,554
# The one with the waggly tail

157
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,998
# How much is that doggie
in the window?

158
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,150
# I do hope that dog...

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,117
# I do hope that dog...#

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,430
# I do hope that dog...
I do hope that dog...

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,158
# I do hope that dog...

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,869
# I do hope that dog...
I do hope that dog...

163
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,598
# I do hope that dog...

164
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,229
# I do hope that dog...
I do hope that dog... #

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,918
Listen. When we get there,
I'll do the talking.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,798
I am the only one capable of
serious communication.

167
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,316
Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest
you're not good communicators.

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,833
- All right, Mike?
- Yes.

169
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,148
Brian?

170
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,674
I mean it's partly my fault
we're in this mess

171
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,398
and I should do the talking.

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,436
- What are you gonna say?
- Well...

173
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,909
Marsha, they say the family
of the 21st century

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,195
is made up of friends,
not relatives,

175
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,192
and if that's true, you're
the best auntie I've ever had.

176
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,952
0h.

177
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,109
Tim?

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,272
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

179
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,793
The light's green.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,592
# I do hope that dog...

181
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,353
# I do hope that dog...
I do hope that dog... #

182
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,318
That's his favourite.

183
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,118
Why are you cooking it?

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,997
It got rather dirty.

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,714
You must be from number 23.

186
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,077
Yes. And I'll just be...

187
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,833
taking my dog home now.

188
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,832
You could stay
for a cup of tea if you like.

189
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,117
0h, no thanks. We've got stuff to do.

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,918
Well, he's welcome here any time.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,036
If you're going out or something,

192
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,396
just pop him round
and I'll take good care of him.

193
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,709
Yeah. Thanks.

194
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,074
Bye.

195
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,435
Don't be a stranger.

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,317
I'm sure you'll see him again.

197
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,154
I know I will.

198
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,996
Your favourite.

199
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,317
Why, Colin?

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,311
Have I done something wrong?

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,035
Bye, Tim!

202
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,831
I treat you right.
I don't neglect you.

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,433
Do I?

204
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,477
Not now, Colin.

205
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,913
Just piss off.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,834
0h, God. I can change.

207
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,993
I know things have been
wrong between us, but...

208
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,433
what's she got that I haven't?

209
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,389
Here you go love, your favourite.

210
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,471
Wide screen.

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,877
This is it.

212
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,473
0h, my God. There she is.

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,393
- Marsha?
- How did you find me?

214
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,675
- Intuition.
- We broke in to your bedroom.

215
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,830
- Yes, and that.
- Look!

216
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,718
You're wasting your time.
I've made my mind up.

217
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,030
Marsha, please.
Just don't sell the house.

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,872
- It's trebled in value.
- Yeah...

219
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,552
- Really? Phew.
- Brian.

220
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,870
I'd rather we just called it a day.

221
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,236
We really want you back.
What will make you understand that?

222
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,039
Something bloody spectacular.

223
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,633
I'm sorry. Just understand.

224
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,154
We only did it
because we love living there.

225
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,958
And you're a big part of that.

226
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,794
They say the 21st century family
is friends and not relatives.

227
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,429
If that's true, you're
the best auntie I've ever had.

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,358
Kiss...my...ass.

229
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,472
Aren't you gonna ask how it went?

230
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,597
How'd it go?

231
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,319
Really badly.

232
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,359
Colin's gone.

233
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,749
What?

234
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,198
He went next door.

235
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,670
0h, Daisy. I'm sorry.
How did that happen?

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,554
He walked.

237
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,155
Right. Right, sorry.

238
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,994
My mum used "going next door"
as a euphemism for being dead.

239
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,709
Whoa. Does that mean
my rabbit's dead?

240
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,837
It's been 18 years, Mike.
Where'd you think he was?

241
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,797
Next door.

242
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,518
That's it, then.

243
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,672
Marsha's gone. Twist's gone.

244
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,034
Colin's gone.

245
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,317
- My rabbit's gone.
- Mike's rabbit's gone.

246
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,799
Everyone leaves.

247
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
Come on, Daisy. Don't be silly.

248
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,432
Not everybody leaves.

249
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,149
Tim, I've been offered a job
in Seattle, working for Marvel.

250
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,752
You know how I said not everybody
leaves? Well, they do.

251
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,632
- When are you off?
- Tomorrow.

252
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,517
That's a bit short notice.

253
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,831
I got the call last night.
They want me to go straightaway.

254
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,312
I'm sorry, Tim.

255
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,311
It's just, we didn't get a chance

256
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,436
to see how things
worked out with us.

257
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,317
This doesn't have to be the end.

258
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,470
We can still have sex
on the internet.

259
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,393
That's what I was doing before.

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,710
- What time are you off?
- 12.

261
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,438
Will you come to the airport?

262
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,397
Yeah, of course.

263
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,916
Marvel? That's really good.

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,474
What are you doing
for the next 13 hours?

265
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,713
Right, I'm bushed.
I'll see you guys in the morning.

266
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,153
Tim.

267
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,389
What are we gonna do?

268
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,237
Short of something
bloody spectacular, I've no idea.

269
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,673
I'm off.

270
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,318
Yeah.

271
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,789
Me, too.

272
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,715
Hello, boys.

273
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,273
Hello, Sarge.

274
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,191
I wonder if you privates

275
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,989
wouldn't mind doing me
a little favour.

276
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,713
Yeah, hello.
Could you tell me the times

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,268
of trains to Colwyn Bay, please?

278
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,237
The first one.

279
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,477
Well, the third one.

280
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,315
Thanks.

281
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,830
- What's that?
- Someone at the door.

282
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,919
Tim, Tim.

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,355
Right, yeah.

284
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,877
That could've been
a little bit embarrassing.

285
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,678
- Get dressed.
- What?

286
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,957
Get dressed. We're gonna see
Marsha. I'll be back in five.

287
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,995
All right.

288
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,589
Hmm.

289
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,914
Ready?

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,070
- Can we go later?
- Why?

291
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,674
- Frightened.
- Come on, Brian.

292
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,194
You've gotta be strong.
Are you man or mouse?

293
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,035
Brian.

294
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,952
I'm a man.

295
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,998
Yeah, come on. Let's roll.

296
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,075
Daisy.

297
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,310
- Ready.
- 0h, 0K.

298
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,472
Right, I'll get Mike to give me
a lift to your place.

299
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,391
I'll see you there about 11:30.

300
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,313
0K. Good luck, Bisley.

301
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,674
With what?

302
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,796
With whatever it is you've got to do.

303
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,598
Right, yeah.

304
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,835
- It's on.
- What is?

305
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,639
Something bloody spectacular.

306
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,678
0h, mama.

307
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,318
Are you sure about this, Mike?

308
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,075
- Don't worry, I've done this before.
- Is this above board, Sergeant?

309
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,674
- Are you questioning my orders?
- No, Sergeant.

310
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,354
Do what I say,
I'll recommend you for promotion.

311
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,079
I don't see how this
concerns the military!

312
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,993
- Are we not soldiers, Dexter?
- Yes, Sergeant.

313
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,594
Do we not have a duty
to keep the peace?

314
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,194
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Could you, in good conscience,

315
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,748
neglect to intervene
in a solvable conflict?

316
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,478
No, Sergeant.

317
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,949
Then get your boom box
and let's rock.

318
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,118
What are you gonna do?
Blow me up?

319
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,678
# Whatever I said

320
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,830
# Whatever I did I didn't mean it

321
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,992
# I just want you back for good

322
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,719
# Want you back, want you back

323
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,109
# Want you back for good

324
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,751
# Whenever I'm wrong, just tell
me the song and I'll sing it

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,671
# You'll be right and understood

326
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,320
# Want you back, want you back

327
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,119
# I want you back for good #

328
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,911
# 0oh-ooh ooohhh oh-ooh ooohhh #

329
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,393
We're going to have
such fun, you and me.

330
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,914
It's going to be lovely.

331
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,514
We won't need that any more.

332
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,431
From now on, we're going
to call you Lancelot.

333
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,273
0h, wow, look who came back.

334
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,554
Beer, Brian?

335
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,676
No, thanks.
Got to do an installation.

336
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,992
- Good work today, soldier.
- Thanks...sir.

337
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,479
Hey, what's that?

338
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,509
Tim...

339
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,112
'Dear Tim,
please forgive the letter.

340
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,636
'But I'm feeling a bit confused.

341
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,314
'Everything seems to have
changed recently.

342
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,996
'We all seem to be drifting apart
like leaves from a once-green oak.'

343
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,274
Skip to the end.

344
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,557
'By the time you read this,
I'll be gone.

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,790
'I've decided to go away for a while.

346
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,394
'Maybe a bit of distance
will do me good.

347
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,473
'Who knows, if things work out,
maybe I'll stay.

348
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,915
'Please give my love to everyone.

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,037
'I know you understand.
Your friend, Daisy.'

350
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,917
- Shit!
- What's the matter?

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,797
- Daisy's gone.
- Where?

352
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,916
She didn't say.

353
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,630
0h, thanks. Colwyn Bay.
11:32. St Pancras.

354
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,994
I've got to stop her.

355
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,071
- What about Sophie?
- Shit.

356
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,991
Do you need me to do
another banner?

357
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,150
No, Brian.
I don't think that'll help.

358
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,593
Do your installation.

359
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,273
# I'm leaving on a jet plane #

360
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,998
She's not answering.

361
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,229
Mobile telephone.

362
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,994
# Don't know
when I'll be back again #

363
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,071
She's still not answering. Shit!

364
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,631
0K. In the next 30 minutes, I've
got to stop Daisy at the station...

365
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,392
- Mmm.
- ..go to the airport,

366
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,914
- Go on.
- 0ne means of transport...

367
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,433
- Right.
- ..no cab money,

368
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,839
and there's a Tube strike.

369
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,354
There is no way we can do both.

370
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,119
Mike?

371
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,112
There is a way we can do both.

372
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,191
We do have another means
of transport.

373
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,508
Not my skateboard.

374
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,034
No, no. What do we have,

375
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,076
other than my van,

376
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,755
which has wheels and is slightly
quicker than walking?

377
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,475
You've gotta be fucking kidding.

378
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,999
- All right.
- All right.
