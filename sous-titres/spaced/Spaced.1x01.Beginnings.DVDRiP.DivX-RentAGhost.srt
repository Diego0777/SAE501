We had good times.

My boyfriend.

15

- That bastard ! I bloody knew it !
- I'm sorry, I really am.

Fine.

- No, I mean what are you looking for ?

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,150
Sorry,
I thought you were a drug dealer.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,070
- Oh, thanks.
- That's all right.

Yeah. Oh !

I suppose... no.
Really what happened was...

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,117
- No, rather than confront, I thought...
- Skip to the end.

I do not envy you at all.

I do have one homeless male friend.

Who ?

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,718
OK. You were born in Highgate to John
and Gillian Bisley on 17th September, 1974.

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,749
Right.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,796
Your little sister Katie once used all your
Batman comics to decorate a cardboard car.

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,877
Unable to salvage the comics,
you drove the car into a pond,

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,639
hit your head on the fountain,
which is where you got your scar.

77
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,468
You've got a best friend called Mike
who's a weapons expert.

78
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,839
- Yes !

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,279
Er... yeah.

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,790
You have a potentially fatal allergy
to brazil nuts.

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I have no memory of Christmas 1979.

82
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,195
I've got no memory of Christmas 1994 either.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
- Oh, why not ?
- I don't know.

Work to date includes a sleeve design
for your sister's boyfriend's brother's band.

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,159
You supplement the 50 quid you got from that
by working in a comic shop, Fantasy Bazaar.

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,475
I'm the assistant manager.

- The manager.

91

- You're not a sci-fi nerd ?
- No !

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,668
You spend evenings on the Internet
discussing symbolism in the X-Files ?

93
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,756
Modern science fiction can be interesting.

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,918
The speculations of contemporary authors
have probably never been closer to the truth.

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,037
Right. Your preferred mode of transport
is skateboarding.

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,198
You like music and regularly masturbate
over pictures of Gillian Anderson.

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,549
- Who told you that ?
- It was a joke !

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,478
FHM voted her sexiest woman in the world.

99

- I wasn't placed.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,195

He is not my friend !

102
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,392
Well, we don't need to talk about that.
We can if you want, it obviously hit you hard.

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,431
No !

104
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,910
You prefer a tight-legged cotton pant
as opposed to the boxer.

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,556
- Is all this necessary ?
- What if we're asked personal questions ?

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,273
We're supposed to be a couple. Do me.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,394
OK. You were born in Richmond in 1975
to Ben and Emily Steiner.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,069
You have a brother and a sister,
older and younger respectively.

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,793
- You graduated from Kingston Poly...
- University.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,719
Whatever, in 1996 with a degree
in humanities for which you got a third.

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,791
Which is fine, what I expected.

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,115
Michelle from EastEnders got a third.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,073
Anyway it's not the grade that matters,
it's being there that counts.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,477
- Your boyfriend Richard is studying in Hell.
- Hull.

115
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,435
We won't mention him. You want to be a
journalist but you haven't quite tried that yet.

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,393
Your best friend's called Twist
and she works in fashion.

117
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,357
Er... yeah.

118
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,676
You've got no skin-care routine to speak of.

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,314
You're scared of mice and spiders

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,150
but fear they will crossbreed
to form an all-powerful race of mice-spiders

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,670
who will immobilise humans
in giant webs in order to steal cheese.

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,757
- I never said that.
- It'd be good, though.

123
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,199
That's it.

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,199
- By the way, my name's Daisy.
- I'm Tim, hi.

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,550
Hey ! What's that for ?

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,434
We could do that thing like in that film with
Andie MacDowell and Gérard Depardieu -

127
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,040
where they get married
so he can get an American work permit.

128
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,632
A green card ?

129
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,830
- Yeah. What's it called ?
- I don't know.

130
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,311
That should do it.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,114
Five eight three - this is it.
Five eight three, five eight three.

132
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,911
- Five eight three, five eight three...
- Five eight three, five eight three...

133
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,270
- I forgot what you had for your fifth birthday.
- Er, miniature drum kit.

134
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,309
- Hey ! Hey !

135
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,558
- I don't want to seem too pushy.
- All right.

136
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,190
- Come on !

137
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,791
Hello. I'm Marsha.

138
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,550

- A couple.

139
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,309
Oh, yeah, it's really nice.

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah, it's a great flat.

141
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,477
Tim got a miniature drum kit
for his fifth birthday.

142
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,954
- You what ?
- What's through there ?

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,994
This is the guest bedroom,
which you can use for storage or utilities,

144
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,396
or if the pair of you
want to bring another life into the world.

145
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,432
- Yes, perfect for a child.
- Very, er...

146
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,075
- Homy.
- Homy, yeah, homy. It's very homy.

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270
What's this ?

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,151
We've finished cleaning the cupboard,
Mrs Klein.

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,591
- Ah. Did it take you long ?
- Yes, it took forever.

150
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,474
And ever. And ever.

151
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,759
It's bob-a-job week.

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,994
So, what do you both do for a living ?

- Working, earning money, cash ?

156
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,474

- Oh, yeah, we're very, very busy.
- Yeah. Phew !

160
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,114
- We're so busy ! We don't stop.
- I don't sleep. Ever.

161
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,435
That's an exaggeration but we are very busy.

162
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,233
We don't know what to do with it.

163
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,669
So, how long you been together ?

164
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,315
Five years, eight months, three days.

165
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,957
Well...

166
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,554
you can move in when you're ready.

167
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,195
- Really ?
- Yep.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,073
Don't you wanna... see our photos ?

169
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,315
Yeah...

170
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,710
Come 'ere, you !

171
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,558
Right. That's it, guys, I'm off.

172
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,151
I'm outta here !

173
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,998
I'll probably give you a call
about bills and stuff.

174
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,077
Ooh ! We haven't got a phone, so...

175
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,829
Well, that's it, I'm off, I'm going. Bye.

176
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,308
Bye ! Bye ! Bye !

177
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,109
Bye ! Bye ! Bye !

178
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,831
Sir !

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,311
It's yours.

180
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,351
Thanks.

181
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,951
Right.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,118
Do you have a phone number
in case I need to contact you about bills ?

183
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,754
l-I'm not sure, Daisy's sorting that out.

184
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,836
- Daisy ?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,553
- Who's Daisy ?
- The girl I'm moving in with.

186
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,352
What do you mean ? When did you meet her ?

187
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,190
- About two weeks ago.
- And you're about to move in with her ?

188
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,913
Yeah. You've got no right to be upset.

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,397
You're the one that ended this,
you're the one seeing someone else.

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,036
I've got to get on with my life.
I'm sorry if that upsets you, it's the way it is.

191
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,551
You can't dangle the bogus carrot
of possible reconciliation in front of me

192
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,120
whilst riding some other donkey. You know ?

193
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,910
I'm moving on, Sarah.
If you don't like that, that's too bad.

194
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,635
- Do you love her ?
- What ?

195
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,193
Do you love her ?

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,671
No, of course I don't love her, I love you !
Nobody could ever love you as much as I do.

197
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,679
OK.

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,313
Hey ! Crazy-Iooking naked
girl with no nipples, what are you doin' here ? !

199
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,075
Cover yourself up, love.
Come on, cover yourself up.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,271
Tim ?

201
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,595
Tim ?

202
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,556
Argh ! Oh !

203
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,237
- What are you doing ?
- Hi, Tim... Oh !

204
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,430
I was just cleaning and, erm...

205
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,191
Did you see the... Cos I changed the table...
Anyway... You don't like it, do you ?

206
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,391
I heard a noise and I thought it was you
cos I was talking to myself...

207
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,672
BT called and we've been connected.
So, do you want a tea ?

208
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,396
You know, I like this room, it's lovely.
I like the... I like what you've done.

209
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,714
Do you want a cup of tea ?

210
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,356
- What noise ?
- I heard a noise, I thought I'd have a look.

211
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,996
- Yeah, so... Did I tell you about BT ?
- Yeah, we've been connected.

212
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,350
- Just investigating.
- Playing Scooby Doo ?

213
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,359
Yeah. I was always Daphne when I was little.
Who were you ?

214
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,038
Freddy, obviously.

215
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,231
Freddy. Yeah. Now look at us.

216
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,198
This guy's called the Bear, he's like a mutant.

217
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,712
He's essentially a nice guy but he's driven
to violence by the society he inhabits.

218
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,070
- Right. Who's that, then ?
- That's Doktor Mandrake.

219
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,078
- Doctor Mandrake.
- Dok-tor Mandrake, it's got a K in it.

220
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,591
He's a mad scientist. He invented this steroid
called oxypheromalkahyde.

221
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,030
He tested it on this orphan kid
but it didn't work, did it ?

222
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,993
So he chucked out his research,
chucked the kid out onto the street,

223
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,031
but when the kid reached puberty,

224
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,234
the dormant oxypheromalkahyde interrupted
DNA coding and he mutated into the Bear.

225
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,909
Doktor Mandrake has dedicated his life
to capturing the Bear

226
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,872
to rediscover
the effects of oxypheromalkahyde.

227
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,828
So, why didn't the doctor
just make the oxypoxydrin again ?

228
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,193
Well... because he'd invented it by accident,
didn't he ?

229
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,597
These mutants are mistakes he's made
as he's tried to recreate the serum.

230
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,191
- Like, see, that guy's got a really big head.
- Oh.

231
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,596
- So, do you like my comic ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,837
That reminds me,
I was talking to Marsha about the rubbish.

233
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,635
There's a door that opens onto the back yard,
so we have to take it to the basement.

234
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,356
I'll take those bin bags out, then, shall I ?

235
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,029
- Do you want another cup of tea ?
- No, thanks. Twelve's my limit.

236
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,391
Hello ?

237
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,391
Hello ?

238
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,799
Hello.

239
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,270
- Daisy, this is Brian.
- Oh, hi ! Do you rent downstairs ?

240
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,312
- Do you mean am I gay ?
- What ?

241
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,671
Do you mean am I gay ?

242
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,190
No, no, I meant
are you renting the downstairs flat ?

243
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,916
Oh, right. Yep, sort of.

244
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,471
- Are you gay ?
- What ?

245
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,593
- Are you gay ?
- No.

246
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,591
All right.

247
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,793
Would you like a glass of wine or something ?

248
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,070
Yeah, I can't stay long.

249
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,994
And he invited me back to stay with his family
in Istanbul and I didn't like to say no.

250
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,237
But his sisters kept me in the house all day.

251
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,556
They made me eat green eggs
and watch Turkish television.

252
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,957
So I had to escape through the window
in the small toilet.

253
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,512
Hopefully, I'll get some publishers interested.

254
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,356
- What do you do, Brian ?
- An artist.

255
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,197
I'm an artist.

256
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,913
- Oh ! What kind of thing do you do ?
- Anger.

257
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,517
Aarrgghh !

258
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,515
Pain.

259
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,757
Fear.

260
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,632
Aggression.

261
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,274
- Watercolours or... ?
- It's a bit more complex than that.

262
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,793
- Tim does cartoons.
- It's a little bit more complex than that.

263
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,109
Processing concept into substance and
trying to create a string of independent forms.

264
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,071
Like sausages ?

265
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,557
I see contemporary art as a dirty plate
heaped with worthless junk food

266
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,797
and I want something more nourishing.

267
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,068
Like sausages ?

268
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,311
What's that ?

269
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,319
That's... Amber, Marsha's daughter.

270
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,189
Marsha.

271
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,199
Don't ask her
if she wants to talk about it.

272
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,709
It was the fucking dog.

273
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,116
It was like the dog
was some kind of replacement.

274
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,428
He used to let her sleep in the bed,
actually in the bed.

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,151
Sometimes I used to wonder.

276
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,159
Anyway, eventually I had to say
"It is the dog or me."

277
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,873
And he chose the dog.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,439
Bitch.

279
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,357
Ahh ! Sarah !

280
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,749
- Sarah ?
- Sarah ! I'm here.

281
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,554
I'm here, it's OK. His pet name for me.

282
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,034
Hm. Where does that come from ?

283
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,911
My ex-girlfriend.

284
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,993
Hello ?

285
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,634
- It's me, Richard.
- Oh, hello.

286
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,116
I got your phone number from your mum.
How's it going ?

287
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,153
Oh, it's fine, you know, good, thanks.

288
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,756
- What's the flat like ?
- Erm, very nice.

289
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,791
Cool. Listen, I've been thinking, wondering
about that Tim guy you've moved in with.

290
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,239
Yes !

291
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,832
Look, I can't really talk now.
There's some people here. OK ?

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,677
Oh, OK.

293
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,111
- I love you, Daisy Duke !
- I love you, too, Boss Hogg.

294
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,358
- I can't hear you !
- I love you, too, Boss Hogg.

295
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,153
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'

296
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,029
That was, er... Boss Hogg.

297
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,591
- How long have you been together ?
- Five years, eight months, three days.

298
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,878
That's what you said two days ago.

299
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,559
<i>Shit !</i>

300
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,110
<i>It's at times like this I wish I was telepathic,
Don't you, Tim ?</i>

301
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,357
<i>Oh, damn !</i>

302
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,352
- Daisy and me have two anniversaries.
- OK.

303
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,516
Daisy takes it from when we kissed,

304
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,632
I take it from
the first time we were physically intimate.

305
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,074
Oh, that's sweet !

306
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,872
Whose is it today ?

307
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,831
- It's Daisy's.
- Mine.

308
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,839
So you had sex before you kissed ?

309
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,997
<i>Shit !</i>

310
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

311
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,232
Happy anniversary.

312
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,151
Well, good night.

313
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,797
Are you gonna keep the table here ? Cos
I always think it works better by the window.

314
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,074
It's up to you though, innit ? It's your flat now.

315
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,997
Yes !

316
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,470
- Night, Brian.
- Night.

317
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,795
- Are you and Mar...
- Sh !

318
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,392
Night. Thanks, see you later.

319
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,431
<i>That was close,</i>

320
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,675
You're telling me.

321
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,831
Well... didn't get much unpacking done,
did we ?

322
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,437
No.

323
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,833
- Ooh ! Well...
- Well !

324
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,315
- Well, well, well.
- Well, well, well, well, well.

325
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,876
- Good night.
- Oh, OK. Night.

326
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,754
- Off to beddy-byes.
- Yeah.

327
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,792
Well done to that.

328
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,910
- I'm knackered.
- Me too.

329
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,396
- So, good night.
- Good night.

330
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,070
- OK. Night.
- OK, well... You... Good night.
