1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,951
0i, get away from there.

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,033
- Is it on?
- Yeah, it's on.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,475
- D'you think it can hear us?
- No.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,914
I love this guy.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,635
Hello?

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,756
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,512
- What's that?
- It's an axe.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,352
It's a bit dangerous, isn't it?

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,192
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, Daisy.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,953
Mike knows exactly what he's doing.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,712
I think we should
lose the axe.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,439
- I like the axe.
- I like my face.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,159
- I like your face.
- Let's keep the axe.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,436
It is my great pleasure

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,795
to introduce
the newly improved versión

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,030
of the single most
effective battle bot

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,873
since Sir Killalot
first killed a lot.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,951
Ladies and gentlemen...

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,272
Private Iron.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,839
Bloody hell.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,071
- It looks VERY dangerous.
- 0nly in the wrong hands.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,355
- D'you think he'll win?
- Look at him.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,032
He can't lose.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,952
'..semifinal
and six contenders.'

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,513
Daisy Ann Steiner. 25 years old.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,556
Hello.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,950
It says here you've had three
employers in as many weeks.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,315
Why do you think that is?

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,109
I don't know.
I just can't work it out.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,952
I think you can.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,396
I got sacked.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,630
- I got sacked.
- That's right.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,837
It seems you have a slight
problem with authority.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,480
Several of your employers
have reported to us

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,516
a general lack of concentration.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,831
That you're belligerent and
often talk when unauthorised.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,639
- Bollocks.
- I'm trying to help you, Daisy.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,314
We can only do that if you help us.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,075
I know. I know. It's me.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,628
It's always been a problem of mine.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,837
It's like I've got these two
opposing forces inside me.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,638
'There's my sensible side.

43
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,190
'She's polite, cooperative,
always does the right thing.'

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,157
And then there's my reckless side.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,472
'She's a rebel. She hates authority.'

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,959
'She knows what she wants.

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,395
'She'll do anything to get it.'

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,278
Better shape up, Daisy.
You better understand.

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,874
Sometimes we have
to make compromises.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,190
- You're right.
- I've got you a placement.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,669
It's a restaurant.
Neo Nachos in Kentish Town.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,957
- 0h, I've been there. It's nice.
- You'll be in the kitchen.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,429
Right. Right.

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,034
- Try not to lose this one.
- I will.

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,872
I will. I will try.

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,909
Not right.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,391
Shit. Shit.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,631
Need something else.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,797
It's shit.

60
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,154
Shit.

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,029
- Shit. Hello.
- Brian.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,076
Marty Berghaus. Reinhardt Gallery.

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,593
- Hello.
- 'Hi.'

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,636
I know this is short notice,

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,518
but Paolo Vincenzo's pulled out
of the installation.

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,919
0h.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,470
Mm. His loss.
Shot himself in the foot really.

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,472
- Why did he pull out?
- He shot himself in the foot.

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,438
Terrible mess. Very moving, though.

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,115
- Could you fill in for him?
- Me?

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,839
- 'Yes. Tomorrow evening. 0K?'
- Er...

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,195
Great! See you tomorrow.

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,958
Shit!

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,310
Hey!

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,549
Hey!

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,470
Looking great at the moment,
isn't he?

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,835
- Have a good weekend?
- It was 0K.

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,071
- What'd you get up to?
- You know. The usual.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,956
Well, well, well.

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,713
If it isn't the triumphant roboteers.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,313
Hello, Dexter.

82
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,039
Have you thought any more
about that rematch?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,554
- Yes and no.
- What does that mean?

84
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,632
Yes, he's thought about it,
no, he doesn't want one. Right?

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,472
- Yes.
- So that's a no.

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,073
Yes.

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,151
The regionals are over.

88
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,708
- We won fair and square.
- You were lucky!

89
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,473
- We were better!
- Whoa. Come on, now,

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,039
we don't want trouble.

91
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,475
Maybe we were lucky.
The fact is, we won.

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,551
All is fair in love and Robot Wars.

93
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,313
I just want another shot.
I know a place.

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,674
- Where?
- You know.

95
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,398
What if we get damaged?

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,357
The quarterfinals are next week.

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,556
0h, yeah. I hadn't thought of that.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,870
Mike, come on. Let's go.

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,589
We'll be seeing you then, Michael.
Think about what I said.

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,238
Say no.

101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,508
No.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,992
That's a real shame.

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,514
God, it's always me, me, me.

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,160
You've left home.
I'm not a bleedin' bank.

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,357
Anyway, give us a call, love.

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,670
0h, it's your mum, by the way.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,996
Hello, Brian.

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,640
Not been up in my region for a while.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,188
I've just come to get
my paint roller back.

110
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,077
The big one?

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,269
There you go.

112
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,238
Something exciting
happening downstairs?

113
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,550
Got an installation
at the Reinhardt Gallery.

114
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,030
That's great! We should celebrate!

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,271
I've got a bottle
left over from yesterday.

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,873
What was yesterday?

117
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,757
Er...Sunday.

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,798
- When you installing yourself?
- Tomorrow.

119
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,792
Bloody 'ell.
That's a bit short notice.

120
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,236
You better get on. Be terrible
with an 'alf-baked pile of crap.

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,515
You'd look really stupid.

122
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,830
Tell you what,
I'll come along.

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,876
- N-no.
- No, no.

124
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,394
I'll save the champers
for the big night.

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,948
I'm sure I can resist
its charms till then.

126
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,149
Woo.

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,269
Excuse me.

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,715
Do you know how I close my locker?

129
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,954
Y- You can't lock it.

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,395
T- Tina keeps the keys.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,038
Daisy Steiner.

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,078
- B-B-B-Billy.
- Glad to know you, Bill.

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,594
Right, staff meeting.

134
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,914
Is everybody here?

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,230
Let's get started.

136
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,239
Any questions about the last meeting?

137
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,271
Billy?

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,510
Perhaps you'd like to start.

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,953
- I have a question.
- Yes...Daisy?

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,873
Where can I get a key for my locker?

141
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,632
I have the keys.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,473
If you would like to use
your locker, come to me

143
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,109
- and I will do it for you.
- That's not really fair.

144
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,111
What if you're not here?

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,272
Some of us don't find it so
difficult to remain in work...

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,191
Daisy.

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,395
Right.

148
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Any more questions? Billy...

149
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,871
You'll be downstairs today.

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,916
What?

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,275
N- N-No. I can't.

152
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,238
Y- Y-Y-You can't make me.

153
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,711
N- N-No!

154
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,392
Meeting adjourned.

155
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,152
Nooooo!

156
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,358
0K, there we go.

157
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,193
- Let's pub!
- Right! I'll get my jacket.

158
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,430
- Hello, Daisy.
- All right.

159
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,317
- How was work?
- Awful.

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,879
- Get fired?
- Not yet.

161
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,757
- That's good.
- How's it going?

162
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,831
Fine. Just putting
finishing touches on.

163
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,388
I thought you were gonna
do more drawings on it.

164
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,675
- Why?
- Well, millions of people

165
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,955
would see your artwork.

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,439
Tim?

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,795
Yeah. I just didn't feel like it.

168
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,838
What does TFU stand for?

169
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,593
The Fuckest Uppest.
Philippa would have loved that.

170
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,671
I didn't think she did it any more.

171
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,716
No, she had a baby.

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,075
Why don't you be Philippa
and I'll be me?

173
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,718
- You what?
- Interview me.

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,031
0K. Er,
that's very interesting.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,872
No, do it properly.

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,757
OK.

177
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,470
This is a very large machine,
Tim. Take you long?

178
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,357
No, not really.

179
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,237
Fast worker.

180
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,278
Why don't you come back to my
flat and we'll find out?

181
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,955
I think you've already
answered my question.

182
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,759
- So you like my robot, then?
- I love it.

183
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,068
What's this?

184
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,311
That's an axe. Feel the weight.

185
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,997
There's nothing more devastating
than a big chopper.

186
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,877
Shh!

187
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,472
Don't cheapen this.

188
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,869
What is going on?

189
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,110
I was just...coming
to the pub with you.

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,078
Yeah. Think we should take
the private down to the shed.

191
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,149
- What's up with Mike?
- Nothing. He likes to be Philippa.

192
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,869
Good night, little one.
I'll see you in the morning.

193
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,598
Look at you there,
so pretty and proud.

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,874
Take that!

195
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,996
You think you're better than me!

196
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,832
You're no better than Big Trak.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,353
You will never go to combat.

198
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,715
You will never be in Robot Wars!

199
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,319
0h, shit.

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,833
It's true.

201
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,911
- She sacked her for that?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,150
- What a bitch.
- Hee.

203
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,158
0oh, look at me. I'm Tina.
I've got the locker keys.

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,753
What is going on?

205
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,115
- Nothing.
- Really?

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,079
Well, I've decided
to change the duty roster.

207
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,473
You'll be downstairs today.
Follow me.

208
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,429
Take these.

209
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,590
It'll...

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,477
m- m-make it easier.

211
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,512
This is Harris.

212
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,278
He'll show you the ropes.

213
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,918
Haven't seen you upstairs.

214
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,830
0h, shit!

215
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,956
That's exactly what I said.

216
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,398
- Brian!
- Marty.

217
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,596
Good to see you.
Thanks for doing this.

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,990
- Actually...
- Hope it meets your requirements.

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,479
I don't...

220
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,596
I'm popping out. You'll be all right?

221
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,750
Ah, well, that's...

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,718
It's 10 am now. Exhibition
starts at 6:30 pm.

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,438
Any problems, here's my mobile.

224
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,238
- I can't...
- There we go.

225
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,629
Good luck with the getting.

226
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,075
Can't wait to see
what you've come up with.

227
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,879
Natasha.

228
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,709
- Who would do such a thing?
- I think I can guess.

229
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,553
No random hit.
It's been taken apart by someone

230
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,234
- who knows what they're doing.
- What happens now?

231
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,754
If we don't repair him
the runners-up go through.

232
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,159
Who's that?

233
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,677
- Dexter and Cromwell.
- Exactly.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,797
- Who did this?
- They did!

235
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,518
- They wouldn't.
- They would.

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,989
- We're screwed.
- We can't give up.

237
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,718
We're never gonna fix him now.

238
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,552
- Yes we will.
- How?

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,712
We'll find a way.
We'll use every contact.

240
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,758
We'll pull every favour,
work every hour.

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,071
We're gonna fix him and then
we're gonna kick some ass.

242
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,630
Timmy, fetch me my tools.

243
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,478
Mike, what about the show?

244
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,197
The show's over.

245
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,435
Shit.

246
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,715
Not right.

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,389
Shit!

248
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,478
Shit!

249
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120
I just need something else.

250
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,953
- All done?
- Yeah.

251
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,235
Would you mind staying on tonight?

252
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,629
- But I...
- Josey has called in sick.

253
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,915
You wouldn't want
to leave me in the lurch.

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,195
So mop the floor
and take out the bin.

255
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,236
- I can't do this.
- Excuse me?

256
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,039
- I'm sick of it.
- Who do you think you are?

257
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,318
I'm a writer, right?
I'm creative.

258
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,595
I'm not a...mopper.

259
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,272
They're all writers, Daisy.

260
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,511
- What?
- All the staff here are writers.

261
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,036
- Not Harris.
- Haikus, I believe.

262
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,317
Charlie's an actor,
but he's writing some play.

263
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,358
- Even Billy?
- Even Billy.

264
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,591
I- I was published in '97.

265
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,148
It w-w-was just a short story.

266
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,519
I...I...I came here in '98.

267
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,469
They're all creative, Daisy.
Not just you.

268
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,870
Now, get creative with this.

269
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Their robot!

270
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,231
- Hello, boys.
- Michael, hi.

271
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,552
Look, sorry to hear about
your robot. Crying shame, that.

272
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,950
What do you mean, crying shame?
You did it, you fucking plum.

273
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,352
Well, whoever did it is academic now.

274
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,158
You don't have a robot

275
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,994
and we do, ergo we get to go
on Robot Wars and you don't.

276
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,559
Is that so?

277
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,551
You want a re-match?

278
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,198
You got one.

279
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,679
Where?

280
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,832
You know where.

281
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,678
Gentlemen,
welcome to Robot Club.

282
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,311
The first rule of Robot Club is...

283
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,914
you do not talk about Robot Club.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,836
The second rule of Robot Club is
you do not talk about Rob...

285
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,717
Wait, I got that wrong.

286
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,393
The second rule is no smoking.

287
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,313
- Why can't we smoke?
- Shh. We can't talk about it.

288
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,435
All right.

289
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,953
First battle...

290
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,478
Blue Thunder versus Metallicock.
Activate!

291
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,439
Hello. I've seen you here
before, haven't I?

292
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,556
Always nice to meet an art lover.

293
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,790
Actually I'm just here
for the free booze.

294
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,836
Free booze, great.

295
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,956
I'm Marty Berghaus.
I own the gallery.

296
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,031
- 0h, cheers.
- Cheers.

297
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,190
I'm Marsha Klein.

298
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,511
So, Marsha, are you enjoying
the installation?

299
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,158
0h, yeah.

300
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,117
- Very moving.
- Hmm.

301
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,919
Yes, certainly has something,
doesn't it?

302
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,993
Loneliness, isolation.

303
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,036
Insecurity.

304
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,599
That's our Brian.

305
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,839
Cease!

306
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,230
Now for the battle royale -

307
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,232
Private Iron versus War Bastard.

308
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,035
Activate!

309
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,913
Come on!

310
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,394
Come on!

311
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,035
Come on!

312
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,673
Cromwell.

313
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,949
- What happened?
- They've blown the motor.

314
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,712
That's not fair!

315
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,872
- That's not fair!
- That's not fair!

316
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,873
Welcome to the real worid,
Michael. It's not a fair place.

317
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,235
Prepare to be annihilated.

318
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,635
It's time we brought out
the big guns.

319
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,517
I think you're right.

320
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,832
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.

321
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,354
That's not fair.

322
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,034
That's not fair!
That's not fair!

323
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,552
Aahhhh!

324
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,709
Cease!

325
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,439
Brian, what can I say?

326
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,478
Well done. I'm amazed you
lay there for the duration.

327
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,710
At least Tilda Swinton
was comfortable.

328
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,190
Great work. Listen, pop by next week.
We can talk about a residency.

329
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,872
OK.

330
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,871
Great. I'd better call it a day.

331
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,633
- Where are you off to now?
- Hospital.

332
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,598
Ah, one of Damien's
trendy new bars, no doubt.

333
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,670
0h well, catch you next week.

334
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,753
There you go, Bri.
You was a knockout.

335
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,599
What you laughing for?

336
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,592
I don't know.

337
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,712
Come on, Daisy.

338
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,711
Put your back into it.

339
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,837
Come on, you can do
better than that.

340
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,832
Stop gawping, you retards.

341
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,195
That's it! That is it.

342
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,430
- I'm not doing this.
- You've got no choice.

343
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,078
You're not the boss of me!

344
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,276
- Yes I am.
- You are technically,

345
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,316
but you're not better than me.

346
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,188
I don't know what kick you get
out of being such a bitch...

347
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,432
..but I'm not
helping you get it.

348
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,910
These are good people. They're
artists. They deserve respect.

349
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,468
Come on, there's thousands of
ways to make money,

350
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,278
it doesn't have to be like this.

351
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,318
We can walk out with our heads high,
show this bitch...

352
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,351
..that we don't need her.

353
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,876

354
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,793
Now, who's with me?

355
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,518
Who's with me?

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,433
Anybody?

357
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,875
- Thank you.
- Interesting night?

358
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,235
No more than usual.

359
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,197
Cheers, boys.

360
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,397
- Juicy Fruit?
- No, thanks.
