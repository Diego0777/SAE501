1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,958
It's over.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,390
I... I can't believe it.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,793
Listen, Richard, we had a great time.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,593
Maybe I even loved you but times change.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,677
<i>I've got to think about me, about my life.</i>

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,757
The Guardian want me to write
this pop column.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,998
I'm going to Fuji to interview the Fugees,
Maui for Bowie, Malaga for the Gallaghers.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,474
I'm going to be meeting new people.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,915
'I just don't think I'll have time for you.'

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,912
I'm sorry but I think this is best for both of us.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,076
'In the long run you'll thank me.'

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,478
'I'm meeting loads of new people and that
doesn't leave any room in my life for you.'

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,192
'It's over, Daisy.'

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,834
It's over... I can't...

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,396
I can't believe it.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,399
Rich has finished with me.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,552
It's hardly surprising. You were
getting off with people behind his back.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,715
How come he finished with you ?

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,757
Cos I was getting off with people
behind his back.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,839
- How did he find out ?
- Well, I told him. Y'know...

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,440
You... You told me to tell him.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,600
You said it would clear the air, you know.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,556
Strengthen our relationship.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,639
- I didn't mean it !
- Oh, you're evil.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,349
I'm not the deceiver here.
I'm not the cheating harpy !

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,436
You're so damaged.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,918
Just cos Sarah hurt you, you're wreaking
your petty vengeance on womankind.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,599
Yes.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,159
Yes.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,511
And I'd do it again, I tell you !
I'd do it again in an instant !

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,717
Sorry. Sorry. So, um,...

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,796
Are you OK ?

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,992
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I s'pose. I mean...

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,277
It was inevitable really. Neither of us
were giving it the time it deserved.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,629
It was... It was my fault.

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,875
I just... I feel...

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,673
- Tim !
- What ? You said you were fine.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,516
Brian ?

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,236
Brian ?

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,317
Brian ?

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,396
Er, no ! Johnny !

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,108
Agh ! Er...

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,071
Oh...  !

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,190
Help me, I'm stuck.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,754
"Why should I ?" this, "Why should I ?" that !

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,270
Why don't you start taking
some responsibility in your life ?

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,232
Leave me alone !

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,793
Don't think I'm going to tidy it !
It'll remain in that state till you return !

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,233
<i>That's if you return. Quite frankly,
I don't give two shits if you come back or not !</i>

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,036
Ooh ! Hello, kitten. Fancy a dab of Rioja ?

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,758
Oh, just a splash.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,551
- Can I borrow a tea bag ?
- Only if you bring it back.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,117
You can have a tea bag, Brian,
you can't borrow one.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,231
What are you playing ?

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,555
Tomb Raider III.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,716
She's drowning.

57
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,795
Yeah.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,999
- Is that the point of the game ?
- Depends what mood you're in, really.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,917
What sort of mood you in, then ?

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,350
Well, I just got a letter from my ex-girlfriend,
three months late,

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,470
explaining why she dumped me.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,796
It was full of "You'll always be special"
and "I'll always love you" platitudes

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,674
designed to make me feel better
while appeasing her sense of guilt

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,475
for running off with a slimy City boy called
Duane and destroying my faith in everything.

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,639
- So it didn't really work, then ?
- No, it made me wanna drown things !

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,795
You've got some paint on you.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,589
It's a literal tribute
to the self-reflexivity of Rembrandt.

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,154
- Did he like it ?
- He's dead.

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,109
Bloody hell, that really backfired.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,675
Tell me all about it, kitten.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,990
Split up with my boyfriend.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,271
Oh, well,... I can't say I'm surprised.

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,313
I heard Tim shouting at you
a couple of nights ago, I was shocked.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,078
- What ?
- "You stupid cow." Something about a key.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,192
"You can't shoot straight, you big-titted bitch."

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,956
No... No, no, that was Lara Croft.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,350
- Well, it sounded like Tim.
- No, it was Tim.

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,753
He was talking to Lara Croft, a video-game
character. He gets very frustrated.

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,877
Is that what the problem was ?

80
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,276
- What do you mean ?
- Is that why you split, he's got no patience ?

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,475
<i>Shit !</i>

82
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,028
"If we pretend we're a couple,
this flat could be ours."

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,469
"It's madness ! It'll never work !"

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,354
"Trust me, Tim, she'll never find out."

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,391
Trust me, Tim,
she'll never find out.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,793
Shut up !

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,796
Think ! Think, think !

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,354
Think. I'm thinking...

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,631
Could Tim and I, could we have...
Could we have...

90
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,749
There, right in front of you !

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,793
- a plate ?
- Dog !

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,638
- A dog !
- Yeah, good one( !)

93
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,031
<i>- A dog ?
- A dog. A dog,</i>

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,310
Cos... if we had a dog,

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,990
then it would help us stay together
because it would be like having a child,

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,874
only hairier, smaller, wilder, quicker, smellier.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,956
I don't see why not.

98
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,238
Well,... good.
I've always wanted a dog actually.

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,833
All right, mate, yeah.
No, I'm really looking forward to it.

100
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,428
We're going to kick some serious ass, mofo.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,278
Yeah, all right, I'll see you later. Over and out.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,157
Who was that ?

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,873
It was Mike. We're going paintballing later.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,480
- I thought he was banned ?
- No, only for six months.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,636
How does that poor accountant feel about it ?

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,031
I dunno.

107
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,750
- What you doing ? !
- Marsha says that we can have a dog.

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,236
- What ? !
- We can have a dog ! Isn't that great ?

109
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,078
Stop it ! What d'you want a dog for, you'll
only end up seeing other dogs on the side ?

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,714
Don't you want to get a dog ?

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,832
- No.
- Why not ? What are you frightened of ?

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm not frightened of anything,
why would I be frightened ?

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,268
(Roobarb and Custard Theme)

114
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,270
You're scared of them, aren't you ?

115
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,198
- No.
- Yes, you are.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,913
All right, I had a minor phobia
when I was a kid.

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,996
- How minor ?
- I had to have counselling.

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,190
Really ? Sorry.

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,598
She said I had canophobia. I thought
"Great, now I'm frightened of bamboo too."

120
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,154
- How many times did you go ?
- Three or four.

121
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,395
It started to work, you know.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,591
She said I had as much chance
of being struck by lightning

123
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,631
as I had of being bitten by a dog.

124
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,191
So... what's the problem ?

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,392
Well, I was leaving the practice one day,
feeling really well-adjusted and happy,

126
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,910
<i>and this fucking great Alsatian
came haring down the road towards me,</i>

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,953
jaws slung with bloody slaver, eyes lit by
the fires of Hades' eternal damned kingdom.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,319
It leapt into the air,

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,831
I remember thinking "This is it,
I'm seven years old and this is the end."

130
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,713
Fortunately, Lady Luck
was smiling at me that day.

131
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,990
- What happened ?
- I got struck by lightning.

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,430
- What ? !
- It hurt but it scared the shit out of the dog.

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,234
<i>- Now you're scared of dogs and lightning ?
- And bamboo.</i>

134
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,196
It's funny, really.

135
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,391
I always really wanted a dog
when I was... little.

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,590
But I wasn't allowed one.

137
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,675
Really ?

138
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,996
Play with me !

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,712
Oh, please play with me, please !

140
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,116
I don't know, Daisy.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,755
Look, I know I've sprung this on you,
you know ?

142
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,998
If you don't like it, I'll understand. But...

143
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,634
I really need this, you know ?

144
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,992
I mean,... I'll do everything for it, you know ?

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,394
I'll feed it and I'll walk it
and I'II... I'll change its little hutch.

146
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,591
And if you still don't like it, then, well,...

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,637
we'll kill it.

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,431
- All right.
- Wahoo !

149
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,233
- But not a big one.
- All right. Sorry !

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,670
Sorry, sorry. It could be good for you,
it could be the turning point.

151
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,915
It might help you conquer your fear.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,155
Stop trying to get your own way

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,670
by turning everything into a psychodrama
that somehow benefits me, OK ?

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,998
I am my own person. I will deal with
my problems in whatever way I see fit.

155
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,508
Aagghh ! Get away from me !

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,677
<i> ? Heads and tails,
heads and tails, heads and tails</i>

157
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,957
? Heads and tails,
heads and tails, heads and tails

158
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,791
I can't believe you brought me here.

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,308
- It's great, isn't it ?
- It smells.

160
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,237
<i>- Twist !
- It smells,</i>

161
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,554
- Hi !
- Hello.

162
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,630
I'm Daisy Steiner, this is my friend, Twist.

163
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,148
- Twist.
- Mm. My parents were hippies.

164
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,634
I see. What can I do for you ?

165
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>- We'd like to buy a dog.
- You'd like to buy a dog.</i>

166
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,871
Yes, I'd like to buy a dog.

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,197
Yes, erm... there.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,431
Have you owned a dog before ?

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,311
Mm,... sort of.

170
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,396
Sort of ?

(Animal Magic Theme)

172
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,915
Come on, boy !

173
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,032
No.

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,633
Now, I want you to think very carefully
before you choose a dog.

175
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,993
Can I afford to keep it ? Will I be able
to take it for walks twice a day, if not more ?

176
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
Can I give it a secure, loving home ?

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,431
Um,...

178
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,039
yes.

179
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,552
OK, number one, don't eat the paintballs.

180
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,633
Number two, this is just a game.

181
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,753
If you take it too seriously,
you're only gonna be hurting yourself.

182
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,074
It's not war,

183
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,439
it's just an exercise
in teamwork and tactics.

Eh !

186
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,597
Groovy !

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,512
Shit.

188
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,194
He's been with us a while now.

189
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,834
It's his last day here.

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,075
Why, somebody bought him ?

191
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,509
Dogs only stay with us for a limited period.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,838
- Where do they go after that ?
- Heaven ?

193

A gay club ? !

194
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,713
No, Miss Steiner. We put them down.

195
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,473
All of them.

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,709
No !

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,030
No ! No ! No !

198
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,239
Come on, Colin,
we're taking you away from this place !

199
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
- Colin ?
- That's what I called my box.

200
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,270
Hi, Dom, yeah. This is Duane Benzie.

201
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,677
This is Duane Benzie.
How you doing ?

(Psycho Theme)

205
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,391
Tim, hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

206
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,352
You never struck me as the outdoor type.

207
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,469
What ?

208
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,353
That reminds me.
You left some stuff at the flat.

209
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,960
Well, I think it's your stuff.

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,197
The bag was full of comics and toys.

211
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,439
I was thinking maybe I'd drop it round
in the car, save you the trip.

212
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,751
You stole my girlfriend.

213
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,477
Tim, now come on.

214
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,711
I didn't want it to be like this.

215
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,719
It wasn't meant to be personal.
You don't choose who you fall in love with.

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,591
When you get that feeling, it's like...

217
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,031
- Sexual.
- Like a force beyond your control.

218
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,270
You know what they say about love and war ?

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,110
Yeah, one involves a lot of physical and
psychological pain and the other one's war.

220
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,799
Talking of which, what team are you on,
A or B ?

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,831
Er, we're B.

222
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,033
Me too.
Looks like we'll be fighting side by side.

223
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,035
Who knows, maybe that's what we need.

224
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,751
Later.

225
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,432
I've rehearsed that moment a thousand times.

226
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,836
- Is that the first time you've seen him since...
- Yes.

227
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,108
I think I was pretty cool.

228
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,199
I could have flown off the handle, smashed
his face in, set fire to him, but I didn't.

229
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,074
- What will you do when you see him next ?
- I'm gonna set fire to him.

230
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,711
Hello ! Hello ! Hello !

Ahh ! We're gonna be best friends.
We're gonna have such fun.

234
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,989
Ahh ! Do you want something to eat ?
- Yes, please.

235
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,709
Where is it, then ?

236
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,432
The little dog ?

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,991
The bandanna, isn't it ?
It makes me look stupid.

238
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,998
- Ahh !
- Do you want me to take it off ?

239
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,953
- C-Colin.
- No, Daisy, it's Brian.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,150
I think you're sitting on my dog.

241
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,037
Oh, my God.

242
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,072
Look, I'll count to three...

243
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,751
and then stand up.

244
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,030
- OK ?
- I can't watch.

245
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,559
One,...

246
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,033
two,...

247
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,430
three.

248
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,879
Go ! Go ! Go !

249
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,312
- The flag's to the northwest.
- How do you know ?

250
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,395
I've just seen it.

251
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,273
- Oh, this is so exciting !
- Is this your first time, kid ?

252
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,356
- I'm 36.
- Is this your first time, old man ?

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,073
Yeah. I've always fancied myself
as a bit of a soldier.

254
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,111
- I've always fancied myself.
- I've always fancied you.

255
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,149
Not here.

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,111
- Have you ever done this before ?
- You could say that.

257
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,559
What do you mean ?

258
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,037
Let's just say the last time I was in this
situation, I wasn't using a paintball gun.

259
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,514
You've seen combat ? Where ?

260
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,551
Erm,... on the television.

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,115
You said the last time you were
in this situation you didn't use a paintball gun.

262
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,151
- He didn't.
- What did you use ?

263
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,077
It was a big stick.

264
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,236
- I'm going for the flag.
- You shouldn't do that.

265
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,352
We're deep in enemy territory,
we've got to choose our moment carefully.

<i>This place is swarming with A's, they're
not just in the jungle, they are the jungle.</i>

267
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,836
What do you think this is, Vietnam ?

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,110
Yeah.

269
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,431
Son of a bitch !

270
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,595
He didn't mean it ! He didn't mean it !
You didn't mean it.

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,438
Say "I didn't mean it, Colin."

272
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,031
- I didn't mean it, Colin.
- No, like I said it.

273
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,671
I didn't mean it, Colin.

274
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,711
There. Yes, good boy !

275
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,031
He's beautiful.

276
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,116
Reminds me of my own dog, Pompom.

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,835
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- As a child, yeah.

278
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,553
Used to spend hours
playing together in the garden.

279
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,593
I'd dress him up in period costumes
and take amusing photographs.

280
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,631
Loved him so much.

281
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,796
It was tragic, really.

282
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,519
Why ?

283
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,915
One day we were playing in the street,

284
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,397
I was taking some pictures of him
dressed as an Elizabethan merchant.

285
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,478
Suddenly, something caught his eye.

286
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,309
Maybe it was a stray tomcat

287
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,750
or a brightly coloured ball
bouncing out of sight,

288
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,995
or maybe the stick I threw.

289
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,918
He ran out into the main road,

290
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,038
exploded under an articulated lorry.

291
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,511
He blew up ?

292
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,715
No, the weight of the truck on his frail body
burst him like a cheap party balloon,

293
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,149
sending his ruff forty feet into the air.

294
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,511
There, you see ?

295
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,909
Such vibrant colours.

296
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,190
That paintball was meant for me,
he's made this personal.

297
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,231
He made it personal
when he slept with your girlfriend.

298
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,111
Now he's made it more personal.

299
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,196
Doesn't get more personal
than sleeping with your girlfriend.

300
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,593
For Christ's sake, Mike !

301
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,632
Have you ever considered thinking about
what you're gonna say before you say it ?

302
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,468
Perhaps you could set up a checkpoint
to vet your thoughts for insensitivity.

303
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,911
You hate me. You're only going out with me
cos of what happened when we were little.

304
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,439
Oh !

305
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,399
<i>Mike !</i>

306
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,155
Mike ?

307
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,512
Mike !

308
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,313
You know, Daisy,
this is gonna be a big responsibility.

309
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,352
Dogs are like kids: want, want, want.

310
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,473
He is a little life.

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,150
He has needs.

312
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,159
I know, Marsha, I do, I really do.

313
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,079
I'm not just gonna discard him
as soon as he's served his purpose.

314
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,113
He's a living thing,
he's not just some kind of novelty toy.

315
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,751
Come on, little Colin, dance for me !

316
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,268
Ha, ha, ha ! Dance !

317
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,437
Yes, come on, Colin, dance, dance !

318
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,836
Dance, dance, dance, dance...

319
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,395
- Oh !
- Dance for me ! Dance !

320
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,749
- Dance !
- Ha ! Ha ! Ha !

321
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,871
Mike.

322
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,511
Mike.

323
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,239
Mike.

324
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,831
Mike.

325
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,873
Saved by the bell.

326
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,556
- Aren't you gonna answer that ?
- I've got an answering service.

327
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,151
<i>- You've got an answer for everything.
- I can't believe you just said that.</i>

328
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,191
Neither can...

329
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,231
Neither can I.

330
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,154
Tim, firing these guns at such close range
is very dangerous.

331
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,476
- You were just about to shoot me.
- In the back of the head, yeah.

332
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,318
In the face, it's a lot different.

333
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,071
Look, if we're gonna do this,
let's at least be sporting about it.

334
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,869
What do you say, 20 paces ?

335
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,358
- OK.
- OK.

336
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,511
Ha !

337
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,239
Oh.

338
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,792
Ha, ha, ha.

339
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,910
You see, Tim,

340
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
that's the difference between you and I.

341
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,674
Organisation.

342
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,029
Careful thinking.

343
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,195
Forward planning.

344
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,835
That is why I sleep in the arms
of a beautiful woman

345
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,678
and you spend your evenings alone
in your bedsit.

346
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,992
With cheap porn.

347
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,270
Timmmmy !

348
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,476
It's not a bedsit.

349
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,794
It's a flat.

350
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,719
Aarrgghh !

351
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,749
Yes !

352
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
No, Mike ! Mike !

353
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,711
Mike ! Oh, Jesus, no !

354
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,672
Medic !

355
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,637
Is that you, Tim ?

356
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,875
I'm here, man, just hold on, hold on !

357
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,797
I'm tired, Tim.

358
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,873
Just, er...
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

359
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,199
I'm sorry I said those things,
I just... I wasn't thinking straight.

360
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,789
I can say pretty stupid things myself,
sometimes.

361
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,832
Oh, Mike, I'm the stupid one,
I've always been the stupid one.

362
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,599
What you laughing at ?

363
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,108
I guess I got to be the hero after all.

364
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,549
Yeah, I guess you did.

365
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,629
I've gotta... I've gotta sleep.

366
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,477
No, no, Mike, stay with me !

367
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,193
- I'm so tired.
- No, Mike !

368
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,674
- Bye, old friend.
- No, Mike !

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,717
No !

370
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,792
- I really enjoyed that today.
- Me too.

371
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,593
- You always enjoy it.
- I enjoyed it more than usual.

372
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,754
I feel cleansed. It's been a really good day.

373
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,076
That, my friend,
is the beauty of simulated violence.

374
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,113
Let's pick up Daisy and go down the pub.
I haven't got a care in the world.

375
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,199
Hey, viano tormenty.

376
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,231
What did you say ?

377
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,679
I said there's a storm coming.
