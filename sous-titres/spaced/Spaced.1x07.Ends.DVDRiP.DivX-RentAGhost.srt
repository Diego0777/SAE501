- Yeah. No, I just... I'm just...
- Uhhh !

Well, I'll, er... I'll see you later, then. Bye.

That was Sarah. She wants to see me today.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,356
- I wonder what that's all about.
- I dunno.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,233
Maybe she wants her CD player back.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,919
- Oooh !
- Maybe she's getting married.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,951
Ooh !

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,231
- Maybe she's pregnant.
- Aaaarghhhh !...

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,393
- So what's the attraction of this, then ?
- What ?

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,476
- Skateboarding.
- What do you mean ?

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,590
- Why do you do it ?
- It's quicker than walking.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,519
- Is it easy ?
- Daisy ! I'm kinda busy at the moment.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,189
- Have you seen my chocolate beanie ?
- I was just asking.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,352
has just phoned up and asked to see me.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,870
You've picked a weird time to take
a spontaneous interest in my travel habits.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,070
- Thanks !
- All right, don't get upset.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,873
You hate skateboarding, anyway.
You're always saying it's childish,

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,070
which really pisses me off because it's not.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,189
- All right, calm down.
- I am calm !

to see Akira.

Yeah, well, you know,...
we'll watch it on video.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,116
What was all that stuff you were saying about
"You've gotta see it on the big screen" ?

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,391
Well, we'll just... sit close to the telly.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,675
All right, well,... take care of yourself.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,113

Well, not so much see as... watch.

47

- They might get back together.
- That's what she wants him to think.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,719
She's gonna look really good,
to remind him of how much he likes her,

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,199

- She said she felt a little bit confused,

- Right.
- Yes, and I've got a funny feeling

78

she's gonna want me
to move back in with her.

- It was our new doorbell.

It was gonna be a surprise.

- Good.</i>

- He who dares wins.

85

- Look before you leap.
- Do you believe in life after love ?

86

- That's a song.
- Shit.

change her mind and dump you again ?

- Hello, Daisy.
- Tim, I think we should talk about this.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,516
Did I ever tell you how Mike and myself
became such good friends ?

93
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,235
It's quite an interesting story.
It happened when we were children,

I don't want to...

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,359
I don't want to move out from you,
I just want to move in with her.

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,550
- I don't understand.
- What is your problem ?

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,751
- I thought you'd be happy for me.
- Oh, I am. Yes, I am.

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,473
It's what I want, Daisy.
You must have things you want.

104

You always go on about wanting to go to Asia
and see the Taj Mahal. I don't complain.

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,431
Yeah, I wanna go to Asia,
I wanna see the Taj Mahal.

106
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,031
But the Taj Mahal didn't sleep with its boss
behind my back and break my heart !

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,592
Yeah, well, it might if you go to Asia.

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,038
What's her problem ?

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,594
Maybe she's worried about you
stumbling blindly into a doomed relationship,

while losing this place and the friendship
you've built up over the past six months.

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,352
It must mean a lot to her or she wouldn't be
so bothered about your emotional wellbeing.

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,516
Get in the car, you big ape.

114

It's really important for me that you get this.

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,431
- It isn't your fault, Tim.
- It is, Mike.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,037
- Isn't.
- Is.

- Ooh, why, you...
- Ahh !

122
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,039
It is my fault, Mike.
I know we were only little, but...

123
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,674
I can still see you up that tree.

124

Mr Watt, we're here to ascertain whether
you're ready to rejoin the Territorial Army.

134
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,630
Yes.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,959
It's important to establish that you understand
the reasons for your original suspension.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,468
- I do, sir.
- Go on.

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,988
In 1994, while on weekend manoeuvres
in France,

138
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,636
I commandeered a Chieftain tank without
the permission of my immediate superiors.

139
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,069
I then attempted to invade Paris.

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,432
However, en route I stopped at Disneyland,
or Eurodisney as it was then called,

141
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,313
and was subsequently apprehended
on Space Mountain.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,557
Do you have any explanation
as to why you might have done this ?

143
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,118
At the time, I was suffering serious emotional
problems that clearly affected my judgment.

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,072
I had immersed myself in a fantasy world
of my own creation

145
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,157
and as a result I became very insular
and uncommunicative.

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,872
Why do you think that was ?

147
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,910
I dunno.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,989
Thanks for the shoes, Daise.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,315
Ahh, are you sure
you don't want to come, mm ?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,117
No, better not, I've got loads of work to do.

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,357
Well, maybe I could...

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,549

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,635
Kick ! Kick !

154
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,875
- I'm going to pick up Mike from the TA.
- Yeah, all right.

156
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,956
Will you get off my back ? !

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
- I'm not on your back.
- You are !

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,718
Yeah... I can feel you, you're there,
like Jabba's little mate - "Wa-ha-ha !"

159
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,069
Why can't you just wish me luck
and say "Have a good time" ?

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,237
I'm not a hypocrite, I wouldn't wish you luck
with something I think is bad for you.

161
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,555
- Well, can't you pretend ?
- No.

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,830
- You just don't want me to move out, do you ?
- What ?

163
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,110
- You don't want me to move out.
- Is that what you think this is about ?

164
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,276
- Well...
- You conceited little shit !

165
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,038
Don't you dare flatter yourself to think that
I would stand in your way for my own ends.

166
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,438
For your information,
I would be sad if you moved out,

167
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,436
but it isn't about me.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,916
I'm your friend, and friends
are supposed to look out for each other,

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,552
and I think you're making a mistake.

170
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,833
If you're too stupid to see that, then someone,
a friend, me, should point it out to you.

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,877
<i>Well, OK, while we're being friends,
maybe I should be a friend to you</i>

172
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,717
and point out that
you're using my personal problems

173
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,719
as another in a long line of excuses not to get
out your bloody typewriter and do some work !

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,671
<i>I am not avoiding work.</i>

175
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, right, OK... "Ooh, let's have a party."

176
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,033
"Ooh, let's do some theatre."

177
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,195
"Ooh, let's get a dog."

178
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,199
"Ooh, let's spend hours in front of
our bedroom mirror bogling to Aswad !"

179
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,391
- That was research !
- You keep telling yourself that, Daisy,

180
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,352
but I think I am big enough and ugly enough
to make my own mistakes !

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,230
Well, Sarah obviously does.

182
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,511

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,039

185
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,758
<i>Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha ha-ha !</i>

186
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,551
- Oh, hi, Marsha.
- Hello. Are you busy ?

187
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,398
Erm, well, yes, I'm...

188
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,112
working.

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,355
But I could do with a breather.

190
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,838
Listen,... I couldn't help
overhearing you and Tim rowing.

191
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,189
- Really ?
- Oh, it's all right.

192
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,037
It was ever so loud.

193
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,038
- ..bogling to Aswad !
- That was research !

194
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,559
Sorry.

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,196
That's all right. Do you want
a splash of vino collapso ?

196
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,711
Once again, the fruit of my loins has fucked
off to Top Shop with the housekeeping.

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,398
Well, I'll just have the one.

198
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,350
I just saw that friend of yours, Twit,
leaving with Brian.

199
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,949
- What's that all about, then ?
- They're just going to an exhibition together.

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,638
Is it serious ?

201
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,716
Tunde Aragundade.

202
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,751
Bloody hell.

203
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,631
Oh, well. C'est la vie.

204
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,716
Et tu, Brian ?

205
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,797
What is going on between you and Brian ?

206
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,953
- This one ?
- War.

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,159
- This one ?
- Bombs ?

208
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,432
- This one ?
- Guts.

209
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,151
Guns.

210
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,551
Guts and guns.

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,191
Butterfly.

212
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,872
Butterfly with a bomb.

213
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,313
Finally, Mr Watt,
how does this make you feel ?

214
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,591
Nice.

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,232
Welcome back, Mike.

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,111
You and Brian ?

217
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,479
Yeah.

218
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,917
Well...

219
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,673
one night he came up here, begging me
to let him stay cos he couldn't pay his rent.

220
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,470
We had a couple of bottles
of duty-free grappa.

221
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,476
Next thing I know,...

222
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,629
I'm riding him like a bitch from hell.

223
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,353
You became lovers ?

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,439
No, it was his rent, really.

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,315
Did he leave a deposit ?

226
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,630
To tell you the truth,

227
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,433
I'm not sure how interested he is in women.

228
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,675

Mm.

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,038
I mean, look at them, they're all so...

233
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,037
They're really...

234
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,877
Samey.

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,717
Yeah.

236
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,279
Exactly.

237
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,834
So, what have you and Tim
been rowing about ?

238
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,190
- He says he wants to move out.
- Oh, dear.

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,356
Trouble in paradise.

240
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,229
He says I was avoiding work.

241
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,914
- Well, are you ?
- No !

242
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,397
Yes.

243
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,874
Aah, don't worry, he'll come back.

244
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,277
- If he doesn't, are you gonna chuck me out ?
- No !

245
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,750
I like having you here.

247
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,910

Oh, it's all right, kitten.

254
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,350
you can tell your friend Twit
she can have Brian.

- Night.

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,517

- I got you a postcard.
- Thanks.

Exhibition on next week. Sounds good.

264
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,755
- Really ?
- It's Roman Duchamp's insect faecal matter.

265
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,870
Faecal ? Lovely.

266
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,111
I was thinking...

267
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,515
afterwards, if you, er...

268
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,914

I guess we've got a lot to talk about.

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,837
Yeah, yeah. I guess we have.

Oh, Tim. Where are you ?

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,358
I'm in the pub. Look, do you fancy a drink ?

- No, she's gone.

All right. Well, you get them in and I'll see you
in a few minutes. All right, mate ?

- Yep.

my typewriter and it just poured out.

- Yeah.

Yeah, I know and before you say anything,
it was my decision.

Wow.

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,631
l-I just had a moment of clarity, you know.
I woke up.

310
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,270
It's like... you know
when you have an orgasm on your own ?

311
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,959
You know, you're sort of lying on the sofa

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,470
watching some porn movie you bought
on a drunken, Ionely night in Soho,

313
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,988
and everything is really great.

314
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,032
You're getting totally turned on
by these absurdly graphic images,

315
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,915
everything seems so right,
and suddenly... bingo ! You wake up.

316
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,110
And you're lying there sweating,

317
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,118
desperately looking for the tissue
which you know is still in your pocket

318
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,151
and the remote control
which is somewhere on the floor,

319
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,317
and it's like walking in on yourself, you know.

320
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,999
It's just like "What you doing ?"

321
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,233
That's how I felt tonight, feeling my heart
miss a beat every time the door opened.

322
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,748
"What the fuck are you doing ?"

323
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,596
Well, that's love, isn't it ? A load of old wank.

324
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,195
Life just isn't like the movies, is it ?
You know ?

325
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,837
We're constantly led to believe in resolution,
in the re-establishment of the ideal status quo

326
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,075
and it's just not true.

328
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,350

about the fact that life is a thankless struggle.

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,911
Do you want to dance ?

330
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,349
Do you know what ? I think I do.

335
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,920
Gonna walk up to her gate

336
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,835
See if I can get it straight

337
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,036
Cos I love her

338
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,712
I'm gonna ask her

339
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,713
Is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?

340
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,113
The way you're acting lately
makes me doubt

341
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,992
Yes, it does

342
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,473
You is still my baby, baby

343
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,190
It seems my flame in your heart's
done gone out

344
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,670
Do you really watch porn in the flat ?

345
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,677
Er, only when you're out.

346
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,799
Sometimes when you're asleep
on the beanbag.

347
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,316
- Can I borrow some ?
- Er, yeah.

348
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,389
Thanks.

349
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,635
When you find the one you love

350
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,958
She's gone and made a change

351
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,632
But is you is, or is you ain't my baby ?

352
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,157
Maybe baby's found somebody new

353
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,917
Or is my baby

354
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,430
Still my baby true  ?

355
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,232
