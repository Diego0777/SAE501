00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,797
# 0ne two, Middlesboogie #

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,475
Tim, Tim. Tim!

3
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,032
# Na na na-na na na na na #

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,233
# Happy birthday to you

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,878
# Happy birthday to you

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,317
# Happy birthday, dear Daisy,
happy birthday to you #

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,392
'Happy birthday, darling.
I thought I'd catch you.

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,675
'It's such a shame I won't see you

9
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,070
'but I'm really hoping you'll
come to Auntie Irene's 40th.

10
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,913
'It'll probably
be the 15th now. 0h, no.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,672
'The 23rd of this month.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,833
'Not this month now, this month
coming. So...next month.

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,959
'So let me know. Aunt Susie's
out of hospital, such a relief.

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,998
'It was going to be today...'

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,629
'..and it was yesterday,
I thought you'd want to know.'

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,758
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,513
# Happy birthday

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,390
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,677
# Happy birthday #

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,990
Thank you very much.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,877
For what?

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,279
For my birthday song.

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,191
0h, is it your birthday?

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,316
How are you feeling this morning?

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,879
Very rough, actually.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,111
I swear to God I will never
drink again until lunchtime.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,553
- Very wise.
- Hmm.

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,756
So how does it feel to be 26?

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,592
- Bit gassy.
- Well, getting old.

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,433
You'd be dead in four years,
if this was Logan's Run.

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,478
- That'd be terrible.
- I'd look a twat in a jumpsuit.

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,358
Don't say that.
That's a word that hates women.

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,112
- Twat?
- No, jumpsuit.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,712
Aaaah! Look. 0h, my God!
What's in the fridge?

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,995
# Wooooooo #

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,518
0h, no!

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,115
- Don't you like it?
- I love it.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,679
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,877
Anyway, happy birthday, pickle.

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,234
I'm gonna do a wee.

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,674
Hi.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,797
0h, God. Hi, Sophie.
I forgot you were here.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,030
Happy birthday.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,269
Thanks.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,237
So, you got anything
special planned?

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,992
I think we're
going out for dinner,

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,957
- you know.
- That'll be nice.

48
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah. I mean you can
come if you want.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,672
0h, thanks. Yeah, I'd love to.
That'd be great.

50
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,150
0h. Ahem. Good.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,674
Daisy's invited me
to the meal this evening.

52
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,399
- That'll be cool.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm sure Marsha won't get suspicious.

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,156
- I don't want to cause trouble.
- You're not.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,357
- I don't know why we don't tell her.
- What are you gonna say?

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,635
"By the way, we're not
really a couple.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,917
"We lied to you for a year
so we could rent your flat."

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
- We're evil.
- You did what you had to,

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,029
- you shouldn't feel bad.
- We don't.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,632
- Come on, you.
- Where you off to?

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,438
I'm gonna walk Sophie to the Tube.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,715
Ah, that's sweet.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,994
It is, isn't it?

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,957
Yeah.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,951
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,634
See you later, Daisy.
Happy birthday.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,756
Bye, Sophie. Bye-bye.

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,637
What a bitch.

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,397
I've got this really cool surprise
birthday cake for Daisy

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,436
in the shape of a typewriter.

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,476
- Cool.
- I've been scheming for weeks.

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,439
I met this baker at Strawberry
Sundae. We danced for five hours

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,114
then had an involved discussión
about pasties.

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,111
And anyway, he's doing me a deal.

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,634
- You're sweet to Daisy.
- I am, aren't I?

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,915
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm a sweet guy.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,798
- You're a stupid cock.
- Ah, well. Thanks.

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,350
Just relax.

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,592
- Hi.
- Where were you?

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,352
- When?
- This morning.

81
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,793
I was in bed.

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,758
Why was today important to me, Tim?

83
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,398
Being promoted to sergeant next week,

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,959
- don't forget.
- I won't.

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,792
Being promoted to sergeant Saturday,

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,154
- don't forget.
- I won't.

87
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,151
What was that?

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,832
I'm being promoted tomorrow,

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,717
- don't forget.
- I won't!

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,836
Er, yeah. I forgot.

91
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,673
- You forgot.
- Sorry.

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,194
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am.

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,158
I wanted you to see me
get my stripes.

94
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,673
What can I say? I'm sorry.

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,954
- It's her.
- What?

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,270
Sophie. You've only
been with her two weeks

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,634
and I'm yesterday's news.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,950
It wasn't this bad
when you were with Sarah.

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,156
Mike, you will always be
my number one.

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,470
Why are you treating me
like a number two?

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,078
It's been a long time since
I've had a Sophie in my life.

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,388
I'm just excited.

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,473
You are my longest-serving friend.
We've done everything together.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,471
0r have you forgotten the good times?

105
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,239
No, of course not.

106
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,392
We were supposed to go
ghost-hunting last week.

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,072
- I know.
- Where were you?

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,237
I can't remember.

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,278
Well, I'm glad you're happy
with your new girlfriend.

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,555
Don't forget whose shoulder
you cried on

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,437
- when you got dumped.
- I won't.

112
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,717
0r when Johnny Alpha got killed
by that monster in 2000AD.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,915
Mike, I won't.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,638
Here's Mike.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,518
- Mike, do your eagle eyes.
- Don't!

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,239
You hurt him, I'll kill you.

117
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,512
Did he mean that?

118
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,199
Yeah.

119
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,631
Knock, knock, knock.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,075
Hello, birthday girl.

121
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,674
Hello, Marsha. How's it going?

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,069
I'm fine, how are you?

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,630
0h, I'm fine. 26.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,631
Happy birthday, darling.

125
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,639
Are you missing Amber?

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,995
0h, yeah. Yeah.

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,510
Many 'appy returns, darling.

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,397
0h, what can it be?

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,074
I thought you might
put some make-up on tonight.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,230
Doll yourself up a bit.

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,436
I don't wear much
normally, but...

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,034
0ooh! Rude Red.

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,590
Right, well I best go off to
Threshers, do the weekly shop.

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,355
You still up for a night
of unadulterated fun?

135
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,668
Adultery?

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,910
Are you still coming out tonight?

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,992
0h, yeah. Right. I'll see you later.

138
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,195
Hello.

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,713
Hi, Daisy. It's me.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,438
Hello, Twist.

141
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,876
It's nice to speak to you.
I feel I haven't seen you in ages.

142
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,996
You were at my birthday
thing last night.

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,911
0h, yes. That was you, wasn't it?

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,956
'Look, do you wanna come shopping?'

145
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,554
Um, I'd love to
but I haven't got any money.

146
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,029
0h, I don't need any.
Will you meet me?

147
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,190
- Where are you?
- 0n your street.

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,998
- All right, Twist.
- Hi, Tim.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,275
What are you doing on my street?

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,828
I can't explain.
Just come and meet me.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,310
All right, well.
Just give me a mo'.

152
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,198
0i!

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,229
Hi, Marsha.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,797
I know what you're up to.

155
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,759
Did Mike tell you?

156
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,719
Does he know?

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,679
I had to tell somebody.

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,189
You are a very bad man.

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,157
What?

160
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,753
She loves you, that girl.

161
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,319
- Who does?
- Daisy.

162
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,391
- Does she?
- Course she does.

163
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,199
- Did she say that?
- No! But it's obvious, innit?

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,113
Yeah. Course.
She's my girlfriend.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,395
Yeah, well you better tell her, Tim.

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,472
Cos if you don't, I will.

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,994
But you'll spoil the surprise.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,151
You bastard.

169
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,073
Marsha!

170
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,195
Brian?

171
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,875
Brian?

172
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,475
Brian?

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,958
- I've finished with Brian.
- 0h. 0h.

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,758
0h, my God.

175
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,239
Are you all right?

176
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,594
What about?

177
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,549
About... How's Brian taking it?

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,232
Brian, no!

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,312
0h, God!

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,477
Why? This is new!

181
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,834
Sorry, I didn't see you.

182
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,037
- What are you doing?
- Expressing myself.

183
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
- By chucking paint around?
- Yes.

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,592
What's the matter with you?

185
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,955
Broken up with Twist.

186
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,838
0h, shit. Really?

187
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,273
What happened?

188
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,715
Sex, sex, sex.
That's all it ever was.

189
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,394
- I wanted something else.
- So, you're single.

190
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,675
I'm tired of our endless clashing.

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,318
- What, your outfits?
- Daisy!

192
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,516
I am not that shallow.

193
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,836
She's shallow, Brian. She's like...

194
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,070
Cordelia out of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

195
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,799
and latterly Ángel,
the spin-off series set in LA.

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,916
I don't know what
you're talking about.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,150
Brian!

198
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,992
You're such a square.

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,993
- Think she'll come tonight?
- She is Daisy's best friend.

200
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,275
You've just got to be strong, man.

201
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,794
- I know.
- You're gonna be fine.

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,110
After a long time
thinking you won't be,

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,668
one morning you'll wake up
and you will be.

204
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,957
You'll miss the fact you're not
cos it's scarier when you are.

205
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,953
When you're not, you've got
something to cling to.

206
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,235
Then you're gonna be fine,
all right?

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,232
Feeling better?

208
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,352
Does that feel better?

209
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,079
Hmm. Is Brian coming tonight?

210
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,550
Yes. But he is my friend, Twist.

211
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,392
I suppose so.

212
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,789
Well, at least we'll
see more of each other.

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,996
Yeah, I hadn't really
thought of that.

214
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,072
Hey, why don't you
try something on?

215
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,517
You always wear that shantytown look
and it's really quite last-century.

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,477
I quite like the way I dress.

217
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,314
Shh. Listen.

218
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,949
There's nothing wrong
with looking nice, Daisy.

219
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,076
You're not betraying
the sisterhood

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,197
just by brushing your hair
once in a while, hmm?

221
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,875
I just doubt there's anything in
here I could get above my knees.

222
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,315
Go on, it's your birthday.

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,398
'Did I update you
on the Susie situation?

224
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,119
'Well, far be it from me
to spread gossip,

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,839

- 'Anyway, apparently...'
- Mum, hi.

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,438
'Hello, love.
I didn't think you were in.'

229
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,751
- No, I've been out.
- 'Since 9 this morning?'

230
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,231
Er, yeah. Yeah.
You know me - go, go, go.

231
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,995
'Well, I've got a lot to tell
you and you never phone me.

232
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,719
- 'Happy birthday, dumpling.'
- Thanks.

233
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,268
- 'I've got some great news.'
- What?

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,078
'Your Auntie Caroline called.

235

240
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,519
Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,114
'Are you and Tim
doing anything nice today?'

242
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,236
Um, we're just going out for a meal.

243
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,276
'Just the two of you?'

244
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,716
No, no. Us and a few...friends.

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,759
'Well, you must be
looking forward to it.'

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,068
Yeah.

0h, shit.

265
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,195
Right.

266
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,550
Hi. Sorry, we're...I'm late.
It was, you know.

267
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,039
Delayed at the office?

268
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,758
I had to pop in, yeah.

269
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,034
I bet you did.

270
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,277
- Right. Shall I get some drinks?
- A treble vodka, please.

271
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,874
- Brian?
- Um...

272
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,076
- Bottle of red.
- How many glasses?

273
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,594
- One.
- 0K. Bitter, Mike?

274
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,238
No, are you?

275
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,835
- Would you like a pint of bitter?
- 0h. Yeah.

276
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,638
Soph...ie?

277
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,871
Bourbon, Tim. Straight up.

279
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,678
Wow!

# But I'm all woman

284
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,949
Woo.

285
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,675
Phew. Hi, Daisy,
how you going? Drink?

286
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,036
Yes, please.
I'll have a Bloody Mary. Thanks.

287
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,076
- You look nice, Daisy.
- Thanks.

288
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,196
I wish I could dress down like that.

289
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,714
- He's gonna come over.
- 0K.

290
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,268
- Hello. You all right?
- Yes.

291
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,430
Right, shall we?

292
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,431
Yes. Merci.

293
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,232
- Are you going to...
- Yes.

294
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,356
We're just going to the loo.

295
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,436
I can't believe you brought her here.

296
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,999
I thought it was quite nice.

297
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,957
So are you gonna tell her?

298
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,758
Marsha, what is your problem?

299
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,068
I'll tell her, then.

300
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,469
Why do you want
to spoil her birthday?

301
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,030
Every second you leave it,
it'll make it more painful for her.

302
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,429
- What?
- I'm telling her.

303
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,714
- Don't!
- I will.

304
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,233
If anyone tells her, I will.

305
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,548
- You won't.
- No!

306
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,789
What's up?

307
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,436
- Tim's having an affair.
- I got you a birthday cake.

308
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,919
What?

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,197
Tim is having an affair with her.

310
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,555
- What?
- I seen 'em snogging

311
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,232
in the front garden.

312
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,189
- No. Marsha, it's not like that.
- What d'you mean?

313
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,479
No, it is like that and I'm sorry,
Daisy, but she means nothing to me.

314
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,154
- It's not..
- I think we should tell her.

315
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,196
- Tell me what?
- She's in shock.

316
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,838
- I'm not.
- You are.

317
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,399
- I'm drunk...
- Daisy.

318
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,038
- ..but I'm lucid.
- Please.

319
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,838
- It's OK.
- What's going on?

320
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,989
I should go.

321
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,035
Sophie.

322
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,997
Marsha...

323
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,433
we're not really...

324
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,272
a couple.

325
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,355
You what?

326
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,194
We're not...
We're not really a couple.

327
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,751
Phew. It's actually
a relief to say it!

328
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,999
The thing is, we had to say we were,

329
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,230
in order to get the flat,

330
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,629
but the truth is, that we lied.

331
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,634
You lied?

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,350
Yeah, but we were desperate. We
didn't think about the consequences.

333
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,512
We didn't mean to hurt you.

334
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,273
We just... It was like,
the longer we left it...

335
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,395
You lied?

336
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,311
- Marsha...
- Why?

337
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,755
The advert said
"professional couple only".

338
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,239
- No, it didn't.
- It did.

339
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,311
I remember. The bloke was a prick.

340
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,358
I don't think
he was listening to me.

341
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,193
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,511
- Dave.
- Can you hold on, please?

343
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,669
Hello, you.

344
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,877
Two-bedroomed, fully furnished,
Streatham, £350 a week.

345
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,871
Could you do that?
I'm going to lunch.

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,030
You bet you.

347
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,918
0h, it's professional couple only.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,399
Sounds nice.

349
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,596
'Professional couple only.

350
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,875
'Professional couple only.'

351
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,280
Sorry about that, Mrs Klein.
Is that everything?

352
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,318
Great. That'll go in tomorrow.

353
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,789
I can't believe
you lied all this time.

354
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,872
I bought you a present
for your anniversary! Both of 'em.

355
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,030
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,348
- 0h!
- Look, Marsha.

357
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,000
Please. Just understand.

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,310
We weren't being malicious.
We didn't have a choice.

359
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,109
We really like that flat.
That was supposed to sound nice.

360
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,990
I suppose you lot
all knew about this.

361
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,389
You must think
I'm a complete idiot.

362
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,789
No!

363
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,394
Don't be angry.

364
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,869
How d'you want me to be, Daisy?

365
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,679
I just found out
my new little group of young friends

366
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,988
has been taking the piss.

367
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,116
- Marsha.
- No, Brian. I'm leaving.

368
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,556
- Where are you going?
- Just away from you lot.

369
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,033
I really think I should go.

370
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,111
- Sophie.
- No, look, Tim.

371
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,394
I'll call you tomorrow.

372
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,469
Bye.

373
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,595
Nice one, Daisy.

374
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,513
I wasn't the one snogging

375
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,478
my supposedly secret girlfriend
in the front garden.

376
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,391
Tim doesn't
think about anyone else

377
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,040
- when he's with Sophie.
- Stay out of this.

378
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,838
It's got nothing to do with you.

379
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,878
It's got everything to do
with me. I live in that house.

380
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,428
I'll have to live with my mum
because of you.

381
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,193
Because of me?
I'm not the one who told her!

382
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,840
You could have kept
your tongue in your mouth!

383
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,480
I think we're all
to blame in a way.

384
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,471
0h, thank you very much,
Mrs Magnanimous.

385
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,471
Fine time to grow
a fucking conscience!

386
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,790
Are you letting him
speak to me like that?

387
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,233
- Yes!
- What?

388
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,630
I'm not an accessory
to pick up when you need me.

389
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,438
Good time to start getting
emotionally articulate.

390
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,988
- Don't lay into Brian!
- I'm not!

391
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,355
I can't believe you
after all we've...

392
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,112
- It's your fault.
- Shut up!

393
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,953
- Did you see her face?
- Say something!

394
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,871
- Shut up!
- Why did you bring her?

395
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,519
You are so stupid, Daisy!

396
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,795
# Happy birthday, dear Daisy

397
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,634
# Happy birthday to you #

398
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,910
Tim! You know
I'm allergic to wheat.

399
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,911
0h, fuck off.

400
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,800
- Grow up.
- You grow up.

401
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,433
Well, the way I see it,
we have two choices.

402
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,431
We can call the police,

403
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,988
or you can clear up
this mess yourselves.

404
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,438
Who votes for clearing up?

405
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,952
Who votes for police?

406
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,911
Clearing up it is, yeah.

407
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,912
Good. I'll get the mop, shall I?

408
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,439
I'm going home.

409
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,750
Happy birthday, Daisy.

410
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
- What are we gonna do?
- We could go clubbing.

411
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,669
I mean about Marsha.

412
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,151
We've destroyed her faith in
the integrity of today's youth.

413
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,879
Young adults.

414
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,192
We've gotta pull together
or else we're gonna lose everything.

415
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,750
- So that's settled.
- Clubbing it is!

416
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,518
Brian and Mike
have gone to look for her.

417
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,478
There's a hundred
off-licences in this area.

418
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,391
She could be in any one of them.

419
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,311
Yeah, well. They might get lucky.

420
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,755
We should stay here
in case she comes back.

421
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,310
- OK.
- Look, Daisy. Don't worry.

422
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,436
We'll sort this out. We always do.

423
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,592
I don't know.
This feels different.

424
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,276
Serious. We've had some good
times here though, haven't we?

425
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,113
Yeah.

426
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,112
- Happy days.
- Yeah.

427
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,475
'We'll be off then, Tim.'

428
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,788
OK.

429
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,031
If we find Marsha, we'll contact you.

430
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,396
Um, yeah.
We'll find her, Daisy.

431
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,959
Promise you.

432
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,110
We'll see you at the rendezvous.

433
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,280
0K, Tim.

434
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,629
Good luck.
