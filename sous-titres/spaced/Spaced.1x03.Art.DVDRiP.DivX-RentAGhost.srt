1
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,713
You want a piece of me ? Come get some.

2
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,639
Heads up.

3
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,398
Oh, shit !

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,151
- Oh, hiya.
- Don't sneak up on me like that !

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,794
Ooohh ! Do you want a cup of tea ?

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,558
Yes.

7
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,315
- There's your tea.
- Thank you.

8
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,794
- You're up early.
- I haven't been to bed.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,310
Me and Mike met up with two Scottish guys
in the pub and they gave us cheap speed.

10
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,635
<i>Oh, Tim, that's so tacky.</i>

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,716
I know. They were so nice.

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,036
If we'd have said no, they'd have got offended
and beaten us to death with a pool cue.

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,593
Where's Mike now ?

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,271
Is there any post ?

15
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,108
- I did hear droppage.
- I'm gonna go and get my rejection letters.

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,033
I met this really, really nice girl last night.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,630
Shh ! I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.

18
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,713
- Marsha might hear.
- Don't be daft !

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,878
- You never know who's listening.
- Nobody's listening.

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,711
<i>- You never know who's listening,
- Nobody's listening,</i>

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,868
So who was this girl, then ?

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,313
Her name was Cassandra, she was
a psychic, she gave me her phone number.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,750
That's our phone number.

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,510
Man, she's good.

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,830
Rejection, rejection, rejection.

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,678
<i>This is shit ! This is so shit !</i>

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,989
I'm a good writer, you know ?
All I want is a chance to prove it.

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,031
Yeah ? Too much to ask ?

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,517
Oh, I really miss my boyfriend.

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,358
I'm gonna go to Hull to see Richard.

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,269
Don't try and stop me, Tim. OK ?
I really need this.

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,952
<i>Oh ! It's from Flaps  !</i>

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,150
- Who ?
- The woman's magazine.

34
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,158
I've got an interview today !
I'd better get ready.

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,398
- What about Richard ?
- Who ? Right, I'm gonna go to the shops.

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,908
- Do you want anything ?
- Porn !

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,473
Tim, I'm not gonna buy you porn.

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,353
You can get it from railway sidings
like everybody else.

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,597
I can't, I'm an adult.
I'm supposed to leave it there.

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,479
Oh, hi, Bri !

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,633
Brought your mop back.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,510
What are you playing ?

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,189
It's a subtle blend of lateral thinking
and extreme violence.

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,988
What, like It's A Knockout ?

45
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,871
Did you want something ?

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,148
No. Not really.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,710
Oh, there's a letter here for you.
Came yesterday.

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,997
It's open.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,717
Yeah. I opened it by accident
because we've both got I's in our names.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,470
- It's from Vulva.
- Is that another woman's magazine ?

51
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,876
Vulva, it's an old friend.
She's having a show tonight.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,275
You've got a friend called Vulva ?
Who's called Vulva ?

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,710
<i>- Her real name's lan.
- What do you mean her real name's lan ?</i>

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,672
- She's non-gender specific.
- What, you mean he's a tranny ?

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,473
- More than that.
- What, a big, fat tranny ?

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,198
Vulva. We had a multimedia performance-art
partnership before she moved on.

57
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,394
Such aesthetic wonders. Such vibrant times.

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,158
Yeah, I can imagine.

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,234
No. No, no. We did valuable work.

60
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,989
<i>She was the beautiful one, really,
I just danced to her tune,</i>

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,471
It was purity.

62
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,640
It was physical. Not in a sexual sense,
no, we were collaborative.

63
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,999
I don't expect you to understand. Most people
don't want to hear, they just switch off.

64
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,113
It's hard to hear the story of a love affair
between two straight men,

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,199
one of whom is the most divine woman alive.

66
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,519
So, are you gonna go ?

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,270
- I don't know, I haven't seen her for ages.
- No, I meant are you gonna go now ?

68
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,271
Oh, yeah.

69
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,192
<i>Research, research, research, research,
research, research, research,</i>

70
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,154
<i>Clothes, clothes, ideas, clothes,,,</i>

71
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,953
<i>Clothes, ideas, photographers,,, and,,, ooh !</i>

72
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,911
Right.

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,997
Current affairs, right. Ooh, current affairs.

74
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,157
OK. What do you think about...

75
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,237
What do you think about current affairs,
Daisy ?

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,352
What do I think about them ?
Erm, well, I like them. I think they're good.

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,391
Right. What shall I wear ?

78
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,989
- I think you should dress like a lesbian.
- How do lesbians dress ?

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,076
Kind of like Suzi Quatro ?

80
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,080
It's not really a lesbian magazine.

81
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,756
It's more for modern, go-getting women
with something to say, women like...

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,553
- Suzi Quatro ?
- No ! Like me.

83
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm not sure if I should go casual or strappy.
Reliable and frumpy or stupid and glamorous.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,032
Why don't you go something in-between ?

85
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,150
- Frumpy and stupid.
- Save you getting ready.

86
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,352
- Tim, I'm serious ! This is important, I've...
- Look ! Daisy...

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,631
Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.

88
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,871
It's gonna be OK.

89
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,517
Now have a big toke on this South African
drugs-reefer-style spliff doobie.

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,030
I dunno. Might make me paranoid.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,355
Oh, all right.

92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,750
(Music from Psycho)

93
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,915
You all right ?

94
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,711
Yeah.

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,997
I nearly didn't make it. I was followed
most of the way here by a squirrel.

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,429
Must have seen it six or seven times.

98
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,356
Maybe it was six or seven different squirrels.

99
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,878
- I like your shoes.
- They're Patrick Cox's.

100
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,559
Oh, right. Borrowed them. Yeah.

101
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,591
Small feet for a bloke.

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,432
Oh, give Josh a big kiss for me.
See you Saturday. Daisy Steiner ?

103
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,795
Hiya, Linda ! Be with you in a minute.
Love the shoes. Patrick Cox's ?

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,748
Maybe you should try buying your own shoes
in future.

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,512
Hello, Vulva.

106
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,630
So... come.

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,631
Hi.

108
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,319
Erm...

109
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,234
Hello ! Shit.

110
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,431
Hello, Vulva.

111
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,313
Yeah, hi, Vulva. Nice invitation.

112
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,432
Mm ? ! Oh, yeah, yeah. Hi, Vulva.

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,358
Vulva ! Hi ! How are you ? How... ?

114
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,393
<i>How are you ? How are you ?
How,,, are,,, you ?</i>

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,512
Brian, painter. Damien... Damien... ?

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,516
Damien Hirst, hi, it's Brian.

117
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,074
Vulva, I'm talking to Damien.

118
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,157
Is it water with the sheep in the box ?

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,875
No, I paint. Lots of work with... paint.

120
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,435
I do big... big... big...

121
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,756
Fucking loser. Yeah, yeah, big loser.

122
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,950
Brian, painter, loser.

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,356
<i>Big, fucking,,, loser !</i>

124
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,954
Just...

125
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,829
Take a seat.

126
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,994
Daisy, is it ?

127
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,679
Ah. Like a little flower.

128
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,393
Right, I'm Yolanda.

129
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,830
This is Tracy, who is our stylist,
and Catherine who is Head of Marketing,

130
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,872
and you've already met Sarah,
she's Administration.

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,959
The position requires you to work closely
with Michelle and Tara

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,390
who are busy working on features
for our first edition

133
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,510
which we're aiming to get out
by the end of the month.

134
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,949
We've started our launch campaign,
have you seen it ?

135
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,554
- I'm sorry.
- Have you seen the launch campaign ?

136
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,957
Yes.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,390
Our magazine reflects the needs
of today's women.

138
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,238
We want it big, hard and we want it now.

139
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,158
<i>I knew I should have bought
Huge Fat Cocks,</i>

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,397
We need to know whether you feel,
as someone working for our magazine,

141
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,716
you could honestly and intelligently
reflect the needs of our demographic,...

142
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,756
..the 20-40-year-old-woman
who doesn't say no,

143
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,999
who sees her home interiors
the same way she sees her life...

144
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,999
..spunk !

145
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,158
We don't want you to pigeonhole yourself
but would you call yourself a postfeminist ?

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,872
Um...  ?

147
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,753
Let me put it this way,
do you drink pints or shots ?

148
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,309
Well, I do drink a pint, I will drink a pint,

149
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,148
but I've been known to drink
a vodka and tonic, you know,

150
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,998
at a wedding, or...

151
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,152
Well,... thanks for coming.

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,589
It's been really useful.

153
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,796
Right, well...

154
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
Girl power !

155
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,630
Don't write me off, Vulva.

156
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,597
I can be...

157
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,518
conceptual.

158
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,718
I'm sorry, Brian.

159
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,794
- Please.
- It's your work.

160
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,597
Abstract expressionism
is so mid-to-late '80s.

161
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,396
'There's no reason for us to stay
any longer than necessary.'

162
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:56,113
'Let's split up, look for any survivors
and get out of here.'

163
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,272
Hey !

164
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,755
- How did it go ?
- Yeah, great. It went well, actually.

165
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,473
- Anyone phone ?
- Your boyfriend.

166
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,512
- Anyone important ?
- No.

167
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,716
You know when you said it went well ?

168
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,035
Well, when you said "well",

169
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,550
- did you mean shite ?
- Yes.

170
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,668
I froze up. I just... made a tit of myself.

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,233
How much of a tit ?

172
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,033
I said... "girl power".

173
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,951
Did you do this ?

174
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,199
Yes.

175
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,590
Well, I mean, you know,
you might have impressed them.

176
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,313
How ?

177
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,711
- Tim !
- Yeah, I'm thinking.

178
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,752
Oh, shit ! Shitting shit it !

179
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,510
Oh, don't be so dramatic, you don't know for
definite you haven't got it. They might phone.

180
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,113
Well, pick it up, then !

181
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,874
Hello ? Oh, hi, Mike. Yeah, he's here,
I'll just get him. It's your boyfriend.

182
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,911
He's not my boyfriend.

183
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,917
- Hi, babe.

184
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,031
- Hello, Timmy.
- 'Where are you ?'

185
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,355
- Er, Sheffield.
- What are you doing in Sheffield ?

186
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,710
- Fell asleep on the tube.
- The tube doesn't go to Sheffield.

187
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,437
- Yeah, I must have changed at King's Cross.
- Well, don't fall asleep on the way back, OK ?

188
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,436
'Mike ?'

189
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,755
Mike !

190
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,152
What is it with you two ?
You sound like his dad sometimes.

191
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,716
Well, it's a long story.

192
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,590
Hello ? Brian ?

193
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,915
No, he's the weirdo downstairs.

194
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,919
Oh ! Sorry, Brian ! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come up. OK, bye.

195
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,393
Brian's coming up.

196
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,634
Why did he phone ?

197
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,309
I don't know,
why did he paint his arse blue last week ?

198
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,114
- You don't like him, do you ?
- I do, I just think he's a bit pretentious.

199
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,231
How do I look ?

200
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,794
- A bit pretentious ?
- I think you look lovely, Brian.

201
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,479
Do you think I should lose the waistcoat ?

202
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,672
I think you should burn it, cos, you know,
if you lose it, you might find it again.

203
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,391
Are you going out, Bri ?

204
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,318
<i>Yeah, he's gonna see
his transsexual ex-boylgirlfriend's new play.</i>

205
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,990
Oh, that sounds great ! Oh, we'll come !
You'll come, won't you, Tim ?

206
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,634
- No way, it's not my cup of tea.
- No, it isn't.

207
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,069
Oh, come on, Bri, it'll be great, it'll be fun.

208
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,272
You'll hate it. It's just a bit of art,
load of wankers, influential people.

209
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,470
- Free booze, though !
- Mm, yeah.

210
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,114
OK, let's go to the theatre.

211
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,469
You can come if you want
but you probably won't get in.

212
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,348
There's three of us,
we've only got one invitation.

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,631
That's OK. Go on, in you go.
There's not that many here.

214
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,674
- They haven't got tickets.
- Look, mate, I've told you, you can go in.

215
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,711
It's ridiculous, they haven't even been invited.

216
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,991
Just leave it, Brian.
Let's just go in, it'll be fine.

217
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,555
We're not gonna embarrass you,
we're here if you need us.

218
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,716
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

219
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,716
Hello !

220
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,716
- Shit !
- Hi !

221
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,433
- What you doin' here ?
- Oh, we just came with Brian.

222
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,072
Oh, how wonderful !

223
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,238
- So how's it all goin' with the flat ?
- It's fine.

224
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,558
Sorry, you come here for a big night out
and there's your landlady spying on you.

225
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,718
Hello, Brian.
Haven't seen you for a long while.

226
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,352
Been painting.

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,834
You've just been trying to avoid me,
haven't ya ?

228
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,397
The show's starting.

229
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,708
- Hey !
- Sh !

230
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,798
Macro...

231
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,792
biotic !

232
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,948
Dust me clean !

233
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,275
A breath... alizer !

234
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,790
Using... a cleaning spray.

235
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,998
Knee...

236
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,429
- jerk !
- Suck it in !

237
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,710
Filter it out !

238
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,478
Go on !

239
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,912
Arrrhhhh...

240
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,349
<i>Beautiful, Beautiful,</i>

241
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,273
<i>I cannot believe I said "girl power",</i>

242
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
<i>Hey, deadhead ! Take a bite of peach,</i>

243
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,991
Hearing...

244
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,870
aidzz.

245
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,357
Fade...

246
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,315
out !

247
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,635
It's not finished !

248
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,829
It's finished.

249
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,159
- Do you mind if I put my glass there ?
- It's a free country.

250
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,595
I thought... you were brilliant.

251
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,634
- And who are you, then ?
- I'm Daisy Steiner, writer, sort of journalist.

252
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,752
Do you know any famous
or important people ?

253
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,995
My mum's cousin
went to school with Enya.

254
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,077
She was in the year above
but they had the same percussion teacher.

255
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,478
I hate your mum and I hate you.

256
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,954
That's brilliant. Brilliant !

257
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,031
- Vulva, hi.
- Brian ! You came !

258
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,039
- Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
- Are you still painting ?

259
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,629
Not exclusively.
I'm moving into multimedia pastures -

260
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,834
installations, a platter of organic processes
mixed with a pinch of irony

261
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,713
and a side helping of self-deprecation.

262
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,990
Sounds delicious !

263
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,156
You should see what's for pudding.

264
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,949
Oh, Brian, you came.

265
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,797
No, I just spilt my drink.

266
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,310
So nice to see you. Are you still painting ?

267
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,511
N-not... er,... multimedia,...

268
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,190
platters,... irony and self-deprecation.

269
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,879
Sounds a little hard to swallow.

270
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,672
There's... there's pudding.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,429
Pud-ding ! I always loved your quirkiness.

272
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,517
You must be able to see I've moved on.

273
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,028
The projects I've been working on
with Hoover

274
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,958
are the most incisive and effective
I've ever done.

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,959
I can't believe some of the shit
I used to do with you.

276
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,835
That's the difference between you and me,
Brian, I could always see into the distance,

277
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,271
you, it has to be said,
were always a little short-sighted.

278
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,638
Anyway, we're having a postmortem
at the Squid and Mashed Potato.

279
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,148
I suppose you could tag along.

280
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,192
You make your mind up
and maybe I'll see you later.

281
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,675
(Music from Psycho)

282
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,598
Now, come on ! There's no need for us
to be here any longer than necessary.

283
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,870
Let's split up, look for survivors
and get out of here !

284
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,600
I'm writing a novel, poetry, articles,
short stories, children's book.

285
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,672
- Ooh, and I'm doing a skydiving course.
- Look, piss off, will ya ?

286
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,233
- Come on !
- What are you doing ?

287
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,236
- I'm saving us !
- This is Hoover.

288
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,237
Bye.

289
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,159
Bye, then.

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,952
I'll see you later.

291
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,755
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.

292
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,152
Like a... kind of visual poetry.

293
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,070
- Wish I could do that.
- Well, I'm sure you could if you had funding.

294
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,396
Right hook... bang.

295
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,432
- What ?
- I should have done it long ago, Daisy ?

296
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,792
In his drunken, childish way, Tim saved me.

297
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,195
Talk about expression, talk about the truth,

298
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,190
but what truer expression is there
than the purity of the clenched fist ?

299
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,514
I am a man, Daisy.

300
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,037
A man !

301
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,118
<i>Vulva treated me like a monkey !</i>

302
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,118
I'm more than that, I am a man !

303
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,351
A monkey-man !

304
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,792
A beast with a mind, and a mind, and fists !

305
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,436
And I will not be subdued again,
not by Vulva, not by anyone !

306
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,319
Hey, fella !

307
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,518
Morning, slugger. Any letters ?

308
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,551
I don't know.

309
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,239
Agh !

310
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,269
- How do you feel ?
- Oh, like I'm gonna die.

311
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,596
- Oh, me too.
- So what happened last night ?

312
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,110
We went to see
an interesting piece of contemporary theatre,

313
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,278
<i>we drank an enormous amount of free wine,
we ate our body weight in Twiglets</i>

314
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,436
and you punched an artist in the face.

315
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,677
Shit.

316
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,915
- I'm not supposed to eat Twiglets.
- Why not ?

317
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,554
They make me violent.

318
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,351
It's from the magazine.

319
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,234
Maybe they did like me.
Maybe they liked my kookiness.

320
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,475
I could be like the cute one in the office,
you know ?

321
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,557
The ditzy one who always gets it wrong,
the office clown.

322
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,034
I'd be like "Ooh, Yolanda, I've lost the file."

323
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,231
She'd say "That's all right, Daisy,
we just like having you around,

324
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,716
cos you're crazy and wild,
an asset to the office dynamic."

325
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,634
- It's a no.
- Oh, well, never mind.

326
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,912
Who needs them anyway, Daisy ?
What do they know ? They're just jealous.

327
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,270
- Of what ?
- Your tits ?

328
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,949
It's not about my tits any more, Tim.
I wish it were.

329
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,433
It's not like the old days

330
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,677
when you could get a job wearing a short skirt
and showing a bit of cleavage.

331
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,075
I've got to prove my intellectual worth.

332
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,908
I know there's something I've got to be,
I just don't know what it is.

333
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,394
I feel like a rabbit...

334
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,071
trapped on a road to nowhere,

335
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,476
frozen in the headlights of the 21 st century.

336
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,513
Daisy, for the last time,
will you stop being so dramatic ?

337
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,594
Why do you have to make
such a performance out of everything ?

338

Yeah !

339
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,236
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...

340
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,671
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit,
rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !

341
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,629
Ooh, like a little flower !

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,949
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...
