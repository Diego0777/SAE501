1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,353
It's just all she seems to talk about
is this bloody dog, you know ?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,597
It's like "Ooh, Colin did this"
and "Ooh, Colin did that",

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,119
and I'm sick of it, you know ?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,676
I should talk to her, but she's been so happy
ever since Colin arrived on the scene.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,438
She'd been having a hard time.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,199
She'd had some articles rejected,
she'd split up with her boyfriend.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,277
To top it all off,
her hair looked stupid all the time.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,357
Then Colin arrives on the scene
and she's writing again.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,191
She doesn't seem that bothered
about Richard and her hair looks good !

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,195
Tim, I know how you feel about dogs
and I know how you feel about Daisy.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,518
Sometimes, where friends are concerned,
sacrifices have to be made.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,959
You're saying we kill the dog ?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,309
- No.
- Spoilsport.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,995
- Count to 100 ?
- All right.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,031
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,918
<i>I used to know this guy Minty,</i>

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,999
<i>He had a dog who he'd train
to attack rich people,</i>

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,873
<i>He was into the whole class-war thing,</i>

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,832
<i>He called the dog Gramsci
after an Italian Marxist,</i>

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,157
<i>Rumour has it, it could smell wealth
from up to 20 feet,</i>

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,519
<i>The thing is, it all backfired,
Minty won 100 grand on a scratchcard,,,</i>

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,594
<i>and Gramsci bit his knees off,</i>

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,279
That's terrible.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,108
Not really. He used the money
to buy new knees.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,515
So what happened to Gramsci, then ?

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,951
Well, no-one knows,
although some people still believe

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,958
he roams wild on Hampstead Heath.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,551
Close to the meat.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,999
Hiya !

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,509
- Is that it ?
- Well, it's not what it is.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,394
It's what it will be - a cold-blooded killer.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,757
It's a fact, sure as day follows night,
sure as eggs is eggs,

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,598
sure as every odd-numbered
Star Trek movie is shit.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,154
- Ahhh !
- Mwah !

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,875
- I'm going shopping. Do you want anything ?
- A crossbow ?

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,150
And also, if Richard calls,

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,475
tell him I'm out with Colin.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,472
We'll make him pay, won't we ?
We'll make them all pay.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,391
- Who's Richard ?
- Ex-boyfriend.

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,317
- Your ex-boyfriend ?
- No, Daisy's ex-boyfriend.

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,079
- My ex-boyfriend.
- Oh, I'm sorry. What happened ?

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,591
Well, you know, I was upset
but I'm not any more, you know.

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,871
In the end, our relationship
was just like a sandwich toaster.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,151
You know, you forget you've got one.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,919
It just sits on top of the cupboard
collecting a layer of greasy fudge.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,909
If you see it, you assume it's broken,
otherwise you'd be using it all the time,

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,393
but you don't and it just sits there.

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,877
Then one day, you get an overwhelming
desire for toasted sandwiches

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,629
and you get it down and it works
and you can't believe it, you know.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,990
You make every kind of sandwich there is,
you have toasted-sandwich parties.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,600
You make Marmite and cheese
and chocolate and...

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,278
- Pilchards.
- Banana and...

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,151
- Acorns.
- Acorns.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,795
Then as quickly as desire comes, it just goes,

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,355
and then you put
the toasted-sandwich maker away

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,790
- and... you know what ?
- What ?

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,951
You don't miss it.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,994
So what you're saying is "Don't hide
the toasted-sandwich maker away,

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,793
use him regularly
and you'll get the most out of him."

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,638
No, she's saying "Chuck your boyfriend,
have a sandwich."

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,274
Anyway, I've got to go cos I'm meeting Twist.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,230
Don't you just love my hair ?

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,914
How can you not like him ? He's so cute.

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,359
Ahh !

65
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,077
That's how it all starts, with "Oohs" and
"Aahs", but later there's barking and biting.

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,395
He's a ticking timebomb of death, Daisy.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,150
You give him all the love in the world,
you spend years doting on his little furry head

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,590
and one day you get back from aerobics
and there he is,

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,518
panting over the half-eaten remains
of some hapless handyman

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,437
you left fixing the tumble dryer.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,232
We don't have a tumble dryer.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,197
You will, my friend, you will.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,314
Look, Tim, I know
that I've been... insensitive, OK,

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,353
and I do appreciate that you are riddled
with deep-seated psychological disorders.

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,879
Thank you.

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,152
But Colin lives here now and I'd like it
if we could all live happily, you know ?

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,590
- Your mum remarried, didn't she ?
- What's that got to do with anything ?

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,713
Well,... you know what it feels like to be...

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,671
to be a stepchild,

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,075
to be resented by a patriarch.

81
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,190
My stepdad was a nice guy !

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,952
Timmy boy !

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,311
All right, I'll give it a try.

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,150
Thanks, Tim.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,954
- So, what are you doing tonight ?
- Brian's coming up.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,274
To see you ?

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,598
I went to a gallery with him last week, so
he's coming up to see the Star Wars Trilogy.

88
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,790
It's like a cultural exchange thing.

89
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,515
Do you mind if we sit in ?
We could be like independent observers.

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,269
No, not at all. I'll get some popcorn.
And a muzzle.

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,279
Ooh ! Sorry, mate.

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,192
You idiot. Why don't you watch
where you're going ?

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,993
Takes the fun out of it.

94
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,079
I just know this street well. I've never seen
an evil, suspicious-Iooking man here before.

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,112
What makes you think I'm evil
and suspicious-Iooking ?

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,712
All right ! I was just being friendly.

97
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,751
It's so moving.

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,672
Little Ewoks.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,155
An entire empire brought to its knees
by small furry creatures.

100
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,590
- That's my point exactly.
- Leave him alone.

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,279
Did you notice that everything that transpired
in those films, and I mean everything,

102
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,552
can be attributed to the actions
of one very minor character ?

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,032
Who ?

104
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,834
The gunner on the Star Destroyer
at the beginning of the first film.

105
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,279
How come ?

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,075
Well, if the gunner had shot the pod
that C-3PO and R2 were in,

107
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,111
they wouldn't have got to Tatooine,
they wouldn't have met Luke,

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,957
Luke wouldn't have met Ben,
they wouldn't have met Han and Chewie,

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,072
they wouldn't have rescued Princess Leia -
none of it would have happened.

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,111
Chaos theory.

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,516
- Eh ?
- The predictability of random events,

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,597
the notion that reality as we know it
- past, present, future -

113
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,871
is in fact a mathematically predictable
preordained system.

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,956
So somewhere out there
in the vastness of the unknown

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,991
is an equation...

116
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,715
for predicting the future ?

117
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,470
An equation so complex as to utterly defy
any possibility of comprehension

118
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,035
by even the most brilliant human mind,

119
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,914
but an equation nonetheless.

120
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,069
- Oh, my God.
- What ?

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,155
What ?

122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,988
I've got some fucking Jaffa Cakes
in my coat pocket.

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,951
Oh, Mama !

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,911
Oh, Daddy, let's all play kabaddi.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,474
- You get 'em, Daise.
- I made the tea.

126
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,398
I opened the window.
Brian, it's your turn to do something.

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,069
- Colin needs to go out for a walk.
- I opened the window.

128
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,556
Yeah, I made the tea
and Brian's getting the Jaffa Cakes.

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,589
Shit !

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,359
It'll give you a chance
to get to know each other.

131
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,556
All right, all right,
I'll do it, if it'll make you happy.

132
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,910
Come on, then, Cujo,
or whatever your bloody name is.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,520
Stay away from me, mind. Go on.

134
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,999
What's the matter with you ?
Just do your thing.

135
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,031
Just do it. Do it. Just go, will you ?

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,071
Oh, right. Well, hurry up.

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,031
Come on, you bastards.
I know you're up there.

138
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,914
Come and get me.
Take me to your homeworld.

139
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,110
Come on, abduct me !

140
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,790
Shit ! Colin's been abducted !

141
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,150
- What do you mean, he's been abducted ?
- Yeah, by a crocodile or something.

142
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,953
- A crocodile ? !
- Or something.

143
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,196
<i>- You let him go, didn't you ?
- Wha... ? !</i>

144
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,876
- Daisy, I'm sure Tim...
- No, Brian !

145
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,559
He's had it in for him from the start.

146
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,671
Now, Daisy, I admit I wasn't keen
on the idea of getting a dog,

147
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,234
but I would never stoop so low
as to do something like that.

148
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,840
- I think you know me well enough.
- Do I ?

149
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,756
Daisy !

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,678
I obviously don't know you
as well as I thought !

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,831
Ow.

152
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,071
Do you want a Jaffa Cake ?

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,111
No.

154
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,716
I can't believe she'd think that.

155
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,478
She's upset and not thinking straight.

156
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,432
People say things they don't mean
in those situations,

157
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,358
she's just lashing out
at someone close to her.

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,391
Thanks, mate.

159
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,032
It's all right.

160
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,192
<i>So what did you do with it, then ?</i>

161
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,191
Colin !

162
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,231
Colin !

163
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,229
- Colin !
- Colin !

164
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,914
Colin ! Colin !

165
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,955
Colin ! Colin ! Colin !

166
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,272
Col... Oh, I'm sorry,

167
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,993
I thought you were someone else.

168
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,911
Colin !

169
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,510
- Colin !
- Colin !

170
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,234
- Colin !
- Colin !

171
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,748
Come on, you little... Colin.

172
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,671
- Any luck ?
- No.

173
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,951
This came.

174
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,951
"To whom it may concern, I'm writing to
inform you of the whereabouts of your dog."

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,959
"Colin has been taken by a man named
James Eldridge, a freelance vivisectionist."

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,870
"I cannot return your dog personally, but
the lab site is located 11-13 Kettle Road, N1."

177
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,751
"Colin is being kept in Terrapin 5."

178
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,519
"The lab has a skeleton security staff of one."

179
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,155
"I hope this information is of use to you.
Yours in search of justice,...

180
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,236
..a friend."

181
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,031
This came with it.

182
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,556
Call Twist, get Brian, I'll get Mike.

183
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,799
- What are you gonna do ?
- We're gonna get our dog back.

184
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,555
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
Daisy and me, we...

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,229
We really appreciate it.
We all know this is gonna be tough.

186
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,192
- Do you want a Bourbon ?
- Ooh, thanks very much.

187
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,629
One of our number is in trouble
and we have to help.

188
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,148
Thanks to the information obtained by Mike,

189
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,556
- Hello.
- ..we've got a rough idea of the lab's layout.

190
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,034
The main gate is here, the guard hut is here,

191
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,995
and Terrapin 5, where we believe
Colin is being held, is here.

192
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,112
We'll go over the fence here. It's two metres
high, so we'll have to do some climbing.

193
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,435
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

194
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,758
I used to climb over my neighbour's fence
when I was a kid. It was about two metres.

195
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,588
- Mike and Brian will handle the guard.
- Why Mike and Brian ?

196
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,358
Because you're tallest
and Mike's good at handling people.

197
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,278
Brian's not bad at handling people,
are you, Brian ?

198
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,757
Once inside, Daisy, Twist and myself
will locate Terrapin 5.

199
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,076
When we find it, Daisy and Twist
will stand guard and I'll go in for Colin.

200
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,908
- Why are you going in ?
- Because I'm the one that lost him.

201
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,311
I want you all wearing black tonight.

202
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,396
<i>- All black ?
- All black.</i>

203
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,112
I don't know much about security lighting,

204
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,676
but I'm guessing they'll use 180-degree
dispersing halogens with motion sensors,

205
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,837
so we'll have to stick to the shadows.
Any questions ?

206
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,440
- Are charcoal-grey pumps OK ?
- Yes, they'll be fine.

207
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,756
If we get separated, we'll meet
at the Beech Tree Inn on Stone Street.

208
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,429
Brian, put your hand down.
Mike, I'll see you here at 2200 hours,

209
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,471
everybody else, I'll see you here at ten.

210
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,910
That's very...

211
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,428
- That's very good, Mike.
- Ta.

212
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,671
Well done, Daisy.

213
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,634
- You've done really well, Twist.
- It's from the DKNY open-warfare range.

214
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,116
- Well, great. Well done. What's this ?
- It's my make-up bag.

215
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,709
We're rescuing a dog from an animal-testing
laboratory - there'll be lots of make-up there.

216
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,512
- Oh, it's for luck.
- Twist...

217
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,073
Tim !

218
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,111
Let her take it.

219
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,388
OK.

220
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,672
When we get there, it's important while
we're doing this we don't use our real names.

221
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,280
From now on,
we'll be using code names, OK ?

222
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,150
Mike, you're Luke.

223
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,349
Brian, you're Chewie.

224
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,435
Daisy, you're Leia.

225
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,472
Twist,... you're... Jabba.

226
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,556
- I'm Han.
- Can't I be Han ?

227
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,238
No !

228
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,952
- Sound off. Luke ?
- Ho.

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,149
- Chewie ?
- Erm, me.

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,077
- Leia ?
- Yes, Tim... Han.

231
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,838
- Jabba ?
- Is Jabba the princess ?

232
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,552
Yeah.
- Here !

233
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,672
OK. Let's go get Colin.

234
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,831
Brian ?

235
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,871
Come back in one piece.

236
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,273
Yep.

237
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,395
You know what piece I mean.

238
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,879
OK, this is it, people. None of us
have ever done anything like this before,

239
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,435
apart from Mike who, as we all know,
once stole a tank and tried to invade Paris.

240
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,153
- Hello.
- We're through the looking glass here, OK ?

241
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,795
We've been given a responsibility
and if we don't do this, nobody else will.

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,759
Good luck, and I'll see you at the Beech.

243
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,836
Go ! Go ! Go !

244
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,473
- Oo-ooh !
- What are you doing ?

245
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,511
The gate's open.

246
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,751
Erm, excuse me.

247
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,869
Excuse me.

248
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,999
Excuse me !

249
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,552
Let's play.

250
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,430
OK, this is it. Stand guard.
If it gets pear-shaped, just go.

251
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,471
Han !

252
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,317
- Good luck.
- You too, Princess.

253
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,351
Thanks !

254
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,752
You must get terrible headaches
looking at the screens all day long.

255
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,597
Oh, it's all right, really.

256
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,189
I find if I keep
a little bottle of eye drops handy,

257
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,959
it's not too bad, really.

258
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
You should get one of those eye masks with
the cooling gel in. I find them very soothing.

259
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,071
Oh, that sounds nice, yeah.

260
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,150
Colin ? Colin !

261
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,631
Colin !

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,428
What if they set the dogs on us ?

263
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,235
Don't worry, Twist. We trap 'em.
Ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah !

264
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,271
- Shh !
- Sorry.

265
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,874
Colin ? Colin !

266
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,798
I'm risking a lot being here, you know.

267
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,035
You're only doing it cos you fancy Chewie.

268
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,957
- Brian ? !
- Yeah.

269
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,752
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

270
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,677
- Uh-uh !
- Nn !

271
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,188
- Uh-uh !
- Eh-eh-eh !

272
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,676
Colin !

273
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,438
Ahh !

274
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,313
You stay back, OK, I'm coming in.

275
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,315
Italian make, 9mm parabellum,
13 in the clip, one in the spout.

276
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,998
Kill zone. Feel that.

277
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,148
That, my friend, will mash up through
the engine block of a Fiat Uno, no problem.

278
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,511
- How's it feel ?
- It's so cold.

279
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,150
You're always wiggling your arse
when he's around.

280
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,953
- I do not !
- You do, I've seen you.

281
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,992
Yes, well, what about you and "Han" ?

282
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,391
Tim ? !

283
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,552
What about me and Tim ?

284
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,477
- Run !
- Colin !

285
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,239
Come on !

286
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,399
Er, 14 across, three letters -
"To walk at speed, manage or oversee."

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,194
- Run !
- Bye.

288
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,514
No, wait !

289
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,515
- We're stuck !
- Do something with it.

290
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,156
No, you're all right, Officer. Must have been
a fox or something set off the motion sensors.

291
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,158
No, everything's fine. You stay where you are.

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,669
There you go.
There's, erm, a bit of a knack to it.

293
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,870
It was you who sent the letter, wasn't it ?

294
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,275
- Yeah.
- Why ?

295
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,596
Well, Eldridge left one of the Portakabins
open last week.

296
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,519
I couldn't believe it,
all those little animals in cages.

297
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,633
I'd never have taken the job
if I knew what he was up to, but...

298
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,470
I knew he'd clean away any evidence
if I went through the official channels,

299
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,796
and when Colin arrived, I saw my chance.

300
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,311
See, I... I've always been a bit of a yes man,
you see.

301
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,839
Have you ?

302
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,035
Yeah. So I thought it was time
I just stood up and said no.

303
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,916
Aren't you worried about getting in trouble
with the police, being involved in a break-in ?

304
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,793
It won't look very good
on your permanent record, will it ?

305
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,479
There's not much I can do about that,
is there ?

306
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,354
Wait a minute, everyone. I've got an idea.

307
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,992
What ?

308
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,271
Voilà !

309
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,119
Blimey.

310
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,311
There you go - it wasn't your fault,
we beat you up.

311
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,798
Hey, I suppose I'd better call the police,
then, eh ?

312
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,352
- You lot had better get off.
- Right.

313
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,755
Colin says thanks. "Thanks !"

314
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,518
- "Bye !"
-Bye.

315
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,919
Daisy, look at this.

this isn't the least bit amusing.
