1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,472
- What?
- You know what.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,312
I do not know what.

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,311
Take a wild guess.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,675
Um... It...

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,513
Is it because I sang the music
from the Kia-0ra advert?

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,319
I remember that.
# It's too orangey for crows #

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,516
You think this is funny?

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,397
No.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,270
I guarantee in about three minutes
you will definitely not be laughing.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,717
Look, boys, if you think
I am gonna stand by

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,509
and let you beat up my friend,
you've got another thing coming.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,309
0h, we're gonna beat you up, too.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,628
OK.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,350
What do you think we should do?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,069
Let 'em have it.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,789
Vegetables, a lot of people
are scared of them.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,314
Take potato,
a lot of people would peel it,

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,152
a lot of people would cube it.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,312
I don't like to, I just like to
put it down, bang, two halves.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,755
In the pan, potato stew,
it's a bit simple,

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,159
it's a bit sexy.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,993
- Mike, how sexy am I?
- 0oh, very.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,433
- In a salad...
- Daisy.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,033
..in a sausage sandwich,

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,998
- with a cup of tea...
- Daisy.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,433
How sexy am I?

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,115
Very. You look good.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,714
Really. Good. You look nice.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,756
You don't want to look
like you've made

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,990
too much of an effort,
you know what I mean?

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,833
I'll change my shirt.

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,552
This, my friend, is gonna
be one of the all-time great

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,949
- chicken stew, d'you know why?
- No.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,189
Because of this.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,872
0regano.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,394
Or oregano to you.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,869
'I got it from
a wise old herb merchant

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,350
'on one of my many travels.'

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,070
This is the good shit.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,434
Woo, mama!

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,553
- Hello.
- Hi, is that Daisy?

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,631
- Yeah.
- 'Hi, it's Sophie.'

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,995
- 0h, hi.
- Nice to speak to you finally,

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,437
- Tim's told me all about you.
- Has he? What did he say?

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,919
0h, you know, the usual.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,958
What sort of thing?
You know, specifically?

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,114
Well...that...you're friends,

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,475
you share a flat,

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,232
and your name's Daisy.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,788
0h, right.

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,677
Is Tim there?

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,877
0h, yes. Yes. He's just
getting his clothes on.

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,679
- It's Sophie.
- 0h, cheers.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,399
Hello.

55
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,675
- Hey, how are you?
- 'Good.'

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,194
Good. Had a nice time last night.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,396
'Me, too. What are you up to?'

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,233
You know,
just making myself beautiful.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,197
Listen,

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,794
Bisley,
I can't come out tonight.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,075
- Damien's got me working late.
- Really?

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,357
There's been a misprint on the
cover of one of the new issues.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,032
- 'Which one?'
- Total Cult.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,511
- Well, 0K. Fine, fine.
- 'We can do it another night.'

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,431
We can do it next week.

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,158
How do you mean, do it?

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,390
You'll find out next week.

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,118
OK.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,838
Bye, Bisley.

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,353
Bye.

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,269
I can't believe she's
sleeping with her boss!

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,874
- You what?
- This is how it starts.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,394
It's excuses!
0h, I've got to work late.

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,711
A presentation, I've got to speak
to the New York office,

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,313
they're five hours behind.

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,870
I can't come round because
I've had ever such a long day.

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,236
It's me and Sarah.
It's Milly and Egg.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,878
It's textbook. 0w.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,393
What'd you do that for?

80
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,996
Well, you said to me that every time
you suffered emotional paranoia

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
as a result of your break-up
with Sarah,

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,912
I was to slap you round the face.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,355
Yes, I did say that. Thank you.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,829
We could go out.

85
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,592
What, you and me?

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,511
Yeah.

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,431
What about your stew?

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,875
It's finished.
I've just got to let it simmer.

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,030
I don't know, Daisy.

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,793
Come on, it'd be fun.

91
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,199
What else are you gonna do?

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,598
0K, then.

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,757
Great.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,070
- Who is it?
- Brian.

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,434
Do you wanna come in?

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,352
Thought you were going out.

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,910
Twist's in a mood.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,560
0oh, what a surprise.
An unreliable girlfriend.

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,313
- What's the matter with her?
- I don't know.

100
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,518
- She didn't really specify.
- That's right. You've got to guess.

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,512
Must be strange being a woman.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,512
- All that power.
- You what?

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,673
They are the true creators,

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,991
because all men do is destroy things.

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,433
Yeah.

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,832
They are the true children of nature.
Gaia's foot soldiers.

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,388
- They look like us.
- Speak for yourself.

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,435
Two arms, two legs.

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,078
Two faces.

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,196
There's so much more
to it than that.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,635
If a group of women
spend enough time together,

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,598
their menstrual cycles synchronise.

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,989
- Men have got that, too.
- Mike.

114
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,117
No, no. Men have got
an unspoken telepathy.

115
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,714
A biological connection
between male psyches.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,712
Whether they know each other
or not, put a group together,

117
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,870
- always the same.
- What d'you mean?

118
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,359
Shall we show him?

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,032
Mike, I really am not...

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,951
- 0ooooh.
- 0h, shit.

121
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,155
- Boom.
- Phuuuuuu.

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,676
Tits.

123
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,637
- Bang.
- Prrrrrrrrrrrr.

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,515
Trrrr.

125
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,238
Phat phat.

126
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,276
Phat.

127
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,998
- Brrrrrrrrr.
- Brrrrrrrrrr.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,235
Trrrrrrrrr.

129
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,639
- You ready?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,076
- Manoeuvres tonight?
- Reconnaissance.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,071
- Tanks?
- Tim, I've learnt me lesson.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,993
- 0h, yeah?
- I'm not gonna steal another tank.

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,957
- Right.
- What time are you going?

134
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,234
2100 hours.

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,833
- That's 9 o'clock.
- Right.

136
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,514
Would you mind taking Colin
for a walk about eight?

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,079
Hmm?

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,196
- 2000 hours.
- 0h, yeah.

139
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,316
- Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,669
That's never happened to me before.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,870
- Minicab?
- No, thanks.

142
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,669
Look after my stuff. You're less
likely to get searched than I am.

143
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,796
- Why?
- You look like a teacher.

144
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,189
- That's enough of that.
- Sorry, miss.

145
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,599
- What's the plan?
- Right.

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,272
'We get the Tube into Soho

147
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,749
'and go for drinks
in a fashionable gay bar,

148
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,400

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,116

'and talk about life until it's

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,911
- What d'you think?
- I'm gonna go home.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,319
What do you wanna do?

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,675
Right, we get
the Tube into Camden and head

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,354
for the nearest
bog-standard indie bar.

157

164
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,238
I like my idea better.

165
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,073
- You would.
- It's more interesting.

166
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,991
- Toss a coin?
- 0K.

167
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,634
Two pints of cider.

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,551
- And crisps.
- Crisps as well.

169
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,119
- Two packets.
- Two packets.

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,428
- And nuts.
- Nuts.

171
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,829
- Honey roast.
- I'm ordering the drinks.

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,229
I can't remember what I was
gonna say. Fuck it.

173
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,675
- Two tequila slammers, please.
- Yes!

174
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,559
It's ups and downs.

175
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,790
Like when you're travelling.

176
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,316
More than normal.
Not more ups and downs.

177
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,515
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

178
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,672
What did you wanna be
when you were a kid?

179
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,829
- Monkey.
- A Monkee.

180
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,875
No, Monkey.

181
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,359
- Monkey.
- Yeah, Monkey.

182
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,434
It was great.

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,238
- What did you wanna be?
- Elvis.

184
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,799
That's stupid, he's a bloke.

185
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,235
# I don't wanna be a tiger

186
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,470
# Cos tigers play too rough #

187
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,516
Go on.

188
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,669
Woo.

189
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,038
There's a good little fellow.

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,270
Right, off to enjoy
a night of running round

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,713
in the dark with a gun.

192
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,268
You've got to stay and be good
for Uncle Michael.

193
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,069
Settle down, relax and get comfy
because you, my friend...

194
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,037
are going nowhere.

195
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,230
0h, bollocks.

196
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,835
Colin! Colin.

197
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,753
Colin! Colin!

198
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,911
Colin. Colin!

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,319
Coliiiiiiiin!

200
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,399
I'm glad we decided
to stay in, Twist.

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,835
It's so nice here.

202
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,478
Just you and me together.

203
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,676
Been naughty.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,877
- Naughty?
- I've lost Colin.

205
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,598
- How?
- He ran off.

206
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,591
- 0h.
- Brian, we've got to find him.

207
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,830
- Probably come back.
- What if he doesn't?

208
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,070
I've learnt one thing
from the military,

209
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,151
- never leave a man behind.
- He's a dog.

210
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,993
- 0r a dog.
- 0K.

211
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,149
Bye, Twist.

212
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,238
- Sophie seems very nice.
- Yeah, she's cool.

213
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,514
Cool, yeah.

214
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,272
She's quite quiet.

215
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,828
You're joking.
She talks more than you do.

216
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,558
- Really?
- Yeah.

217
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,950
And she's very funny as well.
She really makes me laugh.

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,919
0h well, I'm glad for you.
Really glad. Glad.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,513
- What about you?
- Glad.

220
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,353
You got someone special?

221
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,158
No, I think I put men off.

222
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,435
- No.
- No, I do. Trust me.

223
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,518
Hey, come on. Pull my finger!

224
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,799
Look, you're a beautiful,
talented woman.

225
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,872
I'm gonna go to the toilet.
I bet when I come back

226
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,996
some bloke'll be chatting you up.

227
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,313
You having a good night?

228
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,469
What?

229
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,232
Are you having a good night?

230
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,995
Yeah. You?

231
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,150
0h, yes.

232
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,754
Listen, you don't know
where I could get me hands

233
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,877
- on some puff?
- Er, not at the moment.

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,669
- Have you got any?
- A couple of spliffs' worth.

235
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,193
Can I buy it off you?

236
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,192
No, no. It's for me and my dog.

237
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,193
D'you remember
the Kia-0ra advert with...

238
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,238
# It's too orangey for crows #

239
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,677
- Brilliant.
- What are you talking about?

240
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,671
You remember that.

241
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,352
No.

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,356
Hi, Dom.
This is Duane Benzie.

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,839
'This is Duane Benzie.'

244
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,118
Tim, hi. I didn't expect
to see you here.

245
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,758
You stole my girlfriend.

246
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,995
- 0h, Tim. This is...
- Duane.

247
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,312
Tim, hi.

248
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,517
This isn't the kind of place
I'd expect to find you.

249
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,832
Funny. It's exactly the sort of
place I'd expect to see you.

250
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,399
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,994
- You work it out.
- All right, then.

252
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,834
You're Duane. The Duane Duane.

253
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,319
Duane Benzie.

254
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,868
The Duane Benzie that...

255
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,678
Stole my girlfriend.

256
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,196
Well, that depends on
which way you look at it.

257
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,236
I think Tim looks at it that way.

258
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,719
Yes, I do.

259
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,759
So, Tim. How have you been?
Haven't seen you since...

260
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,672
Yeah, well. No hard feelings, eh?

261
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,830
You shot me in the bollocks, Tim.

262
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,390
Like I said, no hard feelings.

263
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,710
You're lucky I didn't sue.

264
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,112
- Why didn't you?
- I'm not a monster, Tim.

265
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,352
Besides, I know you don't have
much in the way of assets.

266
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,237
I...heard you got back
together with Sarah.

267
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,038
She came to her senses.

268
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,269
She not out tonight?

269
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,430
- No, she's...
- Working late?

270
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,557
- A presentation.
- Putting in overtime?

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,677
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You work it out.

272
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,351
Daisy, we're leaving.

273
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,950
Well, nice to meet you, Daisy.

274
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,474
Yeah, yeah. Pull my finger.

275
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,999
Daisy.

276
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,594
At last I will emerge as the victor.

277
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,319
At last I will have revenge.

278
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,479
- Minicab?
- No thanks.

279
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,074
I'm glad we got out
of there when we did.

280
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,232
That could have got
a little bit nasty.

281
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,753
How about that spliff?

282
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,637
I told you, we're not selling.

283
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,631
- We're not buying.
- You what?

284
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,631
Blondie's got something for me,

285
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,075
- ain't you?
- No.

286
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,075
Yes.
Daisy, give 'em the stuff.

287
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
- They're only about 12.
- Look at them.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,433
Woo, mama!

289
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,398
Just what
I've been looking for.

290
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,878
- I cannot believe this.
- Tim.

291
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,077
- I got mugged by the Red Hand Gang.
- Come on.

292
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,674
And my girlfriend's
sleeping with her boss.

293
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,436
She's not sleeping with her boss.
Besides, what if she is?

294
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,751
Sometimes it pays to be single.
Look at Marsha.

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,638
- You know what she told me?
- What?

296
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,553
I was gonna be
an 0lympic athlete, you know.

297
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,517
What's that got
to do with anything?

298
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,715
I'll tell you.

299
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,392
I was a sprinter. A fast one.

300
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,789
Why d'you think
I've got such ace pins?

301
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,189
They're me souvenirs.

302
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,272
Fork-lightning Klein, they called me.

303
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,430
I was all set for stardom.

304
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,636
Sailed through the districts in '67.

305
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,199
Walked the nationals,

306
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,877
all set to wow the 0lympic Selection
Committee when suddenly, bang.

307
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,839
- You got shot?
- Might as well have done.

308
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,798
I was coming back
from training one night,

309
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,713
when suddenly this Mini Cooper
comes out of nowhere

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,153
and knocks me off my bike.

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,834
Next thing I know,
I'm sprawled on the pavement

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,593
with this pillock in tight
trousers standing over me

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,797
saying, "0h, sorry love, didn't
see you, I was going too fast.

314
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,871
"I was drunk."

315
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,349
He gives me his bottle
of Jack Daniel's.

316
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,396
"I don't drink," I said.

317
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,153
"0h, go on, love,
it'll help with the pain."

318
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,318
He was not wrong.

319
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,595
My God.

320
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,831
Fractured me tibia,
fell behind on me training,

321
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,876
eventually lost interest.

322
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,916
What happened to the pillock?

323
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,958
I married him in '69.

324
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,474
I often wonder
what would have happened

325
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,710
if I hadn't been knocked off my bike.

326
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,155
Where would I be now?

327
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,991
'Thanks, Des.

328
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,311
'Coming up, the latest from
the Five Nations at Twickenham

329
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,709
'and a report
from the Davis Cup. Tim.'

330
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,553
Thanks. I'm being stupid, I know.

331
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,438
I'm paranoid. I've been hurt.

332
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,159
I keep thinking about
what happened with Sarah.

333
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,071
That is in the history.

334
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,628
Yeah? That's past.
Stop thinking about Sarah.

335
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,598
Well, I don't.
I don't think about her, really.

336
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,638
I don't miss her. I don't think
what it would have been like

337
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,280
to get married, move into
a nice house in Highgate,

338
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,113
have a couple of kids
and a surround-sound TV.

339
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,237
I don't think about that.
And a studio.

340
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,833
- Thanks.
- You're a winner.

341
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,798
Sod the grass.
You've got good friends.

342
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,952
You've got a good job
and you've got a foxy lady.

343
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,349
I'm the luckiest man in town.

344
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,391
Have a nice night, Tim.

345
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,593
Get on that.

346
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,113
This isn't grass.

347
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,475
- What?
- It's oregano.

348
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,238
How can you tell?

349
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,958
I'm a catering student.

350
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,679
Get the car.

351
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,229
Can you make your way out now,
please?

352
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,073
We should do this more often.

353
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,469
We could have a blowout
for your birthday.

354
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,915
That'd be cool. Hey, here's a plan.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,753
We go home, we watch some telly
and we eat some stew.

356
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,910
Now that's a plan I like.

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,718
- Have you got your keys?
- No.

358
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,995
Shit, I've left mine
in the other pub.

359
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
It'll be closing in five minutes.

360
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,191
What?

361
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,872
You know what.

362
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,675
He who laughs last, laughs longest.

363
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,993
What do you think we should do?

364
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,796
Let 'em have it.

365
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,757
0oooh!

366
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,670
Noooooo...

367
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,832
Tim, let's go!

368
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,073
- Minicab?
- Yes, please.

369
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,151
Step on it!

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,955
Come on!

371
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,358
You bloody idiot.

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,749
Have you any idea
how much this car cost?

373
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,116
Why don't you piss off back
to Romford where you belong?

374
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,156
You little prick.

375
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,992
Eh? Eh?

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,591
Clever boys.

377
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,154
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

378
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,069
Thanks, bye.

379
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,276
I can't believe
you said "step on it".

380
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,396
- Why?
- I wanted to say it.

381
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,708
D'you think we'll have to
wait here all night?

382
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,199
No.

383
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,275
I'm cold.

384
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,828
Do you know what
I was saying earlier on?

385
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,239
About what?

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,912
About being single and that.

387
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,876
I think the thing is just
not to go looking for it, you know?

388
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,952
I think things happen
when you least expect 'em to.

389
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,116
Yeah?

390
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,270
Yeah.

391
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,873
- Isn't that your dog?
- Aren't those your keys?

392
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,109
Yeah!

393
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,839
I must have had 'em all along.

394
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,592
Come on.

395
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,156
Have you two been taking Colin
out for a midnight stroll?

396
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,515
Yes.

397
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,559
- Didn't you do reconnaissance?
- Um, sort of.

398
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,870
Come on, you're
just in time for stew.

399
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,949
Come on, chop chop.

400
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,075
That was a great stew, Daisy.

401
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,072
Think I'll make another one.
