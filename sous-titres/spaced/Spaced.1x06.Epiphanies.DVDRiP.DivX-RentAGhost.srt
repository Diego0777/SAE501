The TA is no game, Tim.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,989
It isn't the TA, Mike, it's the Rough Ramblers.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,999
You're a civilian, you don't understand. You're
thinking "It's Sunday, I'd rather be in bed."

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,395
<i>And you're thinking "It's Sunday,
I'd rather be in Apocalypse Now, "</i>

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,310
That's easy for you to say.
What are you doing later on ?

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,716
- It's classified.
- Why don't you come round ? I'm bored.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,830
I can't - combat canoeing.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,350
I'm learning to Eskimo roll with a two-stone
rucksack on my back, holding a loaded rifle.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,039
They don't have rifles
in the Rough Ramblers, Mike.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,672
- Hand grenades ?
- No.

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,438
- Anthrax ?
- Mike !

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,235
Listen, Tim, gotta go. Looks like we're
moving out. Roger Bravo Tango Alpha.

27

Come on, Mike.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,310
Yay ! Danny Kendall's about to die.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,710
You're right, that is better than
when Jeremy went into the swimming pool

<i>Tim, Bronson's got to pay,
He's got a toupee,</i>

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,633
Can I bring the bike in ? Your landlady's
got the look of a bike thief about her.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,752
What, ageing female divorcee ? What's
she gonna do, sell it to buy Jacob's Creek ?

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,112
Don't get sarky, that bike's my living. Not like
you pretending to be a struggling cartoonist,

37

poncing off the state while decent taxpayers
like me fund your drink problem.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,833
I wouldn't mind so much,
but you seem to be having such a shit time.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,873
Anyway, I was just coming back from a club,
right, passed your gaff and I remembered -

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,911
you owe me 20 quid.

41

he bikes my drawings round for me.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,319

he had more than one friend,

- What, hand ? I don't...

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,595
Are youse two an item ?

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,359
No ! No.That's... No. Well...

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,517
No, Daisy's not like that.
That's funny, that's actually funny.

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,439
- No, we're just mates, aren't we ? Chums.
- Get off me !

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,790
Oh, I see, youse are er... "friends".

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,678
Did you want a cup of tea, Tyres ?

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,438
I couldn't eat a thing,
my stomach's like a walnut.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,710
- Can't you even have tea ?
- No, no solids.

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,672
- Something orange ?
- Er, water ?

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,790
Water ? OK.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,391
Hello ? What, already ?

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,791
All right. I'll see you later.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,518
- Who was that ?
- It was Mike.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,519
He just nearly drowned doing an Eskimo roll.
He put too many pebbles in his rucksack.

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,676
<i>Last time I seen Mike he was on Crimewatch,</i>

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,633
No, that was a case of mistaken identity.
Police had his house surrounded last week.

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,593
- No, this was about two months ago.
- Oh, yeah, that was him.

63
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,993
What did you do last night ?

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,397
Last night ? Last night was A1,
tip-top, clubbing jam fair.

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,399
It was a sandwich of fun on ecstasy bread,
wrapped up in a bag like disco fudge.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,309
<i>Doesn't get much better than that. I just wish
I could control these fucking mood swings !</i>

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,955
<i>So what did youse two friends do last night ?</i>

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,272
Oh, we just stayed in, didn't we ?
Had a laugh, played Scrabble.

- It's a nonsense invented word.

You can't have Pantene Pro V !

It's the ingredient in the shampoo
that makes the hair silky and smooth !

78

It's a word they made up
to make shampoo sound important !

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,076
You're so naive. I cannot believe...

80
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,076
It probably isn't a word !

103

- Tyres has got a really short attention span.

I think we should ask Brian to come.

I don't really see Brian throwing
shapes in the church of dance, do you ?

110
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,112
Well, he might if we ask Twist to come.

111
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,596
- Brian and Twist ?
- Yeah ! Get with the programme !

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,359

- Urgh.

He was funny, wasn't he ?

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,554
What did you mean
when you said "Daisy's not like that" ?

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,272
- I never said that.
- You did.

116
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,551
He said "Are you two... ?"
and you said "No, Daisy's not like that."

117
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,910
- I just wondered what you meant.
- I just meant... I meant you're not like that.

118
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,554
I don't see you in that way.

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,036
- What am I ? Chopped liver ?
- I wish !

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,635
You're too hung up on your ex-girlfriend to
even notice the existence of another woman.

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,671
Who said that ? !

122
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,508
No, I'm serious. I'm serious,
I think you've got a big problem.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,677
Shut up ! You don't know anything
about my problems !

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,030
Yes, I do. Half a bottle of Galliano
and that's all you talk about.

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,311
- Bloody Galliano.
- No, it's an obsession, Tim, it's unhealthy.

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,430
I heard you call her name out in your sleep
the other night.

127
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,595
How did you know I was asleep ?

128
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,871
Why would you call her name out
if you were awake ?

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,959
All I'm saying is I think you've got
a V big problem with your ex-G-friend.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,231
Just back off, will you ?
What do you care about what I do, anyway ?

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,397
All right ! I was just making an observation.

132
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,149
Yeah, well, don't, all right ?
You don't know what you're talking about.

133
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,597
- Sorry !
- It's all right.

134
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,714
You gonna ask Brian if he wants to come out ?

135
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,751
Yes !

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,189
- Are you gonna sulk all day ?
- No !

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
Can't come out.

138
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,713
We're going to a club later.
Do you want to come ?

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,389
- I don't go to clubs.
- What do you mean, you don't go to clubs ?

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,310
I'm working, Tim. Working.
Do you understand ?

141
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,792
No, sorry. Got me there.

142

Wow. Right.

146
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,996
- I'm using my penis.
- Finally !

147
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,792
Do you want to see ?

148
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,712
No, I'm just about to have my tea.
Why don't you come out ? It'll be good for you.

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,751
No, it won't.

150

152
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,791
Can't.

154
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,999
- It's a no.
- Shh !

that's all you care about.

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,476
That'll be Marsha.

163
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,158
No !

164
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,315
- Hi, Marsha.
- Hello.

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,917
Sorry about the noise. Periods, you know.

166
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,350
- Her dad left.
- I thought he left when she was two.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,153
Yeah, yeah. She is milking it slightly.

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,036
- So do you want a tea ?
- No, no, I won't intrude.

169
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,753
Yeah, all right, then, I'll have a small one.

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,950
One small tea.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,154
It's difficult, isn't it ? Me and my mum
used to row all the time.

172
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,036
I'll worry about you
if you stay out later than ten.

173
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,392
- Try to think about my feelings.
- Oh, all right.

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,077
- Bye, Mum. Love you.
- Bye, dumpling. Love you too.

175
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,798
Oh, yeah ! She used to go ballistic.

176
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,550
She'd say "You're not going out"
and I'd say "Yes, I am."

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,751
It was a nightmare.
She was just so unreasonable.

178
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,395
- For God's sake, she was worried about you.
- No, she wasn't.

179
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,399
She was scared to face a life without me
so she tried to stop me from growing.

180
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,637
That is so self-obsessed,
as if everything revolved around you.

181
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,958
She probably looked forward to you going
but wanted to show she cared about you.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,276
If she'd wanted to do that,
she could have bought me that pony.

183
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,869
That's what it boils down to with you -
money, money, money. It's all you care about.

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,356
- What do you know about what I care about ?
- More than you think, young lady.

185
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,391
Oh, leave me alone !

186
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,071
You got any biscuits ?

187
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,679
How is she ?

188
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,474
The fibreglass on the outer casing
was severely damaged in the incident.

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,631
- What happened ?
- Showing off, Tim.

190
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,355
I had fifteen rocks in my rucksack
instead of the regulation five.

191
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,472
I knew something was wrong when I got her
in the water. She was sitting so low.

192
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,238
So low.

193
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,068
But I didn't stop, Tim. Fifteen rocks
in my rucksack and everyone knew it.

194
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,111
So what happened when you rolled ?

195
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,674
I lost control of the vessel
two feet from the shore.

196
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,029
As I struggled to right her,
I banged into the jetty,

197
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,150
damaging the canoe's carcass.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,955
The ramble leader had to dive in
and rescue me from beneath the canoe.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,355
So it wasn't so much an Eskimo roll,

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,358
<i>it was more a case of rolling right Inuit !</i>

201
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,875
Inuit's another word for Eskimo.

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,233
I've been thrown out, Tim. The
Rough Ramblers don't want me any more.

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,475
Come on, come on. Come on.

204
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,717
I've gotta face it, Tim.
I'm not the big man, not the leader.

205
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,230
No-one's ever gonna look up to me.
I feel like a failure.

206
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,919
You're not a failure, Mike, you're not.

207
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,793
You're too good for them.
They're not ready for you.

208
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,718
You're a renegade, you're a soldier of fortune.

209
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,150
- Yeah, like the A-Team.
- Yeah, you're like Mr T but white and hairy.

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,272
- I am, aren't I ?
- I feel sorry for anybody who says you're not.

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,912
<i>- I pity the fool.
- I pity the fool.</i>

212
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,599
- "I ain't going on no plane, sucker."
- Stop that.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,915
- I'll never be in the real army, though, will I ?
- No.

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,951
- Cos of what happened.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,276
I know, Mike, and I'm sorry,
but this was a long time ago.

216
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,515
I haven't let you down since, have I ?

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,152
No.

218
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,755
- And I never will.
- I know.

219
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,711
Come 'ere, you big twat.

220
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,677
- Ahem ! Excuse me.
- Just a second.

221
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,511
OK.

222
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,710
Mike !

223
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,159
- Cheap Dutch lager for the lady ?
- No, thanks.

224
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,634
- Oh, thanks( !)
- I'm on a special diet. I have to eat like a bird.

225
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,671
What, like this ?

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,390
- Where's Brian ?
- Yeah, Tim, where's Brian ?

227
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,033
- Up his own arse.
- You don't like him ?

228
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,036
I do like him, I'm just not sure why.

229
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,911
How are you, Mike ?

230
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,431
- Yep.
- That's a well-fitted body warmer, Mike.

231
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,118
It's a life jacket.

232
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,390
- Have you been yachting ?
- I've been all-terrain rambling.

233
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,752
Kind of off-road rambling.
Comes in all forms of outdoor pursuits -

234
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,273
walking, canoeing, killing.

235
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,357
- Killing ?
- No, no. No killing.

236
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,559
- Maybe you should take the jacket off now.
- He will when he's ready.

237
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,910
- Coming out tonight, Mike ?
- I don't know. I don't really go out much.

238
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,158
- I haven't got anything to wear.
- Come on, Mike. Come on ! Let's all go out.

239
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,149
Let's get dressed up and go out.
We'll be like a gang. Like a group.

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,589
Like an army. Yeah.

241
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,160
- Try this.
- Hey, is this mine ?

242
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,794
- That's mine !
- I let you borrow my clothes.

243
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Why would I want to borrow your clothes ?

244
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,951
Oh, you look fantastic !

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,991
- Too tight ?
- No !

246
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,635
It does look really good. Maybe you could
tie something round your waist...

247
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,750
if you feel a bit self-conscious.

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,519
- The style's a bit feminine, isn't it ?
- No !

249
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,678
Of course it's too feminine, it's a girl's top !
Get away from him.

250
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,269
Mike, don't let them dress you up
like a giant cock.

251
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,276
I had to dress up
as an elderly Israeli woman once.

252
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,595
<i>- Did you ?
- I didn't have to.</i>

253
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,596
We should talk.

254
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,638
Is this too much ?

255
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,478
- Yes.
- No !

256
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,231
Oh, hi, Bri.

257
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,991
- Can I use your video while you're out ?
- What are you gonna do ?

258
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,511
Stick it to canvas as part of a piece depicting
a society populated by cathode junkies

259
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,395
selling their imagination for quick-fix
media hits from the Blockbuster syringe ?

260
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,556
<i>No, I want to record Ready Steady Cook,</i>

261
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,437
OK.

262
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,994
- You're sure you don't want to come out ?
- No, I don't go to clubs.

263
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,474
- Oh, why ?
- Erm...

264
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,791
- Just don't.

265
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,910
Get that, will you, Mike ?

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,312
So, er... packed the party bag ?

267
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,434
Yes, two fresh jumpers, two fresh T-shirts,
two woolly hats, all right ?

268
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,472
You saved any small countries
from tyranny recently ?

269
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,034
- No.
- I like a soldier that minds his own business.

270
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,709
Wahey ! Oh, you lucky people !

271
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,320
- Who's this ?
- It's Brian. He's not coming.

272
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,033
- Why are you not coming ?
- Well... Yeah, why aren't you coming ?

273
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,039
Why aren't you coming, Brian ?
It won't be the same without you. Please !

274
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,749
I don't go clubbing !

275
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,950
Hello, everyone.

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,195
- Oh, hi, Marsha.
- Hi, Marsha.

277
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,310
You all going out ?

278
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,316
Yeah, except Brian.

279
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,238
Looks like it's just you and me, then, Brian.

280
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,954
- I'm gonna put my coat in the cloakroom.
- Yeah, take mine, will you, Daisy ?

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,913
- Take mine, too.
- There's no point us both queuing, is there ?

282
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,116
Thanks very much, little lady.

283
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,115
- Who wrote the music ?
- What ?

284
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,469
- Who wrote the music ?
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

285
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,670
What ?

286
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,711
I've got to dance !

287
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,835
Let's weave !

288
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,717
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about earlier on,
snapping at you.

289
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,637
I was so out of order. I'm really sorry.

290
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,272
No !

291
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,993
No, it's fine. It was fine. It's good.

292
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,871
- Is it ?
- Yeah, we're on another level.

293
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,390
Yeah, we are, cos we can snap at each other
and it doesn't matter

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,908
and it's not a problem, it's not an issue,
you know what I mean ?

295
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,951
It's beneath us, yeah.

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,913
Yeah, cos I like you, I do.
I just like living with you, it's fun.

297
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,475
You know, you're so talented,
you're gonna do so well.

298
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,318
<i>You are. You are. No, you are.</i>

299
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,669
<i>- You're so good.
- No.</i>

300
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,756
<i>- You're such a good artist.
- Am I ?</i>

301
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,314
- You are ! You're so good.
- I am.

302
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,238
You're gonna be fine,
we're both gonna be fine, gonna do well.

303
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,397
We're gonna do so well and when we do,
we'll get a big house in Hampstead

304
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,477
and we'll get a room in the house
and have our own club.

305
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,273
Have a club and we'll get all our friends in.

306
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,869
We'll be like the King and Queen of Clubland,
you and me.

307
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,911
Yeah, you and me.

308
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,632
Yaaay ! Ah-ha-ha !

309
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,875
Terribly sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

310
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,959
<i>I was just wondering if you two friends
would like to come and join the collective.</i>

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,234
- I'm sorry I left you in the queue.
- I had a great time. Where's Mike ?

312
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,475
- Where's Mike ?
- Where's Mike ?

313
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,919
He's over there.
