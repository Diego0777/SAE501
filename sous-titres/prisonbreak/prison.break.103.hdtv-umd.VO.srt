1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,642
Oh, my God. Williamson, get in here.

2
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:19,937
What the hell happened here?

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,271
An accident.

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,691
Here... gotta get him to the infirmary. Come on.

5
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:32,616
Get out.

6
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,288
I thought you said you were gonna have a conversation with him.

7
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,290
Yeah, I did.

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,878
Things, uh, escalated.

9
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,012
Bring him on into Three. Cathy, I'm gonna need 10cc's of Xylocaine.

10
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,937
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here.

11
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,851
I said thank you, I'll take it from here.

12
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,068
Let's go.

13
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,825
Okay... let's take a look at you.

14
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,036
You're okay... You're okay...

15
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,170
What happened?

16
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,088
Uh, nothing.

17
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,924
This isn't nothing, Michael. I need you to tell me what happened.

18
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,926
Don't make me lie to you.

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,888
Please.

20
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,522
I think you better have I.A. start an investigation.

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,858
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

22
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,527
Uh, perhaps you'd be good enough to enlighten me?

23
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,488
There was a pair of gardening shears left on the floor of the shed.

24
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,324
Evidently, he stepped on them.

25
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,451
Blade went right through his boot, huh?

26
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,410
Yep.

27
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,455
So, uh, why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

28
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,916
Like I said, Doc...

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,293
we got it taken care of.

30
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,170
Let's go.

31
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,081
I'm going to kill that scum.

32
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,750
You won't. You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here.

33
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,960
Look what he did to you--

34
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,380
you're not going to last a second in this place unless I do something about it.

35
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,799
You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:54,967
Yeah.

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,678
They operate flights from small airfields across the Midwest,

38
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,013
like the one ten miles from here.

39
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,975
They're run by a shell corporation Abruzzi owns.

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,809
We get him on board,

41
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,979
there's gonna be a midnight flight waiting for us the night we get outside those walls.

42
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,524
You're willing to risk the entire escape on a guy you don't even know?

43
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,985
Preparation can only take you so far.

44
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,946
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith.

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,075
Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith, Michael.

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,785
I'm not talking about Abruzzi.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,829
There's someone else who holds the key to this entire thing.

48
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,123
With him, it either works or it doesn't.

49
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,544
Problem is, I couldn't know who that was until I got in here.

50
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,299
Sucre? You can't be serious.

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,094
The guy's a thief, Michael; he can't be trusted.

52
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,846
Gonna have to trust him,

53
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,431
because he's my cell mate.

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,100
How well do you know him?

55
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,352
About as well as a man can in a week.

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,190
You tell him, he tells everyone, we're done.

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,524
You know that, right?

58
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,776
We don't get him on board, there's not going to be any digging in that cell,

59
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,154
and if there's no digging in that cell...

60
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,572
then there's no escape.

61
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,681
Thank you for calling, please leave a message after the tone.

62
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,019
Maricruz? It's me, baby. You there?

63
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,355
Pick up if you're there, mami.

64
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,731
I been in the SHU.

65
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,942
I been thinking about you.

66
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,819
About your body...

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,405
God, I've been thinking about your body...

68
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,490
Hello?

69
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,408
Uh, Mrs. Delgado....

70
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:01,745
Hi. How you doing? It's me, Fernando.

71
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:05,457
Um, sorry to bother you at home, but, uh,

72
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,459
you know what's up with Maricruz's cell phone?

73
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,127
It just keeps going straight to voice mail.

74
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,171
Maybe she has it turned off.

75
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,007
Any chance you know where she is?

76
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,510
I know exactly where she is.

77
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,095
And that would be?

78
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,972
- With Hector.
- Hector?

79
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,640
That's right.

80
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,225
They're at the mall, I think.

81
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,643
I don't suppose, next time you see her,

82
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,770
you could have her turn her phone back on?

83
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,815
Mrs. Delgado, I know you don't like me,

84
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,067
but I love your daughter and she loves me.

85
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,278
We're going to get married, you know?

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,156
If you were a decent man and you really loved her,

87
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,492
you'd let her live her life.

88
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:43,245
What's that supposed to mean?

89
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:44,955
I'll tell her you called.

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,776
I'm looking to do some damage.

91
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,486
Well, you come to the right place.

92
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,613
I want to do it slow.

93
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,949
Inflict the maximum amount of pain,

94
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:05,035
so a guy wishes he'd just die, you know, and get it over with,

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,162
but just can't quite get there.

96
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,538
Oh, I got that.

97
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:11,416
I got that.

98
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,089
Look at this right here, boss.

99
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,262
I call it "the gutter."

100
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,430
Jam it up there in the stomach,

101
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,057
and  these bits right here hook the intestines.

102
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,101
You give it a pull back,

103
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:32,104
poor sucker's guts are hanging right out of his stomach,

104
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,191
and he'll get a real good look at 'em, 'cause the wound's not fatal.

105
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,653
Well, least not until the infection sets in.

106
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:48,203
You're one sick puppy, you know that?

107
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:50,706
Thank you.

108
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,393
What happened?

109
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:12,853
I'm  okay.

110
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,986
They've gotten to you, haven't they?

111
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:22,946
The other prisoners.

112
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,116
My God, Michael, this place is going to kill you.

113
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:29,286
You said you talked to a woman. What was her name?

114
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:32,414
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

115
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:33,415
How'd you know?

116
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:36,084
A year ago, I was doing exactly what you're doing.

117
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,378
Trying to find out the truth.

118
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,756
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

119
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,090
They designed it that way,

120
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:45,218
so that, by the time you got to the bottom of it, Lincoln would be dead.

121
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,012
Why didn't you tell me you were doing this?

122
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,639
Once the day was set,

123
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,016
once that final appeal had been rejected,

124
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,143
he had 60 days to live.

125
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,814
Figured I could play their game and watch him die in the process,

126
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,900
or I could take matters into my own hands.

127
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,777
You don't have to do that.

128
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,237
Leticia knows something.

129
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:06,657
If I can get it out of her, maybe we can re-open Lincoln's case.

130
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,325
What'd she tell you?

131
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,037
She said that somebody else was behind the killing of the Vice President's brother.

132
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,746
Who?

133
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:16,124
She got spooked, she took off before I could get anything out of her.

134
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:19,753
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields Projects.

135
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,338
I'm going to go see her this afternoon.

136
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,383
Place is dangerous. You should take someone with you.

137
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,217
Who?

138
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:27,594
Fiancé would be a good place to start.

139
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:32,182
I think that's probably the last thing in the world Sebastian'd ever want to do.

140
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,935
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

141
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,904
No priors, a good student.

142
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,323
Then you get yourself arrested for intent to sell.

143
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:51,118
Good life get a little boring?

144
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,411
It was stupid.

145
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,708
It won't happen again.

146
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,705
Well, we're all here to make sure of that.

147
00:09:57,374 --> 00:10:00,377
I took some time to speak to your mother before you came in.

148
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,296
She told me that there were some...

149
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,964
some extenuating circumstances in your life right now.

150
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,882
Yeah, if you're talking about that guy at Fox River,

151
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,509
he's got nothing to do with this.

152
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,469
He refuses to call him his father.

153
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,597
The world would be a better place without him.

154
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:14,808
It's clear to me you've got a lot of anger, young man.

155
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:17,686
Misdirected, it could land you in the wrong place.

156
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,063
So, to make sure that doesn't happen,

157
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,024
you're gonna have to check in with me once a week.

158
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,817
Fridays, one hour.

159
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,987
Your attendance at school and your grades need to be pristine.

160
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,779
Absolutely.

161
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:29,197
And to give you a real good idea

162
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,950
where  that anger of yours will get you if you don't rein it in,

163
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,870
I'm signing you up for the Scared Straight program at Fox River.

164
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,414
You'll have a mentor, who you'll work with weekly,

165
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,041
to give you a little perspective.

166
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,167
A mentor?

167
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,086
Your father.

168
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,694
Tell me that ain't what I think it is.

169
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,489
It ain't what you think it is.

170
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,158
Fish. A cell phone in here?

171
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,160
That's cardinal sin number one.

172
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,537
They can tack two years onto your bid, automatic.

173
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:18,956
If they catch you.

174
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,792
Man, you know what kind of trouble I can get, for just knowing what I know?

175
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,710
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

176
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,924
Now, that means you can make calls whenever you want, right?

177
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:35,347
I don't like the look in your eye.

178
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:38,517
What's in there-- you never saw it. Got it?

179
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,568
Why didn't you include any names?

180
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:49,987
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

181
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,906
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

182
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:55,826
Some people want to go it alone,

183
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,580
others have grandiose statements they want to make.

184
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:04,918
But most want some member of their family there,

185
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:07,421
before they leave this world.

186
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,592
I'll do it alone.

187
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:14,761
Son, in my opinion,

188
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:18,223
all inmates who have made that choice

189
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,351
have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

190
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:25,439
I'll, uh...

191
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,444
...leave it blank for now.

192
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:32,905
You have less than four weeks now.

193
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:35,198
You should give it some thought.

194
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:58,347
Hi. I'm-I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

195
00:12:58,472 --> 00:12:59,932
Five.

196
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,516
Thank you.

197
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:21,954
Hello!

198
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,547
Don't you move a muscle.

199
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,638
Take it easy, Leticia.

200
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,139
You're working with them, aren't you?

201
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,392
- With who?
- Think I'm stupid, lady?

202
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:45,186
I hear the clicks on my phone, I see the cars out there on the street.

203
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,563
I know you're scared. I am, too.

204
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:51,067
But, please, put the gun down.

205
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,531
Where you going?

206
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:00,201
Ireland. What difference does it make?

207
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:02,620
It makes all the difference. Nobody's ever gotten your testimony.

208
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,664
That's exactly the reason I'm still breathing.

209
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,625
I'm not with them, Leticia. You have to believe me.

210
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,711
Oh, yeah? Then what you sneaking in here for?

211
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,254
I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.

212
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,130
Oh, yeah?

213
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,550
And why do you care so much about my well-being, all of a sudden?

214
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,384
I don't.

215
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,678
Finally, an honest answer.

216
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,722
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

217
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,768
And maybe you can bring down the guys who killed your boyfriend in the process.

218
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:26,811
If somebody killed you,

219
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:28,771
and Crab could have done something to the guys who did it--

220
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,273
you think he would have?

221
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,151
I'm not as strong as he was.

222
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,819
I can't take those people on.

223
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,321
I'll take 'em on.

224
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,992
All you have to do is come to my office and tell me what you know.

225
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,495
I'll type it up, you can sign the affidavit, and split.

226
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,539
I'll take you to the airport myself.

227
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,751
Bellick.

228
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:34,545
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

229
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,465
I want some extra time outside for the next couple weeks.

230
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,760
Paint fumes in P.I. must be getting to you.

231
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,137
Cell phones allowed in here?

232
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,225
Who?

233
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,102
Extra time outside.

234
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,396
A couple cigarettes.

235
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:54,232
Half hour. One week. One cigarette.

236
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,533
Know a con named Sucre?

237
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,337
This is what I don't understand, John:

238
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,215
Otto  Fibonacci fingers you.

239
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,551
He put you in prison for life.

240
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:25,221
Yet, you act like you don't even want to find out where he is.

241
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,724
That's not true, Philly.

242
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:30,518
Maybe it's 'cause you don't think you have anything to lose anymore, you know?

243
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,936
You're already locked up.

244
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,731
You... you know, maybe you, um... maybe you like it here.

245
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:35,982
I mean, I don't know.

246
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,111
But, what I do know is that, if Fibonacci testifies next month,

247
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:42,822
you and I are gonna be neighbors.

248
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,992
And I am not going to let that happen.

249
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:48,578
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

250
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:54,542
Fancy suits, ties, shirts.

251
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:57,962
I think you're right, so, uh...

252
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,173
so, let's cut to the chase.

253
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,342
Did you break this kid?

254
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:04,302
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

255
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:14,562
What is this?

256
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,397
It's a little gift from me to you.

257
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,403
Are these his?

258
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,947
Yeah, he won't crack.

259
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:31,829
Well, perhaps, you should consider using a different methodology then, John.

260
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:36,251
From what I gather, there are far worse threats in prison

261
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,336
other than bodily harm.

262
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,756
What happened to the days when you used to trust me, Philly,

263
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,591
that I would get things done?

264
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,095
Those were the days when you actually did get things done, John.

265
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:57,605
Daddy! Daddy! Did you hear the news?

266
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:01,109
What? What-What news?

267
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,195
We're going to stay with Uncle Philly at the lake for a few weeks.

268
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,030
Yeah. We're gonna have a good time!

269
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,451
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.

270
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,370
I do trust you.

271
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,498
Now, you're gonna take care of that thing, aren't you?

272
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:27,427
How are those boneyard visits going with that girlfriend of yours?

273
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,431
I imagine pretty good, huh?

274
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:41,733
You know, visitation rules stipulate that conjugals are only for married couples.

275
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:42,942
But  we're engaged.

276
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:44,777
Besides, I got that coming to me

277
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:47,405
'cause I ain't caused no static in this place.

278
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:51,826
Please don't dead my conjugals.

279
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,244
I won't.

280
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:55,788
Thank you.

281
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,624
But, in exchange,

282
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,210
you have to tell me where that cell phone is.

283
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,963
Cell phone?

284
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,090
Don't play stupid with me.

285
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,593
I'm giving you a chance to save your precious conjugals.

286
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,928
You lie to me,

287
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,889
they're gone, and they're never coming back.

288
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,393
Now, where's that cell phone?

289
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:47,674
Turner?

290
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:50,802
Your transfer came in. They want you in administration.

291
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,442
He didn't talk.

292
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,788
All I got to say is I better get to make all the calls I want.

293
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,669
Gonna be kind of hard.

294
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:30,633
Soap?

295
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,053
I lost my congugals over soap?!

296
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,181
You may have lost your conjugals, but I can do you one better.

297
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,350
I can get you to her.

298
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,435
To Maricruz.

299
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,186
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

300
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,230
Yeah? And how you gonna do that?

301
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,275
We're breaking out of here.

302
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:49,444
How?

303
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:53,072
- It starts in our cell.
- In our cell?

304
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,203
To tell you the truth, it's already started.

305
00:20:59,287 --> 00:20:59,954
Ah.

306
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,456
Are you crazy?!

307
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,249
You think I want to break out of here?

308
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,293
16 months from now, I'm out the gate.

309
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:06,377
I'm getting married, papi,

310
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,588
and I'm sure as hell not doing it with no posse on my ass.

311
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:11,090
Man, I ought to beat you six ways till Sunday!

312
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,759
I lost my conjugals, pendejo.

313
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,218
and all because of your little bar of soap.

314
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:16,679
I had to test you; see if you could keep a secret.

315
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:17,847
You want a secret?

316
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,641
I got a secret for you, Fish.

317
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:21,517
You dig in my cell while I'm there,

318
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,895
and I'm gonna split your wig.

319
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:33,863
That went well.

320
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,788
Why don't we start with Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend.

321
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,538
Real simple.

322
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:45,166
He owed my man $90,000, and he wasn't getting it done.

323
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,085
Then, all of a sudden, it gets done.

324
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,712
Crab walks in with 90K and a big-ass smile on his face.

325
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:50,630
Who  paid him?

326
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,674
Not Lincoln-- they paid his marker.

327
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,883
Who's "they"?

328
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:56,886
It's all right, Leticia.

329
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,429
I told you, you're safe here.

330
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:03,685
Crab brought this guy home. Never seen him before.

331
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:07,230
Crab did what he always did when he was doing big business:

332
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:10,108
he told me to take a walk, so that's exactly what I did.

333
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,526
There was something about this guy, though--

334
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:14,279
he wasn't the kind of guy Crab usually dealt with.

335
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:15,363
What do you mean?

336
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:18,074
Couldn't put my finger on it till he went outside.

337
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:20,451
Then I knew. He had that look.

338
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:21,452
What look?

339
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:23,663
You know, that they own the place.

340
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:25,498
That they're untouchable.

341
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:27,709
Like they're government.

342
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:30,461
So the government paid Lincoln's debt?

343
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,590
Did Crab say what they wanted in return?

344
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:36,009
Uh-uh.

345
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,176
All right.

346
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,554
Uh, just give me a moment to type this up.

347
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:41,848
Where are you going?

348
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:43,308
I'm gonna have a smoke.

349
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:44,559
Look, this is only gonna take me a minute.

350
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,436
So will the smoke.

351
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:53,234
No redness or swelling, so it's no sign of infection.

352
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,945
I'm gonna keep you on antibiotics for the next ten days.

353
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,822
You should be good.

354
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:01,826
Michael, you understand, by law,

355
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,371
I'm obligated to file a report if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct.

356
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,418
There's no way this injury happened by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

357
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:13,254
If you file a report, things could get a lot worse for me.

358
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:14,881
They're not already?

359
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:16,841
Not compared to what they could be.

360
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,219
I've made some enemies.

361
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,304
Yeah.

362
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,015
Scared?

363
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:28,269
Men... Okay.

364
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:31,397
Um... here's what I think. I think you are scared.

365
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,276
And you wouldn't be human if you weren't scared in a place like this.

366
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,822
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night,

367
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,825
'cause I thought there was a monster in the closet.

368
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,830
But my brother told me there wasn't anything in the closet but fear.

369
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:49,457
That fear wasn't real.

370
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:55,004
He said it wasn't made of anything. It was just air.

371
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:56,297
Not even that.

372
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:59,467
He said you just have to face it.

373
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:00,843
You just have to open that door,

374
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,054
and the monster would disappear.

375
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,682
Your brother sounds like a smart man.

376
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,100
He is.

377
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,686
In here, though,

378
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,229
you face your fear,

379
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:13,356
you open that door...

380
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:15,483
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

381
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,445
And the monsters that are hiding behind them...

382
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:22,073
are all real.

383
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,201
If you want, I could recommend you be sent to Ad-Seg.

384
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:29,122
With the rape victims and the snitches.

385
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,082
It would keep you safe.

386
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:32,792
Thanks...

387
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:35,962
but I think I'd like to face the monsters on my own.

388
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,302
Have a good smoke?

389
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,928
I don't smoke.

390
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,351
Didn't mean to startle you.

391
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:53,730
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

392
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,691
We've been informed that you

393
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:59,152
obtained a copy of the surveillance tape

394
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:01,905
entered as evidence in the Lincoln Burrows trial.

395
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:03,823
Is there a problem with that?

396
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,158
We're just following up.

397
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:07,660
Has there been some amendment to the Freedom of Information Act

398
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:09,954
that I'm not aware of?

399
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,916
You know, when a prisoner gets

400
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:15,251
close to the end of his time on Death Row,

401
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:16,711
there's a lot of last-minute sec...

402
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,129
I'm sorry, I still don't understand

403
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,298
why this would be a problem for the Secret Service.

404
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,341
It's not.

405
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:24,636
The prosecution made its case far beyond any reasonable doubt,

406
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:28,264
and we know that we have the right man.

407
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:29,515
That being said,

408
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:33,895
if you come across anything that could shed some light on his innocence,

409
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,230
I'm offering my help.

410
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:37,941
Sounds great.

411
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:40,401
I really appreciate you coming by.

412
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:46,115
Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?

413
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:46,991
Of course.

414
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:49,911
Don't hesitate to call.

415
00:25:50,954 --> 00:25:51,746
Thanks.

416
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:03,091
Leticia.

417
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:34,247
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry, I...
- Where are you?

418
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,499
I'm sor.. this isn't the time, I'm sorry.

419
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,876
This is the time-- I'm at the reception hall.

420
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:41,796
The coordinator's here. The vendors.

421
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:45,383
Look, I'm just, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.

422
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:06,487
I say we take his whole foot.

423
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:09,032
We could cut off all his limbs;

424
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,950
he still wouldn't talk.

425
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,662
Pain is not the answer here.

426
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,917
Maybe the Beatles were right, after all.

427
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,211
Maybe all you need is love.

428
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:26,424
What're you doing?

429
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:28,301
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm rolling it up.

430
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:30,887
You can't do this.

431
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,972
I'm done playing your reindeer games, Fish.

432
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:36,309
I'm gonna transfer to a nice, quiet cell with a normal cellie,

433
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,478
one that doesn't screw my entire life up.

434
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:39,771
Look...

435
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,192
I'm sorry about your congugals, but if you go now...

436
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,322
Don't do this. Please.

437
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:50,615
Listen to me, Fish.

438
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,283
I got 16 months.

439
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,285
I got a fiancée to think about.

440
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,246
I get caught with a hole in my wall,

441
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:59,249
I don't get to see the real world for another five years.

442
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,084
Let's go, Sucre.

443
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:03,419
I can't do that.

444
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:05,922
There's always a solution. We can work it out.

445
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:07,465
Sorry, Fish.

446
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:16,683
Can I ask you something?

447
00:28:18,142 --> 00:28:22,355
Why have you denied any family or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

448
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:25,024
Why would I let them watch me die?

449
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,943
I've caused them enough pain.

450
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:29,946
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

451
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,826
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

452
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,494
That the final torture?

453
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:40,373
No. It's about how you want to leave this world.

454
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,960
What's the last image you want to take with you?

455
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:45,295
A stranger?

456
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,813
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

457
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,566
I don't got to come to you. You don't give the green light.

458
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:09,402
Everything in here runs through me. You know that.

459
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:13,448
May Tag's in the ground because of that piece of detritus.

460
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:15,074
So now you want him.

461
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:18,786
Every day for the rest of his bid.

462
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:22,165
Seems you and I have something in common, then.

463
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,010
Easy now, Fish.

464
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,763
Don't make this any harder than it needs to be.

465
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:40,600
It's time we came to an arrangement, don't you think?

466
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:55,490
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you bow to stern,

467
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,075
soon as I laid eyes on you.

468
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:01,913
But, alackaday, you look so pretty when you're scared, don't you?

469
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:06,602
Maybe we ought to get the love out of the way 'fore we move on to hate.

470
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,271
What do you say to that, Pretty? Hmm?

471
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,939
Yeah...

472
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:16,278
Maybe it's time I lit up that face once and for all.

473
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,911
God, he talks too much.

474
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,123
You and I need to have a conversation.

475
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:40,803
What happened in there was my way of saying

476
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:44,890
I know I been going about this whole thing the wrong way.

477
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:49,728
I'm trying to make amends here.

478
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,356
Bygones be bygones?

479
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:56,026
You're a mercurial man, John.

480
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:57,820
I prefer bold.

481
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:05,661
Tell me what you need from me.

482
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:06,662
A trade.

483
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:10,416
You get me a plane, I'll get you Fibonacci.

484
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,085
What do you need a plane for?

485
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:14,461
I think you know.

486
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:18,007
I help you, I'm in. You know that, don't you?

487
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,675
I do.

488
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:24,179
Just got to know the exact date and time.

489
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,556
I'll tell you soon enough.

490
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:26,765
Soon enough ain't gonna cut it.

491
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,852
I need to be outside these walls before Fibonacci testifies.

492
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:31,311
You will be.

493
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,480
He testifies in one month.

494
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:35,983
Then you'll be out in plenty of time.

495
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:40,320
If not... you're a corpse.

496
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:46,201
You'd better cut the crap. Tell me the exact date and time,

497
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,162
so I can start making the arrangements.

498
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:50,330
I don't know if I can trust you with that information yet.

499
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:51,040
Why not?

500
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,500
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man.

501
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,762
Lewis, take these off.

502
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,473
Sink, I can't do that.

503
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:10,100
Come on, man, I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

504
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:11,977
Please.

505
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:14,563
It's my kid.

506
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,663
So... here we are.

507
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:35,918
Yeah. How you been?

508
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:39,129
You know... in trouble.

509
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:41,548
How's your mom?

510
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:45,886
She's good.

511
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,890
Hey, um... I've been talking to the chaplain,

512
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,727
and they'd like me to decide on who I should, uh, have at the, uh...

513
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:58,399
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

514
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:00,484
when you get to the end,

515
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:05,531
you start to realize what's important to you, you know?

516
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,990
Who really matters to you.

517
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,704
And, uh, you know...

518
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,580
that leaves you and Mike.

519
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,250
The only blood I got left in this...

520
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,293
in this world.

521
00:33:19,753 --> 00:33:22,631
Yeah, I got to say, I'm not really following what you're saying.

522
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,299
Well, uh...

523
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,971
In the end,

524
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,265
the only thing that matters is love.

525
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:37,146
Blood, family... you.

526
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:44,194
Um...

527
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:53,287
Give me your hand.

528
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,457
What are you doing?

529
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,417
Give me your hand.

530
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:00,961
Give me your hand.

531
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,307
I want you to be there when...

532
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:17,478
I want you to be there the day before I die.

533
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,482
So I can see you.

534
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,151
So I can hold you.

535
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,785
I, uh...

536
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:37,498
I love you.

537
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,124
I've always loved you.

538
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:41,210
Yeah...

539
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,302
This whole thing, um...

540
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:55,724
I don't know if I can take it.

541
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,020
Me, either.

542
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:02,648
I don't have a choice.

543
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:05,109
You do.

544
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,092
I am so sorry.

545
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,014
I met with this woman today, and she knew things about Lincoln's case.

546
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,933
And then she just disappeared. I think something happened to her.

547
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:41,020
Look, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

548
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,690
Do you want to get married...

549
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:46,859
or not?

550
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,155
I don't know.

551
00:35:52,364 --> 00:35:53,615
Wonderful.

552
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:57,578
Maybe we could postpone it.

553
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,205
Okay, I can't do this right now. My head's not in it.

554
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:01,457
It's supposed to be a celebration...

555
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:04,209
If you're really telling me you want to postpone this thing...

556
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:07,921
...then I want to cancel it.

557
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:14,511
Sebastian...

558
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,014
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,810
I'll come get my stuff tomorrow.

560
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,302
Open on 40!

561
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:01,350
Scofield.

562
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,060
Found you a new cellie.

563
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,896
As luck would have it, I found him in the Psych Ward.

564
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:07,856
You were the only guy with an empty tray, so...

565
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,274
Psych Ward?

566
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:10,943
You got a problem with that?

567
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:13,779
'Cause if you do, please,

568
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:16,699
feel free to drop it in my suggestion box here.

569
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:26,875
Haywire, get in here!

570
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:33,549
Close it up on 40!

571
00:37:38,637 --> 00:37:41,849
Oh, and Scofield, just a heads up--

572
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,810
don't make eye contact with him.

573
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:12,796
Lincoln, we have a problem.

574
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:15,507
- I got a new cell mate.
- Who?

575
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,094
That's a problem.

576
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,263
We're just gonna have to bring him on board.

577
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:23,223
You're don't bring a guy like that on board.

578
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,726
Then I'll work at night, when he's sleeping.

579
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,311
Ten feet, Scofield.

580
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:37,404
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

581
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:40,657
Thought you said the margin for error was zero days.

582
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:41,909
I did.

583
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,482
Nice out here.

584
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:14,566
I got a buddy--

585
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:16,735
he's got a place way back up in these woods.

586
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:18,987
Come up here hunting around this time of year.

587
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,906
Man...

588
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:23,784
Whoa.

589
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:26,328
Get her back in. Back in.

590
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:32,626
Come on.

591
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:33,502
Over here. Come here.

592
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:35,671
Take her out there.

593
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:36,922
She's nothing.

594
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:39,508
Nobody would believe her if she talked, anyway.

595
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,637
Hundred yards or so should do it.

596
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:46,890
Do it.

597
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:48,726
Go!

598
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,909
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:07,786
You got to believe that.

600
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:11,040
Damn it.

601
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:36,648
Please!

602
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:40,861
Please!

603
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,783
Please.

604
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,421
Pick up the casings.

605
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:51,015
What's your problem?

606
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,851
I got a neuroanatomic lesion

607
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:57,104
affecting my reticular activating system.

608
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:58,856
What does that mean?

609
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,483
It means I don't sleep.

610
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:04,236
At all.
