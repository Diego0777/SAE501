1
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,806
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,855
The bosses are
shipping grenades into L.A.

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:07,404
Get him off!

4
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:10,355
Grenade!

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,800
Guardo's gone.

6
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,600
Vic. What the hell?

7
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,334
Kavanaugh.
What did you tell him?

8
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,301
That I saw your guy
take the heroin.

9
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:21,700
That's it.

10
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,201
6 months,
you could've warned me!

11
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:26,800
Maybe all of us are going
to jail because of you.

12
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,700
Without you,
IAD's case goes away.

13
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:33,591
Jesus. It's you.

14
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,568
You're trying to get
Mackey running to me.

15
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,234
And I so want there
to be trust between you two.

16
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,185
Oh, what the enemy
of my enemy is my friend?

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,595
They're gonna need a friend
in a high place, that's you.

18
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:43,800
If Kavanaugh is successful,

19
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,231
I'm gonna scorch the earth
covering this whole department,

20
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,367
starting with you.

21
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,733
You ever hear of
an Armenian money train?

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,067
It's a money laundering
operation of the Armenian mob.

23
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,468
I think the Strike Team
ripped them off.

24
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,110
I heard you had
a rough week,

25
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,706
so I told John
I'd stop by and check--

26
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,267
Your ex-wife's pussy
tastes like sweet butter.

27
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,234
You're under arrest
for possession

28
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,134
of heroin with intent
to distribute.

29
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,834
If I plead guilty
to the heroin,

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,301
without me,
this whole deal's off.

31
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,867
He's got nothing
on you guys.

32
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:16,134
I got Niners
in every pen in the state.

33
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,034
So wherever he touches down,
it will happen.

34
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,334
You sent Lem to Lompoc.

35
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,812
It's you that's
the real murderer.

36
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:23,267
You don't have
the stomach

37
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,534
to serve Lem up
to Antwon.

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,900
I didn't used to.

39
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,534
I'm taking him to the
courthouse 9:00 tomorrow morning.

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,120
Listen, I gotta
tell you something.

41
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:30,900
What?

42
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,597
You're not going
to prison.

43
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:36,101
Look, we made
a deal with Antwon

44
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,667
to get you
safe passage inside.

45
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:39,591
It went bad.

46
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,587
Christ, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

47
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:42,859
We're gonna
hide you locally.

48
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,124
You mean, put him on the run?

49
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:46,167
Lem, right now, this is
about keeping you alive.

50
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,101
No, no.

51
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,267
Lem, it's only temporary.

52
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:50,034
I promise you, man.

53
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,367
I promise you
we're gonna make this work.

54
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:55,301
He screwed my ex-wife
with the sole purpose

55
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,101
of making
this investigation

56
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,301
seem like
a personal vendetta.

57
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,367
You have 48 hours
to tie up the loose ends.

58
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:07,468
Can I talk to you
for a second?

59
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,568
First of all,
I need you to know,

60
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,267
I've always liked you.

61
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,867
From the first moment
that we met at the school.

62
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,900
I hated that I wasn't able
to tell you the truth

63
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,568
about who I was.

64
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:21,834
Maybe if I had,

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,767
you'd have a whole
different picture of me.

66
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,633
I mean, you like me, right?

67
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,767
Before you found out
I was a, you know...

68
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,920
you thought I was,
like, a decent guy.

69
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:34,934
Yes.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Different circumstances,

71
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,867
a different time,

72
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,534
Our relationship could've
taken a different turn.

73
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,367
I'm just really, really
tired, you know?

74
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,633
I haven't been able
to eat lately.

75
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,967
Why aren't
you guys inside?

76
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,271
Lem's not here yet.

77
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,101
Where is he?
He's already 1/2 hour late.

78
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,201
He'll be here.

79
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,334
How are you
this morning?

80
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,101
I'm OK.

81
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,000
He didn't leave a message.

82
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,667
If I was going to jail for 18 months,

83
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,367
I wouldn't be
in a rush either.

84
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:19,733
Give him some time.

85
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,234
I've made you coffee,
and I've been patient.

86
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,067
You need to go.

87
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,700
OK, stop. Stop.

88
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:43,700
Stop!

89
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:44,834
Don't touch me!

90
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,267
You're right.

91
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,367
That's good. That's good.

92
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:50,099
Why are you still here?

93
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,767
Because there's
nowhere else.

94
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,800
You see how lonely
he's made both of us?

95
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,534
I'm not lonely.

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,334
I'm moving on with my life.
You need to do the same.

97
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,900
No. Not until
there's justice.

98
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:04,534
You need to let this go.
You need to let it go.

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,667
No, don't.

100
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,201
Cause nobody ever
fights back against him.

101
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:09,434
Nobody ever
takes his punch

102
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,110
and just smacks him
one right back.

103
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,938
You need to leave.

104
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,067
If I take this fight to him...

105
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,034
and I win.

106
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,534
I need to know
that you're gonna be OK.

107
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,134
Because I don't want you
to hurt anymore.

108
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,501
What are you
talking about?

109
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,800
Would you
be all right...

110
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,134
without him?

111
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,349
- No.
- Mom?

112
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,767
What's going on?

113
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:46,000
Your mom, she's
a very good person.

114
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,401
She's a...

115
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,733
very good person.

116
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,267
Kavanaugh was here?

117
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,434
All morning.

118
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,434
Yeah.

119
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,101
He said
he wanted to ask me

120
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,267
a few questions to wrap
up this case, but...

121
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,800
did he try to touch you?

122
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,867
Why would you ask that?

123
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,743
What did he say?

124
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:43,667
Well, he was desperate
and kind of lonely,

125
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,700
and I felt bad for him,

126
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:45,733
and then out of nowhere,

127
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,175
he said
he was coming after you,

128
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:48,552
and that he wanted
to make sure

129
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,009
me and the kids
would be OK--

130
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,633
If something
happened to me.

131
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,501
This is about Lem.

132
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:55,800
He didn't show up at
court to turn himself in.

133
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:56,934
Where is he?

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,367
Nobody knows.
He's a fugitive.

135
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,093
Kavanaugh probably figures
I had something to do with it.

136
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,800
No, I didn't.

137
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:05,667
He's just pissed because
his case against Lem tanked.

138
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,600
He's making it personal.

139
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,834
He wants to hurt me
through you.

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,934
Please, don't let him
in this house again.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,900
All right?

142
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,401
All right.

143
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,900
Be careful.

144
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,534
Always.

145
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,767
Where's Lemansky?

146
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,301
I don't know.

147
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,582
You screwed him once, and now
you've done it again.

148
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:38,735
Putting him on the run.

149
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:40,600
Didn't they kick your ass
out of the Barn?

150
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:41,700
You aid and abet him,

151
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,234
you communicate with him
in any way

152
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,834
without reporting it,

153
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,767
you'll be put in prison
along side him.

154
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,967
We had nothing
to do with this.

155
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,501
My office will have eyes

156
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,234
on all of you, every
second of every day

157
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,501
until Lemansky's caught.

158
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,167
Thank you...

159
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,700
for bringing me back
into your life.

160
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:13,283
POSTPARTUM

161
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,333
All right, where are we
with those errands?

162
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,001
Spoke to our
federale buddy,

163
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,534
who took Doomsday
off our hands.

164
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,267
He's gonna meet
Lem in TJ,

165
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,014
get him to a safe house
in Ensenada.

166
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,390
That's wall-to-wall
wetbacks.

167
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,768
Surfer Boy will be
a little obvious.

168
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:29,828
He'll be on the move.

169
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,567
Taco Cop's got a
brother owns a goat ranch

170
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,467
in the mountains north of San Ignacio.

171
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,200
It's a really good place to get lost.

172
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,233
How much?

173
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,801
It's two grand.

174
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,034
And a call on our services
to be determined later.

175
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,333
I can't wait.

176
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,500
What about
living expenses?

177
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,267
Got a line on wire
transfers to Guatemala.

178
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,247
How secure?

179
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,001
Enough to keep it
off immigration's radar.

180
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,168
Used to pay
coyotes mostly.

181
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,701
He's gonna need cash.

182
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:50,986
It's gonna be
his only leverage.

183
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,549
Let me work on that.

184
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:56,134
Now all we need is a way
to get him across the border.

185
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,253
How are we gonna
pull that off, man?

186
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,567
Kavanaugh and his cronies
are watching us 24/7.

187
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,333
We're gonna pull it off
the way we always do.

188
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,134
Right under their noses
with a goddamn smile.

189
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:15,500
Claudette.

190
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,534
We were working
something else.

191
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,634
Not anymore.

192
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,599
You've got history
with these grenade tossers.

193
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,333
Any victims?

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,867
Just a half dozen
crown vics.

195
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,434
You've tangled with

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,034
some well-armed
Salvadorans before, right?

197
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,434
The guy who imports the
grenades is named Guardo.

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,600
We hit him hard
and his weapons stash,

199
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,001
but he got away.

200
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,482
Looks like
he didn't go far.

201
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,101
Agent Gallagher. DEA.

202
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,400
Captain Wyms.
Farmington division.

203
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,401
This is our lot.

204
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,333
We've been running an
op on the El Salvadorans

205
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
out of
the travel agency.

206
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,101
Someone wants to move up
to first class.

207
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:47,400
Detective Mackey
and his team

208
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,967
busted some of that gang
a week ago.

209
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,422
Swept up
a bunch of grenades, MP5s,

210
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,034
a few top level
lieutenants.

211
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,494
And let their
playmaker, Guardo,

212
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,801
slip out
from under your nose.

213
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,434
We're here to assist.

214
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,367
Great. Start
directing traffic.

215
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,967
If a grenade goes off
on my turf,

216
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,901
you get help whether
you like it or not.

217
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,467
Don't step on our toes,
we'll stay off yours.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,034
What an asshole.

219
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,667
Rawlings did burn them.

220
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,692
So now's our chance
to make it up.

221
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:12,967
Track down whatever
you can find.

222
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,400
Run everything by me.

223
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,667
And Vic,
that renegade shit's

224
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:16,934
not gonna fly
on my watch.

225
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,767
But you already
knew that.

226
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,901
Looks like a new sheriff
just limped into town.

227
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,534
She's smart. She keeps tabs
on us from her end,

228
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,367
DEA keeps an eye on us
from the other.

229
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,068
I don't give a shit
about neither.

230
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,267
We'll follow up on this,

231
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,400
but finding Lem
safe passage to Mexico

232
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,367
is still priority one.

233
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,267
Hey, hello?

234
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,901
Hey, open the door.

235
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,934
Open the door now.

236
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:18,001
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
Where's your mommy?

237
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,500
Where's your mommy?

238
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,634
Hey, buddy,
what's your name?

239
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,901
What's his name?

240
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,034
Wendell.

241
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,410
Wendell, will you let me
wash it off for you?

242
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:29,701
Shh. It's OK.

243
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,015
It's gonna be
all right, buddy.

244
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:31,867
It's all right.

245
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,034
It's gonna be OK.
It's just a little cut.

246
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,134
Here we go.
It's all right.

247
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,934
What the hell's
going on in here, guys?

248
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,467
It's OK.
It's all right.

249
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,434
Lisa.
Call the police.

250
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,267
It's OK. I'm a cop.

251
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,168
Lisa, there's a gun.
Call the police!

252
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,333
Come here, come here.

253
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,333
Hold this tight.

254
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Hold it till
someone gets here, OK?

255
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,736
Are you calling?

256
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,947
Yo.

257
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,562
Hey.

258
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:31,967
We're cops. We're cops.

259
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,084
Get up!

260
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,567
Get him down.

261
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,600
Let me see your hands.

262
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,834
What do you want?

263
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:40,667
Some of our Salvadoran
amigos went all Superdome

264
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,200
on a DEA
parking lot.

265
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,867
Turned some crown vics
into some scrap metal.

266
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,034
I'd start talking before he
goes Superdome on your head.

267
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,434
The DEA's
been up our ass.

268
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,333
Busted our number
two Osorio.

269
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,934
Bosses sent
a message to the feds.

270
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,566
That's the third Mexican
that gave up

271
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,181
that it's payback
for busting Osorio.

272
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,901
Which means it can't
possibly be true.

273
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,734
Soldiers have been fed
their cover story,

274
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:12,801
but what's the truth?

275
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,967
I think Kavanaugh
found Lem's trailer.

276
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:16,934
What?

277
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,333
Sheriff's department
got called

278
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,701
to the trailer park
on a disturbance.

279
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,701
Cliff says Kavanaugh's
on his way there now.

280
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,300
Your pal say anything
about Lem?

281
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,934
No. Radio blackout,
but something's poppin'.

282
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,500
Kavanaugh's
poking around, man.

283
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:27,934
What else
could it be?

284
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,016
Look, we would've heard
something if they arrested him.

285
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,001
Maybe. Maybe not.
Who knows with Kavanaugh.

286
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,734
Maybe they found him,
and he was...

287
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,200
There's no way
he'd eat his gun.

288
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,300
No way.

289
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,434
We told him not to
contact us at any cost.

290
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,967
We're in
no man's land.

291
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,034
Best case scenario,

292
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:44,890
he's on the run with
Kavanaugh on his ass.

293
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,456
Look, man.
Lem knows the score.

294
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:48,072
He's gonna meet us tonight,
get supplies,

295
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,901
which means we gotta
pull our shit together

296
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,701
to get his ticket
out of here by then.

297
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:55,734
The truth is,
this could be good bye.

298
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,134
Come on.

299
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,297
Well... he been runnin' that way.

300
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:03,500
This is it?

301
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,168
This the man you saw?

302
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,567
Yeah, that's him.

303
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:13,600
So...

304
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,767
what happened?

305
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:15,767
I heard something.

306
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,367
Came outside,
saw him in the trailer.

307
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,300
Saw the kid bleeding.

308
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,929
Did he say
anything to you?

309
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,534
He said he was a cop.

310
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:28,248
The whole thing seemed pretty weird
so I had my lady called the real cops.

311
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,867
What then?

312
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh, he was off and running.

313
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,434
Funny thing was,
big guy like that

314
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,634
with a gun and all,

315
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,034
he still looked
awful scared.

316
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:40,867
Yeah, it's funny.

317
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:47,767
What's this?

318
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,667
Your former C.I. says
she's got information

319
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,669
on the demolished
DEA cars.

320
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:53,549
Well, give her to the feds.
We don't want her.

321
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,300
I tried. She'll only
talk to you.

322
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,901
Kavanaugh cut me
loose, Vic.

323
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,734
I'm not working
for him no more.

324
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,534
Now that you've stabbed one
of my guys with an indictment.

325
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,567
You need another
PD tit to suck on?

326
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,101
It's real good intel.

327
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:10,134
It's not my dime.
Your call.

328
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:11,767
Give us a minute.

329
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,967
I know she's the one Kavanaugh
had testify against Lem.

330
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,701
It's all bullshit.

331
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:23,134
She as inside
as she says?

332
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,101
See what the story is.

333
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:27,434
Make sure she sticks
around the Barn

334
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,967
where I can see her.

335
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,967
Blowing up those DEA
cars wasn't retaliation.

336
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,534
Nothing we don't know.

337
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,734
Guardo's play for drug
protection's paid off.

338
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,701
Colombians have a huge
shipment coming up from Mexico.

339
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,791
Hired him and his crew
to guard it.

340
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,565
The feds feel like they
were making a dent

341
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,134
in the Salvadoran
drug game.

342
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,034
Meanwhile, something else is
going on underneath their noses.

343
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,634
Yeah. Guardo's
a crazy shithead.

344
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:51,333
Any excuse to blow
something up.

345
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,333
When and where?

346
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,333
Tonight.

347
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,267
Going through a grocery import guy.

348
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,233
Aldo Melchor.

349
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,200
The importer.
He Salvadoran?

350
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,600
Mexican.

351
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,367
Need a place and a time.

352
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:06,767
That's all I got.

353
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,967
That's real good
information though.

354
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,267
If it's true.

355
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,267
Not just another chance
for you to help Kavanaugh

356
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,567
to nail us again.

357
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:16,001
No. I never wanted
to help Kavanaugh.

358
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,901
Right. Now who's the source
of your intel?

359
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,300
You never needed
to know that before.

360
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,001
I trusted you before.

361
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,267
Fine.

362
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,134
I want to get paid
up front then.

363
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,734
I need money
to get out of L.A.

364
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,834
Take Sebastio,
head up to Seattle,

365
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,267
be with my sister.

366
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm so happy you got
a little plan.

367
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,068
What about Lem?

368
00:15:39,134 --> 00:15:40,701
He gonna head up
to Seattle?

369
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,689
Live with
your sister, too?

370
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,225
Oh, that's right.
He can't.

371
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,567
Because he's gonna
be in prison.

372
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:46,701
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:47,767
Vic took care of you.

374
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,901
He fed you and your kid
for months.

375
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,200
And you were sticking us
the whole goddamn time.

376
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,801
No! You see this?

377
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,001
I slept with
this scumbag Ignacio

378
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,034
to get this info
for you, OK?

379
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,734
Then two of his buddies
joined in.

380
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,600
Ripped me up pretty bad.

381
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,667
If you...

382
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,434
made different choices
from the beginning...

383
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,701
none of us would be
ripped up right now.

384
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:37,801
Becca.

385
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,448
Come on, make it look
like we're on a date.

386
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,534
I can't do anything to
help you escape the police.

387
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,367
Make it look like
a lovers quarrel then.

388
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,701
Look, the only advice
I can give you legally

389
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,367
is to turn yourself in now.

390
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:52,867
That's exactly what
I want to do.

391
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,734
Then we're on
the wrong side of town.

392
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,134
Look, I need assurances.

393
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,300
You're not exactly
in a position--

394
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,934
I need to do
my time someplace

395
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,867
where the One-Niners and
Antwon Mitchell can't get to me.

396
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,001
Federal prison
back east.

397
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:06,400
The feds aren't calling this

398
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:09,034
and going fugitive means
the original deal's gone.

399
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:10,567
Then I'll plead to
new federal charges.

400
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,200
I'll tell them
all the shit that I did.

401
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:15,222
You can't just serve them
your head on a platter either.

402
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,500
Kavanaugh's
not gonna stop

403
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,967
until he's
carving me up.

404
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:21,801
Tell them that
I ripped off

405
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,667
an Armenian money laundering operation,

406
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,701
stole cash that was
part of a federal sting.

407
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:26,867
I'll plead to that.

408
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,134
You did this by yourself?

409
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,134
Yeah.

410
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,734
Listen to me.

411
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,734
They're going to insist
on Vic and the others.

412
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,333
I got nothing to say
about them.

413
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,534
Then why are you running?

414
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,068
I'm not running.
I'm giving myself up.

415
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,534
All right,
I'm ending it.

416
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,701
You want a new deal,
they'll want new information.

417
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,200
I'm giving them
new information on myself.

418
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,200
You are not hearing me.

419
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,867
There will be no deal

420
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,474
until you give them
more than you.

421
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:51,333
Curtis, please,
you listen to me.

422
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,200
You have got to
think about yourself.

423
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:55,233
This one time.

424
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,034
It's your only option.

425
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,200
Now, Vic told me
that you guys sometimes

426
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:00,867
would spread around
some drug money

427
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,168
to keep peace on the streets.

428
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,434
Listen to me,
this Armenian thing

429
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,667
was armed robbery.

430
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:06,934
People got killed.

431
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,834
And they weren't
the only ones.

432
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,101
You think it was all just
pawning off some drug money

433
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:12,600
to keep the streets quiet?

434
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,333
I can't tell the truth
about the others because...

435
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,362
they'll throw us away
for the rest of our lives.

436
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,168
Open your goddamn eyes
to who we are.

437
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,333
People got killed?

438
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:22,300
This is all
attorney/client privilege.

439
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,265
Detective Terry Crowley.

440
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,367
You've heard enough.

441
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:26,801
Just get me my deal,

442
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,400
do my time back east.

443
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,967
Then I'll
turn myself in.

444
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,967
I'll call you
in a few hours.

445
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,734
Ow! Goddamnit!

446
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,233
Piece of shit just
scalded my hand.

447
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,400
Could've been
user error.

448
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,433
If you can push
through the pain,

449
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,010
we've got a woman
assaulted on Vermont.

450
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,134
Let's roll.

451
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,767
Get a statement
from her.

452
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,934
Um, you're not
pairing me up with him.

453
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,834
You're the only
two singles on the floor.

454
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,734
Consider it permanent.

455
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,034
Cross Street, 7th.

456
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:11,734
Hey, it's no great joy
for me, either.

457
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm gonna put
some ice on this.

458
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,834
6 months I kept this place
running smooth as silk,

459
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,001
and for what?

460
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,667
No commendation, no
letter for my package,

461
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,534
not even a "hey, Steve,
way to go."

462
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,634
It's humiliating.

463
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,400
Welcome back.

464
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,001
See? No respect.

465
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,434
Wyms is even
moving my desk

466
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,034
where everybody can get
a good gander

467
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:32,713
at Caesar lying
in a puddle of blood.

468
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:35,200
In this story,
you're Caesar?

469
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,701
Did I get stabbed
in the back or not?

470
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,934
Um, I'm driving.

471
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,667
I get nauseous
in the passenger seat.

472
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,034
Why don't you apply
for a transfer?

473
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,934
Show them they can't
kick you around.

474
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,001
No, I got this commute
all figured out.

475
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:53,034
Besides, it's only
56 months 'til I retire.

476
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,333
And then I get out of
this shithole for good.

477
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,467
Aldo Melchor?

478
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:16,934
Hey, let me see
your hands!

479
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:18,767
Easy, easy.

480
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,567
It's a knife.

481
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:22,634
To cut my chorizo.

482
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:23,867
It's OK if I have my lunch?

483
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:26,333
As long as it's
finger food.

484
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,600
What can I do
for you, officers?

485
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,168
Rumor has it
you import

486
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,233
more than just
chorizo from down south.

487
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,567
Everything in this store
is legal.

488
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,134
Really?

489
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,500
You won't mind
if we stick around

490
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,168
and monitor your
import-export.

491
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,233
I close at 7:00.

492
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,634
Not tonight.

493
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,892
You're gonna stay open until
that shipment of coke arrives.

494
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:46,137
We're just
gonna hang out.

495
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:48,267
Provide a little
after hours security.

496
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,967
Salvadorans realize
you snitched on them,

497
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,834
they're gonna grind you
into chorizo.

498
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:56,068
Sell you by
the quarter pound

499
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:58,168
like the rest of the sausage
you got down there.

500
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,333
Is there something
I can do for you?

501
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,367
Tell us what time
the shipment comes.

502
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,580
We'll keep you out of it.

503
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,275
Bust the Salvadorans
after they leave.

504
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:11,200
Keep your pipeline
up and running.

505
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,200
What else?

506
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,567
Obviously, you can import.

507
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,767
Your exporting skills
better be just as good.

508
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,400
I've stayed in business
15 years.

509
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,200
We have a little package

510
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,200
we want to overnight
to Mexico.

511
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,434
How big is it?

512
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,534
About 6'2".

513
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:45,716
Just heard.

514
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:50,767
There's a good-looking kid.

515
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,901
His name's Lee.

516
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,400
After my dad.

517
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,168
Congratulations.

518
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,700
Yeah. Thanks.

519
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,534
You good? Do you
need anything?

520
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,567
My mom's coming tomorrow.

521
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,101
My two brothers,
this weekend.

522
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,700
I got more help than
I know what to do with.

523
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,367
Cash from the baby pool.

524
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,333
Pretty shrewd.

525
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,801
Not revealing
the baby's daddy.

526
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,767
Want to hold him?

527
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,901
Sure.

528
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:46,567
Hey...

529
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,304
Shh. OK. OK.

530
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,567
We didn't find one of...

531
00:22:57,706 --> 00:23:00,634
Everyone thought you could use
it more than anyone else, so...

532
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,667
It's almost 3 grand.

533
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,467
My evil plan worked.

534
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,567
Tell everyone
I said, thank you.

535
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,034
When he's old enough
and he asks,

536
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,134
I'll tell him.

537
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,101
But for now, I just...

538
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:29,567
When he's
old enough.

539
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,467
Hey. Yo.

540
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,390
You want to tell me what the
hell Becca's doing up there?

541
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:54,134
Talking to Kavanaugh
and Aceveda.

542
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,067
Can you think
of any scenario

543
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,867
where that's a good thing?

544
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,634
Curtis Lemansky is
prepared to turn himself in.

545
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,168
If you've talked to him,

546
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:04,201
you have an obligation
to tell us where he is.

547
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,324
I know my obligations.

548
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,489
I don't know
where he is.

549
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,201
Curtis knows where
the Barn is

550
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,400
if he wants to
turn himself in.

551
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,970
He couldn't turn himself
over to you

552
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,534
for reasons
that involve his safety.

553
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,500
Any cop who's incarcerated
faces those risks.

554
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,934
He knew that.

555
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,500
He made his choice
when he broke the law.

556
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,801
This was a calculated move
by lieutenant Kavanaugh

557
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,767
to put Curtis' life
in jeopardy

558
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,801
to compel him to testify
against his team.

559
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,234
Any proof of that?

560
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,027
Look, the department wants
to mitigate the damage.

561
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,901
And when Lemansky didn't
show up for processing,

562
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,168
the chief
handed authority

563
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:34,234
over to my
police committee.

564
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,141
All we're asking for
is protection.

565
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:38,059
At least until I have
a chance to investigate

566
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:39,754
his claims against
lieutenant Kavanaugh.

567
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,700
And after that?

568
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,067
He'll accept
the previous deal.

569
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,367
As long as we can reasonably
guarantee his safety.

570
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,734
He can't have
the same deal.

571
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,034
He ran away
from that deal,

572
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,467
and if the council signs
off, they're gonna want more.

573
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:52,101
My client is willing
to plead to new charges.

574
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:54,054
But he wants his choice
of federal prisons.

575
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,834
What's he have to say
about his friends?

576
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,867
Nothing.

577
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:57,867
Not good enough.

578
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:59,534
I have to run this
up a few ladders,

579
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,934
so... give me 'til
the end of the day.

580
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:12,234
Look, I'll find him first.

581
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,901
Then we can
dictate the terms.

582
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:16,567
I need bodies, though.

583
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,433
I want two surveillance
teams on Mackey and his guys

584
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,268
in case they try to help
Lemansky escape.

585
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,600
You burned your bridges
with the chief.

586
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,034
I need my people
on the street.

587
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:30,712
Becca.

588
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:32,233
Becca.

589
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,801
What happened with Lem,
is he all right?

590
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,967
Privileged information.

591
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,734
Tell me he's OK.

592
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,567
Well, at least
tell me what's wrong.

593
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:41,600
Wait.

594
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:42,767
Don't touch me.

595
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,333
Haven't you done
enough damage yet?

596
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,534
Becca, come on.

597
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,234
Come on. Let's go
somewhere and talk.

598
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,634
Talk about

599
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,067
armed robbery of an Armenian
money laundering operation?

600
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:56,667
Talk about murdering
Terry Crowley?

601
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:57,734
I told you.

602
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,101
Yes, you did.

603
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:00,400
And now,
I know the truth.

604
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,101
I let you touch me.

605
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,834
It makes me sick.

606
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,567
Becca, I don't know
what Lem told you...

607
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,767
No more explanations.

608
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,168
It's all bullshit.

609
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,567
You've lied so much

610
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:14,867
you forgot
what the truth is.

611
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,567
Was I lying
to you last night?

612
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:21,367
I don't ever want to think
about last night.

613
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:25,534
You know, I was worried about

614
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,467
what I'd do if I had to
choose between

615
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:31,001
being Curtis's lawyer
or your friend.

616
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,333
Not anymore.

617
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,234
Did you see the guy
who attacked you?

618
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
No. He just came up
from behind me

619
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,767
and started
hitting me.

620
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,034
I was trying
to cover my face.

621
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:57,767
This area can get pretty
rough even in daylight.

622
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,867
What were you
doing here

623
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:02,367
besides prettying up
the place.

624
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:06,400
Um, I'm a volunteer tutor at the
community center on the corner.

625
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,667
I was trying
to help some kids, you know.

626
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,934
We're gonna have you come
in, look at some pictures.

627
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:14,201
But why? I told you,
I didn't see him.

628
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:16,433
Maybe you saw more
than you think.

629
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,067
Is that really
necessary?

630
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:19,500
Excuse us for a minute.

631
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:22,734
Send her home.

632
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,801
If she remembers anything,
she can call us.

633
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:27,001
Well, figure out another
way to get her phone number

634
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,168
because I'm
bringing her in.

635
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:30,567
I was acting captain,
remember?

636
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm making the call.

637
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,634
Hey, I talked to the owner
of the store

638
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,671
across from where
Tori was attacked.

639
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:44,333
He see anything?

640
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,520
She saw them arguing,

641
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,067
she went in the back,
when she came out,

642
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:48,934
the guy had Tori on the
ground and was hitting her.

643
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,490
- You get the description?
- I got an I.D.

644
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,007
Owner says the guy's
a curb jockey.

645
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,333
Sits in a green cab
most days

646
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,981
waiting for fares
by the intersection.

647
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,173
Yeah, well,
miss pretty thing

648
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:57,921
never said anything
about arguing with the guy.

649
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:58,821
No. I know she didn't.

650
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,734
We should take another
run at Tori.

651
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:03,067
Maybe she'll ask you
to give her a hug.

652
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,300
Let's wait.

653
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,201
Bring the suspect
in first.

654
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,967
Uh, yes, yes.

655
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,367
I'd like to talk
to the owner

656
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:11,700
of the vending machines

657
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,001
at the Farmington
police station.

658
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,975
- Hey, it's Curtis.
- Hi.

659
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,001
<i>Look, I'm kind of in a
hurry. What's going on?

660
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,333
You're in
a holding pattern.

661
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,167
They said they'd take your
offer under advisement,

662
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,700
but gave no
indication when

663
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,967
or what
the answer might be.

664
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,667
Jesus Christ.

665
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,234
OK, look. I need you to get
a message to Vic.

666
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,600
That would be
breaking the law.

667
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:31,934
Shit.

668
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,700
All right. Forget it.
Forget it.

669
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:35,333
It's gonna be worse
if they catch you.

670
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,767
Now that I've told them
what you want.

671
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,767
They know there's more
shit to uncover.

672
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,934
Kavanaugh will show
no mercy.

673
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,300
I know.

674
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,433
There is one other
option though.

675
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,600
What?

676
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,400
<i>Witness protection.

677
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,433
And you tell them
everything.

678
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,201
Witness protection.

679
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,834
The entire truth.

680
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,600
Imagine. You'll be free
of the lies, the running.

681
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:04,134
People pay a price
for what they did.

682
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,734
I can't. I can't.

683
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:11,667
<i>Curtis, you're the one
with the heart.

684
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:12,667
<i>Now, use your head.

685
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,834
This isn't about
my goddamn heart.

686
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,934
I'm just trying
to help you here, Curtis.

687
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,534
No, you're trying
to get me to turn

688
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,367
on my family.

689
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,067
Please, just get me my deal.

690
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:36,573
He held out
as long as he could.

691
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,687
He's still holding.

692
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,276
He didn't want to run
in the first place.

693
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,634
He would run
before he would rat.

694
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,168
How do they know about
the money train?

695
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:43,159
Educated guess.

696
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:44,973
There's always been
plenty of suspicion,

697
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:45,867
just never any proof.

698
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,134
Unless Lem gave it
to them.

699
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,333
We know Lem, look...

700
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,766
if he had
a change of heart,

701
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:50,834
he would've tipped us.

702
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,500
He wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

703
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:54,867
Look, I'm not saying
that it happened.

704
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,713
I'm just saying are we
willing to bet our freedom

705
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:57,685
that it didn't.

706
00:29:57,738 --> 00:29:59,667
I'm not gonna believe it 'til
I see it with my own eyes.

707
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,867
Lem's not
contacting us

708
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:01,856
to protect us.

709
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,578
We're gonna meet him
tonight at midnight,

710
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:04,876
and he's gonna
travel tonight.

711
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,677
That's it.

712
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,001
OK. On whose nickel?

713
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,834
This spic cop doesn't take
American Express.

714
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:13,067
It's already
taken care of.

715
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,424
I told Mara
that Lem was in trouble.

716
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,596
She felt very strongly
that we needed to help him.

717
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,801
So we pulled a little
cash out of the house.

718
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:22,034
I mean,
it's not a lot, but...

719
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,870
Hey, 5 grand ought to
keep him in burritos and beer

720
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:25,857
long enough, man.

721
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,367
Yeah.

722
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,134
All right.
Go get this cashed.

723
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:32,433
Keep half of it
for tonight.

724
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,234
Put the rest
on the wire.

725
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:42,333
Lem must've said something
to Becca about Terry, too.

726
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,700
All that gives Kavanaugh
is a little more suspicion.

727
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,934
Doesn't mean
we're gonna catch a case.

728
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:52,500
Let alone a needle.

729
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,967
Lem starts talking,

730
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:57,967
it puts teeth in an
otherwise empty rumor.

731
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,101
These people,

732
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,134
every time
they look at us,

733
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:02,467
they're gonna see
two cop killers.

734
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:03,834
That's on me.

735
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,433
Terry was a decision
that we both made.

736
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,467
I forced it on you.

737
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,433
Now you're in
Kavanaugh's crosshairs.

738
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
That's on me.

739
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:12,168
Lem's gonna have to hide
under a rock

740
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:14,034
for the rest of his life.
That's on me, too.

741
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:15,201
I know that.

742
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,071
And skewering yourself
is helping Lem how?

743
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,934
How's that gonna help
any of us?

744
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,268
You made a call,

745
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,500
and that call was
to protect the team.

746
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,534
That couldn't have
gone down any other way.

747
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,934
It's done.

748
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,234
It's done.

749
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,767
Now is he still on our
side against Kavanaugh?

750
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,300
I'm gonna find out.

751
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:36,806
You!

752
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:39,034
What the hell was that
pow-wow upstairs about?

753
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:39,967
Call me later.

754
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm running out
of later.

755
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:46,134
Now. Are you and me still
allies against Kavanaugh?

756
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,567
Or do I pull out
my flame thrower

757
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:49,300
and start that
scorched earth plan

758
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,934
that I talked to you about?

759
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:54,001
Becca's being
a good lawyer.

760
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,001
Lem wants to
turn himself in

761
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,634
if he can get his
original deal back,

762
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,067
but Kavanaugh
won't sign off on it.

763
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,667
He's gonna file
new charges

764
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:01,896
for him running.

765
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,512
I thought Kavanaugh
was out of the picture.

766
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:05,366
He was until
Lem didn't show.

767
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:06,767
And now,
the chief's believing

768
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,404
that Kavanaugh was right.

769
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:10,134
He's giving him back
all his power.

770
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:11,067
What about Lem?

771
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:12,667
He'll let him
twist in the wind?

772
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,034
Claudette's gonna
call the D.A.,

773
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,600
but she's waiting
as long as she can

774
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,346
to give Kavanaugh a chance to find Lem.

775
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,934
That's all I know.

776
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,169
You got to throw
a wrench in the works.

777
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,674
You wanted an inside guy
for intel.

778
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:23,867
You got one.

779
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,234
You need help aiding
and abetting a fugitive,

780
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,168
find someone else.

781
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,000
What happened
to your face?

782
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,234
Nothing.
What happened to yours?

783
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:45,100
Where were you
at 8 AM this morning?

784
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,134
Driving. Working.

785
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,768
On what,
your right cross?

786
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,100
Witness says
you attacked Tori Birke.

787
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,743
Also says you two
had an argument first.

788
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:54,598
What was that about?

789
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,601
You just think
you can go around

790
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:58,800
beating women on the street?

791
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:00,601
How do you know her?

792
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,000
She take your cab?

793
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,634
You stalking her
or something?

794
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,434
OK, your thing is just
knocking the shit

795
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:09,668
out of random,
total strangers.

796
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,134
Works for me, Gilbos.

797
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,401
So I...
so I picked up a hooker.

798
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,100
I'm not the only guy

799
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,567
who's had to
bust out of a slump.

800
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:18,634
Doesn't mean I deserved
to get rolled and robbed.

801
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:20,567
Say again?

802
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:21,967
She set me up.

803
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,100
Soon as I got
my clothes off,

804
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,434
and my dick hard,

805
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:25,833
These two black guys
ran in.

806
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,567
Started
smashing me up.

807
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:29,200
Took everything.

808
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,734
The woman you attacked

809
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,167
is a volunteer tutor
for at risk kids.

810
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:34,658
She was on her way
to a session

811
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:35,601
when you jumped her.

812
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:37,701
That whore
flagged my cab.

813
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:40,567
OK, offered me
anything in the book

814
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,401
for a "C" note.

815
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,701
Picked the motel.

816
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,734
Then had her buddies

817
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,701
steal my wallet and a
chain my mother gave me.

818
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,933
So I gave her
a little payback.

819
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,434
Arrest her ass,
not mine.

820
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,768
So, did you find him?

821
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,258
We did.

822
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:06,967
Good. So I guess that means
that I can go now,

823
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,034
and you'll just let me know

824
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,434
if you need me
in court or anything?

825
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,294
We talked to people
at the community center.

826
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:14,122
You volunteer there
at least 3 days a week?

827
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:16,034
Yeah. I read to
disadvantaged kids.

828
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Are you
a prostitute, Tori?

829
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,900
Maybe in your fantasy
I'm a prostitute.

830
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,501
All right,
you know what?

831
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,668
If I'm gonna be insulted
on top of assaulted,

832
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,534
I think I'd--
I think I'd like to leave.

833
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,768
OK. We need to ask you
a few more questions.

834
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,833
You're a suspect

835
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,434
in a separate
assault and robbery.

836
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,601
I'd like to see
my legal counsel.

837
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,067
All right. They're moving
blow into the van.

838
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:49,900
Still no sign of Guardo?

839
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,467
They'll lead us to him.

840
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,367
That's the second time

841
00:34:58,434 --> 00:34:59,900
that car's passed
by here tonight.

842
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,734
What the Mexi chicks
in the el camino?

843
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,933
They don't look like
Kavanaugh's boys.

844
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,900
I think we're all right.

845
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,375
Hey. Wire transfer
went through.

846
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,153
Meet and greet
in TJ Is confirmed.

847
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:12,796
Now he just need
to get Lem on board.

848
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,367
OK, good.

849
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:15,900
Almost home.

850
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,207
They're on the move.

851
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:23,618
Hey.

852
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,768
Come on.
Pairing me up with Billings.

853
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,100
You know a guy like that

854
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,701
is gonna throw me
off my game.

855
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,100
You'll adjust.

856
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,334
I'm filing
for a transfer.

857
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:34,367
Dutch.

858
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,800
No. I'm serious.

859
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,668
Things haven't been
the same between us.

860
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,067
Even before
you got captain.

861
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,601
There is no reason why
we can't work this out

862
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,053
in a new way.

863
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,934
Yes, there is.

864
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,845
The only reason I was
hanging around here

865
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,267
was because we were
partners, and that's gone.

866
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,668
I'd just like
to move on.

867
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,601
OK. I'll prepare
the paperwork.

868
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,102
OK. Check this out.

869
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,501
Tori has an MBA
from UCLA.

870
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,867
Worked as an account
manager at a brokerage firm

871
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,651
until she was fired
6 months ago.

872
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:03,552
What for?

873
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:04,833
Her work started
to get sloppy,

874
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,384
and she stopped showing
up half the time.

875
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,267
But no arrest.

876
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,467
Yeah, if she's a hooker,
she had me fooled.

877
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,401
And I can
usually smell them.

878
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,434
This guy is here
for Tori Birke.

879
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,701
I'm her legal counselor.

880
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,401
And what are
your credentials

881
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,355
Mr. Wallis, esquire?

882
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,833
What I have
is a client.

883
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,334
And I need to see her
immediately.

884
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,234
Now, do I get to
see her now?

885
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,167
Or do I file
for a dismissal?

886
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:33,567
She's in 2.
Show him up.

887
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:37,833
I'll check him out.

888
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,967
I'm getting a whiff
of something now.

889
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,567
Gallagher's DEA bozos are
tied up in a sting in Compton,

890
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,167
and they're a little
short on cars.

891
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:50,196
Maybe in a few hours.

892
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,800
We can't wait that long.
We gotta meet Lem.

893
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,189
What about back-up
from the Barn?

894
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,336
There's a manhunt
on Curson.

895
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,701
Byz-Lats shot
a grocery clerk,

896
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:57,620
and there's no units
to spare.

897
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:00,567
We gotta go in.

898
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,867
There are 6 of them
at least.

899
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,200
We don't know
how many more inside.

900
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:07,034
Lem's gonna be
waiting on us.

901
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,601
Who's coming?

902
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,434
Get down!
Down on the ground!

903
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:25,800
On the floor!
On the floor!

904
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't move!

905
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,167
Get down on your knees.
Hands up!

906
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:31,668
I got rabbits!

907
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:32,933
Let them run.

908
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,434
Get up. Let's go.

909
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:36,434
Hands on your head.

910
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,601
Hands on your head.

911
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:38,701
You all right?

912
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:39,734
Yeah.

913
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,833
Let's go. Right now.

914
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,867
On the ground.

915
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,134
On the ground right now.

916
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,167
How many of these things
these guys got?

917
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:55,634
Claudette's so hot
for these guys,

918
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:56,967
she can book them
herself.

919
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,833
We gotta go get Lem.

920
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,200
Yes, yes. I still
want to hold.

921
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:05,933
Tyrez Wallis
is no more a lawyer

922
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,301
than I am
a figure skater.

923
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,267
Really?

924
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,283
So Dutch's girlfriend's
got a pimp?

925
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:14,367
You know, they've
been up there awhile.

926
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,000
Dutch, let's go.

927
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,281
No, no.

928
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
I want the name of the
owner of these machines

929
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,601
right now, or you will be
sitting in a holding cell

930
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,601
for as long as it takes
me to track it down.

931
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:27,467
Dutch, let's go.
Hang it up.

932
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,267
You own those machines?

933
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:41,634
I was just
filling a need.

934
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:44,334
Isn't it illegal
for department employees

935
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,967
to profit from things
like vending machines?

936
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,634
Especially when you
use your position

937
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,734
as acting captain

938
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,334
to create a defacto
monopoly?

939
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,340
I think it's more of
a gray area than that.

940
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,501
I don't think so.

941
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,833
I think it's more
black and white.

942
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,833
All right, so what now?

943
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,067
You gonna snitch me out
to Wyms?

944
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,477
Like I haven't been
shithammered enough around here.

945
00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:06,073
Is that what this
is gonna be?

946
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,367
I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet.

947
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,733
Attorney/client privilege?

948
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:26,601
It's illegal to practice law
in the state of California

949
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:28,701
without a license,
counselor.

950
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,867
What do you think?

951
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:31,800
Did I need
anymore practice?

952
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,606
Bomb Squad's
on a crank call

953
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:41,900
at some westside
abortion clinic.

954
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,367
They'll pick up
the grenades later.

955
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:44,933
I told you to call in
every move.

956
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,833
You were outnumbered
three to one.

957
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,277
They were getting ready
to bolt.

958
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,467
Split up in two vans.
We had no choice.

959
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:52,833
Sorry I missed
all the action.

960
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,334
Good work.

961
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,134
Just wish we were able
to nail Guardo.

962
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,401
He's been staying off
the frontlines these days.

963
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,267
Probably feeling
the heat from you guys.

964
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,634
Two busts
in as many weeks.

965
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,900
He's feeling your heat.

966
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,029
And I've seen what they
do when they get pissed.

967
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:08,900
Better watch
your crown vics.

968
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,234
You should be
warning him. Not me.

969
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,167
Thanks.

970
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,434
Glad you caught the guys.

971
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,000
Actually, we didn't
nail Guardo.

972
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:31,668
I'll see if I can
find something out.

973
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,434
You find another tip,
find another buyer.

974
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:35,267
Please don't be this way.

975
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:37,867
I'm sorry I made that deal.
Helped Kavanaugh.

976
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:38,867
You should go.

977
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,900
I did it for Sebastio.

978
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:44,900
You'd do the same thing
for your kids, too.

979
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:45,900
Take your rat money,

980
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:47,301
your retarded rat
baby kid,

981
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:48,534
and get on
the first bus--

982
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:51,367
Don't you say that
about my boy!

983
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,286
What?

984
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,867
You gonna let him talk
about Sebastio that way?

985
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:02,200
I showed you mercy once,

986
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:04,534
and it ruined
my friend's life.

987
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,100
Not gonna happen again.

988
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,567
Get out.

989
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,434
The police committee is
willing to consider a deal.

990
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,801
But like I thought, they
insist on adding more time.

991
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:33,967
How much?

992
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,320
Maximum of 10 years
with parole in 4

993
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:38,028
if he turns himself
in immediately.

994
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,134
What about
the safety issue?

995
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,701
He'll be held in
protective custody.

996
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,300
Until it's all
sorted out,

997
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,300
but there's no guarantee
of location.

998
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,900
Unless you can
prove your claims.

999
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,567
What about the others?

1000
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,768
No condition about him
giving us something on them?

1001
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,911
We want to put this
behind us.

1002
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:53,567
Now if he's caught
before he comes in,

1003
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:54,900
all bets are off.

1004
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,801
Excuse me.

1005
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,868
What's going on, man?

1006
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:09,801
What was that?

1007
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:11,200
It wasn't my choice.

1008
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,601
It's what the police
committee wanted.

1009
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,334
If we don't find
Lemansky

1010
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,535
before he comes in,
or he gets out of the country,

1011
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:22,334
we're gonna lose our
last... chance at nailing Vic

1012
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:23,367
before this case
seals off.

1013
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,501
What do you want
me to do, Jon?

1014
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:32,868
He trusts you now, right,
when it comes to me?

1015
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,401
Maybe.

1016
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:38,067
I want you to scare him.

1017
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:40,401
I want you to make Vic
lead us to him.

1018
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:41,227
How?

1019
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:47,933
We both failed at trying
to nail Mackey

1020
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,134
on old business.

1021
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,100
They don't crack.

1022
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,334
They don't
turn on each other.

1023
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:55,300
Good for them.

1024
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,100
The way to get him

1025
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,801
is we gotta catch him
in the act.

1026
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:02,843
With Lemansky AWOL,

1027
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:04,670
Vic knows he's got eyes
and ears all over him.

1028
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,000
He's not gonna do
anything stupid.

1029
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,033
Unless he thinks he's got
one last mess

1030
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,033
to clean up.

1031
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,334
What mess?

1032
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,367
There's a detective
I spoke to here.

1033
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,601
He suspects
that the Strike Team

1034
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,234
robbed an Armenian
money train.

1035
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,567
Wagenbach.

1036
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:20,768
Yeah, but he doesn't
know it was Dutch.

1037
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:22,768
You gotta make him believe

1038
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,967
that Lemansky gave it up
for witness protection.

1039
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:28,567
It'll put him in motion.

1040
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,572
We follow him.
We catch him

1041
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,347
trying to help
Lemansky escape

1042
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:34,134
and nail them for
harboring a fugitive.

1043
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,067
It won't be the amount
of time that they deserve,

1044
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:37,701
but it'll be enough time

1045
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:39,701
to make them
lose their badges,

1046
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:42,200
and get them off the street.

1047
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:43,401
Catch them in the act.

1048
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,234
That's gonna
give us leverage.

1049
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,701
Lemansky, he may have
held his tongue,

1050
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:48,067
but the other ones,

1051
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:49,834
they might not
be as strong.

1052
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,234
David.

1053
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,300
It's time to put the mess
that Mackey made

1054
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,701
behind both of us.

1055
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:05,234
Lemansky's talking.

1056
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,501
That's bullshit.

1057
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,300
Is the Armenian
money train bullshit?

1058
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:09,667
Because that's what
he gave them.

1059
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:10,900
He's coming clean.

1060
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:12,601
There's nothing
to come clean about.

1061
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,601
That explains
where your 65,000

1062
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,337
unaccounted for
dollars comes from, huh?

1063
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,192
Look, he's tired.
He's scared.

1064
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:21,765
He doesn't want to die
at the hands of Antwon Mitchell.

1065
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:23,967
The D.A. said he's got to give
them something on the team.

1066
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:25,401
I guess he's agreed.

1067
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,267
Lem would never
agree to that.

1068
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,967
D.A. gave him no choice.

1069
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,000
He has to
give you guys up.

1070
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:33,401
And now all this bullshit
can blow back on me.

1071
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:35,567
Now you gotta get
a message to your boy.

1072
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,000
Tell him to
shut the hell up.

1073
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,100
Can you do that, hmm?

1074
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,810
If you can speak to him,
can you convince him

1075
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:44,089
to keep his mouth shut?

1076
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:45,975
Yes.

1077
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,367
Then do it,
for Christ's sake.

1078
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:51,701
I don't know
where he is.

1079
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:54,000
You know, Kavanaugh
is out of control.

1080
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,167
With Lemansky
unaccounted for,

1081
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,267
he's got
the chief's ear.

1082
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,667
And now the D.A.
is smelling blood.

1083
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,100
All of ours.

1084
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,514
I shouldn't be telling you any of this,

1085
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,918
but you've
threatened me,

1086
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:05,038
so now I've told you
everything I know.

1087
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,634
Now start
cleaning this up.

1088
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:18,734
We'll look the other
way on solicitation,

1089
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,734
but you gotta
make a statement

1090
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,967
about Spank's involvement in
the robbery and the beating.

1091
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:26,067
Do a little time yourself
for the stick-up.

1092
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:29,100
No. Spank wasn't there
when the cabbie got rolled.

1093
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,734
If you're
afraid of Spank,

1094
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:32,000
we'll protect you.

1095
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,033
He will not hurt you.

1096
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,401
You guys just see
pimp and hooker.

1097
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,601
That's not who we are.

1098
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,933
Yeah, says the hooker
letting pimp daddy

1099
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,447
drag her into
the shit with him.

1100
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:41,900
No, actually,
he dragged me out.

1101
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:43,033
He dragged me out

1102
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,567
of the steaming
shitpiles

1103
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:49,401
of a superficial,
empty...

1104
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:51,667
everything.

1105
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:52,834
And then
he hosed me off,

1106
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,967
and he held me.

1107
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,033
And he made me whole.

1108
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,834
I had nothing.
I was nothing.

1109
00:45:57,933 --> 00:45:59,401
Before I met him.

1110
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,734
According to your sister,

1111
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,067
you had a pretty nice condo.

1112
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:06,200
You equate a roof
over your head to love?

1113
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:09,067
What exactly
does equal love?

1114
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,467
Do you see the wrinkles
on my face?

1115
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:17,734
Do you see them?

1116
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:18,493
Yes.

1117
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,634
Well, Spank doesn't.

1118
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:25,567
I understand you not
wanting to be away

1119
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:27,234
from your, uh...

1120
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,567
boyfriend.

1121
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:29,834
But what do you think

1122
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,501
is gonna happen
when you go to jail?

1123
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,000
Because we both know
that your man

1124
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:34,167
is just gonna
set his sights

1125
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,300
on the next piece of
Century City ass

1126
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,701
that comes his way.

1127
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:39,033
Shut your mouth!

1128
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,367
Shut your
goddamn mouth!

1129
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:42,134
Who do you think you are?

1130
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,367
You don't know us.

1131
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,667
You don't know us.
How dare you.

1132
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:47,033
Let go of me!

1133
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,933
No, no, no.
Let's just sit down.

1134
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,601
You don't know me!

1135
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:51,768
Let go of me.

1136
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,267
Sit down.

1137
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:55,834
The girl just gave you up.

1138
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,267
Says it was all
your idea,

1139
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:58,758
and you're the one
that beat up the John.

1140
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:00,667
I know that
didn't happen.

1141
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,200
Oh, she put the claws
in you, right?

1142
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:05,701
You shouldn't let no
woman do you like that.

1143
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:06,967
Someone like Tori.

1144
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,900
Smart, educated,
good job.

1145
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,801
How do you turn out
a girl like that?

1146
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,667
Any punk can get
some crack ho

1147
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,501
to go down on dick.

1148
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:22,100
But how do I get a little
pink toe from Westwood

1149
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:23,334
to do what I say

1150
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,900
whenever I say.

1151
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:30,167
Every chick's got a hole
in her heart.

1152
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:33,501
And it's connected to
the one between her legs.

1153
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,701
I just figure out
how to fill it.

1154
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:38,401
And then I feed it to her.

1155
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:40,367
And I keep
feeding it to her.

1156
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:42,334
'Til it's overflowing.

1157
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,667
Until she can't live
without it.

1158
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:47,667
And then,
I take it away.

1159
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,601
That makes me God.

1160
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,234
Tori was easy.

1161
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,234
Her fiance
left her last year

1162
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,900
for some young blood bitch.

1163
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,300
I just kept telling
old girl

1164
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:58,801
she was still
the prom queen

1165
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:00,534
like back in the day.

1166
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:01,985
And that white
faggot dude,

1167
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:03,667
he didn't have eyes
to see.

1168
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:05,667
Sooner or later,

1169
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:07,634
all bitches break.

1170
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:09,200
Every goddamn one.

1171
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:11,667
That's if you got game.

1172
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:13,667
And that's why
she's your whore?

1173
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:17,434
If you born a woman,
I can make you my ho.

1174
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:19,234
Which is why she's saying

1175
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,334
I had nothing to do
with no illegal shit.

1176
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,601
Now that y'all got some
pimpology,

1177
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,601
no charge,

1178
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,100
my black ass is out
of here, right?

1179
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:45,134
Anyone here believe
Lem cut a deal?

1180
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,200
Maybe he felt like
he had no choice.

1181
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:49,787
I mean, he's out there
in the wind alone.

1182
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,300
Becca's probably
pushing it.

1183
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,933
He has no idea about
this ranch in San Ignacio.

1184
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,401
Or the money we're gonna
be funneling to him.

1185
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:57,742
Becca told you
he took a deal?

1186
00:48:57,815 --> 00:48:58,401
No.

1187
00:48:58,467 --> 00:48:59,434
Aceveda.

1188
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,401
Aceveda?

1189
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:02,065
He's got a stake
in this, too.

1190
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:03,098
Not like we do.

1191
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,267
He could be
full of shit, man.

1192
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:05,334
Look, the truth is,

1193
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,801
we can't know what's inside Lem's head

1194
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:08,534
until we see him
face to face.

1195
00:49:08,601 --> 00:49:09,952
We need an exit strategy.

1196
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:11,200
How are we gonna
get out of this?

1197
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:12,442
We don't need
an exit strategy.

1198
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:13,634
We need to fill Lem in.

1199
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,467
On the cash, the ranch.

1200
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:16,734
The lines
of communication.

1201
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:17,933
He's right.

1202
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,601
You know Lem,
he's been in the dark

1203
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,467
as much as we've been.

1204
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:23,667
And if Lem is talking,

1205
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:25,734
it's because he believes

1206
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:28,000
that Antwon has marked him
as a dead man

1207
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,467
behind bars.

1208
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:30,734
Now, once he knows

1209
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,801
what we've pulled
together for him,

1210
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:35,234
he'll go along.

1211
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,667
He will.

1212
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:43,768
We go to the spot.

1213
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:46,567
If he doesn't show...

1214
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,933
assume he made the deal.

1215
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,401
And then what?

1216
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,000
If he does show,

1217
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:56,634
then we'll
take his temperature.

1218
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,834
And make sure he's still
solidly on board.

1219
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,634
He'll be on board.

1220
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,734
Lem trusts us.

1221
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,334
He trusts us.

1222
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:08,534
And I still trust Lem.

1223
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:09,933
I do.

1224
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:21,734
Where's Vendrell?

1225
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,634
Shit. They're taking
different cars.

1226
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:25,200
I'll take Mackey.

1227
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,034
Ronnie, I got a tail.
I'm trying to lose him.

1228
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,914
- You sure?
- It's pretty far back but he's there.

1229
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,680
Watch your back, man.

1230
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,668
Looks like I got one, too.

1231
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,768
<i>Call Shane.
Give him a heads up.

1232
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,134
Yeah.

1233
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:04,334
Vic and I
both have tails.

1234
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:05,334
Shit.

1235
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,439
Yeah, I'm looking.

1236
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:09,823
We gotta lose him without
looking like we're trying to lose him.

1237
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,042
Take your time.

1238
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:14,114
- We can't lead Kavanaugh to Lem.
- I don't see anyone on me yet.

1239
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:16,134
Vic says, whoever
loses his tail first,

1240
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,734
gets to Lem, moves him
someplace safe,

1241
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,334
'til we can all regroup.

1242
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:20,734
<i>Got it.

1243
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:01,167
Jesus, am I glad to see you.

1244
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:02,567
Man, how you doing?

1245
00:52:02,613 --> 00:52:04,370
- We gotta get out of here.
- What's going on?

1246
00:52:04,423 --> 00:52:05,900
Kavanaugh's got a tail
on Vic and Ronnie.

1247
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:07,495
He could have an eye
up in the sky.

1248
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:09,167
Follow me to the old
body shop

1249
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:10,833
that closed down.
The one on Mission, OK?

1250
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,067
All right, man.

1251
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:22,833
Captain.

1252
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,833
I've been reviewing
officer Hanlon's package.

1253
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,967
Julien's T.O. report.

1254
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:31,768
You ignored a
recommendation for dismissal.

1255
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,668
Right. You know, with all
due respect to Julien,

1256
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,034
you'll find, as I did, that
he's a little tightly wound.

1257
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,367
Suffice it to say,

1258
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:40,634
I felt he was too tough
on Tina,

1259
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:42,101
and she deserved
a second chance.

1260
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:43,867
Two counts
of excessive force,

1261
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:45,634
contamination
of crime scenes,

1262
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:49,134
failure to identify an
undercover officer in the field.

1263
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,567
Seems more like
a sixth chance.

1264
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,200
She's still learning
her field work.

1265
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,167
But her instincts are good.

1266
00:52:54,234 --> 00:52:57,034
That's why Dutch agreed
to take her under his wing.

1267
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,567
She's very intuitive.

1268
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,401
I'm calling
her PBA rep.

1269
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:07,334
Start the paperwork
for dismissal.

1270
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:10,100
You know, you may not
want to do that.

1271
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:13,900
Tina and I, we...

1272
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:15,467
made an arrangement.

1273
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:18,867
Someone was ripping off
the gourmet quick-mealer.

1274
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:20,034
I figured it was
an inside job,

1275
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,234
so I put a nanny cam
in the locker room.

1276
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:24,933
There are photos of officer
Hanlon in her skivvies

1277
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
that got out
into the world.

1278
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,291
The important thing is
is that Dutch and I

1279
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,768
handled it quietly
and efficiently.

1280
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,634
Uh, all I did
was find the pictures,

1281
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,267
bring them
to Steve's attention.

1282
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:35,267
I had nothing to do with--

1283
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:37,249
Oh, please, you helped
cover up this mess

1284
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:39,900
for a shot
in Hanlon's panties.

1285
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,032
Asshole.

1286
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:43,098
Look, you want to spend
your first month on the job

1287
00:53:43,177 --> 00:53:44,601
overseeing
a full-time lawsuit?

1288
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,933
Ruining several careers,
Wagenbach's included?

1289
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,334
You go right ahead.

1290
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,367
Asshole.

1291
00:54:21,768 --> 00:54:23,800
I never thought
it'd come to this.

1292
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,734
Hasn't come
to anything yet.

1293
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,401
What now?

1294
00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:37,134
I'll go back and get
Vic and Ronnie.

1295
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,167
We got a way for you
to get to Mexico.

1296
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,000
What, like Gilroy?

1297
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:43,534
No, man.
The man died alone.

1298
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:44,601
I'm not going that route.

1299
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:46,100
You're not
a miserable drunk.

1300
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,467
It's gonna be different.

1301
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,833
No. It won't.

1302
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,167
It won't.

1303
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:53,367
Look, I'm not going.

1304
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,334
No more running.

1305
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:57,844
Oh, so you spend
the rest of your life

1306
00:54:57,923 --> 00:54:59,933
looking over your shoulder
for Antwon Mitchell?

1307
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,100
You in Mexico
is the only thing

1308
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,634
that keeps us all safe.
Especially you.

1309
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:04,567
How the hell am I
going to live in Mexico?

1310
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,067
We got it all
figured out.

1311
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:07,134
How?

1312
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,134
San Ignacio.

1313
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,590
What the hell is that?
Some shithole?

1314
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,967
No, man. It's a ranch.

1315
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:12,534
Up in the mountains.

1316
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,367
We got a federale that's
going to get you there.

1317
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:16,367
It's beautiful, man.

1318
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:17,567
It's going
to be peaceful.

1319
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:19,098
We got money parked
in an account for you.

1320
00:55:19,177 --> 00:55:20,167
It's all set up.

1321
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,200
Mara and I even kicked in
5 grand for you.

1322
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:25,768
I don't want that.

1323
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:26,867
It's just a start.

1324
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:28,601
We'll keep skimming
off the street, man.

1325
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:29,634
We'll keep you
hooked up.

1326
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,668
I can't.

1327
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:33,634
I can't.
I can't do that.

1328
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:36,501
It's all in play.

1329
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:37,900
Trust me, man.
It's gonna work.

1330
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,034
It's gonna work.

1331
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,234
There's a way for me
to take the hit solo.

1332
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:43,967
No, there's not, man.
No, there's not.

1333
00:55:44,034 --> 00:55:45,401
Man, Kavanaugh.

1334
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,267
Aceveda, the D.A.

1335
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,234
There's no other
deal to make.

1336
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:52,534
They're gonna make you
give us up.

1337
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:58,198
Maybe not now.
Maybe a year from now.

1338
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:00,496
But man, you got one chance
to get out of here.

1339
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:03,867
Take it, man. Take that chance,
right now. Take it.

1340
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:05,334
I got it figured out.

1341
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,734
Why'd you even
come back here tonight

1342
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,634
if you weren't
planning on leaving?

1343
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,134
I came to see you guys.

1344
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:27,167
Don't do this, man.

1345
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,701
Look, where's Vic?

1346
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:31,267
I want to talk
to Vic.

1347
00:56:32,634 --> 00:56:34,501
He'll call when
he loses his tail.

1348
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:38,200
We can't let Kavanaugh
catch us with you, man.

1349
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:59,167
Mara's pregnant again.

1350
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:02,167
No shit.

1351
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:06,452
Yeah, yeah.
Almost 3 months.

1352
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,501
I wasn't supposed to
say anything to anybody

1353
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,034
until next week,
but, uh...

1354
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,100
Hey, congratulations.

1355
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,634
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1356
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,000
That's another
mouth to feed.

1357
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,127
Mara's gonna be laid up
near the end,

1358
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,717
so I'm gonna have to...

1359
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:27,267
have to step it up,
you know?

1360
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,234
I hope I get to see
the little guy.

1361
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,601
Or girl.

1362
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:39,067
Little girl, huh?

1363
00:57:40,234 --> 00:57:41,467
Yeah.

1364
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:45,434
Yeah. A little girl.

1365
00:57:48,634 --> 00:57:50,634
Hey, I'm gonna
be all right.

1366
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:53,134
Shane.

1367
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:55,301
Yeah.

1368
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,334
Shane.

1369
00:57:56,401 --> 00:57:58,334
I'm gonna be all right.

1370
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,234
It's all about
family, right?

1371
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:11,467
Look, what if Vic and Ronnie
can't shake the tail?

1372
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:17,070
Maybe they doubled back
to the Barn.

1373
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,640
I'll go check it out,
all right?

1374
00:58:24,897 --> 00:58:26,000
Move your car.

1375
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,634
Get it out of sight.

1376
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,968
Did you get enough
to eat today?

1377
00:58:36,074 --> 00:58:37,399
No, man. I'm hungry.

1378
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:38,750
I brought you some food.

1379
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,127
Thanks.

1380
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:12,169
Thanks, man.

1381
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:18,453
My favourite.

1382
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,934
Shane? Shane!

1383
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:06,121
I'm sorry.

1384
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,208
Shane...

1385
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:19,351
I'm sorry, buddy...

1386
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,233
I'm so sorry...

1387
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:34,798
Lem?

1388
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:38,773
Lem, I'm sorry!

1389
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,849
But I had to, right?

1390
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:47,703
But you know I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, man.

1391
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:00,865
Oh, God!

1392
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:40,241
What are we gonna do
if Lem doesn't show?

1393
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:41,860
He's gonna show.

1394
01:01:41,973 --> 01:01:43,258
He will.

1395
01:01:52,302 --> 01:01:53,578
Hey...

1396
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:56,697
I had a tail.

1397
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,807
- Took me a while to shake it.
- Yeah.

1398
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:01,408
- Lem hadn't shown, huh?
- He's late.

1399
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,040
But he'll be here.

1400
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:15,554
Hey!

1401
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:17,393
It's your lucky day.

1402
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,594
The cab driver can't ID
and she won't testify against you.

1403
01:02:21,058 --> 01:02:22,607
Only thing to testify about

1404
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:24,726
is my love for that girl right there.

1405
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:26,734
I'm gettin' you out of here soon, baby.

1406
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,670
Yeah, get yourself out of here.

1407
01:02:28,776 --> 01:02:30,058
Take him out, will ya?

1408
01:02:31,558 --> 01:02:32,816
Dutch,

1409
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:35,090
I spoke to your ex-partner,
the new captain,

1410
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:37,765
and she says
she trusts your instincts, so...

1411
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:40,280
she wants me to increase
the number of hours I trail you.

1412
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,990
I just wanted to say thank you
for putting in the good word.

1413
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,364
Yeah, sure.

1414
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:47,155
Okay.

1415
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:50,659
Hey, hmm...

1416
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:58,362
You know why you're gonna be
such a great detective someday?

1417
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,865
Because most people don't realize
how damn smart you are.

1418
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,994
They just see the surface.

1419
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:07,602
They cannot get paste your looks
to see what you're really about.

1420
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,157
I know, right?

1421
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:12,499
But you're not nearly
as smart as you need to be.

1422
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:15,324
The help I'm offering
doesn't come along every day.

1423
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:19,498
And if I'm gonna spend
my valuable time focusing it on you,

1424
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:20,981
well...

1425
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:23,884
you'd better make it worth my while.

1426
01:03:25,246 --> 01:03:26,094
Sure.

1427
01:03:26,525 --> 01:03:28,388
Definitely, of course.

1428
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,178
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1429
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,096
- He did it.
- No.

1430
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:52,048
He's not coming.

1431
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,540
Maybe he had some heat on him,

1432
01:03:54,637 --> 01:03:55,991
he had to hide.

1433
01:03:56,137 --> 01:03:59,552
He's coming,
or he's gonna get a message to us.

1434
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,215
And we're gonna wait for him,
gonna give him more time.

1435
01:04:03,685 --> 01:04:06,128
Kavanaugh could be
at our houses right now man,

1436
01:04:06,225 --> 01:04:08,281
we have got to get out of here!

1437
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,325
Vic.

1438
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:26,486
Go home.

1439
01:04:27,624 --> 01:04:30,285
Check around,
look for anything incriminating.

1440
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:32,679
Don't take any chances.

1441
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,728
No.

1442
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:38,447
We're gonna wait.

1443
01:05:07,717 --> 01:05:08,597
Yeah?

1444
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:16,128
The transfert is denied.

1445
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:18,426
I need my best detective on this.

1446
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,434
Grenades.

1447
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:28,055
The thing this morning.

1448
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,934
El Salvadorans. The leader's missing.

1449
01:05:31,055 --> 01:05:33,765
His name is Guardo.
Start there.

1450
01:05:44,693 --> 01:05:46,120
Oh my God!

1451
01:06:53,437 --> 01:06:55,784
Vic, Vic...
You can't touch anything.

1452
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:42,658
You're happy?

1453
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:57,425
Are you happy now,

1454
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,729
detective Mackey?

1455
01:08:11,036 --> 01:08:13,190
Stop it!
Stop!

1456
01:08:18,937 --> 01:08:20,789
Break 'em up!

1457
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:21,885
Come on.

1458
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:25,288
That's enough, come on.

1459
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:29,787
Break it up!

1460
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:33,605
Get off of him.

1461
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:51,372
Calm down, calm down...

1462
01:09:07,034 --> 01:09:09,707
We're gonna find out who did this.

1463
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:12,277
And we're gonna kill him.
