1
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:16,375
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,540
Kleavon Gardner. Questioned
in four separate homicides.

3
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:20,507
Kleavon is not
a killer.

4
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:22,807
I'm his sister. Believe me, I'd know it.

5
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:24,208
We're releasing
your brother.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,408
Deep down
you know we're right.

7
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:26,707
There's something
wrong with him.

8
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:27,874
You just don't want
to see it.

9
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,707
Now that you know,
things will add up.

10
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:31,841
About 6 months ago,
we found this kilo.

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,974
Pure heroin from the glove
compartment of your car.

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,041
But you never
logged it into evidence.

13
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,408
Lem got picked up
by IAD.

14
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,108
Got him wearing
a wire.

15
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:40,640
Kavanaugh is planning
to formally arrest you.

16
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,174
When that happens, we'll
be ready to bail you out.

17
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,475
Have you hired
a lawyer?

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,741
You need to
shift perception.

19
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:46,907
Make internal affairs
look like

20
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:48,341
they're hurting
good guys.

21
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:49,941
I got Mackey making a
deal with the russians.

22
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,507
Hot prescription drugs.

23
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,874
These are good faith.

24
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:56,074
Freeze!

25
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:02,241
What the hell
is going on?

26
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:04,841
IAD just shit
all over our sting.

27
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,141
What's this?

28
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,441
I don't know where you got
your intel, but it's wrong.

29
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,475
He ran the whole operation
by me this afternoon.

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,475
I guess IAD will spin
any kind of fiction

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,941
to stain good cops bad.

32
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,774
Keep coming.

33
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,041
All right.

34
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:34,274
It's gonna be tight.
Is there another way in?

35
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,607
No. This is it.

36
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,108
All right.
Come down here, guys.

37
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,774
Whoa! Watch it.

38
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,774
Delicate machinery, people.

39
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,640
Careful, guys.

40
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,308
Watch the turn.
Watch the turn.

41
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,574
Coming through.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,941
Heads up.

43
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,141
Watch your back,
Dutch Boy.

44
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,540
What's going on here?

45
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:00,841
You gotta be
kidding me.

46
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:01,841
No. Hey, guys.

47
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,174
Just be careful
on the landing.

48
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,141
I don't want you
to scratch the leather.

49
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,574
Huh? After our big
pharmaceutical bust,

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,874
the brass put through
some of my purchase orders

51
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,274
they've been sitting on.

52
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,507
Now you'll be
sitting in style.

53
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,274
Anything for us?

54
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,241
Careful. Come on.

55
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,441
I give that couch
two weeks

56
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:31,674
before we're
moving it down here.

57
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,774
I'm not wired.

58
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:33,841
You're what?

59
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:34,941
Look. I'm not wired.

60
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,607
I don't get this guy.
What did Kavanaugh say?

61
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:37,774
I can't find him.

62
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,941
I went by the hotel.
It's empty.

63
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,507
I called his cell, office,
there's no answer.

64
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:41,907
Why hasn't he
arrested you?

65
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:43,108
Maybe he never
had a solid case.

66
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,375
You think
he's packing it in?

67
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,341
What, pull the plug
on the investigation?

68
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:50,375
Until we're sure, we
act like it's still on.

69
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,707
But I like the feeling
I'm getting.

70
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,008
Hey, I hate to start
your morning with this,

71
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:57,507
but multiple gang homicide.

72
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,507
Beautiful.

73
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:01,041
Better than
a strong cup of coffee.

74
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,208
Set tripping?

75
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:10,607
Drive by.

76
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,540
Male victims are
affiliated with Bop Street

77
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:13,974
judging by the ink.

78
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,774
That's what happens when
you cross enemy lines.

79
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,408
This turf's been
gang neutral

80
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,308
since Antwon's crew
slithered out of dodge.

81
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,308
Any witnesses?

82
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,941
Yeah. Friends of
the deceased.

83
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,074
And about as helpful.

84
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,874
Yo...

85
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,874
you two see anything?

86
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,974
Yeah. Brothas
having courage.

87
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,807
My boys went down
wet like real G's.

88
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,607
Do you know
who did this?

89
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,074
Some hater.

90
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:37,208
They almost capped
me and Moni too.

91
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,408
Beyond that,
I couldn't say.

92
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,041
Did you get a good
look at the car?

93
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,241
No. We didn't see nothing.

94
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,540
Well, you better start
searching your memory

95
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,074
or you're gonna get
a good look

96
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,074
at the inside of our car
on the way to the station.

97
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,308
So me and my breezie
almost catch hollowpoints

98
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,807
and po-po got his foot
up my ass.

99
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,640
Ain't that some
toy white cop bullshit.

100
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,707
You better check
your color, honky.

101
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:58,341
Chair over here,
all right?

102
00:03:58,408 --> 00:03:59,475
You getting rid
of that chair?

103
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,741
You know the stuffing
in this one is shot.

104
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,674
My ass dies
a daily death.

105
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:04,574
Yeah, well, sorry.

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,907
It's headed back
to surplus.

107
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,208
Well, you can
send this one back.

108
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,375
Inventory's
expecting that one.

109
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,375
Well, well, well.

110
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,707
Pretty ballsy showing
your face around here.

111
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,874
I get to officially
notify you

112
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,774
that internal affairs is
investigating all four members

113
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,241
of your former strike team.

114
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,274
You got burned trying to
make that case already.

115
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,441
Why don't you move on?

116
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:28,741
Since all
the strike team's files,

117
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,174
all your files on them
are here,

118
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,375
I'm gonna be setting up
shop in the barn.

119
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,074
Until my investigation
is complete.

120
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,174
You're kidding me, right?

121
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,141
Most of the time.
Just not this time.

122
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:41,507
And where exactly

123
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,041
do you think you're
gonna drop anchor?

124
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,841
Well, I need some privacy.

125
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:47,241
And I don't want to restrict
any of these officers

126
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:48,741
from using
the interrogation rooms.

127
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,208
So the easiest thing
for me to do

128
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,141
is to use your office.

129
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:55,707
Excuse me, lieutenant.

130
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,674
Are you forgetting
that I'm captain here?

131
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:58,874
Acting captain.

132
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:02,640
And that entitles you to
a workspace and a phone.

133
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,174
Not a private office.

134
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:07,974
I understand the last captain
did very well right here

135
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,108
on the killing floor.

136
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,707
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

137
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,874
Scott.

138
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:18,874
Hey.

139
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,774
Get that stuff.

140
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,308
Put it over there...

141
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,108
until I can
work this shit out.

142
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,607
I didn't see nothing.
I don't know nothing.

143
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:28,874
I got nothing to say.

144
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,974
Except thank the most high
my man's ok.

145
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,308
Your man? He's a kid,
and you're not.

146
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,441
How's that work?

147
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,375
He laces me
with nice shit.

148
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,807
And got a big dick.
It's all good.

149
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,108
You're a deep one.

150
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,375
What I'm having a hard
time understanding I

151
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,108
aside from
the ghetto speak,

152
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:47,041
is why some evildoers
lit up on your peace posse

153
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,807
for no good reason.

154
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,008
Curse of the Fu Manchu.

155
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:52,874
Arrogant little prick
for only being 19, Preston.

156
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,441
That's my government name.

157
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,441
My homies call me Kasper.

158
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,441
The famous Kasper?

159
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,807
You're making quite
a name for yourself

160
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,074
these past few months
moving rock.

161
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,208
You must have me confused
with some other cat.

162
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:06,141
I hear you been working
with the rival sets.

163
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,674
Black, Brown,
One-Niner, Spook Street.

164
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,074
You're an equal
opportunity dope dealer.

165
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:11,308
Don't know about that,

166
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,941
but see, when you white
in Farmington,

167
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,941
you don't fit in.

168
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,074
So you gotta
make friends everywhere.

169
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,607
You'd make it
a whole lot easier on us

170
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:20,408
if we just put our heads
together on this.

171
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,674
Yeah, it would be.

172
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,008
But see, I ain't no
cheese-eating rodent.

173
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,475
Looks like you been gnawing
on something nasty to me.

174
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,241
Yeah.

175
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:31,640
Vic...

176
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,274
we got issues here.

177
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,475
What the hell
are you doing?

178
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,174
I know this will come
as a big surprise to you,

179
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,807
but you and your team

180
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:44,741
are the subject of
an IAD investigation

181
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,274
which I am heading up.

182
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,441
You already lost face
in front of the brass

183
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:49,640
blowing our russian bust.

184
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,640
How's this play
helping you?

185
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:52,707
I appreciate your concern,

186
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:55,241
but let me worry about that.

187
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:58,807
Don't expect
any cooperation

188
00:06:58,874 --> 00:06:59,874
from those folks
down there.

189
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,640
They're a home crowd.

190
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,907
I wouldn't want to do
anything to upset them.

191
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,041
Last thing I want to do.

192
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,507
Is rock the boat.

193
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,550
RAP PAYBACK

194
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,841
Man, if he'd
arrest me already,

195
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,975
at least then he'd have to
lay out what he's got.

196
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,271
Goddamn it.

197
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:31,371
Come in.

198
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:33,871
Hi.
Hi.

199
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:36,771
Lem, Ronnie, you remember Becca
Doyle from the Crawford case.

200
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:38,137
Yeah, sure.

201
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,571
She's representing us now.

202
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:42,304
Protecting us legally
against this nut job upstairs.

203
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,805
You lawyered up?

204
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,970
She's helping out
all of us.

205
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,404
For just such an occasion.

206
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:48,471
You're taken care of.

207
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,471
Your boy Kavanaugh's
quite the loose cannon.

208
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:54,171
Even his IAD buddies
are surprised by this move.

209
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:55,805
He's made it personal,
which helps me make the case

210
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:57,871
that you're being
unfairly targeted.

211
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,538
Oh, this looks like...

212
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:04,671
attorney client privilege.

213
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:05,937
Yes, it is.

214
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:08,771
Miss Doyle. Isn't it?

215
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:09,771
Yes.

216
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:10,871
Jon Kavanaugh.

217
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,771
I'm representing
all four of these detectives.

218
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:17,504
Make sure your communications
with them go through me.

219
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,571
Oh. It'll be my pleasure.

220
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:20,104
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

221
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:22,337
You just let me know
when you're ready, ok?

222
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,337
All right.

223
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,604
Thank you.

224
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:33,805
All right,
we're gonna concentrate

225
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,671
on doing our jobs,
let her worry about

226
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,504
whatever bullshit charges
he's trumping up.

227
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,137
The last thing you want

228
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,137
is him getting at you
through some side door.

229
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:41,771
Throws you off
your game,

230
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,271
he comes at you
on competency issues,

231
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,237
or some mistake
you make on the street.

232
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:47,104
We have some dead kids
to account for.

233
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:48,805
Kasper and his squeeze
gave us zip.

234
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,237
What's the next move?

235
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,371
The dead bangers
are Bop Street.

236
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,871
It could be
their own set whacked them

237
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:54,137
for breaking ranks.

238
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:55,438
Working with white folks.

239
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,104
That's a tree
worth shaking.

240
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,970
Appreciate what
you're doing.

241
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,072
Slip off, ho.
You got nothing to trade.

242
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,172
I've been flossin'
and pussy tossin'.

243
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,471
Hand it over.

244
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,438
Oh, shit!
Go out the back!

245
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,638
Police.

246
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:31,972
On the ground.

247
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,306
Couple of your crew
caught dirt naps today.

248
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:41,039
I'm thinking you Bop Street
boys are policing yourselves.

249
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:42,205
You tripping, man.

250
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:43,372
Then why were they
rolling with Kasper?

251
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:44,939
We a'right with Kasper.

252
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,139
Mostly.

253
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,538
As in you wanted him
and his crew mostly dead?

254
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,438
Or you're beefin'
with some other set.

255
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,772
I don't know.

256
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,638
This guy's
rank and file.

257
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,505
Look what I found.

258
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,272
We've been letting
Bop Street run game

259
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,772
as long as you
kept it low key.

260
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,306
Truce is over.

261
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,605
You tell Gunsmoke
I'm gonna shut down

262
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,172
a Bop Street rock house
every two hours

263
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,872
until I get that shooter.

264
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,738
Your clique, rival set,
doesn't matter.

265
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:10,872
We want a name.

266
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:13,072
Nice touch. Crack vials.
That's old school.

267
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,972
A name.
By the end of today.

268
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,738
Or Bop Street can start
filing for chapter 11.

269
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:22,738
Uh, no. Thank you.

270
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,205
Well, what do you know.

271
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:28,905
Robbery homicide.

272
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,306
Seems they're sniffing
around the Dutch Man.

273
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:32,905
Want to set up
an interview,

274
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,905
that's impressive.
Elite of the elite.

275
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:38,406
Well, it's not
a total surprise.

276
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,139
We've closed
some big ones.

277
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,672
The whole business with
the D.A. is behind us.

278
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,939
I guess we got some buzz.

279
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:46,172
You anyway.

280
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,139
Hey, isn't that, uh...

281
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:52,772
Fatima Gardner.

282
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:54,571
It's Kleavon's sister.

283
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:55,805
Yeah.

284
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,306
You all were pretty sure

285
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:00,505
Kleavon killed that girl
back when.

286
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,939
Lana Gregory.
Her and several others.

287
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,738
We just weren't able
to prove it.

288
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,406
I've been doing
what you said.

289
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,471
Watching and listening.

290
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:10,471
And I found this while
I was cleaning his room.

291
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,172
It's Kleavon's.

292
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,772
That's a lot of blood.

293
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:17,239
We'll check this for DNA.

294
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,272
I don't know if he's
noticed it's missing.

295
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,306
He hasn't mentioned
cutting himself,

296
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:23,072
or an accident.

297
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,538
If there's
nothing to it,

298
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:25,972
he never has to know
you were here.

299
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,605
I don't know how to
look at him anymore.

300
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:28,772
My own brother.

301
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:31,672
Just go home. Keep
doing what you're doing.

302
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,406
Don't be nervous.

303
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,638
Don't give him any reason
to think twice.

304
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:38,471
You know, she says
not to seem nervous.

305
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:39,872
How am I
supposed to do that?

306
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,705
I... I just don't know
if I can take this.

307
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,638
If we searched your
brother's room,

308
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,039
for evidence,

309
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,738
it's your house, you have every
legal right to let us inside.

310
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:53,638
Kleavon been keeping
odd hours?

311
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:56,471
Being secretive?

312
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:58,805
Nothing out of the
ordinary except the shirt.

313
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,372
His room's this way.

314
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,339
All the furniture's mine.

315
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,039
Only thing he brought
was in there.

316
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,438
Kleavon do anything else
with his time besides work?

317
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,939
Reads a little.
Watches TV.

318
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,505
Like everyone else.

319
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,505
Dear Lord.

320
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,772
Fatima?

321
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,339
Fatima?

322
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:46,838
Oh...

323
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,172
Fatima!

324
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,438
Hey. Changing
the sheets.

325
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,072
I thought you were
at the track.

326
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,306
Ah, bum day.

327
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:00,571
They only
needed me an hour.

328
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,505
Let me help. Then make me
a grilled cheese.

329
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:03,605
I got it. It's ok.

330
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:05,471
It's already done.

331
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:09,638
You all right?

332
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,538
Of course.

333
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:11,939
Come on. I'll make you
some lunch.

334
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:23,306
Can't believe
all that time and effort

335
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,471
just to get across town

336
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,105
then they send me home
after an hour.

337
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,672
You want
some pickles?

338
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:29,838
Sure.

339
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,605
Ok.

340
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:32,605
What about that...

341
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:35,705
that other job
you were looking into?

342
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,538
Manager told me
to call back next week.

343
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,505
Maybe something
will turn up.

344
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,672
Yeah.

345
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,205
You want a bottle
of 7-up?

346
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:45,705
Here it is.

347
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:47,372
You know, we need
some paper towels.

348
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,105
Where the hell
is our door?

349
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,872
The other one too.

350
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:12,139
That son of a bitch.

351
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,905
Thought you might like
a little fresh air.

352
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:16,005
Let a little
sunshine in.

353
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,505
Pretty cheap stunt.

354
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:19,505
I assume you guys have
got nothing to hide.

355
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,272
Right?

356
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,571
Anyway, with all
the confusion last week,

357
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,605
I never did get a chance
to congratulate you

358
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:27,939
on that bust.

359
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,605
Nice work.

360
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:33,105
Even if it was a little...
unorthodox.

361
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:36,905
But back to business.

362
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,738
I need to see you
in my office.

363
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,105
Not without my lawyer.

364
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,505
Becca Doyle.

365
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,838
Good call.

366
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,738
Let me know
when she gets here.

367
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:49,638
Vandrell, you got a sec?

368
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,172
Or do you need
a lawyer too?

369
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,372
No. I'm good.

370
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,805
Shane.

371
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:00,105
I'll answer whatever
questions you got.

372
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,406
I see you just bought
a new house.

373
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,139
L.A. Real Estate's Bananas.

374
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,772
You doing
a little moonlighting?

375
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,205
Security work on the side?

376
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,272
Mara's a realtor.

377
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,339
Between our two salaries,
we make due.

378
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,705
Reason I'm here is

379
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,605
I want to nail shut
the Terry Crawley file.

380
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,638
I see that.

381
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,772
That happened over
two years ago.

382
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:27,705
IAD cleared us.

383
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,372
Or didn't you hear the
squeeks in your rat hole?

384
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:33,172
Wonder if you'd mind taking
a look at a transcript.

385
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,372
Of your interview
after the shooting.

386
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,471
See if it
jars anything loose.

387
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,306
I've been looking
at your jacket.

388
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:44,838
Pretty effective cop.

389
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,306
Gotten yourself into

390
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:49,605
a couple of sketchy
situations along the way.

391
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,205
Black mark or two.

392
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:54,005
You were on your own
for a while last year.

393
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,438
Vice.

394
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,605
What made you come back
to the strike team?

395
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:00,905
I would think
that you would want

396
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,738
to make a name for yourself flying solo.

397
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,039
Like you dribbling shit
all over us

398
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,005
to make a name for yourself?

399
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:09,306
All the same.

400
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:12,039
Living in Mackey's
shadow all the time.

401
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,005
You don't feel that

402
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:17,505
he was trying to get
you back into the fold

403
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,372
so that he could get
a leash on you, do you?

404
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,905
What's here
is how it went down.

405
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:34,838
So there was just
you, Vic, Terry,

406
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:36,905
and Two Time
in that room.

407
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:38,905
Just me and Vic.

408
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:41,172
No Lemansky?

409
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,139
No Gardocki?

410
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,605
It was true then.
It's true now.

411
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,372
Thanks so much
for your help.

412
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,239
I'm gonna need you
to sign a document

413
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,905
confirming that you know
that we are reopening

414
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,672
the Terry Crawley case

415
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:59,672
and you are
under investigation.

416
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:02,939
Blow me.

417
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,638
I've talked to every
precinct in the city.

418
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,872
No recent bodies
matching Kleavon's M.O.

419
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,205
You gonna do something
with that?

420
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,406
Just got off the phone
with robbery-homicide.

421
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,471
Turns out they didn't
just find me.

422
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:28,571
A veteran detective
recommended they review my file.

423
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:31,406
I'm gonna check
missing persons again.

424
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:32,571
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

425
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,105
I thought robbery-homicide
was your dream job.

426
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:35,738
I didn't need your help.

427
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,571
There is buzz.

428
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,571
You guys have
a Fatima Gardner

429
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:41,306
sign in to see you
this morning?

430
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,039
Yeah.

431
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,406
Her brother
just reported her missing.

432
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,272
Yeah.

433
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,738
Captain left
a few things up here.

434
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:56,905
He asked me to get them.

435
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,039
Sure.

436
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,939
Anything you need.

437
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,805
I pulled this
off the wall downstairs.

438
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,005
Pretty demeaning,
don't you think?

439
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:10,339
Doesn't really
bother me.

440
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:12,406
It's just boys
being boys.

441
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,905
A lot of money on Vic
being your baby's daddy.

442
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:16,239
Everybody's
got an opinion.

443
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,638
Heard a lot of rumors
about the two of you.

444
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:22,272
Are you saying
that they aren't true?

445
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,838
Look, I'm sure
you won't blame me

446
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:25,672
when I don't discuss
stupid gossip

447
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,705
about my personal life
with IAD.

448
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:31,406
Sexual relationships
between department personnel

449
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,205
need to be divulged
in a timely manner.

450
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:35,571
According to
the employee handbook.

451
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,139
Failure to do so

452
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:39,471
can result in suspensions.

453
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,838
Even demotions.

454
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,571
You just got
a pay bump recently.

455
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,905
Didn't you?

456
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,738
Come on. There's no
relationship between me and Vic.

457
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,339
Should I
make this official?

458
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:56,205
Because I can do that.

459
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:59,605
Widen my investigation.

460
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,939
Vic and I had a thing, ok?

461
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,438
It's in the past.

462
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,605
When was that?

463
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:13,105
8 or 9 months ago?

464
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,438
You want to get
a court order

465
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,005
to draw blood,
go right ahead,

466
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,306
but this is
none of your business.

467
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,505
You still have to disclose

468
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:21,005
your relationship
with Mackey.

469
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,072
Fill out the forms today.

470
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,805
And I'll overlook
the tardiness.

471
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,872
Hey, Vic.
Checked out our next

472
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:30,005
Bop Street target
on Hoover.

473
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:31,438
Doors and windows
are fortified.

474
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,005
All right. Have Ronnie
get a doorknocker.

475
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,205
Flash bangs, too.

476
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,471
All right, Vic.

477
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,972
Hey. Hang on.

478
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:42,272
Gunsmoke.

479
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,672
We're just about
to pay a visit

480
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:45,805
to another one
of your crack palaces.

481
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:48,072
Man, I don't know
who capped my peoples.

482
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,471
But I tell you
straight up,

483
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:50,872
it wasn't no
Bop Street niggas.

484
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,538
After Hoover,
we're gonna stop by

485
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,939
your Temple Street
smoke house.

486
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:56,372
That'll bring your one
day loss to what, 12k?

487
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:57,972
You know what it does
to my street cred

488
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,571
even walking into
this pig farm?

489
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,805
Oink when you got
something we can use.

490
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:02,905
Hold up. Hold up.

491
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:04,272
Come here.

492
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,738
Tell them.

493
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:10,406
I'm chillin' at
homegirls around the way,

494
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:12,939
hear shots, see these
two vatos drive off.

495
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,005
What'd they
look like?

496
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:17,039
Vatos. You know.
Shaved heads.

497
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,272
White tees.

498
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,538
Guy driving had L.A.
tattooed all up in here.

499
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:23,039
But I didn't get a good
look at the dude shooting.

500
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,039
What kind of car?

501
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,505
Old. I don't know.

502
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:29,039
But they was riding on gold
anodized hundred spoke D's.

503
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,705
I know my wheels.

504
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,105
So we straight now?

505
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:36,072
Not yet.

506
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,205
How's a punk ass wigger
like Kasper

507
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,072
get respect from
a crew hard as Bop Street?

508
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,105
I thought he was a poser
myself for a minute.

509
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,538
White boy
got business skills.

510
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,538
Split 50-50 off top.

511
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:46,972
Folks is gettin' paid.

512
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,272
Comes with these names
for the product.

513
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,339
Pink yo, yellow fever.

514
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:53,805
Same old shit
only different color caps.

515
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:55,239
You moving
Kasper's product

516
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:56,939
out of the place we
took down this morning?

517
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,471
Look, man. Fiends want
what Kasper's selling.

518
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,105
Can't argue
with the free market.

519
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,672
Looking forward to that
truce again, fellas.

520
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:10,705
Hey, Vic.
You got a second?

521
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,072
I'll get on those rims.

522
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,638
What's up?

523
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:18,705
That guy from IAD got all over
me about department policy.

524
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:21,139
Disclosure of personal
relationships on the job.

525
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:22,406
None of his business.

526
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:23,638
Yeah, well, he's
pushing me really hard.

527
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:27,072
I can't take a suspension
or pay cut right now.

528
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:28,939
I gotta notify Billings.

529
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,239
Just wanted you to know.

530
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,175
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

531
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:39,975
Lunch time.

532
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,442
Said she was gonna run out
for some soda, never came back.

533
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:43,945
Family drinks
a lot of soda.

534
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,111
Seem to remember
you were out for soda

535
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:48,278
when Lana Gregory was killed.

536
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,679
It's only a few hours,
grown woman.

537
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,245
Bit premature
to call the police.

538
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,378
I know my sister.

539
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,111
She say she'll be back,
she'll be back.

540
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:57,378
Mind if we look around?

541
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,478
Wouldn't have
called you if I did.

542
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,645
I'll take her room,
you take his.

543
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:15,845
Fatima's room's clean.

544
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:17,812
Back door's unlocked.
What do you have?

545
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,679
It's what I don't have.

546
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:20,879
Kleavon's death kit.

547
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:23,745
Latex gloves, knife,
duct tape.

548
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,312
It's gone.

549
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,145
I was here earlier.

550
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,378
What?

551
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:32,478
Spur of the moment.
Fatima gave her consent.

552
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,812
You searched a murder
suspect's house without backup?

553
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,478
What if Kleavon
had showed up?

554
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:39,312
I hid in the closet.
He didn't see me.

555
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:40,779
I slipped out
the back door.

556
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,145
Jesus. If you're wrong,

557
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,879
and he confronted her
after you left...

558
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:44,979
I shouldn't have
come alone.

559
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:46,412
But I wasn't sure
you were up to it.

560
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,445
Stress is a trigger.

561
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:49,012
I saw you were
hurting this morning.

562
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:50,979
I am fine.

563
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:54,378
Got a neighbor
says he saw a prowler

564
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:55,779
exiting the backyard
this morning.

565
00:22:55,845 --> 00:22:58,078
Wearing what he called
a hundred dollar suit.

566
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,412
I'll deal
with the neighbor.

567
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:03,679
If you think
I'm up to it.

568
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,645
Take Kleavon to the
barn and get a statement.

569
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:08,178
I paid $300 for this suit.

570
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:14,278
Hey.

571
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,111
Who's this ?

572
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,445
It's Terry Crowley.

573
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:24,946
One of my guys
killed by a drug dealer

574
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,078
a couple years ago.

575
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:27,178
That is one version.

576
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:29,111
Terry was working
for justice.

577
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,946
Investigating allegations
of the relationship

578
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:33,645
between drug dealers
and your clients.

579
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,845
You have
a different version?

580
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,979
Detective Mackey

581
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,579
either acted alone,

582
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:39,545
or with other members
of his team,

583
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:42,211
killed detective Crawley.

584
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:44,679
Or put him in a position
to be killed.

585
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:46,111
Just like that russian
I was gonna murder

586
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:48,812
before you blew our sting?

587
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,078
Any evidence or are you
all attitude?

588
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,612
In due course.

589
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,111
These theatrics
why you wanted to see us?

590
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:00,679
I'm sure the three of us
have better things to do.

591
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:02,979
Yes.

592
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:05,378
I'm officially informing you

593
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,012
you are under investigation
for the death of Terry Crowley

594
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,579
and other allegations
of corruption.

595
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,879
You have a right
to a PBA rep,

596
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:12,879
or a lawyer.

597
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:15,046
I see you already
got one.

598
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,679
And a good one.

599
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,512
Please, could you get him
to initial here and here

600
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:19,979
and his signature there.

601
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:27,912
We'll cooperate fully,

602
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:30,812
so you can stop wasting
everyone's time, lieutenant.

603
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,378
I suppose you want
a statement.

604
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:34,012
Actually, if you could
have your clients

605
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:35,512
walk me through the house

606
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,012
where Terry Crawley
was killed,

607
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:39,012
that would be great.

608
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,145
Arrange it soon.

609
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,245
Oh, and take down
these photos.

610
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,412
Or I'll file
for harassment.

611
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:53,712
Becca.

612
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,712
I thought the headline in this
case was David against Goliath.

613
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,845
Or did this murder charge
slip your mind?

614
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:01,078
I can't talk
about this right now.

615
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:02,712
This is a big
goddamn deal.

616
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:03,912
It's all a lie.

617
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,312
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

618
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:10,879
What the hell's
going on?

619
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:12,046
He told them
to bring me in.

620
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,345
Can you take the kids?

621
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,445
You don't have to talk to him, remember?

622
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,579
I just want to
get this over with.

623
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,145
He can't compel
your cooperation.

624
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,612
If you feel uncomfortable at any time,

625
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,145
you just leave.

626
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,145
Ok.

627
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,211
Corinne.

628
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:24,046
Thanks for coming.

629
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:26,779
The children,
they can wait inside.

630
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:27,979
I can take care
of my own kids.

631
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,679
Ok.

632
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,579
This way. Upstairs.

633
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:35,912
Dad, what the hell's
going on?

634
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,779
Don't talk like that.

635
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:39,046
He's a cop, right?

636
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:40,145
Did Mom do something wrong?

637
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:43,178
No. Never.
Come on, honey.

638
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:44,278
Vic...

639
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:46,579
I, um... caught a 187
times two.

640
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,378
We need you
to get on it.

641
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:49,512
What's 187 mean?

642
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:52,145
It means Dad's gonna
find you guys a ride.

643
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,912
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

644
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:56,612
You need anything?
Can I get you something?

645
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,612
Coffee?

646
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,178
Just ask your questions.

647
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:03,579
You told me
that it's difficult

648
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,879
to make both the tuitions.

649
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,512
Yet Vic seems to appear

650
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,012
to come up with the money
all the time.

651
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:11,946
How do you think
he does that?

652
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:14,012
Overtime.

653
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:16,779
Yeah. I've checked
those paystubs.

654
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:20,312
He always has been a good
provider, wouldn't you say?

655
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,946
I guess that my change

656
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,879
now that you
split the pie.

657
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:27,178
Four ways
instead of three, huh?

658
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,378
I don't understand.

659
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:33,145
Oh, maybe...
you're not aware?

660
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:37,012
Officer Danielle Sofer,
who works here,

661
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,679
is filing paperwork admitting
to a sexual relationship

662
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:42,046
with Vic over the last
couple of years.

663
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,478
When did you get divorced?

664
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:47,645
Last year.

665
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:49,545
Right.

666
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:52,478
Officer Sofer
is now pregnant.

667
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,779
Is this another
imaginary child like Andy?

668
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:01,812
I mean, what kind of a man
says he has an autistic child

669
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,111
to a woman that has
two of her own?

670
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:04,879
How sick is that?

671
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:07,278
I didn't really like
doing that. I'm sorry.

672
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:11,412
I just needed to know what
kind of woman you are, Corinne.

673
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:14,245
Really, I mean,
this is not about me.

674
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:16,111
This is about Vic.

675
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,745
It's about you,
it's about the kids.

676
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:18,946
It's about...

677
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,679
this new baby.

678
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,245
How we got
to this place

679
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:25,078
and where we're
gonna go from here.

680
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,545
Please...

681
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,211
have a seat.

682
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:36,312
L.A. Cali-for-nia.

683
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:39,912
Same caliber
as the Bop Street hit.

684
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:40,979
It's gotta be the
shooter from this morning.

685
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:42,278
Payback's a bitch.

686
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:43,745
And karma's a whore.

687
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,612
Amado Alvaro. His place.

688
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,645
No sign
of forced entry.

689
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,445
What about
ass boy over there?

690
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,879
No ID yet.
Neighbor called 911.

691
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:52,612
Saw Alvaro's car
driving away

692
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,979
a little while after
she heard the gunshots.

693
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,078
Hoopty? Gold rims?

694
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:58,612
Yeah. '69
Olds Cutlass.

695
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,545
Black.

696
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,645
Run Alvaro's registration.

697
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,111
Put an APB out
on the car.

698
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,111
Got it.

699
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:07,078
Let me get a run on
a '69 Olds Cutlass.

700
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,845
<i>Vehicle should be rolling up
to you right now, detective.</i>

701
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,046
<i>You see it?</i>

702
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:14,312
We got it.
Nice work, Larry.

703
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:16,745
Say hello to whoever
killed L.A. and ass boy.

704
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:17,812
Who's the Chinaman?

705
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,612
I don't know. But we're gonna find out.

706
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,745
Hey, get back here!

707
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,979
Stop!

708
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:42,779
Stop!

709
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:44,779
Hey!

710
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:47,178
Hold. Hold it!

711
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:49,812
Hey, stop, dumb ass.

712
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:53,178
It's a barbed wire fence.

713
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:02,278
I didn't do nothing.

714
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:04,912
Except a double homicide.

715
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:06,545
That's crazy.
Amado's my main man.

716
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,845
Funny how you know exactly the
murders we're talking about.

717
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:10,712
We've got you fleeing
the scene of a murder

718
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:11,979
in the victim's car.

719
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,579
You take one last look
at the outside world.

720
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:16,278
Where'd you put
the murder weapon?

721
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,579
They were dead
when I got there.

722
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:19,812
I swear.

723
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:20,979
All right.
Search the car.

724
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:22,312
He was into me
for 10 grand.

725
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,345
Some white guy
named Kasper

726
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,211
was coming by
to drop off money.

727
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,211
Amado was
meeting Kasper?

728
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:30,046
I wasn't
supposed to know.

729
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,645
Kasper was coming by to pay
him for some work he did.

730
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:34,645
When I saw bodies,
I bounced.

731
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:37,078
We need to take another run at Kasper.

732
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,345
Remember Terry Crowley?

733
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,078
Sure. He was on
Vic's team.

734
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:45,612
Do you remember any change
in Vic's behavior

735
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,579
leading up to Terry's death?

736
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:50,278
No. But he was pretty
torn up afterwards.

737
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:51,211
We all were.

738
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,612
I'm sure it was terrible.

739
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:58,979
Terry was working
for justice.

740
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:02,645
Investigating your ex
husband's team for corruption.

741
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:05,912
Planting evidence,
extortion.

742
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,378
Kickbacks.
Laundry list of things.

743
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:13,512
When the Vic made Terry
as working for the feds,

744
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,979
we believe that he and
Shane Vandrell murdered him.

745
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:21,211
Vic's a lot of things,
but he's no killer.

746
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,445
Vic is a survivor.

747
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:25,245
He'll do
whatever it takes.

748
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:27,245
To protect himself,
his team,

749
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:28,612
and his family.

750
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,378
Are you really
trying to tell me

751
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:32,445
that after 12 years
of marriage,

752
00:30:32,512 --> 00:30:33,845
you don't think
that that man

753
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:37,345
is capable of pulling
the trigger on someone

754
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:39,378
who's trying to take away
everything from him?

755
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,612
Everything?

756
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,779
You need to stop this, ok?

757
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,612
Don't cry.

758
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,445
I don't want to
see you shed one

759
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,412
single tear.

760
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,412
Because tears imply
that you didn't know.

761
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:57,345
And don't you sit here
and tell me

762
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,145
that you didn't know,
Mrs. Mackey.

763
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:02,512
12 years,
you share his bed.

764
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,912
You knew.

765
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,145
You paid your mortgage.

766
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,712
You paid your bills.

767
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,779
And now he's paying
for private schools.

768
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,779
You always knew what he
was capable of.

769
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:13,178
Just like you knew
about the other women.

770
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:15,545
Don't you sit here
and cry

771
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,645
and tell me that he's
a good man

772
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:20,012
because we both know
that's bullshit.

773
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,445
You left him
because you knew.

774
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,779
And yet you protect him...

775
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:30,612
you protect him
and you lie.

776
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:31,946
You lie to me.

777
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:32,979
No.

778
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:36,779
Don't you dare sit here
shedding tears...

779
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,879
you can only do that

780
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:39,979
if you've earned
that right.

781
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:41,445
If it was all a surprise.

782
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:46,145
But it's not a surprise
to the woman

783
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,512
who knew him better
than anyone on this earth.

784
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:52,178
Is it?

785
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:59,378
Police, open up!

786
00:32:03,745 --> 00:32:04,779
Please...

787
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,145
Help me.

788
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:07,745
Please.

789
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,045
Sir, what's the problem?

790
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,111
Something's got me.

791
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,912
My dick. Please...

792
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,178
Please...

793
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:17,111
Hurry.

794
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:18,645
Sir, just relax.
I'm gonna try...

795
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:19,946
No! No! No!

796
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,779
Oh, god!

797
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,912
Oh, please.

798
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:33,312
Please hurry up!

799
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:36,512
You're caught
in a rat trap.

800
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,679
Call the paramedics.

801
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:40,512
One Tango Bravo
requesting paramedics

802
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,412
for male hispanic
mid thirties.

803
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,212
Sir, it's ok.

804
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:50,745
Paramedics are on the way.

805
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:53,712
Damn.

806
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,345
Ouch. Meanwhile,
this IAD guy

807
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:58,312
has got my nuts
in a waffle iron.

808
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,879
You say this happened
at a glory hole?

809
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:01,178
Yeah, it's pretty
sick, huh?

810
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,812
Yeah. Guy's lucky his
schlong wasn't cut off.

811
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,212
I figure the perp only
let it snap halfway.

812
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,946
Otherwise,
it would've...

813
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,145
no question.

814
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:10,412
Anyway, we're re-interviewing
the victim

815
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,712
as soon as he gets back
from the hospital.

816
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,045
Price tag. Check out the
hardware store that sold it.

817
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:15,779
Yeah. It's one of 20

818
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:17,445
in the same transaction
two days ago.

819
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,145
That's why my T.O. thought

820
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,612
you'd want to put
detectives on it.

821
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,245
I can't spare any, so why
don't you guys run with it.

822
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:24,045
It's right up
Julian's alley.

823
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,145
It's the kind of case,

824
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,912
he can really
sink his teeth into.

825
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,245
You and Fatima
had a fight.

826
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,745
She was nagging you
too much,

827
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:35,879
invading your privacy?

828
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,679
Lady, I came to you.

829
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:39,479
Now y'all want to pull me
in here about this thing.

830
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:40,645
You're wasting time.
My sister's missing.

831
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:41,879
And we're trying
to find her.

832
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,111
Then why ain't you out
talking to my neighbor

833
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:44,779
about the man he saw
at my place?

834
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,312
We're following up
on that.

835
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:48,312
To help you
find your sister,

836
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:49,745
you have to start
answering questions.

837
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,111
You gonna
cooperate or not?

838
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:53,345
Anything for her.

839
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:55,745
Give us a minute.

840
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,479
Anyone else, I'd say he's
genuinely concerned about her.

841
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:03,278
Given that he's a homicidal
sociopath, who knows.

842
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:06,846
When we get this guy, I want
to administer the needle myself.

843
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,078
Wow. He's really
under your skin.

844
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,512
I wish I could
get under his.

845
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,712
Ok. Maybe we hit Kleavon
with the bloody shirt,

846
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:13,512
the missing death kit,
we get him rattled.

847
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,946
We've already
exposed the team enough.

848
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,412
I don't want to
blow our cover.

849
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,045
She could still be
out there alive.

850
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:19,779
You know,
he could've realized

851
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:21,445
the bloody shirt
was missing,

852
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:23,178
figured out Fatima
turned on him

853
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:24,245
even if he
didn't see me.

854
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,011
Great. Now that we've
covered your ass,

855
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,846
you help me figure out
what to do.

856
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,565
4:00 this afternoon.

857
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:34,832
Where were you?

858
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,232
4:00 this afternoon?

859
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:37,498
I was at Monie's crib.

860
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:39,399
Hitting the skins
and smoking endo.

861
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,665
You don't believe me,
ask the girl.

862
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:43,199
You know
an Armado Alvaro?

863
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:44,466
No.

864
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:45,665
Shot and killed
in his home

865
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:46,765
along with a buddy.

866
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:47,798
Pretty messy.

867
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:48,798
Rest in peace.

868
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:49,898
Matches
the description

869
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,498
of someone we're
looking for in the attack

870
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,498
on you and your peeps.

871
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:54,832
Like the book says,

872
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:56,999
"No hand raised against
me shall prosper."

873
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:05,366
The other DB
is Adair Zeborio.

874
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:07,698
Vegas PD was looking at
him on a murder for hire.

875
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:08,865
Case didn't make.

876
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:09,798
Professional hit.

877
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:10,999
He didn't get
the whole job done,

878
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,065
wigger got the last word.

879
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:13,598
This punk? Unlikely.

880
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:16,531
Gilligan's still
half baked on chronic.

881
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,132
Let's keep him yapping.
See where it gets us.

882
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,332
All right.

883
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,299
Am I done here?

884
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:25,366
No, you're not done here.

885
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:26,665
Not until you tell us

886
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:27,798
what you were doing in Amado
Alvaro's apartment today.

887
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:28,932
You all are buggin'.

888
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,332
I was at my homegirl's.

889
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,798
How I'm gonna try
and kill somebody

890
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:32,999
I never even heard of?

891
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,665
And how long before you
piss of the wrong mandingo

892
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:39,332
and he wastes your pasty
wigger ass as reparations?

893
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:40,399
Streets got nothing
but love for Kasper

894
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,399
long as I'm putting
money in their pockets.

895
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,466
One bad month,
and you'll be

896
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:45,698
dangling from a balcony,

897
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:46,765
just like Vanilla Ice.

898
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,199
Another great
white wannabe.

899
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:49,631
Next thing you know,
we're gonna be hearing

900
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,165
about some shitty
rap album

901
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,898
you're gonna
want to put out.

902
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:53,932
Why you tripping on this
black-white shit?

903
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,099
Color ain't a thing.

904
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:56,199
Oh, come on, man.

905
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:57,832
This is just us
glacier monkeys.

906
00:35:57,898 --> 00:36:00,165
We both know white is
right and black is wack.

907
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:01,399
Which is why
you're rolling

908
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:02,898
with the pretty white lady.

909
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:04,099
You might talk
like a brother,

910
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:05,299
but you hang
with your own.

911
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:06,832
Not that the sisters
would show you love anyway.

912
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,432
Man, I get more black ass
than a bus bench in Compton.

913
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:10,732
Ya heard.

914
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:13,032
Hard time imagining you
holding it down

915
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,765
with some nubian
mattress monster.

916
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:17,199
Well, then you need to
ask somebody, one time.

917
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:19,199
Taneisha's
my go-to girl.

918
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,265
She let me tear her phat
ass and sugar walls up

919
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:22,332
any time I want.

920
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,898
White ho's only around
'cuz she swallows nut,

921
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:27,665
and I can take her home
to moms without any drama.

922
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:30,965
Word.

923
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:37,598
That little douche bag is
starting to piss me off.

924
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:38,965
Yeah, well, he
gave us enough

925
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,299
to put his alibi
to the taste test.

926
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,932
Pick up the girlfriend.

927
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,432
I'm gonna stick around.

928
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:47,065
You must've
seen something.

929
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,466
The assailant had to walk right past you

930
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:49,631
to leave that bathroom.

931
00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:51,199
I really didn't get
a look at him.

932
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:52,865
Get a booking slip going.

933
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:54,065
I need you to stand.
Hands behind your back.

934
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:55,099
What?

935
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,099
Stand. Hands behind
your back.

936
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:57,865
You're arresting me?

937
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,898
Public indecency.
Lewd conduct.

938
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:01,299
I'm not the one
who did anything.

939
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,032
You think maybe
I've suffered enough?

940
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,732
I have a wife
and daughters,

941
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:05,898
if they find out...

942
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:08,265
look, I don't normally
do this sort of thing.

943
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:09,898
Just once or twice
to work stuff out.

944
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,565
Please. Don't do this.

945
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,232
It'll ruin
my marriage.

946
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,032
Come on, Sir.
Come on.

947
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,999
I don't have to
say anything to you.

948
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:26,132
We were married,

949
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,032
and I'm protected
under spousal privilege.

950
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:30,932
He told you
to say that, didn't he?

951
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,531
Because it protects him.

952
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:38,832
You know you can
waive that right

953
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,732
anytime you want to, right?

954
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:45,032
Which is why he probably
didn't even tell you

955
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,199
to get an attorney,
did he?

956
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,698
He got his own lawyer.

957
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:50,665
Maybe you saw her
downstairs.

958
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:51,832
She's real pretty.

959
00:37:51,898 --> 00:37:54,032
Dark haired.

960
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:56,698
Such a good provider.

961
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:57,932
And yet...

962
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,332
he's covering his ass.

963
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,631
He's covering
his guys' ass.

964
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,865
And he leaves you
just hanging out there.

965
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:07,765
You know why?

966
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:10,032
Because he doesn't
want you listening

967
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:11,631
to anybody else
but him.

968
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:14,199
Your lawyer would be
looking after your interests.

969
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:17,232
And that doesn't
help him.

970
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,765
That hurts him,
in fact, so...

971
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,232
your lawyer would
advise you to cooperate.

972
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,798
To tell me the truth. Tell
me what I want to know.

973
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:29,565
But you're here...
all alone.

974
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,565
You want to know
what I see?

975
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:36,965
I mean just looking
at you.

976
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:40,199
I see a mother of three,

977
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:42,665
going away for
obstructing justice

978
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:46,366
protecting a man
she knows is a criminal.

979
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:52,365
What are your two
autistic children gonna do

980
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:56,165
when you're... locked away
and serving your sentence?

981
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:57,165
What are they gonna do?

982
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,799
How are they gonna be
in foster care?

983
00:38:58,866 --> 00:38:59,866
Stop it!

984
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:00,966
Well, tell me
what I want to know.

985
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:03,332
I'm just asking you
to tell me...

986
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:05,465
tell me
what I want to know.

987
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:08,599
Vic is not going

988
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:12,732
to take care of those
kids when you're gone.

989
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,765
Vic gave me some cash
in a bag

990
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:17,765
a little while ago.

991
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:19,832
That's it. I don't know anything else.

992
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,599
There was nothing else.

993
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:24,765
How... how much?

994
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:26,065
65,000.

995
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:32,232
Where'd it come from?

996
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:35,131
I didn't ask.
I never asked.

997
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,465
And where is it?

998
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:37,599
I spent most of it
on tuition,

999
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:38,532
and on therapists.

1000
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,165
There's only about
$5,000 left.

1001
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:44,665
I need that money.
I need that money back.

1002
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,031
Now.

1003
00:39:55,098 --> 00:39:57,465
Now you can cry.

1004
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:04,198
You might wanna
rethink this alibi

1005
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,398
you're handing Kasper.

1006
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,699
We can put him
in the crib

1007
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:08,932
where Amado Alvaro
got his brains splashed.

1008
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:10,131
That's the guy
that shot at you

1009
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:11,298
and killed
your friends.

1010
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,365
If you're lying to cover
for your mad boy toy,

1011
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:15,899
we can get you on
conspiracy to commit murder.

1012
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,465
Just like pulling the trigger yourself.

1013
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:19,165
You'll be old
and in the way

1014
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:20,265
by the time you see
the sky again.

1015
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:21,866
I've got
nothing to say.

1016
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,632
Period point blank.

1017
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:26,699
Kasper's got plenty
to say about you.

1018
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,532
<i>I get more black ass than
a bunch bench in Compton.</i>

1019
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,198
<i>Ya heard.</i>

1020
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,732
<i>Hard time imagining you holding it down</i>

1021
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,398
<i>with some nubian
mattress monster.</i>

1022
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,499
<i>You better ask somebody, one time.</i>

1023
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,332
<i>Taniesha's
my go-to girl.</i>

1024
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,398
<i>She let me tear her phat
ass and sugar walls up</i>

1025
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:42,732
<i>anytime I want.</i>

1026
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,966
<i>White ho's only around
'cuz she swallows nut.</i>

1027
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:05,832
You all right?

1028
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:07,065
Don't talk to me.

1029
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,065
What happened?

1030
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:09,165
Not now.
Just let me go.

1031
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,332
Corinne...

1032
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:11,432
Corinne,
I'll call you.

1033
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:14,365
Vic, Moni gave up
our friendly ghost.

1034
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:17,131
What's wrong?

1035
00:41:19,398 --> 00:41:21,265
Come on, man.

1036
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:22,799
Let's go.

1037
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,738
You know, the thing
about women.

1038
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,005
And it doesn't really
matter what color they are.

1039
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:31,538
When they get pissed off,
watch out.

1040
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,972
Moni just threw your
pink-ass cheeks to the curb.

1041
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,172
You had the smarts,
the business model,

1042
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,772
stripper girlfriend.

1043
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,239
What you didn't have
was the street cred.

1044
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:42,671
Not really.

1045
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:44,372
Not like some
hard ass brother.

1046
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:45,571
You're only
a true baller

1047
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:46,671
when somebody
wants you dead.

1048
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,139
And if the bullets
miss you,

1049
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,305
makes you immortal
to the streets, right?

1050
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,005
So you hired
Alvaro and Zeborio

1051
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:52,172
to shoot up your friends.

1052
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,605
Make you look like
the target.

1053
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:57,671
Market yourself
as some bad ass dude

1054
00:41:57,738 --> 00:41:58,772
instead of
a punk ass white boy.

1055
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:00,339
You been smoking crack.

1056
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:03,005
Your girl Moni
just gave us the key

1057
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:05,105
to her locker
at the Cheetah

1058
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,406
where she stashed
the Tek-Nine

1059
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:08,638
you did the two
hit men with.

1060
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:10,205
Shooter
out of the way,

1061
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:12,005
you don't have to pay
for the hit, right?

1062
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,105
The business man in you
saw a way to save a buck.

1063
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,838
Instead it's gonna
cost you

1064
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,838
three to five dimes
in the State Pen.

1065
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,472
Bitches ain't shit.

1066
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:28,139
Your sister's
a church going woman.

1067
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,239
You grow up that way?

1068
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:31,538
Jesus is my savior.

1069
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:32,705
That's what you mean?

1070
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:34,571
That's what I love
about the church.

1071
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,905
No matter
how bad you are,

1072
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,305
how often, forgiveness
is always there.

1073
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:43,205
All you gotta do
is come clean.

1074
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,805
What's that got to do with finding her?

1075
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:45,872
I don't know.

1076
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,239
Maybe she started
looking at you funny

1077
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:48,738
after you murdered Lana.

1078
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:50,239
Maybe she wanted
to ask you about it,

1079
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:51,738
but she was too scared.

1080
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:53,139
And then one day,
it all came out.

1081
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:55,571
But you couldn't have that,
so you had her killed,

1082
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:56,805
and reported her missing,

1083
00:42:56,872 --> 00:42:57,872
so you could make
yourself look innocent.

1084
00:42:57,938 --> 00:42:58,838
No!

1085
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:01,005
I didn't kill my sister.

1086
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:02,139
That's my blood.

1087
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,172
They were all somebody's blood, Kleavon.

1088
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,272
Didn't stop you then.

1089
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:07,205
Why would it
stop you this time?

1090
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:08,305
Don't talk to me
like that.

1091
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:12,039
I'll talk to you any
way I goddamn please.

1092
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:14,772
You can't arrest me, and
you're not helping me.

1093
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:16,406
I'll find her myself.

1094
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:28,272
I'd be willing to make
these charges go away

1095
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,406
on two conditions.

1096
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:30,406
Anything you want.

1097
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:31,838
You never do this type
of thing again.

1098
00:43:31,905 --> 00:43:33,638
My word.

1099
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:35,172
And you help us I.D.
The guy who did this.

1100
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:38,005
Then I'll be involved
in a court case.

1101
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:39,571
I know how this works.

1102
00:43:39,638 --> 00:43:40,638
My brother's a lawyer.

1103
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:41,872
Either way,
it's all public.

1104
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:43,305
I'll keep your name
out of this.

1105
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,439
But I cannot
get this guy

1106
00:43:44,506 --> 00:43:46,571
and his 19 other
rat traps off the street

1107
00:43:46,638 --> 00:43:48,205
without your help.

1108
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:51,339
Bridge of his nose
is right,

1109
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:53,538
but his cheekbones
are higher.

1110
00:43:57,105 --> 00:43:58,305
Hey.

1111
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,872
You decided
to cut him some slack?

1112
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,072
Lesser of two evils.

1113
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,105
Gets the kook
off the streets.

1114
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,239
You think we're looking
for a vigilante?

1115
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,705
Don't know.

1116
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:07,805
Julien, you and I
got off to a rough start.

1117
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:09,671
But I feel like things
are starting

1118
00:44:09,738 --> 00:44:10,872
to make more sense.

1119
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,305
Good.

1120
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:14,339
Look, man, I grew up
with my gay uncle

1121
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:16,005
living with us.

1122
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,205
So it's no
big deal to me.

1123
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:19,406
But I saw what he
had to go through.

1124
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:22,605
I honestly just didn't get
your situation.

1125
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:24,172
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

1126
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:25,439
All I'm saying
is that I understand.

1127
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:27,738
And it's between
you and your wife anyway,

1128
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:28,872
so I'm cool.

1129
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:30,205
You're cool with what?

1130
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:31,838
That I'm the T.O.
That should've

1131
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:33,272
washed you out
weeks ago?

1132
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:35,239
You don't
understand anything.

1133
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,506
I know why you recommended
me for robbery-homicide.

1134
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:43,972
No need to thank me.

1135
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:44,972
You're getting sicker,

1136
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,671
and you can't bear
for me to see it.

1137
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:51,872
A woman may be dead because
you wanted to protect me.

1138
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:55,938
I shouldn't have done
the search without you.

1139
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:57,205
I'm sorry.

1140
00:44:57,272 --> 00:45:01,938
I do not let my illness
get in the way of my job.

1141
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:03,506
You do.

1142
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,605
That's dangerous.

1143
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,305
I'm not leaving you.

1144
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:11,671
Detectives.

1145
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:12,872
You wanted
to be notified

1146
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:14,005
of any black, female
dump jobs.

1147
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:16,239
Late forties.
Probably strangled.

1148
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:18,105
That's not
Kleavon's M.O.

1149
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:19,938
That's his sister.

1150
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:23,905
Uni says
it looks like rape.

1151
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,372
His own sister?

1152
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,339
It's not Fatima.

1153
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:46,305
Who is it?

1154
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,205
Look at this.

1155
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:52,605
He chopped her hair off.

1156
00:45:52,671 --> 00:45:53,772
Yeah.

1157
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,972
Not with scissors.
Probably a knife.

1158
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:02,472
You recognize the haircut?

1159
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:08,705
Looks like I got under
Kleavon's skin after all.

1160
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:19,938
Hey.

1161
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:21,638
Thanks for swinging by.

1162
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:26,039
I wanted to finish this
in person.

1163
00:46:26,105 --> 00:46:28,805
Me, too. If you didn't
before, now you can see

1164
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:31,605
how out of control
Kavanaugh is.

1165
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:34,339
I need to decide
if I want to represent you.

1166
00:46:34,406 --> 00:46:36,039
Any of you.

1167
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:37,705
First, you're
a sacrificial lamb

1168
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:39,406
to appease angry voters
after that referendum tanked.

1169
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:40,571
We're the good guys
in this.

1170
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:41,872
Only not that good.

1171
00:46:41,938 --> 00:46:43,506
Because then you tell me

1172
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,538
Aceveda had you doing
dirty work for him

1173
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:46,972
and is setting you up
to take the fall.

1174
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,372
Today I find out,

1175
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,406
this is about
capital murder on a cop.

1176
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:51,671
Becca, it's a put up job.

1177
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:52,872
Right now...

1178
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,705
I have no clue about who
the hell you really are.

1179
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:01,638
How can I help you
with that?

1180
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:10,205
I actually had
a kernel of faith

1181
00:47:10,272 --> 00:47:11,872
that you could
take the guy down.

1182
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:14,406
Now it just seems like
you've lost your senses.

1183
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:17,305
You're under
investigation, Councilman.

1184
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:18,705
For what?

1185
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:20,272
Your connection
with Mackey.

1186
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:25,938
I don't understand how you're
so gung-ho to get this guy,

1187
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:28,039
yet be in his pocket
at the same time.

1188
00:47:28,105 --> 00:47:30,272
Something I got
to look at.

1189
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,605
You still think
that I helped Vic

1190
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:34,705
set you up
with that russian sting?

1191
00:47:35,872 --> 00:47:37,039
Man, he got to you.

1192
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,105
Playing us
against each other.

1193
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:42,472
You may as well fold up
your tent and go home.

1194
00:47:42,538 --> 00:47:44,738
One thing
I know for sure...

1195
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:46,072
when you sat in this office,

1196
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,972
could've put
an end to him.

1197
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,472
But you didn't.

1198
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:51,772
Now it's my turn.

1199
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,439
You seriously think this
little display of yours

1200
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:56,239
is going to work?

1201
00:47:57,972 --> 00:48:01,805
I need you to
initial here, here,

1202
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:03,972
and I need
your signature here.

1203
00:48:08,772 --> 00:48:10,372
You're still
a reserve cop, right?

1204
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,671
I do have
authority over you.

1205
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,905
You walk out that door,

1206
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,339
I'm gonna
take your badge.

1207
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:19,972
And I'm gonna tell
every reporter in town why.

1208
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:24,105
Then you may as well
add insubordination

1209
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:25,272
to your list of
bullshit allegations.

1210
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,571
You want any
paperwork signed,

1211
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,005
you send it
to my office.

1212
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,571
I'll have the city
attorney take a look at it.

1213
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:31,571
Fine.

1214
00:48:31,638 --> 00:48:32,838
I'm chairman
of the Police Committee.

1215
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:35,039
This is a fight
you don't want.

1216
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:38,372
I didn't want
any of it.

1217
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:41,772
But I'm here...

1218
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,272
and I'm staying.

1219
00:48:46,372 --> 00:48:47,705
Corinne, call me.

1220
00:48:47,772 --> 00:48:49,938
Kavanaugh's upstairs
with Aceveda.

1221
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:51,172
What the hell's
going on?

1222
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:53,172
It's almost 8:00
and he's till at it.

1223
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,938
What do we do,
just leave for the night?

1224
