2
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:19,680
- Anything?

3
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,346
No. Shit.

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,218
All right We switch

5
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,884
- Oh, God.
- We'll do it all again with new eyes.

6
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,689
- Damn.
- Shit.

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,197
We can't spend a nickel
until we know which bills are marked.

8
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,860
I'm gonna check
for dummy serial numbers this time.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,929
- Who's got the Federal Reserve seal?
- Uh, I'll take it.

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,271
- Here
- All right.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,781
- The, uh, cuddler rape case--
how many victims so far?
- Five

13
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,943
- We're going to the press tomorrow
- No, not yet

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,953
No, the reporters are already
calling with questions.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,353
They've got the story
We might as well give 'em our side

16
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,392
We've got a list of registered sex offenders,
guys with prior robberies

17
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:04,224
- Let us talk to them first
- There have gotta be 1 00 suspects, at least

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,264
It'll take you a month

19
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,493
Actually, we've narrowed the list down to 1 4

20
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,593
How?

21
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,867
- We got the jail profile
- I said ''No'' to that

22
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,171
When I told the profiler who the victims were,
he offered to do it for half price

23
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,178
Apparently,
his grandma put him through school

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,248
- It's still too much
- I-- $2,500.

25
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,580
I wrote him a check If it doesn't work out,
just take it out of my salary

26
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,211
- Believe me, I will
- Okay

27
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,257
Now, the profiler gave us ''hot zones,''

28
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,485
places where the guy likely lives or works

29
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,290
Plus, we've got high-risk areas
for future rapes.

30
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,924
Talk to whoever you need to,
but you got 2 4 hours till the press conference

31
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,730
Wh-What if our guy has a lust for fame?

32
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,102
Going public now will only build his
confidence, make him more dangerous

33
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,937
- Give us another week
- Potential rape victims need to know the threat

34
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,943
and they need to know it now

35
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,411
You've got until tomorrow

36
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,851

37
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,963

38
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,665
You're early

39
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,997
You told me you wanted me
to check the pool filter

40
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,003
I'll do it before I take Cass to the game

41
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,130
Okay I'll go get her ready

42
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,805

43
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,912

44
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,251
- ''Noisy.''
- Right.

45
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,154
Hey, Mr Mackey How's it going?

46
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,856
- Hey, little man
- That's enough for today, Matthew.

47
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,455
You did a goodjob. I'm proud of you.
Let's pack up.

48
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,594
He's working on understanding concepts
as well as objects

49
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,332
- Like a horn's not just a horn, but it's--
- Noisy

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,170
- Right
- I got it That's good

51
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,014
Matthew, those don't go there

52
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,640
- Let's put them in your room right now, okay?
- It's okay He can get it later

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,743
- Well, he knows he needs to do it now
- I said he can do it later

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,721
I got a job for him

55
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,087
She's getting her uniform on
She'll be out in a minute

56
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,629
I'll be by the pool
Come on, Matt Help your dad

57
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,736
Eh, I talked to a nurse
Tavon's doing a lot better

58
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,170
- Oh, that's great
- Yeah, it is.

59
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,765
- He's off the ventilator.
- Who? Tavon?

60
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,368
Yeah. He's, uh--
He's still not responding to voices...

61
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,642
but, uh, breathing on his own
was a big hurdle

62
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,649
He could still have a full recovery.

63
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,117
I'm gonna go see him after work.
Anybody wanna come with?

64
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,553
Yeah, I-- I can't make it today

65
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,922
Look, I got another idea
on how to track those bills

66
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:52,930
You know those, uh, lists that the feds
send around to banks to track counterfeits?

67
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,932
You can't just walk into a bank

68
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,231
and ask to see their Treasury watch list
without attracting attention, man

69
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,035
Those lists also go around to check-cashing places
They go to Indian casinos

70
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,702
Anyway, I know this wink joint
He cashes checks

71
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,373
I go in, I tin Uncle Ho,
say I need to make sure his list is current.

72
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,474
- And he'll go for that?
- If it keeps me from poking
around his back room...

73
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,485
where he's pimping slope cooch, yeah

74
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,488
- Yeah, I think he'll go for it
- Huh.

75
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,785
That's not badJust keep it quiet

76
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,792
Okay

77
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,159
Oh All here

78
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,462
- You're assigned to Trish for the day
- I'll try to break you in easy

79
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,870
We've got gay-bashers
going after male hustlers out on the stroll.

80
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,271
- Where's the rest of the Decoy Squad?
- Deep cover.

81
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,368
Trish will fill you in on operational details

82
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,973
Just for the record, I have no problem
working with the Decoy Squad...

83
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,983
but we don't work for them.

84
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,451
Right You work for me

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,225

86
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,625

87
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,753
- Who the hell wrote this?
- Who do you think? Nina.

88
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,094
What, are we in third grade?

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,604
- Yes
- Hey! That yours?

90
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,197
- Tommy Hisk?
- Yeah?

91
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,005
Detective Kouf, Wilshire
Can I talk with you?

92
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,012
- Shoot
- Do you wanna come with me?

93
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,014
I'm about to go on duty

94
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,676
Just step outside

95
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,311
Go get the captain

96
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,552
Your ex-wife and son were found murdered

97
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,755
I'm very sorry

98
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:35,300
- What?
- I need to take you to Wilshire with me

99
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,892
- Wait a minute Why?
- 'Cause that's my captain's orders.

100
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,995
This happens and Griggs wants to sweat him?

101
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,666
- It's just a couple of questions
- Hey We're all cops here

102
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,675
You think I had something to do with this?

103
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,440
- It's procedure
What do you want me to do about it?
- You talk to him here

104
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,448
You do it fast and you get it over with

108
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,097
Are you all right?

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,894
Yeah

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,730
Ripped by:

111
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,102
Hound

113
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,607
Where were you last night
between 1 0:00 and 1 1 :00 pm?

114
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,011
- Is that when they, uh--
- Just where were you?

115
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,215

116
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,725
Uh, I don't know.

117
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,057
I, uh, worked late and went home

118
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:41,156
- Okay. Were you with anyone
like a girlfriend maybe or--
- I don't have a girlfriend.

119
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,758
- I'm sorry?
- I don't have a girlfriend

120
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,931
- This is bullshit
- I heard his divorce got nasty, but come on!

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,099
They'll get a statement,
see there's nothing there

122
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,007
Meanwhile,
the real killer's trail is going cold

123
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,479
It's Wilshire's case Your team's got yours

124
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,849
- How old was his kid?
- Four or five.

125
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,355
God damn it

126
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,893
We gotta posse up,
find out who did Tommy's family

127
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,861
We gotta posse up,
find out who did Tommy's family

128
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,759
- Who's coming?
- Okay.

129
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,128
- True they got him up in interrogation?
- We're gonna fix that

130
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,667
You talking about
just disappearing off the grid?

131
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,862
If the hammer doesn't
come down fast and hard

132
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,771
it sends a message that cops
and their families are fair game

133
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,275
- I got cage duty What can I do from here?
- Run a record search.

134
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,644
Anyone Tommy's put away, recently paroled
I'm gonna check out the crime scene

135
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,185
- You guys come with,
canvass the neighborhood
- All right Let's go

136
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,555
Change of plans

137
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,557
- I'm calling in sick
- Are you?

138
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,390
Well, I could put a penny under my tongue
or you could just take me on my word

139
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,430
This about that uni's family getting killed?

140
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,193
Look, the only reason your old boss
is dicking with Tommy

141
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,361
is because Aceveda took you
and your team from Wilshire

142
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,371
This is payback

143
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,373
And what am I supposed to tell Claudette?

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,375
Tell her I was present and accounted for

145
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,843
Oh, she spanks me, I'll spank you

146
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,777
- Hey, Vic I'm coming too
- No.

147
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,852
Look, I'm not sitting around on flamer duty
while Tommy gets boned

148
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,184
You got problems of your own

149
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,985
- Vic, come on
- I got some bodies I'll handle it

150
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,322
You handle this for me

151
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,366
- Did you hear about Tommy?
- Yeah There's no way he did this

152
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,063
A bunch of us are going out there to prove it
You want in?

153
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,538
Yeah He was my partner
I knew his son

154
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,701
It's a deep blue run
Could be consequences-- a little hot water

155
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,874
Okay

156
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,950
Good You're in Let's go

157
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,887
Okay Did you place any calls
so we can prove you were home?

158
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,222
- No Look, I wanna see them
- Uh-huh.

159
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,057
- When can I see them?
- It's all right. We won't be here too long.

160
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,502
Excuse me a minute

161
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,773
She's been crying for you.

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,435
She doesn't understand where you've been

163
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,174
I'm sorry It's, uh--
It's been really busy right now

164
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,241
You're always busy That's never stopped you
from coming home before

165
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,582
I can't get into it right now

166
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:20,182
Well, we're here right now
That's all you gotta say?

167
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,495
Will you be home for dinner?

168
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,361
I don't know how long I'll be needed here

169
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,366
- You're spending another night?
- I don't know.

170
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,596
For God's sake!
What have you been doing?

171
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:37,074
One of my cops just found out
his family's been murdered and he's a suspect

172
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,144
and then you've been calling all day

173
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,145
And then you bring Sophia down here

174
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,445
You know, wh-what are you thinking,you know?

175
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,019
Calm down

176
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,989
Mira

177
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,117
Hey

178
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,562
I'll be home when I get home

179
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,865
- I'll call it in.

180
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,413
- Mind if we take a look around?
- You're in the wrong district, aren't you?

181
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,710
Uh, this was the family of one of our guys

182
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,411
Yeah I heard Techs are still inside

183
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,079
No one's gonna disturb your crime scene, man

184
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,421
Normally, sure,
but the captain's taken a special interest in this

185
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,758
- He could stop by anytime
- We just wanna help out a friend
who lost his wife and kid

186
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:36,426
Who's caught up in the middle of
a pissing match between your boss and ours.

187
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,938
Look I'm not trying to be a pain in the ass

188
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,703
Two minutes
We just wanna see what happened

189
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,576
Look, they can wait outside
Just me and Tommy's partner

190
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,351
- Two minutes, in and out
- Thanks

191
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,883
Came in a back window-- broken lock

192
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,895
The wife was stabbed a couple dozen times

193
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,693
- The sister found her
- Anything missing?

194
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,702
Off the top ofher head,
a silver tea set and somejewelry.

195
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,565

196
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,576
The kid ran to hide under the bed.

197
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,578
The killer found him and slashed his throat

198
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,792
You think God's gonna show any mercy
to the person who did this?

199
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,487

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,590
How bad was it?

201
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,601
Oh, it was a speed murder
Guy had to be cranked on something

202
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,933
Neighbor said
there's been a lot ofbreak-ins lately.

203
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,973
There's a crack house right over there
across the street

204
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,272
Hey, anybody check that rock house
over there?

205
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,505
We knocked No answer

206
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,672
Aw, for Christ's sake

207
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,951

208
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,854

209
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,153
- Hey, Vic, wait a minute

210
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,229
I just got my job back, okay?
I'm not breaking into this place

211
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,933

212
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,094
There's a citizen inside here

213
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,229
in need of immediate medical attention

214
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,676
See? Medical emergency

215
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,974
Somebody get this man an aspirin

216
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,141
Rise and shine, party people!

217
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,116
Yo, dude This is my crib

218
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,188
Aaah! Ow!

219
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,256

220
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,917
- Ohhh!

221
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,259
A cop's wife and kid across the street
were murdered last night

222
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,095
This looks like a good place
to round up the usual suspects

223
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,601
Ain't nobody here last night except myself

224
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,832
- Well, that makes you a prime suspect
- Y'all trippin' for real

225
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,841
I was too blind off a eight-ball

226
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,036
to raise my hand against my fellow man.

227
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,376
You playin' a game with me?

228
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,881
'Cause I know some games myself

229
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,660
Come on, Vic.

230
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,568
Ahhh-- Okay, okay.

231
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,732
This slanger, Darontay

232
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,402
came by here last night to make a delivery

233
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,241
- Huh?
- He sees that bitch outside

234
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,781
writing down his goddamn license plate

235
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,408
Darontay goes out to regulate

236
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,250
Tells her to get ghost
or be swarmed on by a nigga

237
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,722
- What happened then?
- I don't know, man

238
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,726
I-- When homes came with the product

239
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,092
I was too busy trying to get my smoke on

240
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,802
IfTommy's wife wrote down this guy's license
plate number, maybe it's inside the house

241
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,375
Look, I think I saw some kind of list
on the fridge

242
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,944
- I'm not sure
- Okay Here's what we do

243
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,541
I need another quick look inside

244
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,776
I got a call that Captain Griggs is on the move

245
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,353
Come on, man
I-- I'm just trying to lend a hand here

246
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,445
Then turn around and walk away

247
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,649
I thought we were all
working on the same team.

248
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,420
Look I don't know what this beef
between our captains is

249
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,019
- Well, you want me to break it down for you?
- No

250
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,293
I just want you out of here
before mine shows up

251
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,296
All right. I'm outta here.

252
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,474
Plate numbers I'm figuring the last one
on the list belongs to Darontay

253
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,476
Good Copy the last few,just to be safe

254
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,411
- You're gonna turn that over to Wilshire, right?
- After we run the numbers, why?

255
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,642
- It's their investigation
- Yeah, and they're focusing on the wrong guy

256
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,551
Wait a minute Breaking and entering?
Withholding evidence?

257
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,453
If the perp fences the stuff he stole
before we get him

258
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,583
it's gonna be harder
to tie him to the case

259
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,593
We gotta get this asshole right now

260
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,993
I signed up to keep Tommy outta jail,
not put myself in

261
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,397
Oh, please
We're just doing the job they should be doing

262
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,698
Julien, come on Let's go

263
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,137
I'm gonna see this through

264
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,071
- We're on patrol
- It's not like I haven't covered for you...

265
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,547
for a couple of hours
when you've had an emergency

266
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,551
- You got the numbers?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,452
Feel free to return the list to Wilshire

268
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,429
You know there was another break-in
last month?

269
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,931
- Did she tell you about that?
- She told me

270
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,697
Same as last night
Came in through the same window

271
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,865
Stole a bunch of valuables
Luckily, no one was home at the time

272
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,875
So why aren't you
out looking for a break-in guy?

273
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,879
Not a very good neighborhood
for a mom and kid to be living alone, is it?

274
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,074
It's shit

275
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,743
I tried to get Barb to move,
but she likes the house

276
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,911
and I don't make enough cash
to get her something better

277
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,080
- You fought.
- So they argued

278
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,090
She's an ex-wife It comes with the territory

279
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,319
Divorce was final, what,
two weeks ago, right?

280
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,521
What does that have to do with anything?

281
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,498
Well, like you said, it's tough to get a house
in the hills on a uniform's alimony, right?

282
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,535
- Why the hell is that important?
- We're here to discuss last night.

283
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,696
Cap, am I interrogating you or him?

284
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,141
I thought we were just talking

285
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,905
I, uh, reconned three victims' homes
last night--

286
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,913
all with windows facing the street

287
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,711
Tried to get a look inside

288
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,286
drapes were closed in all three instances

289
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,287
I can't wait to hear the punch line

290
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,880
I reinterviewed the victims
Before the attacks

291
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,654
all had their drapes up during the day,
but closed at night

292
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,219
- So--
- He's scoping them out during the day

293
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,233
- Unemployed?
- It'd be less conspicuous if he worked in the area--

294
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,704
uh, courier, construction--
someone you wouldn't look at twice

295
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,706
How's it going up there?

296
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:54,438
You guys any closer to a suspect
or are you just $2,500 poorer?

297
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,505
We're gonna need daily surveillance patrols
in areas of potential attacks.

298
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,642
Save it till after the press conference.

299
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,119
- Yeah I've got my notes for you
- No. Keep them.

300
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,247
You're gonna be doing it

301
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,656
The press conference?
Y-You always do those

302
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,229
I gotta give backup to Tommy

303
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,264
Um, I still think this is premature.

304
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,027
We should at least release the psych profile,
see if it gets us any tips

305
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,094
- What's the profile?
- Single or with a submissive partner--

306
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,537
frees him up for going out at all hours

307
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,372
No Enough of the profiles
Just give them what we know

308
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,577
Yeah I need you to run a plate
One-zero-zero-Paul-Charles-Edward

309
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,711
Should come back to an owner,
first name Darontay

310
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,383
Yeah I need an address ASAP

311
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,892
Hey, I, uh-- I hit that check-cashing place

312
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,395

313
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,465
Palmed a list of serial numbers
Treasury's watching

314
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,091
Everything's under control here

315
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,534
- What, you can't talk?
- Right

316
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,165
Soon as we're done with the bone-smokers,
me and the guys will check our cash

317
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:01,372
Uh, we don't know
if your CI's information is correct

318
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,177
His info may not jive
with Aceveda's expectation

319
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,482
- Wha-- Aceveda might be
working off a different list?
- Correct

320
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,991
You need to review the evidence
collected in the Byz Lats investigation

321
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,857
Check it against the bills
that we know are marked in property

322
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,452
There you go

323
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,532
Hey, Cacuzza

324
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,863
I could use a little help
on this Byz Lat investigation

325
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,871
There was, uh, some cash
logged into property-- last name Salcido

326
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,204
Can't release property
without the owner's signature

327
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,210
Doesn't need to leave the room

328
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,281
The drug residue on those bills
gives me the search warrant I need

329
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,752
All right

330
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,953
- Here it is

331
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,961
The marked bills we're holding for Treasury

332
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,031
Great Great

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
You haven't been back
to the house since you left?

334
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:04,401
Um, I picked upJeff
a few times outside the house.

335
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,671
That's the only reason you've been back?
To pick upJeff?

336
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,803
- You heard him.
-Jesus Christ

337
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,814
The thing is, uh

338
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:16,047
one of the few items that was stolen
last month in the break-in

339
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,182
was an American Eagle coin collection
from your father

340
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:25,127
We talked to Barb's sister. She said your son
saw the coins last week at your place.

341
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,566
He told his mom.

342
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,330
She said she was gonna press charges--
breaking and entering

343
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,201
That would've cost you your job

344
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,404
Tommy?

345
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:46,111
- Somebody made a mistake
- Yeah? Was your son a liar?

346
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,710
My son's dead
And you pricks won't let me see him

347
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,696
- Captain.
- Steve

348
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,707
What's going on, David?
And why isn't he in custody?

349
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,902
Oh You said, ''Just a few routine questions''

350
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,242
There is a case against him
I'm not obliged to lay it out in front of him

351
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,511
- Well, why don't you lay it out in front of me?
- Okay

352
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,519
He breaks into his ex-wife's house,
stole property

353
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,181
She found out
He kills her to cover it up

354
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,258
The son sees it, so he kills him too

355
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,261
Yeah? Well, you've got nothing to support that,
so why don't you just let it go?

356
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,264
So if I search his place,
I'm not gonna find those coins, David?

357
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,267
Steve, you know you don't have enough
for a search warrant

358
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,172
You still working with us

359
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,600
or are you a defense attorney now?

360
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,944
Cuff him and put him in the car

361
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,038
No He stays in my house
until you show me more

362
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,951
- Let's call the chief
- Sure

363
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,616
Yeah I think he's on the 1 0th hole
at Rancho Park

364
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,457
I'll make sure to tell him what a great job
the Decoy Squad's doing for me

365
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,791
Or you can finish up with Tommy here

366
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,296
Oops Next time I won't knock so hard

367
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,275
Put your clothes on, walk out the door

368
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,471
and change your taste in men.

369
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,451
Where were you last night, playboy?

370
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,850
You know Ruling the streets

371
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,823
then back to the crib
for a little thug passion with shawtie

372
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,759
There was a double homicide right down
the block from the crack house you supply

373
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,297
Police officer's wife and child
were stabbed to death.

374
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,264
See me crying?

375
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,859
Well, we only just got here

376
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,202
- Did you do it?
- I woulda, but I had on a new suit.

377
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,675
You wear that around your neck
and you talk like that?

378
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,838
Ahhh You like the bling-bling
Twenty-five grand

379
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,308
- Man
- Why you trippin', nigga?

380
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,717
Two less blue-eyed devils in this world.

381
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,381
Ohhh!

382
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,015
Witnesses saw you arguing last night

383
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,026
Who didn't have words with that bitch?

384
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,221
Tellin'folks to come correct
or get dimed on...

385
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,390
'cause her baby daddy Five-O

386
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,899
Hell Even your boy couldn't deal--

387
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,732
hired a straight ''G'' to come gank his own crib

388
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,500
No speakee Ebonics, shithead

389
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:28,102
Her old man hired some dude
to come rob his own damn house

390
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,076
- How do you know?
- My users tell me things of interest

391
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,644
Like when a fellow smoke hound
gets recruited by the po-po

392
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,820
- Who'd this cop hire?
- Some smoker

393
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,124
Probably wasn't a wise choice

394
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,207
- You hired someone to knock over your house?
- No.

395
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,215
Cut the bullshit, Tommy. I found out.

396
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:09,413
Now, we got about two minutes, tops.
Tell me what happened.

397
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,156
I have a coin collection from my dad--
gold American Eagles

398
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,821
She got half of them in the settlement
She was gonna sell 'em

399
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,898
So you hired someone to steal them back?

400
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,899
It was a one-time thing.

401
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,767
Christ You know, a bunch of us are out there
trying to clear your name

402
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,772
and you're making us all look like assholes

403
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,365
He was a 459 suspect I cut loose
who owed me

404
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,376
It has nothing to do with last night

405
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,914
He came through the same window,
the same broken lock

406
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,580
Ex-wives know how to push buttons.

407
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,556
One way of getting out
from under the alimony

408
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,321
My son, Vic You think I would do this to him?
You got kids

409
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,388
Yeah. I wouldn't hire some crackhead
to break into where they sleep.

410
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,263
Barbara and Jeff were out of town
He wasn't a crackhead

411
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,998
- What, did you make him take a urine test?

412
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,337
This guy came back for seconds,
killed them both

413
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,879
Jesus Christ I gotta find him

414
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,844
That's what I'm doing Tell me his name

415
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,212
- Hey! Unlock this door.

416
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,217
Soren Arnovic

417
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,287
Run his priors, you'll find him

418
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,880
- I didn't know, Vic. If he did this, I didn't know.

419
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,392
- Keep your mouth shut Let me do my thing

420
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,124
I said, ''Unlock this door.''

421
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,569
What's going on?

422
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,071
Just showing a fellow officer some support

423
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:48,082
Uh, the rapes appear to be
preferentially motivated assaults

424
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,586
Would you put that in terms
our viewers can understand?

425
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:56,252
Yes, uh, women between
the ages of 65 and 80 living alone

426
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,093
The perpetrator-- uh, rapist--

427
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,362
watches for women to leave the house,
enters and waits for them

428
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:08,064
If you live in the area,
keep your blinds drawn at all times

429
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,835
because he scopes out his victims
during the day.

430
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,079
We believe he's a white or Latino male,
age 25 to 40.

431
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,879
That sounds like three-quarters of the
population. You don't have any hard suspects?

432
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,422
We're making progress with our investigation

433
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,219
Sounds like you have nothing

434
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,060
We know he thinks of himself
as a sophisticated predator

435
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:36,065
But really he has low intelligence
and poor interpersonal skills

436
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,897
Probably in a menial job or unemployed

437
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,995
It's doubtful that he has a relationship
with a woman

438
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,234
If he does, he's domineering
and can come and go as he pleases

439
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,240
And he, uh, struggles with impotence
Thank you That's all

440
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,714
- One more question, Detective.
- I'm sorry No, no

441
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,283
- Impotence?
- I said he struggles with impotence

442
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,289
- He never ejaculates
- Dutch--

443
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,383
It's a solid tactic Emasculate him in public

444
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,428
You draw him out or you defuse his impulses

445
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,192
Or piss him off
What if he uses this as an excuse to rape again?

446
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,235
He's raped five women that we know of
He doesn't need an excuse

447
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,894

448
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,872
Ran those bills from Evidence
They're not showing up on the Treasury list

449
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,738
So Aceveda's working off a different list?

450
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,743
- The question is how to flush it
- Hey, hey

451
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,870
- Hey
- I got an address.

452
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,041
All right Meet back here after you're done
We'll get into it

453
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,616
Hear Tommy might not be as clean
as we'd like to think

454
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,885
Think what you want to

455
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,223
We gotta get back on patrol

456
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,060
What would you be saying if it was you
in interrogation for two murders you didn't do?

457
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,566
Look, I'm not taking another fall

458
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,296
You guys go back out there,
I gotta go to Aceveda

459
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,642
Let's go

460
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,144
Tell us about the coins.

461
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,280
I got guys at your apartment right now.

462
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,046
They gonna find 'em?

463
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,849
According to the divorce settlement...

464
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,325
they belong to Barb, right, Tommy?

465
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,794
Part of the division of property.

466
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,424
- I wanna see my lawyer
- You helping us or trying to hide something?

467
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,866
You have anything to do with the robbery?

468
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,607
I wanna see my son or get me a lawyer.

469
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,873
A lawyer.

470
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,878
Not a PBA rep, huh?

471
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,018
You can take him

472
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,225
Let's go, buddy Stand up

473
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,299

474
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,667
There have been three assaults on gay hustlers
the last month, all on Saturday nights

475
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,538
- Victims give us anything?
- Besides big, sad eyes

476
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,702
Descriptions are all over the place...

477
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,645
but the MO tracks four to five guys
bashing and grabbing for trick money

478
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,046
We're supposed to be shutting down vice
in Farmington, right?

479
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,914
- That's the job description
- If I'm a cocksucker--

480
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,182
- What do you mean ''if'?
- And shit like this is going down
at my place ofbusiness...

481
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,757
don't I just take my moist and willing mouth
someplace else?

482
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,691
You may find it trivial,
but two of the victims ended up in ICU--

483
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,695
one with a fractured skull

484
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,698
Shane, you'll be undercover with the fellas
Everyone else maintains a perimeter

485
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,701
Hold the phone there, doll face
You got me on salami patrol?

486
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,533
No What about one of these guys?

487
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,301
- Oh, they don't look gay enough

488
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,377
Shane. When you want your buddy
to release...

489
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:39,109
gently squeeze the shaft at the base,
applying tongue to the glans and frenulum

490
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,549
- Hey, tube-steak.

491
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,884
I'm engaged to a gorgeous female
who's carrying my child

492
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:48,550
You're the one who actually knows
the names of dick parts

493
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,357
- You must be the undercover police officer
- I'm glad to be of service

494
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,022
- Thanks
- For what?

495
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,692
For watching our backs
It's been a mama of drama around here

496
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,894
You might wanna hold off on the thanks

497
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,335
I'll more than likely be running you in
next week

498
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,842
I didn't get your name

499
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,845
Yeah

500
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,947
Uh, I got a call-- guy claiming to be the rapist

501
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,513
He's demanding a formal statement from you
retracting the impotence charge.

502
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,116
- So he's made contact
- We've had over 1 00 calls

503
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,128
It could be a hoax

504
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,030
Well, he said he took a figurine
from the last victim's house

505
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,625
You could say you take a figurine
from an old woman's house...

506
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,034
and have a 9 out of 1 0 shot of being right

507
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,198
He says it was a Hummel

508
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,212
Danny's not gonna say anything

509
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,875
She wouldn't do that to me
She sure as hell isn't gonna do it to you

510
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,215
Listen, we find this guy?
After what he did, we don't take any chances

511
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,020
If he resists, he reaches for a piece,
he lifts a finger

512
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,095
we use deadly force

513
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,597
I'm not gonna give him a chance to hurt us
or Tommy

514
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,469

515
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,906
- Sir?
- What is it?

516
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,413
Our deal was if I saw something--

517
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,449
What happened?

518
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,246

519
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,254
Vic rounded up some guys
to track down who killed Tommy's family

520
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:29,258
I was one of'emJust to, you know,
make sure Tommy was getting a fair shake

521
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,351
But now?

522
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,590
But now it's gone from a fact-checking mission
into a foxhunt

523
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,665
- And-- And who's with him?
- Julien.

524
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,271
- You let this happen?

525
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,398
Well, I'm not his TO anymore, am I?

526
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,943
Obviously,Julien is responsible for himself

527
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,673
I thought you had some influence over the guy

528
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,246
Okay

529
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:00,452
Six-Paul-Eleven requesting backup
at 95 Round Hill Road

530
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,549
Possible 1 87 suspect

531
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,560
All right. You take the front.

532
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,893
If he sees the uniform, he runs, he did it

533
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,967
I'll take the back.

534
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,801
Hey, hey No chances

535
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,816
Police! He's got a gun!

536
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,890
He's running! Police!

537
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,482
Oh, shit

538
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,390
He's still got the gun

539
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,333
Couldn't get a good shot

540
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,666
Go out front Wait for backup

541
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,066
Don't come near me!

542
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,977
When he calls, tell him the only way
the public's gonna hear his side of the story

543
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,515
is for him to come forward
and tell the truth himself

544
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,450
- And what ifhe doesn't call?
- He's gonna want to hear our answer

545
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,284
You really think he's gonna give it all up
just to make it clear he's not impotent?

546
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,384
- Why would he do that?
- Uh, because he's mentally ill

547
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,760
Don't come near me!

548
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:23,765
The thing I couldn't take about prison--
the stink

549
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,002
Piss and shit

550
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,568
You're looking at 1 0 years of that
before they hit you with the needle

551
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,615
The worst part--

552
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,014
you can't fix up when you're hurting

553
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,488
Sometimes you can't fix at all

554
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,988
- Shut up!
- Me?

555
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,525
I'd eat a bullet right now

556
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,425
Backup's two minutes out!

557
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,499
You got two minutes
before the cavalry gets here.

558
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,928
You think it over

559
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,677

560
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,110
Suspect who killed Tommy Hisk's family
Saw the stolen property in the house

561
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,417
Vic's trying to get him
to put the gun down and come out.

562
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,515
Hope he doesn't try too hard

563
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,757
Stick the gun in your mouth and pull
Last chance

564
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,130
Do it, Soren

565
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,904
Don't shoot!

566
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,737
Please, don't shoot!

567
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,317
Put your hands behind your head

568
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,212
Turn around

569
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,183
Take him

570
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,429
Come here

571
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,001
- Behind your back.

572
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,876
Thank you Bye

573
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,812
- Check out the wheels
- Chrome 22's. Sweet.

574
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,681
- How much you think?
- I don't know--a couple of night's work.

575
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,889
Set of Kruz Laguna chrome 22's

576
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,391
run you around $3,200

577
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,552
Throw in another grand for the spinners

578
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,654
Looks like our breeder
knows a thing or two about rim jobs

579
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,926
Rim jobs

580
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,868
In front of the camera,
so the cops can't do nothing to me

581
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,871
I can arrange that.

582
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,534
I'll say what I gotta say,
but he's gotta take back what he said.

583
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,045
No one there except you, me and him.

584
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,047
You mean Detective Wagenbach.

585
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,344
He needs to apologize.

586
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,352

587
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,354
I'm putting one of my men in
with the camera

588
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,924
No, not unless you know someone
who can run a Sony D-600.

589
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,925
You get the arrest,; we get the video.

590
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,927
I've done this dozens of times.

591
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:01,192
My camera guy was in the middle of Baghdad
when Desert Storm started

592
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,268
I want at least two guys in close proximity

593
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,895
- I can handle it
- Three backup teams...

594
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,908
with radio contact, and everyone's
wearing a vest, or you get no video

595
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,207
Back home, I had a Chevy 1 500.

596
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,045
Four-barrel carb on a high-rise

597
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,416
Slapped them paddle tires on every summer.

598
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,546
Sand-dragged the shit out of it

599
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,557
I had an F-1 50 with a NOS system

600
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,889
- so the nitrous shot straight into the manifold

601
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,054
My brother did that to a Dodge short bed.

602
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,064
- Aw, that was a bad move.
- No shit

603
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,726
Threw a rod, sent it sideways, tires smoked--

604
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,996
-Junked the whole engine, huh?
- Yeah

605
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,664
- Hey, faggot!

606
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,367
- Hey! Come here, punk!
- Yeah! Come on! Come on! 

607
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,569
Move! Move!

608
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,737
Hold it! Police officer! Police officer!

609
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,339
- Drop the bat! Drop the bat right now!
- Police! Stop right there!

610
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,817
- Turn around!
- You! On the ground! On the ground!

611
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,785
Turn around! Turn around! Get over here!

612
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,414
Get over here! Against the wall!

613
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,653
Stop! Stop right there!

614
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,498
Nice tackle

615
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,362
- What's this?
- The collar you and me been working on all day

616
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,532
Oh, right We're good

617
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,475
DA says this case
has got the makings of a hate crime

618
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,478
Yeah, that'll work,
but they're also in it for the money

619
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,014
- Got a confession outta one
- Spilled his guts.

620
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,550
Football players
After the game, they go knock back a few

621
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,552
and then go looking for a few queers
to beat up

622
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,316
Rip 'em off for their trick money,
pay the bar tab

623
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,153
- How'd the Strike Team do?
- Fine.

624
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,887
That one's a natural born
undercover cum-guzzler

625
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,555
- Hey, I heard that, bitch

626
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,096
You went off the grid today?

627
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,409
Who told you that?

628
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:05,013
I knew Tommy didn't do it Didn't like
that Griggs asshole trying to prove otherwise

629
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:09,320
Today was a one-time thing, got it?

630
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,292
Got it

631
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,364
You weren't at the basher sting tonight?

632
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:18,094
I was there in spirit Bust got made

633
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,539

634
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,945
You never disappeared for a couple of hours
to help another cop?

635
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,144
You look like hell

636
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,279
Is everything else all right?

637
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,459
Long day, that's all

638
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,126
I replaced the gasket on the filter

639
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,962
- It's working just fine again
- Thanks for doing that

640
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,571
Matt having another session?

641
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,141
Not tonight

642
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,211
Owen's here a lot lately, isn't he?

643
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,746
Matthew's improving

644
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,340
Something you wanna tell me?

645
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,614
- About what?
- About you and Owen

646
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,557
Did Cassidy say something?

647
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,127
No

648
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,187
You walked by the doorway in your panties
without batting an eye that he was inside

649
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,865
- I don't have to discuss this with you
- Yes,you do.

650
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,034
I want him the hell away from Matthew

651
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,372
- He's not his father.
- No, but he's here for him

652
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,445
I'm not shelling out my own money...

653
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,982
so the hired help
can play Daddy to impress you

654
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,983
Get rid of him!

655
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,383
He's an amazing teacher
and that's what you pay for

656
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,421
Anything else is my business

657
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,015
You know he has a record?
He got busted for weed in college

658
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,720
- You've been checking up on him?
- You're damn straight!

659
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,263
He's alone with my son!

660
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,567
So he smoked a joint 1 5 years ago

661
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,330
It wasn't possession It was for dealing

662
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,397
It couldn't have been that serious
if he got his teaching certificate

663
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,072
You date who you want, but he's out of a job

664
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,774

665
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,785

666
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,195
I talked to a buddy over at Wilshire

667
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,201
Arnovic's given a full confession

668
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,203
- Good
- Not good

669
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,604
He's telling them about how Tommy had him
break into his ex's house last month

670
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,672
- What's that gonna mean for him?
- Probably his job

671
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,617
I didn't have a shot

672
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,455
I know

673
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,924
You did the right thing riding with me today
People saw you stepped up

674
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,229
I'm going to church tonight
I'll say a prayer for him-- for his wife and kid

675
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,798
Say one for all of us

676
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,072
It's now four hours past
the designated surrender time

677
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,741
of the alleged rapist
who's been terrorizing elderly women

678
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,681
in the the Farmington District of Los Angeles.

679
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:26,917
Is he sending a message
that it's your department who's impotent?

680
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,515
You may as well turn this off,
'cause it's never gonna air

681
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,063
- We're chasing our tails
- We would've been better off
if the money train never happened.

682
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,071
- Give me a break
- Calm down, girls.

683
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:47,270
Now, we know Treasury's got Aceveda
checking bills on any bust over a grand

684
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:51,940
- So?
- One of the unis just logged
two large into Evidence

685
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,780
We don't let that money out of our sight,
we'll find the list he's working with

686
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,784

687
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,223
Here's your phone list
and your schedule for tomorrow

688
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,062
Did you call Aurora back?

689
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,564
- Not yet
- You really should.

690
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,567
I'll do it when I do it

691
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:15,127
- What?
- Something's bothering you

692
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,436
- If it's anything that I did--
- It's not, Nina

693
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:22,239
Please,just check the bills in Evidence
like I asked you to

694
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,849

695
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,377
- What do you need?
- Shane thinks he forgot

696
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,045
to sign that evidence envelope from that 21 1

697
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,783
- No, he signed it
- All right. Great. I'll let him know.

698
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,567
- He was never coming.
- No

699
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,399
I embarrassed him;
he wanted to embarrass me

700
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,564
Probably.

701
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,142
It's more self-control
than I gave him credit for

702
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,910
We still got some time
before we have to get back to work

703
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,949
You could buy me breakfast.

704
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,950
I'm broke

705
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,926
We know...

706
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:47,430
where he lives, where he hunts.

707
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,522
Now we've got him on tape

708
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:54,935
Voice analysis will tell us his ethnicity,
personality traits

709
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,307
We're getting to know him

710
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,373
I was wrong

711
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,448
You were right

712
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,711
Maybe a little

713
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,050
Come on.

714
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,818
I'm buying

715
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,393
Hey, Nina Could you, uh, help
with the computer in the briefing room?

716
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,059
- It's not taking my access code
- I can't right now

717
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,137
You know, it's really kinda urgent
It's, uh--

718
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,137
I'm trying to access this database

719
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,537
I'm working on something for David Sorry

720
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,140

721
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,117
- Thank you
- Have a good night

722
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,062

723
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,426
Close it

724
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,162
The list's in Aceveda's safe

725
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,602
- Well, so that's it
- Not necessarily

726
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:07,200
- Well, what do you mean?
- Ripping off the money train
was 1 0 times more complicated

727
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,145
It's in a safe in a captain's office
inside of a police station.

728
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,649
Without that list,
none of that money is any good

729
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,287
Yeah.

730
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,292
There's gotta be a way
