So how'd we do?

178
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,136
Some of it looks legit.
F.D.A. Seals, valid expiration.

179
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,303
But there's over a dozen boxes
that don't have seals.

I'm shutting it down.

189
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,335
Mission Cross has been overflowing
with bad scrip deaths.

190
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,777
We hear your clinic is ground zero.

191
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,075
- Our drugs aren't bad.
- They're illegal.

192
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,311
Yeah, but they're not bad.
Look. I make a few deals, cut some corners.

193
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,149
But it's not about the profit.
It's about helping these people cope.

194
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,452
These are different than the ones
we got from the E.R.

195
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,892
Real labels. American.
Where'd you get these?

196
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,359
Gruhani brothers.
Persian dudes.

197
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,368

- I buy at a third the price.

200
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,135
- Take him.
- Come on.

201
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,181
You know, a lot of people
can't afford these drugs any other way.

202
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,275
Not looking to hurt this place. But I got
black market scrips poisoning the Farm.

203
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,220
- I gotta come down on everyone
till we figure it out.
- Yeah, I know.

204
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,986
But the sooner we can get this place
up and running again-

205
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,061
I'm working on it.

206
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,556

No. I hired that.

Why?

212
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,145
Not me. Us. She's walking us
through this thing with Lem.

213
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,845
Collecting intel on the whole
suit-and-tie side of things.

- You think we're gonna need lawyers?
- I just wanna be prepared.

00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,491
Right over here.

228
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,789
I was just getting Shane up to speed
on our arrangement.

229
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,591
- The others too?
- Lem's still wired...

230
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,996
- so we have to keep him in the dark for now.
- Huh.

231

a search and destroy.

239
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,526
It was to prove
we weren't crooked.

240

- And what direction is that?
<i>- The way of polltlcs.</i>

245
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,833
This new chief wants to move past
the stain of the last five years.

246
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,242
The riots, lawsuits.

247

- Yeah, and we get screwed by a history lesson.
<i>- What about Kavanaugh?</i>

253
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,360

00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,867
You need to shift perception.

257
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,270
Start piling up some wins in bigger cases.

258
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,503

<i>- I'm a one-gal shop.</i>

264

00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,626
Attorney-client privilege.

280
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,794
It's all inadmissible.

281
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,566
This quasi-pharmaceutical shit...

282
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,768
caused an aneurysm in your sister.
It stroked her out.

283
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,903
We find out you knew
these drugs were illegal...

284
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,004
we're gonna arrest you
for manslaughter.

285
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,573
- You get these from the clinic?
- Clinic charged 45 bucks for her prescriptions.

286
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,653
That wasn't cheap enough
for you?

287
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,781
L-I knew they were Russian mob.
Had the same kind of drug.

288
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,793
<i>Ten bucks a bottle.</i>
<i>I was afrald to tell you.</i>

Operate out of
a strip joint on Hensley.

291
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,567
That's Popovich's place.

292
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,501
Popovich stepped in for Tretiak.
He's running the red clan now.

293
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,038
- Sounds like a guy we should get to know.
- Yeah.

294
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,199
Somebody trashed the Gruhani
brothers' trucking office.

295
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,904
Checked the brothers' homes. Looks like they
left in a hurry. Both Zal and Babak are M.I.A.

296
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,277
- Zal and Babak?
<i>- Yo, Vlc.</i>

- Hey!
- Oh, Shit.

302
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,493
Come on, girls. You know this is
a patch-the-snatch zone.

303
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,592
Here's your pink slip, ladies.

304

Mikula Popovich. [Chuckles]
I hear you're the czar to know.

305

You have warrant to be here?

306
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,674
Violation of pornography laws,
assaulting a police officer.

307
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,477
Probable cause.
Search and seizure, boys.

308
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,575
- About a half dozen of these in the supply room.
- Not much of a supply.

309
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,087
It's French label.
It's the same shit we got from the E.R.

310
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,352
You selling hangover cures,
Popovich?

311
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,419
No. I just like pussy.
Dancing pussy.

312
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,129
<i>[Curtls]</i>
<i>Turn around.</i>

314
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,008
Mikula lets me strip.
Better money.

315
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,272

On Alex?
That was over a year ago.

482
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,110

- So he's alive?

He moved to Panama.

487
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,261
Wanted to die
in his boyhood home.

488
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,429
So he e-mailed me to apologize
and say good-bye.

489
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,440
Had the techs plant cameras
and mikes in the garage.

493

He's doing okay.
He's real worried about his brother.

494
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,880
