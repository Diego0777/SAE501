1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,528
<i>Vic! Come on, dude!</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,441
<i>- Tell me you're leaving!
- That which doesn't kill me...</i>

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,608
<i>Come on! Come on! Let go!</i>

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,139
Vic!

5
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,008
Hi.

6
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,113
David Aceveda.
Vote for me. Appreciate it.

7
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,589
Hi. David Aceveda.
Vote for me.

8
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,353
That's an arm.

9
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,769
Went to Armadillo's place
to talk to him about Tio's murder.

10
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,044
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.

11
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,104
Signs of a struggle though.
Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove.

12
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,210
- Pretty ugly stuff.
- That sounds like Armadillo's M.O.

13
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,953
Checked Tio's phone records.

14
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:10,286
You were the last call he made
last night on his cell before he died.

15
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,989
Yeah. He sounded kind of agitated.

16
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,956
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.

17
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,860
What are you asking me?

18
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,364
Look, I don't like these questions
any more than you do.

19
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,735
I was with my guys all last night
while Tio was being killed.

20
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,375
Feel free to ask 'em.

21
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,340
Okay, then.

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,911
Single blow, a heavy blade.

23
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,474
- An ax, maybe a machete.
- How long ago?

24
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,482
<i>Based on core temp,
I'd say recently.</i>

25
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,388
- Three to four hours.
- So she's been dead since around 6:00.

26
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,892
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting...

27
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,190
indicate she was alive
when this happened.

28
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,327
- Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
- Okay.

29
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,234
If someone were trying to keep her
alive, how long could she survive?

30
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,810
With a tourniquet and basic
medical knowledge, indefinitely.

31
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,541
Until he tired of his domination and
control Dr. Mengele experiments...

32
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,539
<i>and decided to squeeze the last breath
out of her so he could watch.</i>

33
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,982
See, this is why you and me can't date.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,521
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.

35
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,963
I spoke to Shane.

36
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,955
He said you weren't with him
for about an hour last night.

37
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,803
Yeah. That's right.

38
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,863
I was with a private eye
named, uh, Gordie Liman.

39
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,672
- What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
- Nothing.

40
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,539
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.

41
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,143
I'm happy to help you
if you're helping me.

42
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,805
- Are you?
- I have been.

43
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,883
But I'm just about through.

44
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,213
I guess I'll have to
figure this out on my own.

45
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,889
What the hell was that all about?

46
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,825
Nothing.

47
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,030
Why didn't you just
leave it here and call 911?

48
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,503
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?

49
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,944
It's a bone.

50
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,572
The arm probably fell out of the
Dumpster when the truck picked it up.

51
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,939
Call city services. Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.

52
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,951
The rest of her might still be
in that truck. Alive, even.

53
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,884
Lowe, did we I.D.
the fingerprints yet?

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,886
<i>- There's a backlog.
- Backlog? I cant find her if I can't I.D. her.</i>

55
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,255
Give me that. Have your guys
do door knocks. Talk to every neighbor.

56
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,863
Tell everyone if they find anything,
give me a call.

57
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,033
This is Detective Wagenbach.

58
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,370
I told you I needed
a rush on those prints.

59
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,498
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.

60
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,037
And if she is, I'd hate to see
your backlog cost her her life.

61
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,542
<i>- You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
- You were gone for an hour.</i>

62
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,343
Jesus! She's all over my ass
about this Tio connection.

63
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,678
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.

64
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,720
<i>- Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
- You are lying to her.</i>

65
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,882
- What, are you trying to be a wiseass?
- No, I'm just...

66
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,593
Just shut the hell up!

67
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,558
- Christ!
- Where are we headed?

68
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,198
I got things to do. I gave you guys
to Aceveda for the day.

69
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,560
<i>- What?
- Apparently, a group of male hustlers...</i>

70
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,229
is hangin' out on the same block
as Aceveda's campaign headquarters.

71
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,964
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.

72
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,339
<i>- You can't be serious.
- Your shirt's gay enough for the job.</i>

73
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,312
<i>- What do you mean
you gave us to Aceveda? What...</i>

74
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,748
Great. I've got your assignments.
Briefing room, five minutes.

75
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,626
Is everything okay with Kayla?

76
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,026
When was the last time
you saw your roommate?

77
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,030
- Last night around 6:00.
- She didn't come home all night?

78
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,764
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.

79
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,404
Any idea where she might have gone?

80
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,272
There's two million single men in L.A.
Take your pick.

81
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,207
We found her car in the garage, but not her
purse or keys. Is there someone close?

82
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,845
Somewhere she
might have walked to?

83
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,278
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?

84
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,581
We have every reason to believe
that she's still alive.

85
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,485
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch...

86
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,522
but our rent's due next week.

87
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,931
- Vic. I got great news.
- What?

88
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,628
Just be glad you hired me and not
the brain-dead idiot your wife did.

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,462
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?

90
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,998
Corrine's P.I., they're making
nonsecure calls from his cell phone.

91
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,303
I caught one.
Found where she's at.

92
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,574
- Beauty. You got the address?
- Yeah, sure.

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,247
- Oh, geez.
- Corrine... Don't run away.

94
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,414
Just hear me out
for two seconds.

95
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,827
Look, this running has to stop.

96
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,261
How much time
could you possibly need?

97
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,927
This isn't about me, Vic. It's about
our kids, about them being safe.

98
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,589
Do you honestly think
I'd put my children in danger?

99
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,635
Not intentionally,
but the things going on in your life...

100
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,635
Something told me to run.

101
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,334
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.

102
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,711
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.

103
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,773
This isn't gonna
change things between us.

104
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,415
Don't punish them
because of me.

105
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,752
I'll move out if I have to,
if that's what it takes.

106
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,457
But I need to know that they're
at home where they can be safe.

107
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,431
I don't... I don't know, okay?
I'll think about it.

108
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,010
Hey, how'd your meeting
with I.A.D. go last night?

109
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,311
Good. Good.

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,311
You ran out of here so quick.

111
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,383
They told me not
to discuss it with anyone.

112
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,019
But it went fine.

113
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,158
Anything yet?

114
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,764
- Hi. I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right. Just a second.

115
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,404
<i>- Bob, the police are here.
- Police? Open it.</i>

116
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,116
I saw you all coming in.
What's going on?

117
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,346
I'm investigating
your neighbor's disappearance.

118
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,120
You hear or see anything
suspicious last night?

119
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,818
- Which neighbor?
- Kayla LeSeur.

120
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,861
Oh, man. We heard her arguing
last night out on the balcony.

121
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,501
Yeah, around midnight. I saw her
through the window with a guy.

122
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,993
- You recognize him?
- Yeah. Marcy had me come take a look.

123
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,602
I've seen him around a few times.

124
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,037
Come down, give a description?

125
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,475
Uh, sure. Let me
just grab my jacket.

126
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,511
Great.

127
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,819
- Alvarez?
- All right. Let's take Union.

128
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,892
Hey, how's my favorite hillbilly?

129
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,189
Joe, what in the hell
you doin' here?

130
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,459
I'm here to meet
the big guy for lunch.

131
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,298
- Hey, you still crackin' skulls?
- Yeah, man. How's retirement?

132
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,836
- I'm shavin' a few strokes off my golf game.
- You look good.

133
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,100
- You I don't know.
- Ronnie Gardocki.

134
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,006
Joe Clarke. Taught your boss
everything he knows.

135
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,806
<i>Yeah, but you didn't teach me
everything you know, right?</i>

136
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,575
That's right.
I'm saving some.

137
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,515
- We're gonna grab a bite. Wanna go?
- They're busy.

138
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,991
When I miss tee time at Riviera
for this, you better be buying.

139
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,790
Riviera? Since when do they let
hacks like you play at Riviera?

140
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,004
You guys still here?
Come on!

141
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,996
Hey, who was that with Vic?

142
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,701
- Joe Clarke, his old partner.
- They kicked him off the force.

143
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,810
- Why is that?
- Some punk took a swing at his last partner.

144
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,905
Joe knocked out like half
of his teeth in front of this crowd.

145
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,376
<i>Total railroad job.</i>

146
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,784
Don't worry. It's nothing like
what you're going through.

147
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,725
So it's been a year
since you called me up.

148
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,795
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?

149
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,731
Can't I buy you lunch?

150
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,998
Vic, come on.

151
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,965
It's, uh...

152
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,274
been a pretty rough ride lately...

153
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,509
Enough I'm thinking about
gettin' off the train.

154
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,386
You wanna give up your badge?

155
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,925
I'm lookin' for a sign.
Seen any around?

156
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,194
You don't wanna give it up.

157
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,163
- Retirement's been pretty good to you.
- A forced retirement.

158
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,496
Believe me. I still miss it.

159
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,232
We can hit the links
together every day.

160
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,939
What's bothering you now?

161
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,177
When, uh...

162
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,312
When we were ridin'...

163
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,717
you ever feel like
you went too far?

164
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,296
Yeah. Couple times, maybe.

165
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,763
Probably.

166
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,867
Definitely.

167
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,768
<i>Hell, you can't always
land just right.</i>

168
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,342
Goin' too far will get you fired. Not
goin' far enough will get you killed.

169
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,949
I never lost any sleep
over it though.

170
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:34,181
Anyway, we always did
more good than bad, right?

171
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,920
Right.

172
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,356
That's the key.

173
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,067
- Yeah. That's him, all right.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,675
- Good.
- Anything else we can do?
She was such a nice girl.

175
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,706
She still is.

176
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,547
Roommate I.D.'d the photo
as a Jordan Arnold.

177
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,143
Run the D.M.V.
Get me an address now.

178
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,081
We're running out of time.

179
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,657
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.

180
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,455
That guy had to be 6'6" easy.

181
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:20,060
- Still, that bust was when I knew.
- Knew?

182
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,362
That maybe you wouldn't be
a complete screwup after all.

183
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,639
<i>- Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
- No, I can't.</i>

184
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,105
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.

185
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,612
Bullshit. This is your
training officer, all right?

186
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,740
Take the afternoon off. Humor an old man.
Take a right. Come on.

187
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,382
All right.

188
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,419
<i>Yes?</i>

189
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,418
I've got a problem
on this Tio murder.

190
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,722
What's that?

191
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,328
The more I look into it,
the more Vic Mackey's name pops up.

192
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,957
Well, Tio was Vic's C.I.

193
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,035
He was also a drug dealer.

194
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,034
Vic's name is all over
his phone records.

195
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,902
<i>But Vic told me he hadn't
talked to him in months.</i>

196
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,102
- He lied.
- Well, what do you wanna do about it?

197
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,817
I went through Tio's place.

198
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:16,652
I found his business ledger detailing
payments made to a landlord.

199
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,791
I wanna check them against Vic's
cash deposits in his bank accounts.

200
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,794
I need your authorization.

201
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,557
Claudette, Vic's one of us.

202
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,311
I got a dead drug dealer.

203
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,678
I got a suspect who's
probably skipped town...

204
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,908
and the only person who
can shed some light on it...

205
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,217
is an uncooperative cop
with a bad rep.

206
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,081
You want me to let this case
just slip away, son?

207
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,726
<i>I.A.D. on Danny's shooting.</i>

208
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,925
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.

209
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,069
<i>Everything looking good
for my officer?</i>

210
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,844
- Getting all the cooperation you need?
- Pardon?

211
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,917
'Cause if anybody's giving you
any interference, I can help.

212
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,688
Ah. Thanks.

213
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,026
Claudette, witness brought in
a freshly amputated arm.

214
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,324
I'm thinking sadomasochist,
probably keeping her alive.

215
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,223
- I've got a suspect named Jordan Arnold.
- Let me help you with that.

216
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,724
Thanks. I can use a sounding board.

217
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,335
Know who lives there?

218
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,471
Cocksucker who cost me my job.

219
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,641
- Fleetwood.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,083
City paid off the lawsuit: 1.2 mil.

221
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,451
<i>He moved back
just a couple months ago.</i>

222
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,888
- Son of a bitch.
- Hey.

223
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,824
How'd you like to help me do some good,
serve up a little karmic justice?

224
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,228
- Joe...
- Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him
on a felony before nightfall.

225
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,631
These assholes could win a lottery
and still not keep their noses clean.

226
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>See that little prick?
He got one over on me, man.</i>

227
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,505
- You know that ain't right.
- Yes, I know it's not right.

228
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,371
<i>- Then here we go.
- Lookee here!</i>

229
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,409
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- Bitch that made me rich!</i>

230
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,741
You thought it'd be fun to beat on me
like a punk nigga now, huh?

231
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,647
- Who's the nigga now?
- Hey! Step back!

232
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,880
Yeah. Here. Go get yourself
some new gear on me.

233
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,492
Go back to your party, burn out
whatever brain cells you got left.

234
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,823
Come on, bitch. Hit me!
I could use another couple million.

235
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,397
- Put the camera down.
- Come on. Show's just startin'.

236
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,563
Hey, let go of him!
Let go!

237
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,536
- Back off!
- That's all right. I'll just buy me a new one.

238
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,231
Hey, what's this?

239
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,606
That's a Palm. Keep it.
Got ten more on order.

240
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:58,308
Why don't you
crawl on back to your crib?

241
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,419
Hey, you need a beer,
keg's always on tap.

242
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,793
Yeah. This ain't right.

243
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,278
What's the verdict?

244
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,304
Well, other than a few hiccups,
it's looking good.

245
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,950
What hiccups?

246
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,783
According to Julien's statement,
he didn't see the shooting.

247
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,356
What do you mean?
He was right there!

248
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,119
He says he was
in the woman's apartment.

249
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,018
<i>But I wouldn't
worry about it though.</i>

250
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,992
It's gonna be a good shoot.

251
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,079
- Dutch.
- Jordan's alibi checked out.

252
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,513
I ran a records check on
everyone in Kayla's building.

253
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,919
- Any hits?
- Two: A woman passing bad checks
and a Bob Lindhoff.

254
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,251
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.

255
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,250
Nine years ago, an attempted
kidnapping charge, later dropped.

256
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,698
She's coming to again. Get in the car.

257
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:50,662
Hey! Hey, I tried to call,
but there was no answer.

258
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,826
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?

259
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,329
I've got a suspect down at the station
I was hoping you could I.D.

260
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,264
You mind coming back?

261
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,964
<i>- Uh, is it really necessary?
- Yeah, do you mind?</i>

262
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,136
- No, not at all.
- Great. Follow me.

263
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,284
Hey. Fleetwood's been checkin' in
with his parole officer...

264
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,750
doin' community service
and scrubbin' graffiti.

265
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,324
Sumbitch is totally clean. You?

266
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,790
I ran some of the names
he had in his Palm Pilot.

267
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,361
He had four two-strikers
in his address book.

268
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,692
You need a new C.I.?

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
- Doesn't everyone?
- I'm gonna hit the head.

270
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,497
Then we can go do
some arm twistin', huh?

271
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,644
- Vic, we need to talk.
- What's up?

272
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,610
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.

273
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,409
He was supposed to burn that.

274
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,022
Well, apparently,
Armadillo burned him first.

275
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,887
Claudette wants to run
your financials against Tio's records.

276
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,255
Fine. Let her.

277
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,486
- You sure?
- Trust me. She's not gonna find anything.

278
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,302
- What's Joe Clarke doing here?
- You know Joe?

279
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:07,329
I remember his picture
in the papers. He can't be here.

280
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,467
Hey, he's a friend of mine.

281
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,143
And he's also an embarrassment
to this department.

282
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,075
So unless he's here
to report a crime...

283
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,805
I can't allow him
in this building.

284
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,983
I don't know.
Makes you think.

285
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,486
Vic says the guy was
a real crackerjack cop.

286
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,989
Somebody like him can get booted,
man, none of us are safe.

287
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,459
Come on. The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.

288
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,359
- Nothing's gonna happen to us.
- How are you so sure?

289
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:37,159
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.

290
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,634
Stupid, huh?

291
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,501
- Vic, I...
- What's stupid is Joe's
twice the cop you'll ever be.

292
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,074
You're too sloppy
to even know it.

293
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,008
- Here we go again.
- I guess so.

294
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,715
You know, I'm gettin'
a little tired of this bullshit.

295
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,715
<i>I'm gettin' tired of constantly having
to clean up after your bullshit!</i>

296
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,217
Every time something goes to shit in
your life, I become your whipping boy.

297
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,152
Why don't you find someone else?

298
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,724
- Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
- You want my transfer request?

299
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,521
Say the word, Vic! It'll be on Aceveda's
desk first thing in the morning!

300
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,661
- Fine. Write it up.
- Fine!

301
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,163
Asshole.

302
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,203
- What'd you call me?
- Hey, hey! Everything all right?

303
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,703
Yeah. Just a little spring cleaning.

304
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,706
Let's ride.

305
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,534
I thought this was about
I.D.'ing somebody.

306
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,695
Actually, we're more interested
in the kidnapping charge...

307
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,103
that was filed
against you in 1993.

308
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,202
That was a misunderstanding.

309
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,107
- You were 35 at the time, right?
- Correct.

310
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,011
- And your girlfriend was in high school?
- She was 18.

311
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,448
And you took her away on vacation for
two weeks and never told her parents.

312
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:07,991
I know. In hindsight,
it was just a bad judgment call.

313
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,025
But Amanda was an adult.

314
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,288
You're 17 years older
than Marcy too.

315
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,423
You like 'em young, Bob?

316
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:19,059
Yeah. They just...
feel right.

317
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,034
Did Kayla feel right?

318
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,538
I wouldn't know.

319
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,338
<i>- I know how you feel.
- Excuse me?</i>

320
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,577
What'd your partner do?

321
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,376
He's not backing me up
on the shooting.

322
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:39,013
- If that guy costs me a promotion...
- He's not backing you up?

323
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,524
<i>- After all I've covered for him.
- You covered for him?</i>

324
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,186
- What did he do?
- Nothin'.

325
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,131
Hey, it's cool.
You can tell me.

326
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,896
No. It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.

327
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,907
Seeing the way you stiffed your partner,
I figure you're just one big hard-on today.

328
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:08,414
- Excuse me?
- You know what
an officer-involved shooting means?

329
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,746
It means that we're all involved.

330
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,588
- I told the truth.
- When it comes to your partner's career...

331
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,694
the truth is like grits.

332
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,789
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.

333
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,864
You goddamn rookies.

334
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,629
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.

335
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,672
That's real... That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.

336
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,400
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with...

337
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,580
Drop the clothes, ladies.
Although, you have got to have that one.

338
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,707
- She's keeping that one for free.
- Wait... Whoa!

339
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,585
- I got receipts for all this, man!
- Oh, yeah? That's funny.

340
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,644
I got a police report for it
from Dress For Less.

341
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,985
Dealin' stolen merchandise,
Taylor.

342
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,853
That's your third strike...
before you're 25 years old.

343
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,729
That makes you the goddamn
rookie of the year.

344
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,289
I got a little baby at home.
She need milk and books, man.

345
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,495
Only thing you got at home...

346
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,567
is a wide-screen TV
you haven't paid for yet!

347
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,772
- Ow!
- Here's your statement. Sign it.

348
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,380
Whoa, man. What the hell is this, man?
This is all filled out.

349
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,078
You don't wanna sign? I'll throw you in
County right now on that third strike.

350
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,123
And if I sign this
bullshit confession?

351
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,886
Play ball with us,
we'll let you play extra innings.

352
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,727
We know you've been selling
stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.

353
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,719
Give us a hand, we'll lose this
statement. We'll forget we ever saw you.

354
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,665
Man!

355
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,400
Oh, my God.

356
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,136
Why would someone
do this to her?

357
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:46,011
<i>Most likely trying to fill
a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.</i>

358
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,550
Why would someone fantasize
about cutting a woman's arm off?

359
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,558
Some people derive
sexual pleasure...

360
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:57,927
through inflicting
physical, emotional abuse.

361
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,127
That's horrible.

362
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,996
Yes, it is.

363
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,000
How old were you
when you met Bob?

364
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:12,268
<i>- Is he your first boyfriend?
- How did you know?</i>

365
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,709
He made you
feel powerful, right?

366
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,916
Did he tell you about the attempted
kidnapping charges filed against him?

367
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,989
Yes. Why?

368
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,557
Bob went to medical school
for two years.

369
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,127
So?

370
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,398
So...

371
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:37,198
So if a woman had her arm cut off,
he'd know how to keep her alive.

372
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,631
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

373
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:45,233
No. I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.

374
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,379
What'd we get back on the river basins
and the state parks check?

375
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,746
Nothing. We're still waiting
for regional and county.

376
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,653
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.

377
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,952
Bob's cold, manipulative. Always been
with women he could control.

378
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,790
Marcy accepts this
'cause she knows no better.

379
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,884
She's been force-fed his opinions to the
point she's incapable of having her own.

380
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,359
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.

381
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,523
Believe me, if you'd grown up
in my family for 20 years...

382
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,464
you'd recognize it
right away too.

383
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,197
I'm gonna, uh,
go it on my own on this.

384
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,603
Marcy only knows how to
take orders from men like Bob.

385
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,302
I-I can handle this.

386
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,113
Bob is innocent.

387
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,720
I understand.
You're afraid of him.

388
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,981
- I'm not afraid of him.
- It's okay.

389
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,614
I can protect you, but only
if you tell me what he's doing.

390
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,489
<i>- He's not doing anything.
- Don't lie to me, Marcy!</i>

391
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,130
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are!

392
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:44,735
<i>Bob tells you how to think,
how to feel, how to act.</i>

393
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,371
<i>- Without him, you're worthless. Nothing.
- It's not like that!</i>

394
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,738
<i>And you won't leave him because you're
afraid no one else will ever love you...</i>

395
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,270
that you'll learn Bob
was right about you all along.

396
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,677
- No!
- Oh, damn it, Marcy!

397
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,610
<i>- Don't lie to me!
- Why are you doing this?</i>

398
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,842
Because there's a girl out there
who may still be alive...

399
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,420
and I won't let you kill her!

400
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,650
Now, goddamn it!
Tell me right now! Where is she?

401
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,284
I don't know!

402
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,864
Really! I don't!

403
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,564
<i>I played the daddy.
I broke her.</i>

404
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,572
If she knew Bob was involved,
she would've confessed...

405
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,145
or at least given me
a nondenial.

406
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,748
- You think?
- I don't know.

407
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,047
Maybe Bob's not
a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

408
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,322
<i>Maybe he's just an asshole.</i>

409
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:40,758
<i>Problem is, he's the only
asshole we've got.</i>

410
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,938
- Well, what do you got for me?
- What you got for me?

411
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,703
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.

412
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,849
Fleetwood is fencin' again.

413
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,750
He's so goddamn predictable.

414
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,948
- What's he movin'?
- Just, you know, warehouse electronics, man.

415
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,251
CDs, TVs, DVDs.
Same stuff as before.

416
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,696
Where's he keeping his stash?

417
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:21,689
Are you gonna hold this third strike
over me for the rest of my life?

418
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:26,169
I could lie to you, but I have far too
much respect for you as a person.

419
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,335
Yes, I am.

420
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,144
Here is your authorization to check
Mackey's financial records.

421
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,643
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.

422
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,547
I just hope
you find the truth.

423
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,190
Hey, Joe. It's Vic.

424
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,273
<i>Can you believe
I walked out on them?</i>

425
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,146
When they left,
I thought it'd be easier.

426
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:18,880
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd
miss them. Guess I'm the shithead, huh?

427
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,826
- Stacy still on the swim team?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

428
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,359
Yeah, she, uh...
Damn it!

429
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,298
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

430
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:35,030
<i>- Broke, with nothing.
- What about your pension?</i>

431
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,333
<i>Damn lawyers for
the civil suit ate it up.</i>

432
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,412
<i>- What about the stuff
you took on the side?
- I guess I didn't take enough.</i>

433
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,006
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.

434
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,213
<i>- Joe, you can't live like this.
- Oh, sure I can.</i>

435
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,613
The truth is, the people we save
from the worst day of their lives...

436
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,223
never gotta see us
when we have to face ours.

437
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:56,023
Hell, and why should they?
We took the job, not them.

438
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,656
<i>- No, that's not right.
- What you gonna do, man?</i>

439
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,594
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

440
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,701
- Fleetwood's got a warehouse
full of stolen merch.
- No.

441
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,500
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.

442
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,402
- We get you some new digs.
- I can't let you do that, all right?

443
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,909
Hey, I'm just... I'm just
trying to do some good.

444
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,483
<i>You know, and deliver
some karmic justice.</i>

445
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,846
Now are you in,
or are you out?

446
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,432
Easy. Don't suck
on his tailpipe.

447
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,481
<i>One second.</i>

448
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,844
- Yeah.
- It's me.

449
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,454
- Where are you?
- Home.

450
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:59,014
- What, our home?
- Yeah. The keys still work.

451
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,020
- Are the kids with you?
- Yeah. We're all here.

452
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,023
Oh, thank you.

453
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,562
- This doesn't change things.
- I know.

454
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,293
- When can I see them?
- Now?

455
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,903
I got to finish up somethin' first.
I'll be right there.

456
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,273
- Okay.
- Okay.

457
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,075
<i>Looks like he's making a deposit.</i>

458
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,810
Yeah, you gotta love good intel.

459
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,317
Stay here.
Watch my back.

460
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,701
<i>This is for my boy down the street.</i>

461
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,372
Fully automatic. You know
what I get for those on the street?

462
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,238
Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!
Fingers interlaced!

463
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,846
Palms on the back
of your head. Now, asshole!

464
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,085
<i>Come on, man! Let's move! Let's move!</i>

465
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,889
- Vic!
- Stay back!

466
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:38,146
- Vic! You been hit?
- I'm all right. Get out of here.

467
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,382
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
- Just get out of here.

468
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,550
<i>- No, no, I'm not ditching you, man.
- You're not ditching me.</i>

469
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,457
I can't explain
you being here to Aceveda.

470
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,860
<i>Now, go! Just call an ambulance
and call my family!</i>

471
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,366
<i>I'm gonna kill
that sumbitch!</i>

472
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,869
No. No. Don't.

473
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,020
Goddamn it!

474
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,324
<i>Christ. I hate playing this with you.</i>

475
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,231
<i>This game's sucking.</i>

476
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,235
- You could stop.
- Shut up.

477
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,171
It's Vic.

478
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,175
Hey, what's up, boss?

479
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,778
Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?

480
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,910
- What?
- Vic got shot.

481
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,784
- What?
- Vic got shot.

482
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,262
- Can we leave?
- Shouldn't be much longer.

483
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,227
Oh, please.

484
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,696
Don't walk out on me again.

485
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,936
Just please don't leave me alone.

486
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,176
Look, um...

487
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,144
I believe you.

488
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,409
Maybe Bob did this
without you knowing.

489
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,482
I was with him all night.

490
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:23,753
If I thought he did this,
I would tell you. I would.

491
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,330
I know you would.

492
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,003
- Who did this to you?
- Fleetwood.

493
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,302
That prick that got Joe
kicked off the force?

494
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,776
Yeah. Joe's goin' after him.
You gotta stop him.

495
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,141
Okay.

496
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,147
You gotta stop him.

497
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,614
- Come on, guys. We're losing blood.
- Just hang in there.

498
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,812
- Gotta go.
- Just hang in there.

499
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,694
Detective Wyms,
Carlson just called.

500
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,889
There's a homeless guy with a bloody
machete saying he killed somebody.

501
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,026
- Where?
- Just south of Bell on Vine.

502
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,259
That's a block from Kayla's apartment.
Where's Dutch?

503
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,065
I don't know. Maybe he's checking
in on Vic. Have you heard anything?

504
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,571
Not yet. Find Dutch.
Tell him to meet me there.

505
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,606
Excuse me. Excuse me.
They got the guy?

506
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,683
<i>- Sir, put the knife down, please.
- I'll kill again!</i>

507
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,115
<i>- Drop your weapon!
- I killed them all!</i>

508
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,519
J.F.K., R.F.K., M.L.K.

509
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,421
- Carlson, got bean bags?
- Locked and loaded.

510
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,924
Run D.M.C.!

511
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,892
That's the guy?
He's a nut.

512
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,692
<i>- I was told he had a bloody machete.
- I called in a kitchen knife.</i>

513
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,231
- Oh, for Christ's sakes.
- I was told to call if I found anything.

514
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,200
End this!
Come on.

515
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:45,003
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Just a bean bag, ma'am.</i>

516
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,642
- Let's get back to Bob and Marcy.
- I released them.

517
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,304
- You what?
- I thought we had the guy here.

518
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,616
Bob didn't do it.
Marcy would've told me.

519
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,984
<i>Stay still for me, sir. That's it.</i>

520
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,150
- I'm his boss. How is he?
- He's gonna live, but we need him in surgery.

521
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,991
- Not until I see my kids.
- Vic, don't be stupid.

522
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,064
They're on their way here.
They're gonna be here any second.

523
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,529
<i>- Vic.
- Where are they?</i>

524
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,932
- They're in the waiting room.
- I gotta see 'em.

525
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,868
- I won't let you. Not like this.
- Corrine...

526
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:20,237
- I don't want them to be scared.
- They won't be.

527
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,508
Vic.

528
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,341
Daddy!

529
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,282
<i>- Hi.
- Daddy.</i>

530
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,355
I missed you so much.

531
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,355
Kiss.

532
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,357
<i>Hey, Matty.</i>

533
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,020
Give Daddy a kiss.

534
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,066
<i>Hey, Vic, I really
need you in here now.</i>

535
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:47,726
- Dad, don't go again.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I have to.

536
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,998
Listen, someone was
hurt really bad...

537
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,870
and I have to stay here
until he feels better.

538
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:56,809
But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come
and see you again, okay? I promise.

539
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,914
I love you.

540
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,811
- Where is he?
- Who?

541
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:38,216
Fleetwood. You're packing his goddamn
suitcase. Now, where is he?

542
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,824
- I forget.
- Where's your boyfriend at?

543
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,017
- I don't even hear you.
- He just shot my partner.

544
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,890
- Hey, where is he? Where is he?
- What are you gonna do, hit me?

545
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,464
- I don't see any witnesses here.
- Yeah? Let my bruises do the talking.

546
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,603
Don't make me do something
that we both don't want me to do.

547
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:56,095
- Yeah? Go ahead.
- Just tell me where he is!

548
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,910
<i>Please. Just tell me where he is.</i>

549
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,903
Go ahead and whack me, you cracker
prick. I'll make my own million.

550
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,580
- Is that what you want?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,083
- Is that what you really want?
- Mmm.

552
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,745
- All right, let's go. Let's go.
- What? What are you...

553
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:20,196
- Come here!
- No! Let go of me!

554
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,161
- Leave me alone!
- Open up!

555
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,994
<i>What's goin'on in there?</i>

556
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,999
<i>Shane, come on!</i>

557
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:31,573
You and me, we're about to get real
acquainted if you don't start remembering.

558
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,939
- Don't touch me!
- Where is he?

559
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,445
- Open up!
- Let go of me!

560
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,083
You don't wanna tell me?

561
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,345
- Damn it! Open the door!
- Just let go of me!

562
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:48,618
Well, maybe I should just let my dick
do the talking. How about that, huh?

563
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,590
- Huh?
- Open the goddamn door!

564
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,593
- Shane, come on!
- Where is he? Where is he?

565
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,266
Okay!

566
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,528
He told me to meet him
at the stash house.

567
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,798
- Where?
- Open up! Come on!

568
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,965
<i>Near the bridge.</i>

569
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,844
<i>Come on!
You're freaking me out!</i>

570
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,948
You have no idea
what you just missed, darlin'.

571
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,645
<i>- Come on!
- Asshole!</i>

572
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,032
Couldn't split town before you
picked up the merchandise, huh?

573
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,139
<i>You were always
such an idiot, Fleetwood.</i>

574
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,300
Weren't you?

575
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:44,039
- You can't arrest me.
- I'm not here to arrest you, asshole.

576
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,699
<i>- Drop it! Put that on the ground!
- You heard him, asshole!</i>

577
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,463
Now! Turn around!
Turn around!

578
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,639
Your girlfriend gave you up, man.

579
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,472
She couldn't resist my charms.

580
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,982
- You found something?
- Yeah. Over here.

581
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,018
While I was checking
the bathroom, this tile fell off.

582
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,689
<i>It looks directly into
Kayla's bathroom.</i>

583
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:38,025
Oh, God. Oh, God. We got
to get an A.P.B. out on their car.

584
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,800
<i>Jesus.</i>

585
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:48,274
- You okay?
- Better than you.

586
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,849
Looks like I taught you
my last lesson, huh?

587
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,089
Don't end up like me.

588
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,733
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

589
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,639
Going after that guy
was the right thing to do.

590
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:25,645
- Hell, I got you shot.
- I always knew there was
a bullet with my name on it.

591
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:30,686
<i>And guess what?
I'm still here.</i>

592
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,621
So are you.

593
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,498
Hey, you really ought
to get in there and see him.

594
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,126
Yeah. Me and Vic aren't
really talkin' right now.

595
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,436
He'd want to see you.

596
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:54,077
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

597
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,251
Hey, what the hell
is going on?

598
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,424
We found the peephole, Bob.

599
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,984
- What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
- Step away!

600
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,293
- It's clean.
- Pop it.

601
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,951
She's dead.

602
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,524
She didn't like the way
I looked at Kayla.

603
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,152
And the arm was her idea.

604
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,391
She was in the trunk...
the whole time?

605
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:56,004
<i>Marcy, why didn't you tell me?</i>

606
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,003
Marcy.

607
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,474
Sorry, Daddy.

608
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,130
Oh, Shane.

609
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,862
<i>- Hey.
- When we retire...</i>

610
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:32,168
we're gonna play golf
together every day.

611
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,971
I never played golf.

612
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,678
I'll teach you.

613
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,583
I'd really like that.
