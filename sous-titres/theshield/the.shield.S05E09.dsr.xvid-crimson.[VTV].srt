1
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,867
If you could, uh have your
clients walk me through

2
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,067
the house where Terry Crowley
was killed,

3
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:16,067
that would be great.

4
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,534
Hey!

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,267
Terry was
workin' for justice.

6
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:28,951
Officer Danielle Sofer,
who works here,

7
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:31,251
if filing paperwork admitting
to a sexual relationship

8
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:33,318
with Vic over
the last couple of years.

9
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,318
Officer Sofer
is now pregnant.

10
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,251
I need to know everything
you know about these men.

11
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:38,483
The price is simple.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,251
I help you put away
these fine young men,

13
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:44,318
you make sure you put
them away right here.

14
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:45,550
So you can kill them?

15
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:46,884
I made a life
for myself.

16
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,117
You been missin' me?

17
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:49,318
Ex-wife.

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,517
Ask me
to come back again.

19
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,017
You're here to be
remanded for psychiatric.

20
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,684
And I am
your goddamn wife.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,684
At least we found
his weak spot.

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,051
Come on, Jon!

23
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,417
Shit. Go!

24
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:59,650
Don't leave me,
Jon!

25
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:01,350
Hey!
You're under arrest

26
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,084
for possession
of heroin

27
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,917
with intent
to distribute!

28
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,383
Yeah.
Come on and have a seat.

29
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:14,318
I need you to tell me
everything that you know

30
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:16,350
about Mackey
and his Strike Team.

31
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,383
No deal.

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,051
You got your deal!

33
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,184
hey, man.

34
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,051
How's it goin'?

35
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,184
All right.

36
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,017
What's goin' on?
Have we got a plan?

37
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,117
Yeah. Get you the hell
out of here.

38
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:16,884
Did Mara back off
puttin' up

39
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,284
her and shane's house
as collateral?

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,584
We're still
workin' on bail, right?

41
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,284
But Kavanaugh had the irs
freeze our assets,

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,617
all of us.

43
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:28,318
So I'm stuck.

44
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,450
I mean, there's no way
you're comin' up

45
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,817
with $100,000.

46
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,483
I've already filed a motion
to have your bail reduced.

47
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,784
OK. How long you think
I need to hold out for?

48
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,184
You listen to me.

49
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:46,084
24 hours,
you're out of here.

50
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,851
Tomorrow night,
you sleep in your own bed.

51
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,917
You just gotta stay good
for 24.

52
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,350
All right, man.

53
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,383
All right.

54
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,450
Take the back.

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,084
Don't move!

56
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,550
Jeez, stay still!

57
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:17,984
Don't move, damn it!

58
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,117
Police!
Drop your weapon!

59
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:20,784
It's OK! Don't shoot!

60
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:21,650
I said
drop your weapon!

61
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:22,784
Don't shoot!
I'm a cop!

62
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,617
God damn it drop
your weapon now!

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,684
Stop!

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,117
Stop right there!

65
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,717
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!

66
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,218
Get on your knees!
Nice work.

67
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:36,450
Rookie, right?

68
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,684
Look, man, tell your
partner not to shoot.

69
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,517
He's undercover!

70
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,884
I didn't know.

71
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,784
He didn't identify
himself.

72
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:45,817
His right arm!

73
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,450
It's the color
of the day.

74
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:50,084
Which makes you
ditz of the month, honey.

75
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,717
Terry went down... here?

76
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,617
Uh, yeah, about
where that chair is.

77
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:10,318
Uh, two-time
came out blastin'.

78
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,350
Terry went down.

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,817
We fired back.

80
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:16,951
Ballistics gave Vic
the kill shot.

81
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,650
I must've been
a close second.

82
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,750
I was off of my game,
I guess.

83
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,383
Were you off your game

84
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,684
when angie stubbs
got murdered?

85
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,318
Your bullet got
the kill shot on that one.

86
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,817
Gun wasn't
in my hand.

87
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,184
Right.

88
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,717
Angie's death got pinned
on Antwon Mitchell.

89
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:33,851
Nothing got pinned.

90
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,017
He killed her.

91
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,084
Right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,417
Uh...

93
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,417
you just watched.

94
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:43,784
Mitchell ever
give you any money?

95
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,284
Put you
on his payroll?

96
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,417
He was undercover.
It's all documented.

97
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,951
Not all of it.

98
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,550
Not the drug payoffs.

99
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:53,151
Not the One-Niner pimps
you were shakin' down.

100
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:55,051
Not the nights and days
that you spent

101
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:58,383
bein' Antwon Mitchell's
bought bitch.

102
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,550
You think that I
don't know about that?

103
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,784
We are here to talk
about Terry Crowley.

104
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,284
Otherwise,
we'll be going.

105
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,151
Sure.

106
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,550
Hey, stay here.

107
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:22,750
Why don't you
just relax, asshole?

108
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,017
I'm just coppin'
a squat, all right?

109
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,517
Detective Mackey!

110
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,151
Come on up.

111
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:43,784
According to you,
Terry entered the room

112
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,184
before it was cleared.

113
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,151
I failed to clear
the bathroom.

114
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:56,383
I looked, I thought
it was clear...

115
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:01,017
but two-time must have
been behind the wall.

116
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,184
There were noises, uh,

117
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,084
movements from the
other side of the house.

118
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,584
Shane and I started
that way.

119
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:12,350
I moved on
before I should've.

120
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,617
I'm gonna
have to live with that.

121
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,051
Soon as I turned around,
about 2 seconds,

122
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:21,784
I heard the shot...

123
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,584
and Terry fell.

124
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,951
We returned fire.

125
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,184
Now, we can run this
6 more times.

126
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,017
Two-time's always
gonna have the gun,

127
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:31,750
and Terry's always
gonna be dead.

128
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,051
Right.

129
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,383
You got some kind
of a problem?

130
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,851
Thought you'd remember
Drew from Terry's funeral.

131
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,151
But, no matter.

132
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,383
Drew Crowley...

133
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,184
Vic Mackey.

134
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,650
Doesn't remember 'cause
he never looked

135
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,251
at me or my family
that day.

136
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:56,951
<i>Formerly officer Drew
Crowley, San diego.

137
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,917
Left the force after
his brother was murdered.

138
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,917
Mothers, you know.

139
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:03,750
I just wanted
to see your face.

140
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,084
Here, where my brother died.

141
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,584
Of all the underhanded
bullsh...

142
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,584
now I want to know
the truth.

143
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,584
What happened
to my brother?

144
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,917
Tell the truth,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:10,984
Get him out right now!

146
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,717
Hey, no, no.

147
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,750
If you killed him...
God'll know.

148
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,550
My brother
was a good man.

149
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:23,084
I'm sorry
what happened to him.

150
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,350
It went down
just like I said.

151
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,851
Come on, Vic.
Let's go.

152
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,584
If you're lying,
God'll have your soul,

153
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,550
and I will give it
to him personally.

154
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,806
SMOKED

155
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,184
All our stories
matched up.

156
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,517
Maybe now he'll give up
this bullshit case.

157
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,917
Move on to shit
we actually did.

158
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,084
All bullshit.

159
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,184
This is about
rubbing our faces

160
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,950
in the intel he's
already uncovered.

161
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,317
Like what?

162
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:51,917
He knew
all about the pimps

163
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,317
me and army were bleedin'.

164
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:54,684
Where the hell
did he get that?

165
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,784
I don't know.
Antwon maybe?

166
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,417
No. He'd
never give up anything

167
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,584
for nothin'.

168
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,617
And with his stretch
for double capital,

169
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:01,818
there's nothin'
to give him.

170
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:02,917
Army?

171
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,617
No. Halpern.

172
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,718
Maybe Rawling.

173
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:08,117
No. She didn't know
these kind of details.

174
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:09,950
Could have been
some One-Niner.

175
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:10,950
Could be Lem.

176
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:11,983
Stop that shit.

177
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,684
<i>I'm not saying
it was Lem.

178
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,784
I thought were just listing
the possibilities.

179
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,050
Well, don't.

180
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,517
We gotta stay focused
on gettin' Lem out of there.

181
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,384
This is the last night
he spends in county.

182
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:23,217
Well, we got
about 700 in cash,

183
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:25,084
3 frozen bank accounts.

184
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,217
That's it?

185
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:28,250
Lem's kin is
trailer park trash.

186
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,451
Couldn't spare the money

187
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:31,117
big powerball
this weekend.

188
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:34,084
So we gotta find 100
grand on the street.

189
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,384
Just lying around
with Kavanaugh watching us?

190
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,217
He's fixated on the
past, not the present.

191
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,718
You're wrong, we're gonna
end up keepin' Lem company.

192
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,584
We're not leavin' him
in there.

193
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,617
I promised him.

194
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,484
Construction
worker called it in.

195
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,417
Whoa! Talk about
a dump job.

196
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,784
OK, uh...

197
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,684
maybe the murder
occurs around here,

198
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:02,484
probably in the heat
of the moment.

199
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,484
Killer panics,

200
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:04,784
sees this as
the best possible way

201
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,050
to dispose
of a body,

202
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,950
hopes it gets carted away
before it's discovered.

203
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,050
What do you think?

204
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,983
Sounds good to me.

205
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,950
Your partner comin' back
anytime soon?

206
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,117
A couple of weeks.

207
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:18,484
Let's go.

208
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,017
Hey. The kids ready?

209
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:28,784
I might have to drop 'em
back off early.

210
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,850
My money's been frozen.

211
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:30,850
What?!

212
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,117
Checking, savings,
debit card.

213
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,517
I can't even buy
groceries.

214
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,451
Shit.

215
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,117
I'm sorry. L...
I just need some time.

216
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,751
Right now,
I can't be around you,

217
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:38,983
and neither
can the kids.

218
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,883
It's not me,
it's the lawyer.

219
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,617
I was the one who told you

220
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,751
to hire
the asshole, remember?

221
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,384
To protect you.

222
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,718
In order
to do that,

223
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:49,317
I have to create a pattern
of distancing myself from you.

224
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:51,784
Listen, it's
only temporary

225
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,050
until you sort
these legal matters out.

226
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,751
Hey, sweetheart. Hi.

227
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,017
You should go.

228
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,050
Please.

229
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,484
Mom's been crying
all morning.

230
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,484
Look. At least let me
give you some cash.

231
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,284
No, Vic. Vic, Vic, Vic,
I can't. I'm sorry.

232
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:06,917
Look, we're gonna
sort this all out.

233
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,617
We will. We'll figure
something else out.

234
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,050
OK?

235
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,150
If you need me,
I'll be at work.

236
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,250
Hey, captain?

237
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,684
Captain, this is
detective Hoffman.

238
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,017
He had an incident with
officer Hanlon last night.

239
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,017
You got an office somewhere
where I can bitch...

240
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,017
in private?

241
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:29,417
I like hangin'
with my cops.

242
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,751
We can talk here.

243
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:33,351
Tina failed to identify Hoffman
as an undercover officer.

244
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,150
First, she nearly
blew my head off,

245
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,751
then she allowed
the perp to escape.

246
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,451
He was clearly wearing
the color of the day.

247
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:39,684
Julien put a report

248
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,983
on your desk
this morning.

249
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,150
We'll take
all necessary steps

250
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:43,517
to ensure this doesn't
happen again.

251
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,084
You know,
I live with lowlifes,

252
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,351
smelling
like piss and shit

253
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,551
so guys like you don't have
to get your suits dirty.

254
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,784
I get enough guns
to my head

255
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,950
without barbie
adding to the action!

256
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,517
You expect me
to fire her?

257
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,084
Look, I've tried
with Tina, sir.

258
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,050
So has Julien.

259
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:57,684
She doesn't get it.
She never will,

260
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,718
until it's too late.

261
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,617
Look, she's a woman,
latina besides.

262
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:02,117
There's like 3 hoops
to jump through to can her.

263
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,417
OK, well, you know what?

264
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:05,617
She's gonna land herself or
someone else in a body bag.

265
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,617
Look, your girl
saw this color,

266
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,850
not the color
on my arm.

267
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,050
Right, you handle it
any way you like.

268
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,284
Look, being captain's
about tough choices.

269
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,917
I'll take care of it.

270
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:18,117
Hey, man.

271
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,417
Hey, Vic.

272
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,184
Any asshole
sightings today?

273
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,284
Not... not yet.

274
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,850
Guess even rats
have to sleep.

275
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,850
Isn't it
your day off?

276
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,017
Uh, my kids got sick.

277
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,384
Wanted to see if you
had anything juicy

278
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,050
I could sink
my teeth into.

279
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:34,050
Uh, there's, uh,
some new chicken pot pies

280
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,150
in the quick-mealer.

281
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,818
What about that loan shark
over on clinton?

282
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,517
Newman and his team
still set up on him?

283
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,617
Well, he cut a deal.
We got 2 to 6.

284
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,684
Uh, Vic,
there's a girl

285
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,150
who's been waitin' to meet
you or one of your guys.

286
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,284
All right,
give me a second.

287
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,584
What about that dealer
on the decks?

288
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,617
What's his name?
Felonious t.

289
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,684
Intel says he's hangin'
up his dealer hat,

290
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,651
been busy makin'
a documentary

291
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,718
of the streets
or some shit.

292
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,384
I can't wait
to see that, huh?

293
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,718
Yeah.

294
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,850
You lookin' for me?

295
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:02,883
You Mackey?

296
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,551
Antwon Mitchell needs
a sit-down with you.

297
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:06,983
That dickhead sent you?

298
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,917
Gave me a message.

299
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,384
Stand up and put your
hands against the wall.

300
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,050
Sh... go to hell.

301
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,818
Your incarcerated old man
wants to fly a kite?

302
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,017
Let 'er rip.

303
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:23,950
Told me to ask you

304
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,784
what you willin'
to put on the table.

305
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,883
For what?

306
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,451
To keep your boy
Curtis alive.

307
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:31,217
Stop playing games
or you're gonna get

308
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,617
matching
his and hers cells.

309
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,818
Your cop buddy's
headed for Lompoc.

310
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:37,317
Gonna be in the same cell
block with Antwon real soon.

311
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:38,317
Horseshit.

312
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,317
Ask the other cop,

313
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,384
the big brother.

314
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,784
He made the deal
with Antwon.

315
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,983
Kavanaugh?

316
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,551
Even a douche bag
like Kavanaugh

317
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,784
wouldn't jump into bed
with Antwon Mitchell.

318
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,718
God knows what kind
of diseases you'd get.

319
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:49,784
Ask him.

320
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,351
But do it quick.

321
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,818
Antwon
don't like waitin'.

322
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,584
Said, make sure you know

323
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:56,150
the offer of protection
ain't out there for long.

324
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:57,617
Well,
you can tell Antwon

325
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,883
I'll put a bullet in that
fat head of his myself

326
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,983
before I'll let him
kill another cop.

327
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,184
Tell him yourself.

328
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,617
Sounds like it's
just a matter of time

329
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,850
before you follow
your boy inside.

330
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:07,917
Get the hell
out of here.

331
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:08,818
Get your hands off!

332
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,617
You just givin' Antwon
more reason

333
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:11,983
to make it worse
on your boy.

334
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,484
Open it!

335
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:45,384
What do you got?

336
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,451
Nothing. Huh?

337
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:47,850
Your face is red.

338
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,017
You're back!

339
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,850
Well, what a pleasure
it is.

340
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,617
The doc said
another 2 weeks.

341
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,983
I can recuperate better
at my desk

342
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,551
than I can in my bed.

343
00:13:58,684 --> 00:13:59,617
What are we working?

344
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:00,684
Your knee?

345
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,451
Knee, ankle...

346
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,084
the whole shebang.

347
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,651
I fell pretty hard.

348
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:06,950
What do we got?

349
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,950
Uh... dump job.

350
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:11,250
Artemis Cooke, 43,
black male,

351
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,651
shot in the face,
stuffed in a dumpster.

352
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,084
And no next of kin?

353
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,150
Uh, mother.
I've got her upstairs.

354
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,617
Come on.
Pick up the pace.

355
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,883
Artemis was always
hard-working.

356
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,751
All sorts of jobs.

357
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,684
Where was he working now?

358
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,818
Ambulance company.

359
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:32,517
Drove body organs
to canada.

360
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,551
Company paid him
to paint his van up.

361
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,050
Very professional.

362
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,718
Uh... body organs?

363
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,718
You know, they take 'em
just before you die,

364
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,317
give 'em to people
who need 'em.

365
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:44,184
You mean donor organs?

366
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,517
I guess they have
a big need up north.

367
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,883
You can ask
his buddy, DeKnight.

368
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,484
He helps him
load up sometimes.

369
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,417
Your attempts to drive a
wedge between me and my guys

370
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,850
include
planning a murder?

371
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,517
Just looking
for my salad.

372
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,284
Somebody took it.

373
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,250
Why don't you just
find out who did it,

374
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,150
send him to prison to be
killed by Antwon Mitchell?

375
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,718
What's that make you,

376
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:15,451
servin' Lem up
to some cop killer?

377
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:17,950
Just like
you served Terry up?

378
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,684
Terry was a snake,
just like you.

379
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:24,050
Oh. So you did know that
Terry was workin' for justice.

380
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,517
You told me
about it yourself.

381
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,351
I'm done with cryin'
about him

382
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,850
gettin' killed
by two-time,

383
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,050
no matter how many weepy
relatives you bring by.

384
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,284
Had a conversation
with Antwon Mitchell.

385
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,983
Very illuminating,

386
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,784
especially as it relates
to shane Vendrell.

387
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,883
Is your neck
a little sore?

388
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,917
Excuse me?

389
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,217
From the noose...
tightening.

390
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,050
You send Lem to Lompoc,

391
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,850
it's you that's
the real murderer.

392
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,484
If the 4 of you
come completely clean,

393
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:59,517
I will let you
pick the prison.

394
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,150
No deal?

395
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:03,818
Well, I guess you're
not as concerned

396
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:05,718
for his safety
as you claim.

397
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:08,384
Anyway, there's
nothing on paper

398
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,850
as to where Lemansky
will end up.

399
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,284
But I'm sure I'll have
a recommendation

400
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,517
when the time comes.

401
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,983
That being said,

402
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,883
any correctional facility
is dangerous for a cop.

403
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,050
Best thing to do
is play by the rules,

404
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,584
and stay out of jail.

405
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,983
Streets can be
real dangerous, too.

406
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:34,050
Are we leveling
threats, detective?

407
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,217
Just making
random observations,

408
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,617
same as you.

409
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,184
Here's another one.

410
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,751
You're bluffin',

411
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,883
trying to split us up.

412
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,917
You're Mr. Straight
arrow, right?

413
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:50,084
Couldn't even cut your
poor, sick-in-the-head,

414
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,617
defenseless ex-wife a
break from the rules.

415
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:54,751
Could ya?

416
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:59,950
You don't have the stomach
to serve Lem up to Antwon.

417
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,883
I didn't used to.

418
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,484
Excuse me.

419
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,351
I worked for
Artemis at the plant.

420
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,684
That donor thing was
something he got on his own.

421
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,284
Don't know
much about it.

422
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,484
Seems weird.

423
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:20,384
Usually organs have to be
transplanted within hours.

424
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,351
Take a hell of a lot longer
to drive to canada.

425
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,351
Wouldn't you think
they'd fly 'em?

426
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,317
Maybe it's
low priority organs

427
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,883
like fingers or tongues.

428
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,351
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here.

429
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,284
Artemis was not running
fingers and tongues

430
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:38,551
back and forth
to vancouver, was he?

431
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:41,284
Whatever he was runnin'
got him shot in the face.

432
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,551
Shit. He's dead?

433
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:45,250
Found him in a dumpster
like common trash.

434
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,551
He was runnin'
some cush,

435
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:51,818
some sort of
super weed.

436
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,050
You get anywhere
near this shit,

437
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:54,917
the contact high would
knock you out for a week.

438
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,584
He made 8 grand
a run.

439
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:57,950
And that makes him
invaluable.

440
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,184
He have any beefs
with anyone?

441
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,417
Hell, no.

442
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:01,551
Everybody loved art.

443
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,084
He drove
that van into L.A.

444
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,351
Full of
the good tree,

445
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,517
it was like Santa Claus
was comin' to town.

446
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,751
We've got a guy upstairs,
needs a ride home.

447
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:15,084
OK. No problem.

448
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,117
Is she OK?

449
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,551
She says she's 100%.

450
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:18,684
I'm not gonna
argue the point.

451
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,818
When I get
my 6 weeks,

452
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,617
I'm gonna forget
this place even exists.

453
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,983
Yeah.

454
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,784
Hi there.

455
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,850
Oh, let me guess.

456
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,651
You're here to give me
shit about something.

457
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,250
What? No. I, uh...

458
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:42,751
these... these have been
floating around.

459
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,250
Thought you should know.

460
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:52,484
Jesus Christ!

461
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,250
The door was locked.
How'd they...

462
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,050
I barely glanced, just
enough to identify you.

463
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,784
Apparently, some asshole put
a camera in the locker room.

464
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,983
So every jerk-off
in the Barn's

465
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,351
been staring
at my tits?

466
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,784
Hey, you can't let
their high school mentality

467
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,017
get to you.

468
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,050
They'll get their kicks,
then move on to somebody else.

469
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,017
Shit.

470
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,250
I think
I'm gonna get fired.

471
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,883
I screwed up
at a call last night.

472
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,317
That's why
I'm stuck in here.

473
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,150
We all make mistakes.

474
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:25,850
Even I've been known to make
one or two, occasionally.

475
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,684
I wore those bra
and panties 2 days ago.

476
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,150
The red ones
the day before.

477
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,584
That's something
to go on.

478
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:34,850
I'm gonna find out
who took these.

479
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,084
I'm gonna see that
every picture's destroyed.

480
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,684
OK.

481
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:41,050
Thanks for being
such a gentleman.

482
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:43,850
We're not all neanderthals.

483
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,751
I should
probably keep those.

484
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,684
Stick 'em in a drawer
for evidence.

485
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,651
Oh...

486
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:08,917
we don't have
anything planned.

487
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:11,651
I'm resigning my position
as a reserve officer.

488
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,983
So now you no longer
can compel my cooperation

489
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,284
by threatening
to take my badge.

490
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,050
It's all yours.

491
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,684
That's not necessary.

492
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,351
You should also know
that as vice-chair

493
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,284
of the police committee,

494
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,351
I'm launching an investigation
into your investigation.

495
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,484
Really?

496
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,050
Yeah.

497
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,684
And why after tens
of thousands of dollars,

498
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,917
you have nothing more now
than you had 7 months ago.

499
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,284
I got Lemansky in custody.

500
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:39,818
Yeah, on 7-month-old
charges.

501
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:43,617
I got 65,000
unaccounted for dollars,

502
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:44,983
courtesy of Mackey's wife.

503
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,718
I got Mackey's assets
frozen,

504
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,384
along with every member
of the Strike Team.

505
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,850
And I've got
Antwon Mitchell talking.

506
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:56,584
You're getting Mackey
panicked,

507
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,651
hoping he'll
overplay his hand.

508
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,351
Something I hoped
you could help me with.

509
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,950
Nicely done, by the way,
stompin' in here like that.

510
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,050
That was good.

511
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,217
I liked that.

512
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:07,917
You're trying to get
Mackey running to me?

513
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:11,584
What? "the enemy of my enemy
is my friend?"

514
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,417
Well, forget it.
It won't happen.

515
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,384
He and his boys,

516
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,751
they were in business
with Antwon Mitchell.

517
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,117
These guys,
they're desperate.

518
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,150
They're gonna need
a friend in a high place,

519
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,883
like you.

520
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,818
All right.

521
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:32,284
I'll hold off
on my investigation...

522
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,684
for now.

523
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,950
Walk out angry.

524
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,050
Mackey's watching.

525
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:48,950
Vic, you got a sec?

526
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,217
Barely.

527
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:52,983
You ever hear
of a canadian super pot?

528
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,850
What, are you lookin'
to buy a dime bag?

529
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,084
Dump job this morning was
driving vans full of the stuff

530
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,517
down from vancouver.

531
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,250
You know any locals
plugged into that route?

532
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,351
Probably.

533
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,084
You guys have the van?

534
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,084
Still lookin'.
Might be a robbery.

535
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,617
I'm just lookin'
for a few names.

536
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,451
Well, seein'
as you and Claudette's

537
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,451
wonder twin powers
aren't fully activated yet,

538
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:16,718
I'll do you a favor,

539
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:17,850
pick up the slack
on this one.

540
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:18,983
OK, thanks.

541
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,150
All right, let me
shake the One-Niner tree,

542
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:24,784
see if any 5-pointed
leaves fall out.

543
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:32,591
That prick cut a deal
with Antwon Mitchell.

544
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:34,624
Wants to send Lem to Lompoc
if he gets a conviction.

545
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,023
What?

546
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,491
That's why Kavanaugh knows
so much about you and Antwon.

547
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,391
He's hopin' the threat
will get Lem talkin'.

548
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:41,691
That's not exactly playin'
by the rules.

549
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:42,923
Means we don't either.

550
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,257
If he puts Lem in
with Mitchell...

551
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,557
I know.

552
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,157
Yo, cuz.

553
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:52,890
Shit. Let's go.

554
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:55,090
This 5-o is hitler.

555
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:56,791
You miss us?

556
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,858
Not especially.

557
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:02,957
Ha. Antwon's cuttin'
deals over in Lompoc,

558
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,524
shorin' up
the power structure.

559
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,491
If it don't
involve the street,

560
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:06,824
it don't involve me.

561
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,791
Or maybe you're part of
Antwon's restructuring.

562
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:09,923
Nice try.

563
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,157
But me and
the big guy's tight.

564
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,157
You really expect
me to believe

565
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,424
he's lettin' you
call the shots out here?

566
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:15,424
He can't do it.

567
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,923
Somebody's
got to, right?

568
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,124
Antwon know you're recruiting
out of middle school?

569
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,457
Most of the old guard hung
it up after Antwon left.

570
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:23,890
This is the new regime.

571
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:27,190
Any of your students runnin'
chronic down from canada?

572
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:29,424
Let's take a ride.

573
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,124
What, shootin' me
wasn't enough?

574
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,691
Tell me what
we want to know,

575
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,858
or we're gonna be back in
your life again full-time.

576
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:37,890
All right.

577
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:40,457
Dude with a fancy
French name,

578
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:42,224
he runs most of the bud
to the crews.

579
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,057
Best shit in years.

580
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,624
What's frenchy's name?

581
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,990
Dijon.

582
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,724
Get back to class.

583
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:56,557
Porkchop's stuck
on street duty.

584
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,491
He knows where
the pot comes from,

585
00:23:58,557 --> 00:24:00,791
but Antwon's cut him out
of the inner circle,

586
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,157
the decision making.

587
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,290
You thinking
regime change?

588
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:05,124
Well, it's somethin'
to keep an eye on.

589
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:12,557
Dude, sweet pictures.

590
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,457
What pictures?

591
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,457
It's OK. I'm cool.

592
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:19,491
You think Tina's panties
are regulation?

593
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,923
Just wish we could have
seen her badge.

594
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:26,324
Just between you and me,

595
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:27,791
how'd you
pull it off?

596
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:28,758
Shit, I'm not a perv.

597
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:30,890
I found 'em
on Billings' desk.

598
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,124
Anyone make copies?

599
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,591
What do you think?

600
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,324
Anyway, thanks
for sharin' 'em with me.

601
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,957
The way you stare
at that chick,

602
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:42,824
would've been
cruel not to.

603
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:51,657
You had the irs
freeze my money.

604
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,957
Sorry.
That is unfortunate.

605
00:24:54,023 --> 00:24:55,190
Sorry?

606
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:56,290
You did it.

607
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,657
Yes.

608
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,457
I did everything
that you asked.

609
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:00,791
I told you
about the money.

610
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:03,290
Now I can't
feed my children.

611
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:05,557
You told me
about $65,000.

612
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,457
Now I'm hearing
there may be more.

613
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:08,557
A lot more.

614
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:09,824
Please.

615
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,290
You think I would default
on my children's tuition

616
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:14,324
if there was more?

617
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,391
I hate that this
is hurting you,

618
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:18,691
but I'm building
walls around Vic...

619
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:20,424
to stop him
from slitherin' away,

620
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:23,157
and you, you're
one of those walls.

621
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,858
I'm not a wall.
I'm a mother.

622
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,357
And... and I'm disconnecting
Vic from my life

623
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,624
and from the kids,

624
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:30,691
so leave us out of this.

625
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,591
Are you aware
that I arrested

626
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,858
Curtis Lemansky
2 days ago?

627
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:37,957
He's in county, waiting
for Vic and his friends

628
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:38,990
to bail him out.

629
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:40,557
If they don't have
the money,

630
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,457
they can't do it.

631
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:45,290
And every minute
that Lem spends inside,

632
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:48,457
I'm just a minute closer
to gettin' at the truth.

633
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:50,691
That has nothing
to do with me!

634
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,724
My advice is
to go to Vic yourself,

635
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,391
ask him to confess.

636
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:05,724
You want your life back,
ask him, not me.

637
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,557
What did I do
to deserve this?

638
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:13,691
You married
the wrong man, Corrine.

639
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:17,990
Now, I'm not doing this because
that cowboy called me out.

640
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:19,057
Of course not.

641
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,591
I got 2
of my finest officers

642
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,157
telling me
that Tina's gotta go.

643
00:26:22,224 --> 00:26:23,424
Look, every day
that she's out there,

644
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,824
she's putting people
at risk.

645
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,023
She's just
so damn popular.

646
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,524
I can call
her pba rep.

647
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,990
OK. Get him
down here asap.

648
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,758
Julien, I want a full
report of her conduct.

649
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,023
You're goin'
on the record.

650
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,591
Yes, sir.

651
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:36,923
Thanks, guys.

652
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,257
What's up?

653
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:43,657
Shit.

654
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:45,357
Where'd you get these?

655
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:46,923
They're circulating.

656
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,257
<i>They were on my desk.
Is nothing sacred?

657
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,090
You're asking me?

658
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:53,124
Come here.

659
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,990
I put a nanny cam
in the locker room.

660
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:01,023
People have been ripping off
the vending machines.

661
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,691
I was just trying to catch
whoever was doin' it.

662
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,657
You could've put
a camera in the hallway,

663
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,391
over the machines.

664
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,624
Well, not where
it could be hidden.

665
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:08,824
And I think whoever's
stealing this grub

666
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,858
is stashin' it
in their locker.

667
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,824
I pulled these photos
and some others

668
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,724
so that they wouldn't
get into the wrong hands.

669
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,157
You know
this only happened,

670
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:17,858
because I don't have a
goddamn private office anymore.

671
00:27:17,923 --> 00:27:20,990
Do you have any idea what kind
of shitstorm you're lookin' at

672
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,990
when she finds out you're
behind these photos?

673
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:25,023
She saw them?

674
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,157
<i>You told her?

675
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:27,724
She had a right to know.

676
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,424
I just promised
to wash her out.

677
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:37,858
You think he's gonna
take care of that baby?

678
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,357
He's not.

679
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:41,324
I have no idea what...

680
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,758
you think he's
gonna be a father?

681
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,124
Who the father is
none of your business.

682
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,591
Really? It's
none of my business

683
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:49,424
that my kids are gonna get
a new brother or sister?

684
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:52,557
Uh, I'm at work
right now, OK?

685
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:53,758
This isn't the place.

686
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,457
Right. Come find me
later.

687
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:57,257
You managed to find
someone to screw at work.

688
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:58,691
Why not talk
about it here, too?

689
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:00,324
I'm gonna walk away
from you right now

690
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,691
because you're obviously
not being rational.

691
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:02,858
Really? Were you
being rational

692
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:05,257
when you slept
with a married man?

693
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:06,758
He made that vow,
not me.

694
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:07,791
Which makes him a cheat,

695
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:08,923
but that makes you
a whore

696
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,557
and the baby you're
both having a bastard.

697
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,491
You Dijon?

698
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,624
I didn't do nothin',
if that's what you mean.

699
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:27,957
Nice threads.

700
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:30,557
We hear you got the best
b.c. Bud in Farmington.

701
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,424
Hey.

702
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,391
What?

703
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:35,923
White guys can't get
the good stuff?

704
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,057
Or you only sell
to bangers?

705
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,391
That's discrimination.

706
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,758
I got nothin'.
Look around.

707
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:42,224
OK.

708
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,858
You took
a hit today.

709
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,124
We're offering you
a chance to get it back.

710
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,224
Whoa.
Run that by me again.

711
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,858
Your canadian organ
express got taken down.

712
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,124
Your driver got killed,
supply ripped off.

713
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,491
We can get it
back for you

714
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:58,591
for a finder's fee.

715
00:28:58,657 --> 00:28:59,591
Why?

716
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:00,657
Don't worry
about that.

717
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:04,457
Hundred grand,
no questions asked.

718
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,324
Oh, yeah. That's right.

719
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:10,257
Only a matter of time before
the detectives on the murder case

720
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:12,491
follow the phone records
back to you

721
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:14,591
and your monthly
pot runs.

722
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:17,591
But... you work with us,

723
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,791
we see to it that the
trail ends with Artemis.

724
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,124
And I keep the rest.

725
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,491
It's a hell of a lot better
than nothin', isn't it?

726
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,090
All right.

727
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:31,023
The only thing is it wasn't
my shipment that got jacked.

728
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,457
It was my cash.

729
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,391
<i>Artemis was on his way
up to canada.

730
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:35,923
How much did you lose?

731
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,457
Quarter million.

732
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,424
You get it back,

733
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:40,858
I'll cut you
the hundred gs in.

734
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,724
Uh-uh. We don't
trust you.

735
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,324
We'll take our fee up
front as a down-payment.

736
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:45,391
Are you crazy?

737
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:46,691
I'm out of pocket
on this.

738
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:47,990
Everything I got
was invested

739
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:49,224
in that run.

740
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,324
Jesus Christ, man.
This is just a waste of time.

741
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:52,557
No, it's not.

742
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,324
Deal's a deal.

743
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,923
Put together a list
of every customer,

744
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,624
anybody who would've known
about Artemis's run.

745
00:29:58,691 --> 00:29:59,791
Dirty yourself up.

746
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:01,557
We need you to play
the ignorant friend

747
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:03,157
for some colleagues
of ours.

748
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,391
Yo Asher.
Upstairs.

749
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,824
America's
favorite couple

750
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,890
wants to have
a little chat with him.

751
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:10,957
Sure thing.

752
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:13,057
I'm tellin' you,
my intel's good.

753
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,591
Artemis was flyin' solo.

754
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:16,557
His buddy's got some details
about his criminal dealings.

755
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:18,557
Well, let's see what's up
between these two.

756
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,457
I'll be right up.

757
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:24,591
Lem?

758
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,591
I finally got
some phone time in,

759
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,324
so, uh,
what's goin' on?

760
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:28,524
Am I getting
out of here today?

761
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,257
I'm workin' on it.
Hang on.

762
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,090
Hello?

763
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,257
Hey, it's Vic. I'm gonna
put you on with Lem.

764
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:38,524
Hold on.

765
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:41,023
All right.
You guys both on?

766
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,457
Yeah.
I'm here.

767
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,491
All right, Lem, you're
talkin' to your lawyer,

768
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:46,824
Becca Doyle, in case there
are other ears on this call.

769
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,657
Whoa. You can't use me as
cover for anything illegal.

770
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:52,023
What I'm about to tell Lem,
you need to hear, too.

771
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,124
What is it?

772
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,624
All right,
the good news first.

773
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:55,957
We got a lead
on some bail money for you.

774
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:56,858
How?

775
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,624
Callin' in
a few favors.

776
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,724
All right. Look, man,
I know you got my back.

777
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,023
What's the bad news?

778
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,758
Kavanaugh has been
sittin' down

779
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:05,957
with Antwon Mitchell.

780
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:08,357
He made some sort of deal
to send you to Lompoc

781
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:10,090
in case
there's a conviction.

782
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,257
No goddamn way!

783
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:12,990
That's insane.
He doesn't make those calls.

784
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,224
Look, it's never
gonna get that far.

785
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,657
We're gonna
get you out of there,

786
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,457
then we're gonna get you
out from under this prick.

787
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:18,990
Do you know this?

788
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,090
Kavanaugh
said those words?

789
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:22,624
He'd never admit it,
but it's real.

790
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:25,124
All it means is Kavanaugh
knows he's got Jack shit on us,

791
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,657
and he's gettin'
desperate.

792
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:28,124
All right, I hear you.

793
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,057
I hear you.

794
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:30,990
Vic, you comin' or not?

795
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:31,990
Yeah, hang on.

796
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:32,990
All right,
listen, I gotta go.

797
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,157
You stay safe,
all right?

798
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,990
OK, yeah.

799
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:45,791
Dutchman.

800
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,591
Uh, I'm in
the middle of something.

801
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:48,990
I got it, Dutchboy.

802
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,557
You know I was on the up
and up taking those photos.

803
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:02,990
Tell the chief.

804
00:32:03,057 --> 00:32:04,591
If Tina makes a stink
about this,

805
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,524
maybe she'll get
a huge pile of cash,

806
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,591
but her career
will be kaput.

807
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:09,123
You know how
these things wash out.

808
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,791
Well, I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

809
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,157
I have a plan.

810
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,924
This thing goes away,
everybody wins, including you.

811
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,190
No, thanks.

812
00:32:18,257 --> 00:32:21,457
You can either be
a hero in Tina's eyes,

813
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,023
or you can watch her and
her red bra and panties

814
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,190
march out
that Barn door forever.

815
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,724
He's full of it.

816
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,691
He probably is a member
of the weed ring,

817
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:38,924
but why kill
your own driver?

818
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,491
I really don't think
he was involved.

819
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:41,691
If this guy is funding
Artemis's run,

820
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,157
he'll never cooperate.

821
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:44,290
He'll want to recover
the money himself.

822
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:46,524
<i>Or Artemis is workin' solo.

823
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,990
Your intel hasn't been
what it used to be.

824
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:52,791
Fine. I'll see what else
I can squeeze out of him.

825
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:56,390
What'd I miss?

826
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,757
What the hell did you
bring him into this for?

827
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:00,123
I thought we could use
a little muscle.

828
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,290
Brains over brawn,
Dutch.

829
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:03,224
How many times
I gotta tell you that?

830
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,624
Move it, asshole.

831
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:07,791
Don't need to keep
sellin' it so hard, do you?

832
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:09,624
Your list of customers
got us nowhere.

833
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,190
The only thing these bangers
want more that ass and cash

834
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,990
is some of your
top grade canadian bud.

835
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,724
They know a good thing
when they smoke it.

836
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,090
Yeah, well, if I
don't find the guy

837
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:18,057
who knocked
over your van,

838
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,290
you'll be hangin' up
a closed sign.

839
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,491
Who else besides

840
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:23,357
your customers knows
about the runs?

841
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:25,891
Just my wife
and my dumbass stepson.

842
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,157
How old is he?

843
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:28,324
He's 20.

844
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,424
What's his name?

845
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,591
Jaden reid.

846
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:32,123
He drove the route for me
a couple of times

847
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,157
till I noticed the load
kept comin' back light.

848
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:36,157
Punk don't know
the meaning of high enough.

849
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:37,390
Where is he now?

850
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:39,257
Who knows?
He gonna send his mama

851
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:40,357
to an early grave.

852
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:42,090
Does your wife know
where Jaden is?

853
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:44,457
She got no clue.

854
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,524
You never know.

855
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,924
Blood is thicker
than bong water.

856
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,524
Kid's name
is Jaden reid.

857
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,924
Think he's
our shooter.

858
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,524
Let's pay Jaden
a little visit.

859
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:54,691
First,
we gotta find him.

860
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:55,691
Kid's a Burnout.

861
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:56,791
Now he's got
enough cash

862
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:57,891
to keep him stoned
for a long time.

863
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,824
And enough cash
for us to spring Lem.

864
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:01,057
So where do we start?

865
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,524
Unis found
the abandoned van

866
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,190
in a parking lot
in silverlake.

867
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:05,691
Lots of blood, no cash.

868
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:06,858
If I had
a bagful of money,

869
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,224
I wouldn't want to walk
too far with it.

870
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,424
Check out
the local weed dealers.

871
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:11,791
He had the cash,
he'd want to score.

872
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:12,757
What about Claudette?

873
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:14,257
We're still a step
ahead of her,

874
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:15,858
and she seems
2 steps slow.

875
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:19,290
Let's find this kid before she
figures out anything else, OK?

876
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,724
Yeah. Got it.

877
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,791
Got a hit on the
fingerprints in the van.

878
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,390
Belongs to
a Jaden reid.

879
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:28,424
Address?

880
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:30,924
Last known, his mother's,
Tasha Reynolds.

881
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,990
What's up?

882
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:35,157
Got a suspect...
Jaden reid.

883
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:38,491
According to the file, he's
your friend Dijon's stepson.

884
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:39,424
Nice work.

885
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:40,691
We're gonna check out
an address.

886
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:43,457
Why don't we let
some unis pick him up?

887
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:44,958
Well,
they can join us.

888
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:46,257
Dutch is right.

889
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:48,524
Why don't you let me and my
guys handle sweep-up duty?

890
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,791
You can join us, too,
if you want.

891
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,857
Mrs. Reynolds, when
was the last time you saw Jaden?

892
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,090
Couple months.

893
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:58,491
Look, he's a good kid.

894
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:01,291
There's no way he'd be involved
in anything like this.

895
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:05,224
Dutch, uh, why don't you have
Dijon show you where Jaden stays

896
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,658
when he's here?

897
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:08,890
Sure.

898
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:11,024
Um... lead the way.

899
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:19,324
Mrs. Reynolds, I know you're
worried about your son,

900
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:20,757
but he could be
in trouble,

901
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:21,790
and not just from us.

902
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:22,924
He wouldn't kill no one.

903
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,990
Then help us find him

904
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:25,658
so we can clear
this mess up

905
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,723
and keep Jaden
from being hurt.

906
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,257
He has a girl.

907
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:31,524
I don't like her.

908
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:33,124
She lives by that
old theater on sunset.

909
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,823
Got an address?

910
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:38,224
2409 Cole street
by the vista theater.

911
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,558
Jaden's there.

912
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:41,790
Uh, 2409 Cole.
Yeah, we got it.

913
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:42,890
How far out are you?

914
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:45,124
Uh, traffic,
15 minutes maybe. Why?

915
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:47,823
Because Dutch and Claudette
are on the way over there, too.

916
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,890
Just get inside the house,
find the money,

917
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,624
and get out of there, fast!

918
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,757
Well,
how far are they?

919
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,257
Same as you.

920
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,291
Jesus. What
if they catch us?

921
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:58,291
I mean, we've got
the day off, remember?

922
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:01,357
Just get there!
I'll make it work.

923
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:04,790
OK, park it
and let's go.

924
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:05,790
Yeah? Where?

925
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:06,924
Claudette
knows this truck.

926
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,424
Well,
check around back.

927
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,790
Come on, man! Move!

928
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,357
It's locked, man.

929
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:27,257
I'll get the front.

930
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:29,291
2 minutes. That's it,
then we're gone.

931
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:30,757
No arguments here.

932
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,857
God damn it.

933
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:48,491
Let's forget it.
We're outta here.

934
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,823
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

935
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,558
Oh, shit!

936
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:03,224
Shit. Is he dead?

937
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,524
No. No, it's just
a damn good buzz.

938
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:08,924
Oh, you gotta be
kiddin' me.

939
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,291
He's sleepin'
on the money.

940
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:16,357
Oh, shit!

941
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,024
Grab it!

942
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,191
Yeah, we're good.
We're good.

943
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:24,890
Come on. Let's go.

944
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:28,391
Hey!

945
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:30,524
You take him,
I'll clear the back!

946
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,457
Clear.

947
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,324
Looks like
we got our shooter.

948
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,890
Come on, buddy, wake up.
Party's over.

949
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:48,224
Somebody took my money.

950
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:50,257
You won't need
any where you're goin'.

951
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:51,823
He cut me out.

952
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,690
He didn't have to do that.

953
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:56,224
I didn't want
to hurt nobody.

954
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,524
Hey, you shot him
in the face 3 times.

955
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,391
We should probably
wait until he sobers up.

956
00:38:00,457 --> 00:38:01,924
We can't use anything
he says right now anyway,

957
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,057
his state.

958
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,124
All that money was his.

959
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:06,957
All that bud, his.

960
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:08,723
I want to know why you
ain't goin' after him.

961
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,124
Artemis?

962
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:12,690
You killed him and took the
money belonging to Artemis?

963
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,124
Artemis?

964
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,257
I was drivin'
for Dijon...

965
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:17,624
it was his shit.

966
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,224
He fired me.

967
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,157
I'm his stepson. What
kind of shit is that?

968
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:27,624
You really dialed a wrong
number on your street intel.

969
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,757
Still don't have any
evidence against Dijon,

970
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,957
and his hazy memory
ain't gonna get you far, either.

971
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:33,790
Jaden says somebody broke
into his girlfriend's apartment

972
00:38:33,857 --> 00:38:35,723
and took the money.
What's our next move?

973
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,790
It's my day off.

974
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:37,890
I helped you
catch the killer.

975
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:39,558
Finding the money's
your problem.

976
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,857
Hey, Smitty.

977
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,857
Haven't seen
you guys in a while.

978
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,491
It's been nice.

979
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,057
Yeah, well, it's
about to get a lot nicer.

980
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:51,624
How'd you like
to make 100 grand?

981
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:54,957
Pass.

982
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:56,191
Hear us out.

983
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:57,757
The shit I've done for
you guys for peanuts,

984
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:58,990
I don't
even want to know

985
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:00,291
what 100 grand
looks like.

986
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:01,990
Looks a lot easier
than you think.

987
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:03,591
Lem's in jail.

988
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:06,157
You're gonna put up
100 gs for his bail.

989
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,424
You expect me
to just give you 1oo k?

990
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,757
We're gonna
give it to you.

991
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,324
And when Lem shows up
in court,

992
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,491
you're gonna keep it.

993
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:17,324
And the catch is?

994
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:20,357
IAD is gonna
ask you about it.

995
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,558
They might want to
look at your books.

996
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,924
You business is
profitable lately, right?

997
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,424
Very.

998
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,591
How'd those leads we gave
you last year work out?

999
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:33,890
Great. Could always
use a few more.

1000
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,658
How many jobs does it take
you to clear 100 grand?

1001
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:44,957
Why you guys always comin'
to me with this shit?

1002
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:50,057
Because you're
the last honest guy we know.

1003
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,007
Hey.
Hey.

1004
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:54,341
We found someone
willing to post bail.

1005
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,774
An old friend
came through.

1006
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,274
Kavanaugh will be looking
into that old friend.

1007
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:01,873
Nothing to find.
He likes Lem.

1008
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,774
I'll see if I can
wake up a clerk,

1009
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,174
get things
fast-tracked.

1010
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,407
Thanks.

1011
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,940
What? What is it?

1012
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm stuck here.

1013
00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:21,541
I don't want to convince
you all to turn on Lem,

1014
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:23,840
and I don't want to
convince him to turn on you,

1015
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:25,107
but that's what
a good lawyer

1016
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,641
would be advising all
of you to do right now.

1017
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,708
l...
I don't want to see

1018
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,541
any of you
going to prison.

1019
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:34,341
Well,
that's nice to know.

1020
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:40,774
Right now, I think
I'd make a better friend

1021
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,074
than a lawyer.

1022
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:46,240
Lem...

1023
00:40:46,307 --> 00:40:48,207
Lem needs you right now.

1024
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:52,074
And we sure can't afford
to hire someone else.

1025
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,507
If you have to make a
choice, you go with Lem.

1026
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,474
And advise him
to hurt you? L...

1027
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,873
if you can make a deal that has
me switching places with Lem,

1028
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,441
you do it.

1029
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,040
Just me.

1030
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:09,107
None of my guys.

1031
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:13,240
I want to see you
get your second chance.

1032
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,607
Already have.

1033
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,374
On behalf
of the entire department,

1034
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,674
I'd like to apologize
for the wrong done to you.

1035
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:29,708
The captain learned
about the photos

1036
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:31,774
earlier this afternoon
and came to me.

1037
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,307
Did you find
the dickwad, or what?

1038
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,541
Unfortunately, no.

1039
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,341
The identity of
the culprit's a mystery.

1040
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:39,474
Great. So where
does that leave me?

1041
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,307
During the course
of our conversation,

1042
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,574
I mentioned
to the captain

1043
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:44,840
thay I've seen you have
some really great instincts,

1044
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:46,708
and he agreed that you have
a lot of potential.

1045
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,240
And potential
needs to be nourished.

1046
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:50,240
I've asked
special permission

1047
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,574
to take you
under my wing,

1048
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:52,907
show you
the detective ropes

1049
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:54,474
in your spare time.

1050
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,107
Unless these photos
have you too upset

1051
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:57,674
to focus
on career advancement.

1052
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,507
I see.

1053
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:03,307
So I keep my mouth shut,
I climb the ladder.

1054
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:08,240
Dutch is just offering
an opportunity.

1055
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:15,074
Did you get rid
of the rest of them?

1056
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,907
Every last one.

1057
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,741
I look forward to working
with you, detective.

1058
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,240
Thanks, captain.

1059
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:38,808
Prisoner all clear for release.

1060
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:42,774
Hey, hey!

1061
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,240
Told you
we'd get you out!

1062
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:45,274
Hey!

1063
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:47,274
It looks like
your hymen's still intact.

1064
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:48,840
Gonna have to get your own
pussy tonight, though, buddy.

1065
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:49,840
Ahh!

1066
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:50,840
Where's Vic at, man?

1067
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:51,907
He's, uh...

1068
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:53,507
he had someplace
he's gotta be.

1069
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,840
He's gonna
meet us later.

1070
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,107
Come on, man, let's go
grab a beer. Come on.

1071
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,708
- Smitty's buyin'.
- I am?

1072
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:00,374
Yes.
One round.

1073
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,607
What are you doing here?

1074
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:14,307
Kavanaugh,
he's out of control.

1075
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:16,873
He's unbalanced.

1076
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,007
He's breaking
the rules.

1077
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,641
He's threatening
Lem's life.

1078
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:23,708
Hey, IAD is your problem,
not mine.

1079
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:28,574
The look on your face walkin' out
of his office today says otherwise.

1080
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,708
He's got screws
in you, too, yeah?

1081
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:42,607
I, uh...

1082
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:46,907
I'm an element
in Kavanaugh's investigation.

1083
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:50,074
Price I pay for having
been your boss.

1084
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:53,940
But I'm hardly in the same
category as you and your guys.

1085
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,973
Really?

1086
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,174
You think if Kavanaugh's
successful,

1087
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,574
I'm gonna go down
quietly?

1088
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,774
Ha ha...

1089
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:10,307
I will scorch the earth
covering this whole department,

1090
00:44:10,374 --> 00:44:11,940
starting with you.

1091
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,674
I can tie you
to every bullshit thing

1092
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,774
Kavanaugh's accusing
me of, and then some.

1093
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Your stink will smell up every
voting booth in this city.

1094
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:30,240
On the other hand...

1095
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,474
you want that little nameplate on
your desk to read "mayor" someday?

1096
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,207
We work together.

1097
00:44:38,973 --> 00:44:42,107
Make sure that
you, me, my team,

1098
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:44,341
are the last men
standing

1099
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:46,674
long enough to go
our separate ways.

1100
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,840
What's your plan?

1101
