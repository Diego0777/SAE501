<i>Uh, that'll be 17% across the board.</i>

00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,480

89
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,576

Listen, starting next week, we're gonna
be going to single-unit patrols.

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,937

more than six months on the street...

97
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,343
- you're gonna be flying solo.
<i>- [Woman] What?</i>

<i>- It's a rookie mistake.</i>
- She's way too young for you.

167
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,917
I am mature and distinguished.
A lot of young women appreciate that.

168
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,490
You really ought to
cut back on the porn.

169
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,058
Please move back.

170
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,027
This shooting related to our stabbing,
or was this just for extra credit?

171
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,189
Either way, he's not graduating.

172
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,370
<i>- You okay?</i>
- I'm fine.

173
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,804
- I can grab those paramedics.
- I said I'm fine.

174
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,536
Let's give that to Vic,
and we'll stick with the stabbing.

175
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,911
Okay.

176
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,315
<i>- [Danny] The parents</i>
<i>want to take their kids home.</i>
- Nothing would make me happier.

177
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,388
Unfortunately, all the little shitheads
are suspects and witnesses.

178
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,788
- They want to talk to a captain.
- And I want more hair.

179
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,918
All right. You handle it.
It's good mothering practice. Vic.

180
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,726
- What do ya got?
- Armed and dangerous. Taser.

181
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,460
He was in the cafeteria
when the kid got shot.

182
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,502
All right. Listen.

183
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:16,064
Anything you can do to quiet this shitstorm,
get it off my plate, it's got my blessing.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

You a member of the Varsity
Taser Club, Weston?

Eleven of your classmates are in
Mission Cross- some critical, one dead.

00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,537
A knife and gun did the damage.

190
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780
Shit!

00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,433
All right, all right, all right.

197
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:21,165
There's a kill clock. Some Mexican's
gotta kill a couple brothers by tonight.

198
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,765
- Why?
- I don't know the whys, man, just the what.

199
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,836
- Who's the Mexican?
<i>- If I knew that, I wouldn't be carrying the zapper.</i>

200
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,912
That's for being a wiseass.

201
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,220
<i>Claudette, I might know</i>
<i>what your stabbing's about.</i>

202
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,353
- Guy in 1 thinks there's a kill clock ticking.
- Kill clock?

203
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,432
Gangs use it to set a time limit
on an initiation or a retaliation.

204
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,559
- He heard some Mexican's
gonna try to kill two blacks.
<i>- Just randomly?</i>

205
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,796
- You think it's legit?
<i>- That doesn't matter.</i>

206
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,032
If it stirs up enough fear, it's real.

207
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,269
- Would explain why our witness isn't talking.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

208
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,278
Keep at her.
I'm gonna tap into a C.I. Of mine.

209
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,110
That girl that was stabbed, Caroline Tylin?
She just died in surgery.

210
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,684
<i>Sorry.</i>

211
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,746
Hey, how you feeling?

212
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,824
<i>- How do I look?</i>
- Great.

213
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,725
Yeah? Pretty much how I feel.

214
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,797
Thanks for asking.

215
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,828
- Bad news, Zellie.
<i>- [Dutch] We know about</i>
<i>the black-brown retaliation.</i>

216
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,202
And right now, you're the closest brown
to our dead black girl.

217
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,207
She died?

218
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,075
<i>[Claudette] Which means you were</i>
<i>involved or you know who did it.</i>

219
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,980
<i>[Dutch] By not talking,</i>
<i>you're interfering with an investigation.</i>

220
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,074
That's a crime.

221
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,680
All right.
I saw him running out as I came in.

222
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,887
<i>And then I saw her by the sink,</i>
<i>all bloody and shit.</i>

Lorenzo Lavedra.

225
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,792
All right. This kill clock's
gonna fall gangland.

226
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,871
Vic and I should follow up on this.

227
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,099
- Okay, we'll take over the cafeteria shooting.
- Yeah.

228
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,335
I'll tell the captain we traded cases.

229
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,574
Why confuse him?

230
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,884
That it?

231
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,955
<i>[Man]</i>

<i>Somethin'else?</i>

233
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,167
Uh, no.

You're here early. Come in, please.
Come on. Come on. Have a seat.

237
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,980
I've only got a few minutes.

238
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,547
How can I help you,
Lieutenant Kavanaugh?

239
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,151
You know that I.A.D. Has been looking
into Detective Mackey...

240
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,494
and the Strike Team he ran
while under your command.

241
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,558
Captain Rawlings began that investigation.
I was aware of it.

242
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,637
That investigation still ongoing?

243
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,709
Yes, it is.

244
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,738
- Well, what have you got?
- What have I got?

245
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:20,148
<i>We've got Lemansky.</i>

246
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,982
He lifted a brick of tar
off the El Salvadorans.

247
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,319
We've been waiting for it
to spin into something... more.

248
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,552
Which means you've got nothing
on Mackey.

249
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,629
<i>His day job's keeping him busy.</i>

250
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,995
He hasn't had the freedom
to navigate much game.

251
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,627
But we got a C.I. Next to him,
and when he jumps dirty, we'll know.

252
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,833
Until then I was hoping that you
might be able to help us out.

253
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,842
[Chuckles]

254
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,313
You've got my letter,
and I've got nothing else to add.

255
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,975
Mackey's your problem now, not mine.

256
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,053
<i>No, perception is your problem.</i>

257
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,954
I'm going after Mackey and his team.

258
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,652
Now, you can get on board
and be proactive...

259
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,728
or you can sit back and spectate...

260
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,390
<i>just like you did when he</i>
<i>was running dirty on your watchl</i>

261
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,297
Hey, I did everything I could
to rein him in.

262
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,530
Don't sit there
and threaten me with bad P.R.!

263
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,772
You're right. I was out of line.
Hey, I'm sorry.

264
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,505
Please, come on. Sit down.

265
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:26,209
<i>Mackey's jacket</i>
<i>is like a 20-page cautionary tale.</i>

<i>This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.</i>

267
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,252
<i>I just want to get him off the street</i>
<i>before he does any more damage. That's it.</i>

268
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,827
P.D. Is looking for a poster boy
for corruption.

269
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,888
They crucify one of their own,
the public will trust the rest.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,334
And next time that ballot measure,
it passes.

271
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,376
When you were captain,
Mackey and Vendrell...

272
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,605
<i>were interrogated</i>
<i>about the shooting death...</i>

273
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,012
of a Detective Terry Crowley.

274
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,076
From the notes, it's very clear
that you thought Mackey was involved.

275
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,523
And your comrades ruled it line of duty.

276
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,618
<i>I was hoping you might be able</i>
<i>to shed some light on the specifics.</i>

277
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,392
<i>The rumor has it that the feds</i>
<i>might've been involved with that.</i>

278
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
<i>Is that true?</i>

279
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,544
What's my end?

280
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,181
Your suspicion. It's your letter.

281
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,549
We say you got the ball rolling.

282
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:40,614
You followed it through
even after you left the job.

283
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,924
<i>Now, that's the man</i>
<i>that I would want to be mayor.</i>

284
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,464
I would vote for that man.

285
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:55,967
Vic and his guys are tight.
And Lemansky, he's a soldier.

286
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,043
<i>He'll follow Mackey anywhere.</i>

287
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,475
<i>But he's also the one with a conscience.</i>

288
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,345
<i>So, you're gonna need something to drive</i>
<i>a wedge between him and Mackey.</i>

289
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,682
I need that wedge, Councilman.
I need that wedge.

290
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,081
If I give you this, I'm done.

291
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,490
I don't want that guy's stink
on me anymore.

292
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,494
My word.

293
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,868
Terry was working with Justice
to bring down Mackey...

294
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,772
<i>and I think Vic had him killed.</i>

295
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,215
What kind of proof have you got?

296
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,375
Detective Crowley's deal with Justice.

297
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,347
That's good.

298
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,755
That's good.

299
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,828
That's good.

300
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,627
- Can I get the intel by the end of the day?
- Sure.

301
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,870
- No, thank you.
- Come on. This is a fresh pack.

302
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,474
It's Juicy Fruit.

It's Juicy Fruit.

304
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,044
I said no. Thank you.

305
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,980
You hold this out long enough...

306
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,385
some people feel compelled
to take the gum.

307
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,151
It's a sign they'll crack under pressure.

308
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,659
I know.

309
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,219

310
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,060
Hey, listen. Oh, there he is!

311
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,831
<i>Hey, Sebastio. How you doing?</i>

312
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,375
Look how big you got.
Oh! Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

313
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,070
How'd that get in there, huh?

314
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,148
You want that?
[Chuckles]

315
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,148
You want anything?

316
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,684
No. Here on business.

317
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,013
I got a kill clock ticking.
Mexican on black.

318
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,026
These things usually start on the inside,

319
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,096
- Okay.
<i>- Good.</i>

320
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,861
Uh, your C.I. Renewal papers hit my desk.

321
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,873
You need me to sign them?

322
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,877
Look, I know it pays the rent,
but C.I. Work is a roll of the dice.

323
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,609
We've had a good six months,
but you should get out before you get hurt.

324
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,915
- I need that money, Vic. What else am I gonna do?
- Anything else.

325
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,319
I'll help you find something.

326
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,293
You're worried about us.

327
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,455
I just want this to end on good terms.
Tell me you'll think about it.

328

00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,982
She won't say. Why don't you guys
just leave her alone?

493
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,814
- Come on, man. Help a brother out.
<i>- [Tina] Who'd you take?</i>

494
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,356
- Oh, I always take Shane in these things.
- Not me, brother. I'm married.

495
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,722
- That means no stickin', just lickin'.
- Oh, charming.

496
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,057
Besides, I like my women tiny.

497
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,562
So your dick fits better?

498
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,293
<i>Ohl Easy.</i>

499
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,062

<i>[Tina]</i>
<i>Put me down for 20 on the sperm bank.</i>

I gotta get this organized.
Tina, 20, turkey baster.

502
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,406
You okay, <i>mijo?</i>

503
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:58,414
See ya later, darling.
[Kisses]

504
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,121
I got him.

505
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,089
Are you on drugs?

506
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,124
I didn't raise an animal.
You hear me?

507
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,329
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

508
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,406
<i>Who set the kill clock?</i>

509
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,878
Don't you touch him!

<i>Vic. Vic.</i>

511
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,848
Little kid who got run over last week was
a nephew of a <i>Los Mag</i> capo doing 20 in Chino.

512
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,620
Los Mags <i>are reaching out</i>
<i>to settle the beef.</i>

513
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,252
<i>Chino's where Lorenzo's pop</i>
<i>is stretching.</i>

514
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,331
Hood's been under the microscope.

515
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,027
Maybe the <i>Mags</i> use a proxy, make sure
no blood blows back in their direction.

516
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:55,538
I got a few Juvie graduates in Chino.
I'll find out what pop's story is. Come on, man.

517
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,302
- Shane, give me a minute.
- Yeah.

518
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,338
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>
- Where's Sebastio?

519
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,542
- My mom's watching him.
- Here.

520
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,711
It's okay. I'm- I'm on the clock.

521
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,416
- I know how much gas costs. Come on.
- More and more.

522
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,424
Thanks.

523
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,926
Any thoughts about hanging this up?

524
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,896
Still thinking.

525
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,001
A <i>Los Mag</i> captain
set the kill clock from Chino.

526
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,442
Same cell block
where your father got caught...

00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,378
helping the black brethren
distribute smokes.

528
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,382
Pissed off the inked <i>vatos.</i>

529
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,112
<i>[Shane] The asshole can't even</i>
<i>play by the rules in prison.</i>

530
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,383
My guess is Lorenzo Sr.
Offered you up...

531
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,856
as a junior assassin...

532
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,325
to settle both scores.

533
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,524
<i>Is that true? Does that bastard</i>
<i>have something to do with this?</i>

534
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,998
<i>- Answer mel</i>
<i>- [Bangs Hand On Table]</i>

535
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,500
Mommy can't help you.
You grow a dick. Tell the truth.

536
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,946
It's about justice.

537
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:17,078
He said I could help the cause.
It's Mexi pride.

538
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,156
Jesus, mother of God.

539
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,852
<i>I didn't want to hurt no one.</i>
<i>Dad started crying.</i>

540
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,555
Said if I didn't kill two dark by 10:00 tonight,
<i>Los Mags</i> were gonna waste him.

541
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,792
That was him you were
on the phone with last night?

542
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,301
I gotta finish it, or he dies.

543
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,304
<i>Why? Why would you</i>
<i>do this for him?</i>

544
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,375
Not for him. I hate him!

545
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,104
But if I don't do it, it falls on Cisco.

546
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,806
He was on the other line.
Dad told him too.

547
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,145
He gave us the combination
for the guns.

548
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,684
Guns? There's more than one?

549
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:53,246
<i>- [Mrs. Lavedra] Oh, no.</i>
- Cisco still thinks my dad's like a real dad.

550
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,316
He'll do it. He'll throw it all away
for that asshole.

551
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,658
Come on.

552
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,733
<i>[Mackey] Paula, where's the kid</i>

553
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,802

554
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,167
- Shit.
- [Whimpering] No, no, no.

555
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,267

557
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,448
- What happened here?
- Little spic came in, shot him cold.

558
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,144
- Tommy never saw it coming.
- He's gone.

559
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,221
- Which way did he go?
<i>- Out the back.</i>

560

<i>- That crazy kid stopped</i>
<i>to take a goddamn Polaroid.</i>

561
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,956
- I stuck him with my best pair though.
<i>- Stuck him with your scissors?</i>

00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,751
Hey!

567
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,155
Cisco? Put the gun down, kid!

568
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,522
<i>Put it down right now, or I'll shoot.</i>

569
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:06,324
- I gotta get this picture to my dad.
- H-Hold it! All right.

570
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,127
We'll talk about the picture
after you put the gun down.

571
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,862
- You'll take it to him?
- Yeah.

572
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,938
Yeah, I'll take it to him myself.

573
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,208
<i>That's it. Where we can see it.</i>

574
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,439
Good boy. Go.

575
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,683
All right. Give me the camera.
Good boy.

576
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,412
<i>This really hurts.</i>

577
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,421
Don't! Shit. Oh, Jesus Christ.
All right. Hold on.

578
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,491
- Keep pressure on it.
- Go get those paramedics!

579
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,083

- Aw, Christ almighty! Here we go. Watch out.

580
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,095

- Watch out. Go, go, go.

581
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,722

<i>[Claudette]</i>
<i>What happened in the cafeteria, Evan?</i>

583
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,269
I heard those shots,
hit the floor like everybody else.

584
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,931
- Anyone else see that?
- Don't know. We all ran for the door.

585
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,375
- We got three people who saw you
pull the trigger, Every-Day.
- Then you got three liars!

586
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,946
Three against one.
Those aren't very good odds for you.

587
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,539
I'm used to it.

588
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,619
We're gonna need
a little more than bad attitude...

589
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,881
to be convinced of your innocence.

590
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:10,286
You best tell pale boy here
to get outta my goddamn face.

591
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,296
Look, I ain't- I ain't been playing trouble
for a while now. Ask around.

592
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,374
We did.
That's how we got the statements.

593
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,069
From who? Some chili-shitters?
They killing us niggers.

594

You don't think they wanna
put another one away?

<i>- That sounds like motive to me.</i>
- Lazy-ass cop.

00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,410
Hey, I bust my ass on this job!

597
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,645
Well, your busted ass suck at it.

598

- Come on. It's been a long, shitty day.
- Every day.

601
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,365
The E.M.T. Says he's gonna make it.

602
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,028
<i>- Gracias a Dios.</i>
- Yeah, I wouldn't be too thankful.

603
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,162
He just killed an innocent man.

604
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,300
I wanted to kill their father a dozen times,
and I never did for their sake.

Look, this isn't the way I wanted to do it,
but at least it'll end this round of blood.

Talk to your guy in Chino.
Find out where those pictures go.

<i>Got a call</i>
<i>from a teacher at Wellman.</i>

He just realized his gun was stolen
out of a locked desk drawer.

00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,015
- Evan Dayne in any of his classes?
- Homeroom and science.

616
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,210
Now we know where Every-Day
got his weapon.

617
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,881

- I thought maybe I'd-

624
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,448
I'd try to catch them before they
went to bed, say good night.

625
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,248
- It's not your usual night.
- I know.

626
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,052
Vic, you can't just show up.
I mean, they have a schedule.

627
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,127

You want me to ever see 'em or not?

00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,255
- These aren't my rules. It's the custody agreement.
- Ah, Jesus!

00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,200
Shit. I thought I got it all.

632
