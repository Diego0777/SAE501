Well, you got burned trying to make
that case already. Why don't you move on?

And where exactly do you think
you're gonna drop anchor?

87
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,839
I need some privacy, and I don't
want to restrict any of these officers...

the interrogation rooms...

89
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,672

Excuse me, Lieutenant.

<i>- Are you forgetting that I'm captain here?</i>
- Acting captain.

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,349
And that entitles you to a work space
and a phone, not a private office.

93
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,789

217
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,002
He hasn't mentioned cutting
himself, or an accident.

218
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,770
If there's nothing to it, he never has
to know you were here.

I just- I just don't know
if I can take this.

225
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,260

<i>Vice. What made you come back</i>

290
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,351
I would think that you would want to make
a name for yourself flying solo.

291
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,123
All the same,
living in Mackey's shadow all the time?

292
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,330
You don't feel that he was trying
to get you back into the fold...

293
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,133
so that he could
get a leash on you, do you?

294
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,875
What's here is how it went down.

295
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:27,075
So there was just you, Vic...

296
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,678
Terry and Two-Time in that room?

297
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,916
Just me and Vic.

No Lemansky, no Gardocki?

299

It was true then.
It's true now.

You gonna do something with that?

308
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,527
Just got off the phone
with Robbery-Homicide.

309
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,262
Turns out they didn't just find me.

310
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,033
A "veteran detective"
recommended they review my file.

311
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,234
I'm gonna check
Missing Persons again.

312
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,574

- I thought Robbery-Homicide was your dream job.

313
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,978
I didn't need your help.
There is buzz.

314
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,143
Hey, you guys have a Fatima Gardner

00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,557
- Yeah?
- Uh, Captain left a few things up here.

317
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,794

Anything you need.

319
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,935
I pulled this
off the wall downstairs.

320
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,945
Pretty demeaning, don't you think?

321
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,505
Doesn't really bother me.
It's just boys being boys.

322
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,085
A lot of money
on Vic being your baby's daddy.

323
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,417
Everybody's got an opinion.

324
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,683
Heard a lot of rumors
about the two of you.

325
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,259
<i>Are you saying that</i>
<i>they aren't true?</i>

326
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,555
Look, I'm sure you won't blame me...

327
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,265
when I don't discuss stupid gossip
about my personal life with I.A.D.

328
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,233
When I don't discuss stupid gossip
about my personal life with I.A.D.

329
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,464
Sexual relationships between department
personnel need to be divulged in a timely manner...

330
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,472
according to the employee handbook.

331
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,975
<i>Failure to do so</i>
<i>can result in suspensions...</i>

332
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,604
even demotions.

333
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,480
You just got a pay bump
recently, didn't you?

334
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,383
Ah, come on. There's no relationship
between me and Vic.

335
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,153
Should I make this official?

336
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:53,198
<i>Because I can do that-</i>
<i>widen my investigation.</i>

337
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,326
[Sighs]

338
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,438
Vic and I had a thing, okay?
It's in the past.

339
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,066
<i>When was that?</i>

340
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,943
- Eight or nine months ago?
- You want to get a court order
to draw blood, go right ahead.

341
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,140
But this is none of your business.

342
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,980
You still have to disclose
your relationship with Mackey.

343
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,681
Fill out the forms today, and
I'll overlook the tardiness.

344
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,555
Hey, Vic. Checked out our next
Bop Street target on Hoover.

345
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,222
- Doors and windows are fortified.
- All right, have Ronnie get a door knocker.

346
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,322
- Flash bangs too.
- All right, man.

347
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,368
<i>- [Mackey] Hey. Hang on.</i>
- Over there.

348
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,903
Gunsmoke, we're just about to pay a visit
to another one of your crack palaces.

349
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,138
<i>Look, man, I don't know</i>
<i>who capped my peoples.</i>

350
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,680
But I tell you straight up,
it wasn't no Bop Street niggas.

351
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,580
After Hoover, we're gonna
stop by your Temple Street smokehouse.

352
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,653
That'll bring your
one-day loss to what, 12K?

353
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:53,088
You know what it does to my street cred
even walking into this pig farm?

354
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,717
- Oink when you get something we can use.
- Hold up, hold up.

355
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,091
Come here.

356
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,389
Tell him.

357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,834
I'm chillin' at homegirl's round the way,
hear shots, see these two <i>vatos</i> drive off.

358
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,065
- What'd they look like?
<i>- Vatos.</i>

359
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,665
You know, shaved heads,
white tees.

360
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,745
Guy driving had "L.A."
Tattooed all up in here.

361
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,075
But I didn't get a good look
at the dude shooting.

362
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,617
- What kind of car?
- Old, I don't know.

363
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,243
But they was riding on gold anodized
100-spoke D's.

364
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,256
- I know my wheels.
- So we straight now?

365
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,422
Not yet. How's a punk-ass wigger like Kasper
get respect from a crew hard as Bop Street?

366
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,692
I thought he was a poser myself
for a minute.

367
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,734
White boy got business skills.

368
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,464
Split 50-50 off top,
so folks are gettin' paid.

369
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,472
Come with these names
for the product...

370
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,906
"Pink Yo," "Yellow Fever."

371
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,478
Same old shit, only
different colored caps.

372
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,207
You were moving Kasper's product outta
the place we took down this morning?

373
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,374
Look, man, fiends want
what Kasper's selling.

374
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,214
Can't argue with the free market.

375
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,618
Lookin' forward
to that truce again, fellas.

376
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,961
<i>- [Danny] Hey, Vic, you gotta sec?</i>
- I'll get on those rims.

377
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,658
- What's up?
- Uh...

378
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,634
That guy from I.A.D. Got all over me
about department policy...

379
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,898
disclosure of personal
relationships on the job.

380
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,498
- None of his business.
- Yeah, well, he's pushing me really hard, okay?

381
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,772
I can't take a suspension
or a pay cut right now.

382
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,007
I gotta notify Billings.
I just wanted you to know.

383
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,016
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you saw your sister?</i>

384
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,026
<i>Lunchtime. Said she was gonna run out</i>
<i>for some soda, never came back.</i>

385
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,619
<i>Family drinks a lot of soda.</i>

386
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,858
I seem to remember you were "out for soda"
when Lana Gregory was killed.

387
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,401
<i>[Claudette]</i>
<i>It's only a few hours. Grown woman.</i>

388
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,994
<i>- Bit premature to call the police.</i>
- I know my sister.

389
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,801
She say she'd be back,
she'd be back.

390
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,934
- Mind if we look around?
- Wouldn't have called you if I did.

391
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,618
<i>[Claudette]</i>
<i>I'll take her room, you take his.</i>

392
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,662
Fatima's room's clean.
Back door's unlocked. What do you have?

393
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,357
It's what I don't have.
Kleavon's death kit.

394
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,333
Latex gloves, knife, duct tape-

395
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,996
It's gone.

396
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,630
I was- I was- I was here earlier.

397
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,074
- What?
- The spur of the moment.
Fatima gave her consent.

398
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,305
You searched a murder suspect's
house without backup?

399
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,404
What if Kleavon showed up?

400
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,779
I hid in the closet.
He didn't see me.

401
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,318
- I slipped out the back door.
- Jesus.

402
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,514
- If you're wrong, and he
confronted her after you left-
<i>- I shouldn't have come alone.</i>

403
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,922
But I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Stress is a trigger.

404
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,656
<i>- I saw you were hurting this morning.</i>
- I am fine.

405
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,222
<i>We got a neighbor that says he saw</i>
<i>a prowler exiting the backyard this morning...</i>

406
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,167
wearing what he called
a "$100 suit."

407
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,173
<i>I'll deal with the neighbor.</i>
<i>If you think I'm up to it.</i>

408
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,743
Take Kleavon to the Barn,
get a statement.

409
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,076
I paid over $300 for this suit.

410
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,051
<i>[Kavanaugh]</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

411
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,689
<i>Who's this?</i>

412
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,958
It's Terry Crowley.
He was one of my guys.

413
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,624
<i>- Killed by a drug dealer a couple of years go.</i>
- That is one version.

414
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,430
Terry was working forJustice,
investigating allegations of a relationship...

415
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,471
<i>between drug dealers</i>
<i>and your clients.</i>

416
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,472
<i>- You have a different version?</i>
<i>- Detective Mackey...</i>

417
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,806
either acting alone or with other members
of his team...

418
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,144
killed Detective Crowley or put him
in a position to be killed.

419
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,277
Just like that Russian I was gonna murder
before you blew our sting?

420
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,548
Any evidence,
or are you all attitude?

421
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,057
In due course.

422
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,897
These theatrics
why you wanted to see us?

423
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,228
I'm sure the three of us
have better things to do.

424
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,893
Yes.

425
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,803
I'm officially informing you, you are under
investigation for the death ofTerry Crowley...

426
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,068
<i>and other allegations of corruption.</i>

427
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,667
You have a right to a P.B.A. Rep,
a lawyer.

428
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,145
I see you already got one.
And a good one.

429
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,809
<i>Please, could you get him to initial here</i>
<i>and here, his signature there.</i>

430
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,291
<i>We'll cooperate fully so you can stop wasting</i>
<i>everyone's time, Lieutenant.</i>

431
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,864
I suppose you want a statement?

432
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,934
Actually, if you could have your clients
walk me through the house...

433
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,629
where Terry Crowley was killed,
that would be great.

434
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,262
Arrange it soon.

435
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:39,002
<i>Oh, and take down these photos</i>
<i>or I'll file for harassment.</i>

436
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,017
Becca.

437
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,485
I thought the headline in this case
was David against Goliath.

438
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,386
Or did this murder charge
slip your mind?

439
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,291
<i>- I can't talk about this right now.</i>
- This is a big goddamn deal.

440
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,886
It's all a lie.
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

441
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,227
- What the hell's going on?
- He told them to bring me in.

442
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,397
- Can you take the kids?
- You don't have to talk to him, remember?

443
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,805
- I want this over with.
- He can't compel your cooperation.

444
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,639
<i>If you feel uncomfortable</i>
<i>at any time, you just leave.</i>

445
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,679
- Okay.
- Corrine.

446
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,613
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

447
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,912
The children, they could, uh-
they can wait inside.

448
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,216
- I can take care of my own kids.
- Okay.

449
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,086
This way. Upstairs.
Hey.

450
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,553
- Dad, what the hell's going on?
- Don't talk like that.

451
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,654
He's a cop, right?
Did Mom do something wrong?

452
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,666
No, never.
Come on, honey.

453
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,499
Vic. I, uh, caught a 187 times two.

454
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,073
- Need you to get on it.
- What's 187 mean?

455
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:47,338
It means Dad's gonna find you guys a ride.
Come on, kids. Let's go.

456
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,414
You need anything?
Can I get you something? Coffee or water?

457
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,848
Just ask your questions.

458
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,878
<i>You told me that, uh...</i>

459
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,082
it's really difficult
to make both the tuitions.

460
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,524
Yet, Vic, he seems to be able to come up
with the money all the time.

461
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,858
How do you think he does that?

462
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,023
Overtime.

463
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,796
<i>Yeah, I've checked those pay stubs.</i>

464
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,939
He always has been a good provider,
wouldn't you say?

465
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,497
He always has been a good provider,
wouldn't you say?

466
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,871
<i>I guess that might</i>
<i>change now that...</i>

467
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,740
you have to split the pie
four ways instead of three.

468
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,042
I don't understand.

469
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,743
Oh, maybe you're not aware.

470
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,983
Officer Danielle Sofer,
who works here...

471
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,785
is filing paperwork admitting
to a sexual relationship with Vic...

472
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,384
<i>over the last couple of years.</i>

473
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,986
When did you get divorced?

474
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,067
- Last year.
<i>- Right.</i>

475
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,001
Officer Sofer is now pregnant.

476
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,203
Is this another imaginary child
like Andy?

477
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,279
What kind of a man says he has
an autistic child...

478
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>to a woman who has</i>

479
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,116

<i>- You know, I didn't really like doing that.</i>

480
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,917
<i>I'm-I'm sorry. I just needed to know</i>
<i>what kind of woman you are, Corrine.</i>

481
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,753
Really. I mean,
this is not about me.

482
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,759
This is about Vic.

483
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,421
<i>It's about you.</i>
<i>It's about the kids.</i>

484
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,828
It's about this new baby.

485
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,759
How we got to this place and
where we're gonna go from here.

486
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,805
Please.

487
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,534

00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,446
- Same caliber as the Bop Street hit.
- Yep.

491
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,280
It's gotta be the shooter
from this morning.

492
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,218
- Payback's a bitch.
<i>- Yeah, and karma's a whore.</i>

493
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,120
Amado Alvaro. His place.
No sign of forced entry.

494
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,456
- What about ass-boy over there?
<i>- No I.D. Yet.</i>

495
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,620
Neighbor called 911,
saw Alvaro's car driving away...

496
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,630
a little while after
she heard the gunshots.

<i>Hooptie?</i>
<i>Gold rims?</i>

498

Yeah.
'69 Olds Cutlass. Black.

499
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,968
- Run Alvaro's registration,
put an A.P.B. Out on the car.
- Got it.

500
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,567
Squad, let me get a run on
a '69 Olds Cut-

<i>- [Mackey] We got it. Nice work, Larry.</i>

503
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,377
- Say hello to whoever killed L.A. And ass-boy.
- Who's the Chinaman?

504
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,117
I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

Go!

00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,105
Stop! Hey!

Whoa! Hold it!

512
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,715
Hey, stop, dumb-ass.
It's a barbed wire fence.

513
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,451
<i>- What the hell is he doing?</i>

[Grunts]

515
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,427
I didn't do nothing.

516
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,129
- Except a double homicide.
- That's crazy. Amado's my main man.

517
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,763
Funny how you know exactly the murders
we're talking about.

518
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,707
We've got you fleeing the scene of a murder
in the victim's car.

519
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,005
You take one last look
at the outside world.

520
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,775
- Where'd you put the murder weapon?
- They were dead when I got there.

521
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,146
- I swear.
- All right. Search the car.

522
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,151
He was into me for 10 grand.

523
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,986
Some white guy named Kasper's
coming by to drop off money.

524
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,492
- [Mackey] Amado was meeting Kasper?
- I wasn't supposed to know.

525
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:28,464
Kasper was coming by to pay him for some work
he did. When I saw bodies, I bounced.

526
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,830
<i>We gotta take another run at Kasper.</i>

527
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,631
- Remember Terry Crowley?
- Sure. He was on Vic's team.

528
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:41,178
<i>Do you remember any change in Vic's</i>
<i>behavior leading up to Terry's death?</i>

529
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,009
No. Uh, but he was
pretty torn up afterwards.

530
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,278
- We all were.
- I'm sure it was, uh, terrible.

531
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,089
Terry was working forJustice...

532
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,989
investigating your
ex-husband's team for corruption.

533
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:01,631
Planting evidence, extortion, kickbacks-
a laundry list of things.

534
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,864
When Vic made Terry
as working for the feds...

535
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,839
we believe that he and Shane Vendrell
murdered him.

536
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,410
- Vic's a lot of things, but he's no killer.
- [Scoffs] Vic is a survivor.

537
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:19,950
He'll do whatever
it takes to protect himself...

538
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,679
his team and his family.

539
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,120
Are you really trying to tell me that
after 12 years of marriage...

540
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,718
<i>you don't think that that man</i>
<i>is capable of pulling the trigger on someone...</i>

541
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,457
who's trying to take away
everything from him?

542
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,329
- Everything?
- You need to stop this, okay?

543
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,163
Don't cry!

544
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,206
I don't want to see you
shed one single tear.

545
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,835
'Cause tears imply
that you didn't know.

546
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,879
And don't you sit here and tell me
that you didn't know, Mrs. Mackey.

547
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,977
Twelve years you shared his bed.

548
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:00,649
You knew. He paid your mortgage,
he paid your bills...

549
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,658
and now he's paying
for private schools.

550
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,856
You always knew what he was capable of.
Just like you knew about the other women.

551
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,297
Don't you sit here
and-and-and cry...

552
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,300
and tell me that he's a good man.

553
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,495
Because we both know
that's bullshit.

554
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,768
You left him because you knew.

555
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,211
And yet, you protect him.

556
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,281
You protect him and you lie.

557
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,441
You lie to me.

558
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:31,250
Don't you dare
sit here shedding tears.

559
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,449
You can only do that
if you've earned that right...

560
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,458
if it was all a surprise.

561
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:41,296
But it's not a surprise to the woman who knew
him better than anyone else on this Earth.

562
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,867
Is it?

563
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,937

00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,683
<i>- Oh, God. Get it off me, pleasel</i>
- Call the paramedics.

00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,922
Damn.

580
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,834
Ouch. Meanwhile, this I.A.D. Guy's
got my nuts in a waffle iron.

581
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,998
- You say this happened at a glory hole?
- Yeah. It's pretty sick, huh?

582
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,008
Yeah. Guy's lucky
his schlong wasn't cut off.

583
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,544
Well, I figure the perp
only let it snap halfway.

584
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,046
Otherwise, it would've- No question.

585
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,606
Anyway, we're reinterviewing the victim
as soon as he gets back from the hospital.

586
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,812
Price tag. Check out
the hardware store that sold it?

587
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,822
Yeah, it's one of 20 in the same transaction
two days ago.

588
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,449
That's why my T.O. Thought you'd want
to put detectives on it.

589
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,551
I can't spare any,
so you guys run with it.

590
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,361
It's right upJulien's alley. It's the kind
of case he can really sink his teeth into.

591
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:31,364
You and Fatima had a fight. She was nagging you
too much, invading your privacy?

592
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,877
Lady, I came to you. Now y'all want to pull me
in here about this thing?

593
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,345
<i>- You're wasting time. My sister's missing.</i>
<i>- We're trying to find her.</i>

594
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,042
<i>Then why ain't you talkin'</i>
<i>to that neighbor about the man he saw?</i>

595
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,211
- We're following up on that.
<i>- We want to help find your sister.</i>

596
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,314
<i>You have to start answering questions.</i>
<i>You gonna cooperate or not?</i>

597
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,484
Anything for her.

598
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,757
Give us a minute.

599
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,731
Anyone else, I'd say he's
genuinely concerned about her.

600
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,199
<i>Given that he's a homicidal sociopath,</i>
<i>who knows?</i>

601
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,102
When we get this guy,
I want to administer the needle myself.

602
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,039
- Wow, he's really under your skin.
- I wish I could get under his.

603
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,044
Okay, maybe we hit Kleavon
with the bloody shirt, the missing death kit.

604
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,444
- We get him rattled.
- We've already exposed Fatima enough.

605
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,450
I don't want to blow her cover.
She could still be out there, alive.

606
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,918
You know, he could've realized
the bloody shirt was missing...

607
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,489
figured out Fatima turned on him,
even if he didn't see me.

608
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,856
Great. Now that we've covered your ass,
you help me figure out what to do.

609

<i>- No.</i>

Shot and killed in his home,

- Pretty messy.
- Rest in peace.

615
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,214
Matches the description of someone we're
looking for in the attack on you and your peeps.

616
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,552
Well, like the book says:

Vegas P.D. Was looking at him
on a murder for hire. Case didn't make.

620

Professional hit. He didn't get the whole job
done, wigger got the last word.

somebody I never even heard of?

628

00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,143
Why you trippin' on this black-white shit?
Color ain't a thing.

635
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,912
Oh, come on, man.
This is just us glacier monkeys.

636
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,078
We both know
white is right and black is whack.

637
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,486
Which is why you're rolling
with the pretty white lady.

638
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,024
You might talk like a brother,
but you hang with your own.

639
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,026
Not that the sisters
would show you love anyway.

640
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,460
I get more black ass
than a bus bench in Compton.

641
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,464
<i>- Ya heard?</i>
- [Chuckles]

642
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,660
Hard for me to imagine you holding it down
with some Nubian mattress-monster.

643
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,999
<i>Well, then you need</i>
<i>to ask somebody, one-time.</i>

644
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,005
Taneisha's my go-to girl.

645
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,304
She'll let me tear her fat ass
and sugar walls up any time I want.

646
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,711
<i>White ho's only around</i>
<i>'cause she swallows nut...</i>

647
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,700
<i>White ho's only around</i>
<i>'cause she swallows nut...</i>

648
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,076
and I can take her home
to Moms without any drama.

649
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,041
Word.

650
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,649
L.L. Douche Bag's
starting to piss me off.

651
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,694
Yeah, well, he gave us enough to put
his alibi to the taste test.

652
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,628
Pick up the girlfriend.
I'm gonna stick around.

653
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,366
<i>[Julien]</i>
<i>You must've seen something.</i>

654
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,766
The assailant had to walk past you
to leave that bathroom.

655
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,567
- I really didn't get a look at him.
- Get a booking slip going.

656
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,574
<i>- I need you to stand, hands behind your back.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

657
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,577
- Stand, hands behind your back.
- [Groans] You're arresting me?

658
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,080
- Public indecency, lewd conduct.
<i>- I'm not the one who did anything.</i>

659
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,413
<i>You think maybe I've suffered enough?</i>
<i>I have a wife and daughters.</i>

660
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,510
If they find out- Oh, Jesus.

661
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,612
Look, I don't normally
do this sort of thing.

662
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,089
<i>- Just once or twice to work stuff out.</i>
<i>- In the cage.</i>

663
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,854
Please, don't do this.
It'll ruin my marriage.

664
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,827
- Come on, sir. Come on.
- Please.

665
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,398
I don't have to say anything to you.

666
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,407
We were married, and I'm protected
under spousal privilege.

667
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,909
[Scoffs] He told you
to say that, didn't he?

668
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,982
'Cause it protects him.

669
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,281
You know you can waive
that right any time you want to, right?

670
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,818
Which is why he probably didn't even tell you
to get an attorney, did he?

671
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,397
You know he's got his own lawyer?
Maybe you saw her downstairs?

672
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,228
She's real pretty, dark-haired.

673
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,826
[Scoffs]
Such a good provider.

674
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:58,307
And yet, he's covering his ass,
he's covering his guys' ass...

675
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,377
and he leaves you
just hanging out there.

676
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,611
You know why?

677
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,482
'Cause he doesn't want you listening
to anybody else but him.

678
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,045
Your lawyer would, uh,
be looking after your interests.

679
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:17,457
And that doesn't help him.
That hurts him, in fact, so-

680
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,962
Your lawyer would advise you
to cooperate.

681
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,533
Tell me the truth.
Tell me what I want to know.

682
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,626
But you're here all alone.

683
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,833
You want to know what I see?
I mean, just looking at you?

684
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:40,349
<i>I see a mother of three</i>
<i>going away for obstructing justice...</i>

685
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,851
protecting a man
she knows is a criminal.

686
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:51,388
What are your two autistic children
gonna do when you're, like...

687
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,293
<i>Iocked away and you're serving</i>
<i>your sentence? What are they gonna do?</i>

688
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,992
<i>- How are they gonna be in foster care?</i>
- Stop it. Stop!

689
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,366
<i>Tell me what I want to know.</i>
<i>I'm just asking you to tell me what-</i>

690
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,769
<i>Tell me what I want to know.</i>

691
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:09,339
<i>Vic is not going to take care of those kids</i>
<i>when you're gone.</i>

692
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:15,147
Vic gave me some cash
in a bag a little while ago.

693
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,483
That's it. I don't know anything else.
There's nothing else.

694
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,021
- How- How much?
- 65,000.

695
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,695
- Where'd it come from?
- I didn't ask. L-I never asked.

696
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,864
- And where is it?
- I spent most of it on tuition and on therapists.

697
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,375
There's-There's only-
There's only about $5,000 left.

698
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,275
I need that money.
I need that money back.

699
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,216
Now.

700
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,758
Now you can cry.

701
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,361
<i>[Shane] You might want to rethink this</i>
<i>alibi you're handing Kasper.</i>

702
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,264
<i>'Cause we can put him in the crib where</i>
<i>Amado Alvaro got his brains splashed.</i>

703
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,304
That's, uh-That's the guy who shot at you
and, uh, killed your friends.

704
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,533
If you're lying to cover
for your man-boy-toy...

705
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,700
we can get you on conspiracy
to commit murder.

706
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,710
<i>[Shane] It's like pulling</i>
<i>the trigger yourself.</i>

707
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,508
<i>You'll be old and in the way</i>
<i>by the time you see the sky again.</i>

708
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:21,642
I've got nothing to say.
Period. Point blank.

709
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,879
Kasper's got plenty
to say about you.

710
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,718
I get more black ass
than a bus bench in Compton.

711
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,486
<i>- Ya heard?</i>
<i>- [Mackey Chuckles]</i>

712
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,562
Hard for me to imagine you holding it down
with some Nubian mattress-monster.

713
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,893
<i>[Kasper] Well, then you better</i>
<i>ask somebody, one-time.</i>

714
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,899
<i>Taneisha's my go-to girl.</i>

715
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,401
<i>She'll let me tear her fat ass</i>

716
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,994
<i>White ho's only around</i>
<i>'cause she swallows nut-</i>

717
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,017
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me.

718
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,686
- What happened?
- Not now. Just let me go.

719
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,787
- Corrine.
<i>- [Shane] Vic?</i>

720
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,991
Corrine, I'll call you.

721
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,432
Vic, Moni gave up
our friendly ghost.

722
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,970
What's wrong?

723
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,474
Hey, come on, man.

724
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,942
Let's go.

725
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,479
<i>[Mackey] You know</i>
<i>the thing about women?</i>

726
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,143
And it doesn't really matter
what color they are.

727
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,847
When they get pissed off, watch out.

728
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,323
<i>Moni just threw your</i>
<i>pink-ass cheeks to the curb.</i>

729
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,487
- You had the smarts, the business model.
<i>- The stripper girlfriend.</i>

730
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,327
What you didn't have was the street cred.
Not really.

731
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,333
<i>Not like some hard-ass brother.</i>

732
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,403
You're only a true baller
when somebody wants you dead.

733
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,234
And if the bullets miss you,
makes you immortal to the street, right?

734
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,777
<i>So you hired Alvaro and Zeborio to shoot up</i>
<i>your friends. Make you look like the target.</i>

735
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:58,611
Market yourself as some bad-ass dude
instead of a punk-ass white boy.

736
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,616
Man, you been smoking crack.

737
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,118
<i>Your girl Moni</i>
<i>just gave us the key...</i>

738
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,211
<i>to her locker at the Cheetah,</i>
<i>where she stashed...</i>

739
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,314
the TEC-9 you did
the two hit men with.

740
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,394
<i>Shooter out of the way, you don't have</i>
<i>to pay for the hit, right?</i>

741
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,123
<i>The businessman in you saw</i>
<i>a way to save a buck.</i>

742
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,758
Instead, it's gonna cost you
three to five dimes in the state pen.

743
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,170
Bitches ain't shit.

744
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,874
Your sister's a churchgoing woman.
You grow up that way?

745
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,448
Jesus is my savior.
That's what you mean?

746
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,677
That's what I love about the church.

747
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,618
No matter how bad
you are, how often...

748
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,918
forgiveness is always there.

749
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,925
All you gotta do is come clean.

750
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,120
- What's that gotta do with finding her?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

751
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,357
Maybe she started looking at you funny
after you murdered Lana.

752
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,729
<i>Maybe she wanted to ask about it</i>
<i>but was too scared.</i>

753
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,859
<i>And then one day it all came out.</i>

754
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,200
But you couldn't have that.
So you had her killed...

755
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,604
<i>and reported her missing</i>
<i>so you could make yourselflook innocent.</i>

756
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,768
<i>Nol I didn't kill my sister.</i>

757
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,778
That's my blood.

758
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,905
They're all somebody's blood,
Kleavon.

759
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,040
Didn't stop you then.
Why would it this time?

760
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,588
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'll talk to you any way I goddamn please.

761
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:16,092
You can't arrest me, and you're not helping me.
I'll find her myself.

762
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,063
I'd be willing to make these charges go away
on two conditions.

763
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,142
- Anything you want.
<i>- You never do this type of thing again.</i>

764
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,177
- My word.
- And you help us I.D. The guy who did this.

765
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,645
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Then I'll be involved in a court case.</i>

766
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,582
I know how this works, my brother's a lawyer.
Either way, it's all public.

767
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:46,179
I'll keep your name out of this. But I cannot
get this guy and his 19 other rattraps...

768
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,986
<i>off the street without your help.</i>

769
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,392
<i>The bridge ofhis nose is right,</i>
<i>but his cheekbones were higher.</i>

770
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,535
Hey. You've decided
to cut him some slack?

771
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,105
Yeah. Lesser of two evils.
Gets the kook off the streets.

772
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,607
- You think we're looking for a vigilante?
- Ah, don't know.

773
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,200
Julien, you and I got off
to a rough start.

774
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,542
But I feel like things are
starting to make more sense.

775
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,809
Good.

776
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,851
Look, man, I grew up with my gay uncle
living with us...

777
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,853
so it's no big deal to me.

778
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,855
But I saw what he had to go through.

779
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,551
I honestly just didn't
get your situation.

780
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,560
I'm not sure what
you're trying to say.

781
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,459
All I'm saying is that I understand.

782
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,690
And it's between you
and your wife anyway. So I'm cool.

783
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,532
You're cool with what? That I'm the T.O.
That should've washed you out weeks ago?

784
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,832
You don't understand anything.

785
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,177
I know why you recommended me
for Robbery-Homicide.

786
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,179
There's no need to thank me.

787
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,383
<i>You're getting sicker, and you</i>
<i>can't bear for me to see it.</i>

788
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,315
<i>You're getting sicker, and you</i>
<i>can't bear for me to see it.</i>

789
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,811
A woman may be dead
because you wanted to protect me.

790
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,821
I shouldn't have done
the search without you. I'm sorry.

791
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:02,428
I do not let my illness
get in the way of my job.

792
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,764
You do.
That's dangerous.

793
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,962
I'm-I'm not leaving you.

794
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:13,670
<i>Detectives? You wanted to be notified</i>
<i>of any black female dump-jobs.</i>

795
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,836
Late 40s.
Probably strangled.

796
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,609
That's not Kleavon's M.O.
That's his sister.

797
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:25,079
Uni says it looks like rape.
His own sister?

798
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,970
It's not Fatima.

799
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,567
Who is it then?

800
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,039
Look at this.

801
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,412
- He chopped her hair off.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

802
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,247
Not with scissors.
Probably a knife?

803
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,051
You recognize the haircut?

804
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,525
Looks like I got
under Kleavon's skin after all.

805
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,606
Hey. Thanks for swinging by.

806
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,773
- I wanted to finish this in person.
- Me too.

807
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,717
If you didn't before, now you can see how
out of control Kavanaugh is.

808
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:35,758
I need to decide if I want to represent you.
Any of you.

809
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:39,488
First, you're a sacrificial lamb to appease
angry voters after that referendum tanked.

810
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,497
- We're the good guys in this.
- Only not that good.

811
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,193
Because then you tell me Aceveda
had you doing dirty work for him...

812
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,031
and is setting you up
to take the fall.

813
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,504
Today I find out this is about
capital murder on a cop.

814
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,438
Becca, it's a put-up job.

815
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,309
Right now, I have no clue about
who the hell you really are.

816
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,877
How can I help you with that?

817
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,524
I actually had a kernel of faith...

818
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,560
<i>that you could take the guy down.</i>

819
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,098
<i>Now it just seems</i>
<i>like you've lost your senses.</i>

820
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,224
You're under investigation,
Councilman.

821
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,861
- For what?
- Your connection with Mackey.

822
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:25,567
I don't understand how you could
be so gung ho to get this guy...

823
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,236
and yet be in his pocket
at the same time.

824
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,813
Something I gotta look at.

825
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:35,408
What? You still think that I helped Vic set you up
with that Russian sting?

826
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,750
<i>Man, he got to you.</i>
<i>Playing us against each other.</i>

827
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,087
You-You may as well fold up your tent
and go home.

828
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,626
One thing I know for sure:

829
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:49,427
When you sat in this office,
you could've put an end to him, but you didn't.

830
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,433
Now it's my turn.

831
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,766
You seriously think this little display
of yours is gonna work?

832
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,441
I need you to initial here, here...

833
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,742
and I'd really like
your signature here.

834
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,981
<i>You're still a reserve cop, right?</i>

835
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,079
I do have authority over you.

836
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,626
You walk out that door,
I'm gonna take your badge...

837
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,423
and I'm gonna tell
every reporter in town why.

838
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,929
Then you may as well add insubordination
to your list of bullshit allegations.

839
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,095
<i>You want any paperwork signed,</i>
<i>you send it to my office.</i>

840
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,299
- I'll have the City Attorney take a look at it.
- Fine.

841
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,308
I'm chairman
of the police committee.

842
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,810
This is a fight you don't want.

843
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,711
I didn't want any of it.

844
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,716
But I'm here...

845
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,015
and I'm staying.

846
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,286
Corrine, call me.

847
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,826
Kavanaugh's upstairs with Aceveda.
What the hell's going on?

848
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,828
It's almost 8:00
and he's still at it.

849
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,162
What do we do?
Just leave for the night?

850
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,634
