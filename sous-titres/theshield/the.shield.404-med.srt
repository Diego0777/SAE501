1
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:00,105
[Aceveda]
The police department can change...

2
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,149
but trust me,
it's not gonna happen from the inside.

3
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,219
Well, what's that have to do
with the city council?

4
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,880
These property seizures are targeting
my constituents now, someday, yours too.

5
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,427
- That's not our problem?
- You just started, David. Take a breath.

6
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:15,825
Give yourself a chance
to get settled in.

7
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,490
[Aceveda] This policy's led
to increased corruption in other cities.

8
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,093
Locals fighting for profits,
rises in police brutality complaints.

9
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:25,866
- What do you want, exactly?
- A leadership position
on the police committee.

10
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:29,875
/ can steer policy, protect
the council's interests. Look, Bill.

11
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:33,538
/ know how it works there.
/ know what needs to be done.

12
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,843
I just need the authority
to do it.

13
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,510
[Bill] That's what the other
councilmen are afraid of.

14
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,555
They think you might try
to shove something down their throat.

15
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,284
That won't happen.

16
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,919
/t's how / can serve best.

17
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,622
/tjust makes sense.

18
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,308
I got it.

19
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:11,150
Thanks.

20
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:15,279
- I'm Sara.
- David.

21
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,357
You mind?

22
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:23,920
Havin' a good time?

23
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:27,023
Just making an effort
to meet people.

24
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,796
But I don't remember
seeing you in here before.

25
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:32,668
But your friend looked familiar.

26
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:35,799
I hope, for his wife's sake,
he wasn't a john.

27
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:42,339
You're a cop.

28
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,051
I need to get
my radar checked.

29
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,485
How's business?

30
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,387
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:54,552
Look, I'm just here to have a cigarette,
not to make an arrest.

32
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,899
So where you from?

33
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,664
Phoenix.

34
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:07,297
- Been here long?
- No.

35
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,569
Just came out.

36
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:11,577
I like it though.

37
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,904
There's a lot to like.

38
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,613
It's nice to meet you, David.

39
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:42,134
You been on vacation, or are you
just workin'on white people's time?

40
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,143
Where the hell is Antwon?

41
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:47,146
Every cop with a Kodak is hasslin'
brothers, seizin' cars and shit.

42
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,443
- Antwon's shit.
- So?

43
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,212
So you best remember why you here.
Antwon ain't posin'for no po-po.

44
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,550
I told you last time.
I don't deal with scrubs.

45
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:59,683
Andjust so we're clear, /'m the one
that's supposed to be getting tips.

46
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:04,493
You're a week behind.
So you tell Antwon to come back himself.

47
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:07,499
- And don't forget to bring me gifts.
- You trippin'? Huh?

48
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,126
Or you forget just how much
you up in for Antwon?

49
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,536
'Cause itjust takes one anonymous call
to 911. You feel me?

50
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:18,072
- Oh, yeah, I feel you.
- You better figure out
how to stop the bleedin...

51
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:20,773
or I'm gonna have to drop
a dime on your ass.

52
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:27,545
One second.
Come here.

53
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:31,352
We'll work this out.

54
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,053
He's gonna drop a dime?
Are we involved in some shit...

55
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,062
beyond hookers
that I don't know about?

56
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,064
This is just a little
quid pro quo thing...

57
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,066
only Antwon's a little
slow on the quo.

58
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:45,195
Hey, this is not a big deal. These guys
always try this once to see if they can own you.

59
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:49,299
As long as we handle this right,
there's not a problem.

60
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,277
So you just sit
on the other guy, okay?

61
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,007
All right? Okay.

62
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:57,242
I think I might have
come up with something.

63
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:59,751
- My nigga.
- [Army] Hey! Hey!

64
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,754
Step back, asshole.

65
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:05,053
[Groaning]

66
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:09,061
You gonna drop
a dime on us? Huh?

67
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,765
- [Grunting]
- [Groaning]

68
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,902
Whatcha got in here?

69
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:29,915
Come here.
Hit him.

70
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,679
Do it, asshole!

71
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:36,517
- No.
- I told you to do something, you dumbshit!

72
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:46,222
Harder. Harder.

73
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,233
I thought you two were tight.

74
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,303
[Chuckles]

75
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:57,969
You know what?
Tell Antwon there's a new scoop law.

76
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,672
Come pick up his dog shit.

77
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,316
It's, uh, safer
if we talk out here.

78
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,888
Whatever. Listen,
/ need you to look at a guy.

79
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,480
A drug dealer named
Maurice Webster.

80
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:13,787
Claudette and I don't
usually handle drug cases.

81
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:17,091
From what you've been telling me,
it's a step up.

82
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:20,098
- I should write this down.
- Stop. I'll send over the file.
Get it from your captain.

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,727
This is all we have to do to make things
straight with us and the D.A. again?

84
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:25,737
No. But it's a start.

85
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,774
Now, my source says
that Maurice is a major player.

86
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:32,107
See what you and
your partner can whip up.

87
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,112
Hey.

88
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:36,876
Hey, we've gotta go.
The Realtor's inside.

89
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,884
- She's taking her sweet time.
- They're interested.

90
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,352
Gretchen thinks they're
gonna make us an offer.

91
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:44,686
Why does Mom have to move?

92
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:48,853
We talked about that, Cassidy.
/ want to.

93
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:53,627
What about my friends...
when I'm here?

94
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,668
Can / go to my room?

95
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,170
- We have to go while they're here.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

96
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:02,572
- Hold on. Yeah.
- [Mouthing Words]

97
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:05,873
I'll hold.

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,416
- All my stuff is in my room.
- No one's gonna touch your things.

99
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,178
[Sighs]
All right, /'ll be there.

100
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,311
I gotta go to work.
Give me a kiss.

101
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,085
[Sighs]
All right, let's get out of their way.

102
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,697
I appreciate the call,
but rape's not usually my thing.

103
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,431
Fugitive recovery is.

104
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,666
Oscar Ruiz was at
the courthouse this morning...

105
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:37,073
for a prelim on his three
sexual assault charges.

106
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:39,338
They think he found
an unlocked window.

107
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,346
[Mackey]
Picked the wrong guy to let escape.

108
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:43,348
They figure he got loose
around 7:30.

109
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,975
We didn't hear about it
until 9:30 after he raped again.

110
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,112
[Man] Myrna, are you there?
You said it was an emergency.

111
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:51,123
- [Myrna]Joe-
- Yeah? Yeah, what's wrong?

112
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,921
- / slept with him.
- What? What are you talking about?

113
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,895
- / sucked his dick, and then
he did me from behind.
- What the hell's going on?

114
00:07:56,997 --> 00:08:01,866
He's better than you are.
He's a real man, not a pussy like you.

115
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,437
- Myrna- Myrna, is somebody there?
- He's so big.

116
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:07,473
- Who's there, Myrna?
- He's the best / ever had.

117
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,474
Myrna, is he
making you say this?

118
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:13,876
/ want him to do it to me
again in the ass... while you listen.

119
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,745
- Myrna, /'m calling the police.
/'m on my way home.
- [Myrna Sobbing]

120
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,841
[Machine Beeps]

121
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,221
Wanna get this guy?

122
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,291
Yeah.

123
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:29,453
[Rock]

124
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:31,463
[Men, Women Chattering]

125
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:34,534
[Ends]

126
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,903
[Dutch] Oscar Ruiz,
the stay-at-home rapist.

127
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:43,408
Forcing his victims to call the husband
or the boyfriend was his standard M.O.

128
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,535
Puts a neat little spin
on things.

129
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,546
Come for the rape,
stay for the humiliation.

130
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:50,276
- That's a list of his friends and acquaintances.
- Anyone interesting?

131
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,909
- He's got a fiancée living in Farmington.
- Talk to her.

132
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,821
So Ruiz left the rape scene at 9:15 with
a handgun and clothes from their closet.

133
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,587
That makes two hours
since anyone's heard from him.

134
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:02,628
A smart guy would run as far
and as fast as he could.

135
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,663
But he raped again
right out of the box.

136
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:07,256
Which means he knows we'll catch him.
He's gonna binge until we do.

137
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,799
Ruiz poses as
a flower shop delivery guy.

138
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:16,000
Then he forces his way in.
I'll get his pictures to the shop owners.

139
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,977
Then I'll talk to his roommate.
"Stay-at-home rapist"?

140
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,047
It's just something I coined.

141
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:24,140
Well, the women stay at home.
This guy goes out and rapes.

142
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,048
Nicknames are meant
to be catchy, not literal.

143
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,212
You want us to throw in on Ruiz?

144
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,290
[Monica]
No, Vic's got it.

145
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:38,025
I'm Captain Rawling.
This is Detective Mackey.

146
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:41,295
- Emily, right?
- Yeah- Emily Mischner.

147
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,859
Thank you for coming in.
I apologize for what happened.

148
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:48,464
We can put you in a department
safe house until this is resolved.

149
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,475
Until what's resolved?

150
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:54,310
Why am I here?

151
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:58,350
Oscar Ruiz escaped
from sheriff! s custody this morning.

152
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:02,821
Oh, my God. That's what
the commotion at court was about?

153
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:07,860
We're gonna find him. But
you shouldn't go home alone until we do.

154
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:12,864
I have been alone. I went home
right after they delayed that hearing.

155
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:16,595
He already raped me once.
Why didn't somebody here tell me?

156
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,332
The sheriff s department thought they
had him contained in a downtown area.

157
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,466
/t took a couple ofhours before they
realized that he had gotten past them.

158
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:30,113
- So he's out there?
- We have a lot of resources
dedicated to this thing.

159
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:33,345
/n the meantime, a couple of officers
could take you home...

160
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,921
and stand guard.

161
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:40,926
l- I'd, um-
I'd rather stay here...

162
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:43,292
until you catch him.

163
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:49,330
Yo. You seen this guy?

164
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,734
- You are Blinky, right?
- In here, I'm Felix. What's goin' on?

165
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,776
Oscar Ruiz, your roommate?

166
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:59,778
He's in prison.

167
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,280
- He got escaped.
- No shit?

168
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:05,442
So you don't know that he raped
another woman this morning either?

169
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:08,715
- What?
- They were about to lay
a life sentence on this prick.

170
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:11,655
You know what they're gonna do to you
when they find out you helped him escape?

171
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,885
Yo, I didn't help him escape.
All right?

172
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:17,157
I didn't even know he was out
till he showed up this morning.

173
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,164
When did he get here?

174
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,530
Hey, he was out back
when I got here to work.

175
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:25,127
Look, he said he was innocent, so / gave
him a few dollars to get to Mexico, and-

176
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,139
l-I just wanted him gone.

177
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,300
He didn't go to Tijuana.
He went out and raped another woman.

178
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:32,742
He used your money to buy the flowers
that got him in the front door.

179
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:35,838
Does he know how
to get into your apartment?

180
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,849
He knows where
I keep the spare key.

181
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,976
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- Save it.

182
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:45,081
I'm gonna park your ass right here with
an officer in case Ruiz shows up again.

183
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:50,689
Antwon Mitchell...

184
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,493
as I live and breathe.

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,500
Run on inside, kids.

186
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,571
Man, you got to be crazy
showin'your face around here...

187
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,573
especially after that shit
you pulled last night.

188
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:04,337
/ didn't wanna play hard,
but your boy was threatening to own us.

189
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:09,472
The question is,
what's next for us?

190
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:13,547
Halpern was out of line.

191
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:15,849
That shit
won't happen again.

192
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:18,857
That's not good enough, partner.

193
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,793
I don't know if you got a hard-on for jail
or you just like pissin' off cops...

194
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:28,061
but me and my boy are lookin' at the door
on this unless you convince me otherwise.

195
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,667
Come on.
Shit on 'em, man.

196
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:37,568
Hey, don't go sideways on me.

197
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,872
Paid in full...

198
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,850
with a little extra
to make everything all right.

199
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:48,785
Okay, player?

200
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,050
Good.

201
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,058
But I like makin' busts too.

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Just step up the tips. I'll make sure
you get by same as before.

203
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:58,964
Hey, things ain't the same
as before, man.

204
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,694
We got these cops comin'
after us like storm troopers.

205
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:03,963
Well, I'm your Luke Skywalker.

206
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:08,064
The seizures-
I'm close to the cop who's runnin' it.

207
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,843
How close you to him?

208
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:14,812
I'm as close
as I need to be.

209
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:20,643
- Okay. Get at me then.
- Uh-uh.

210
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:23,086
You gotta bring me
some news I can use.

211
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,626
Then the clock starts runnin'
on your protection.

212
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:38,993
- Hey, Captain. Back already?
- City business.

213
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:44,944
A multiple rapist walked out of the courthouse
this morning, attacked another woman.

214
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,036
- I need to reschedule.
- Anything I can do?

215
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,547
No.
Sorry to inconvenience you.

216
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,209
A lot of people have been talking to me
about these police seizures.

217
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:55,379
I think we should talk today.
It's important.

218
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,889
- Can you wait a few minutes?
- Yeah, a few.

219
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,960
Beth /nsardi just called. There's a drug dealer
they wanna make a case against.

220
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,222
She specifically asked
for the two of you.

221
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,031
- Really?
- You sure she meant us?
Must be the bottom of the barrel.

222
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:06,521
- Really?
- You sure she meant us?
Must be the bottom of the barrel.

223
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,760
Doesn't sound it.
His name is Maurice Webster.

224
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,803
He's a big dope fish
in our little pond.

225
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:14,067
- So try to wrap a net around him.
- [Claudette] Drug sting.

226
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:17,234
- Isn't that more Vic's rhythm?
- Vic's busy.

227
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:20,643
So I'd take whatever olive branch
the D.A.'s offering.

228
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:23,113
Beth says there's a time issue,
so don't waste any.

229
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:29,487
Maybe they're ready to take
the leash off, huh?

230
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,116
His picture's out there- flower shops,
supermarkets, even the on-ramp slingers.

231
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:36,059
- [Mackey] Anything on the fiancée?
- No, nothing.

232
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:39,257
All right, gather around.
This is Ruiz's old apartment.

233
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,266
We'll start from here
and spread out.

234
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:44,166
Let's hope he's feeling homesick.
Let's go.

235
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:49,203
Hey, any luck
on your rapist?

236
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,938
Yeah- all his.
You got something to run by me?

237
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:56,243
I just found a crack
in Antwon Mitchell's family seal.

238
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:58,874
His oldest son, Donald ///,
has been movin'fake /.D. 's...

239
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,283
out of the back of his van
in the D.M.V. parking lot.

240
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:04,050
I thought Antwon kept
all of his kids straight.

241
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:06,182
This one dumped private school
for the family business.

242
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:11,791
I, uh- Do me a favor.
Don't move on this punk for a day or two.

243
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:15,197
- Why not?
- I gotta test a theory.

244
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,066
Someone just spotted Ruiz.
Seventh and Vermont.

245
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:27,504
So, about the seizures?

246
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:30,048
I understand coming on strong
in the beginning to set a tone...

247
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,608
but maybe
you're pushing too hard.

248
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,417
- You have a suggestion?
- Reach out to the community.
Visit some churches...

249
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:39,424
community watch programs.

250
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:41,517
Put on a friendly face.

251
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:43,528
If these people don't know you,
they won't trust you.

252
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,621
When they see us pulling
bangers off their corners...

253
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:47,825
I think they'll give us
a second look.

254
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:51,233
And what they'll see
is you targeting blacks and Latinos.

255
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,806
That's who's here.
We target the criminals.

256
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:57,274
Most of their victims are black and Latino.
They're smart enough to know the difference.

257
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:59,971
I'm not trying to kill it.
Maybe with some modifications...

258
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,516
this plan could be a little more
civilian-friendly, that's all.

259
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:08,054
- This coming from a councilman
or a police captain?
- Both.

260
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:10,918
And you should know
there's a chance that...

261
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:13,686
I could be overseeing these seizures
on the police committee.

262
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:16,455
We don't answer to
the police committee on this.

263
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,554
- Not yet.
- [Phone Ringing]

264
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,870
- Yeah.
- [Mackey] We just missed him.

265
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:29,032
- What happened?
- Flower shop owner saw him, called it in.

266
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:31,042
- We missed him by five minutes.
- What do you need?

267
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:34,841
As many bodies as you can spare.
/ gotta blanket the area.

268
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:37,678
Okay. Excuse me.

269
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,982
[Julien]
Raga's who our boss is interested in.

270
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,387
Sees the tag in a dozen places
on her way in to work.

271
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,426
He's the main tagger
for the One-niners.

272
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:51,793
"Raga Paints." "P" is for "Po Boys,"
"ain't," "S" stands for "shit."

273
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:54,765
"Po Boys ain't shit."
Cute.

274
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:57,769
So does this have anything to do
with the, uh, territory being disputed?

275
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:01,705
This is the front line,
which is why Raga keeps hitting this sign.

276
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:05,437
Raga just gets the word out. But if we can
get him, we can find who's giving the orders.

277
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:09,276
Look for hoodies or skullies,
and a backpack to carry the paints.

278
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:13,182
I've been trying to get you guys onto
taggers for a long time. What changed?

279
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:17,154
We got a new captain. So what's the chance
of this guy hittin'again tonight?

280
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:20,283
Sometimes, it's hard to tell if ours is
even dried before they're taggin' over it.

281
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,953
- [Woman On Radio] Possible man down.
- That's us. Thanks.

282
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,097
- Have you looked at his file?
- Glanced at it.

283
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,933
- A 60-year-old drug dealer
that's never been arrested?
- Late bloomer?

284
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,337
- There's a possession charge in '89.
- A citation.

285
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:38,900
We've got unis staking out a guy
who got a ticket for having a joint.

286
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,879
- Maybe he's careful.
- You said he was a late bloomer.

287
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,007
- The D.A. says he's important.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:47,018
- I think they're tryin' to jerk us off.
- They requested us.

289
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,385
Because everybody else
is out huntin' a rapist.

290
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,187
Take yes for an answer?
Please?

291
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,257
Ruiz ran out of here
less than 20 minutes ago.

292
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,496
- Where do you want us?
- Start a couple of blocks up
and work your way north.

293
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:08,370
- Okay.
- Hey, Vic. Ruiz just called his fiancée.

294
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:11,569
- She tipped him the cops were there.
- Tell me we got a trace.

295
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:21,083
[Man]
They're gonna take care of you.

296
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,087
I need you with me.

297
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,352
I'll be right behind you.
I promise.

298
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:34,863
- [Yelling, Clattering]
- [Danny] Sir, come on.

299
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,868
- Calm down.
- It's his house.

300
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,870
[Yelling]

301
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,133
[Yelling, Sobbing]

302
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,512
Neighborhood canvass
came up empty.

303
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:59,592
- He's got family in Fresno.
- Unis are at the train and bus stations.

304
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:02,457
- What's your next move?
- I'm on the fiancée and the friend.

305
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:05,588
And we're gonna expand
the neighborhood search.

306
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,929
Ruiz didn't sling.
He wasn't a member of a gang.

307
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:09,934
Maybe you should talk to Dutch.

308
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:13,665
He's a little more plugged in
to this guy's psychology than you are.

309
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,401
[Sighs]
It's time to get creative.

310
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:20,869
- [Rap]
- [Whistles] Five-O!

311
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,610
Suvuto. How'd you and your thorns
like to play deputy for a day?

312
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,653
God's work
ain't cop's work, homey.

313
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,688
I thinkJesus'll
loan you out for this one.

314
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:35,091
- [Ronnie] Name's Oscar Ruiz.
- He who persecutes my brother
persecutes me.

315
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,720
Yeah? How about he who rapes
my mother or my sister?

316
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:41,858
At least five that we know about.
After he's done...

317
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:45,699
he makes them call their husband or
their boyfriend, tell 'em how good he was.

318
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:49,104
Ruiz escaped
from your hood this morning.

319
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:51,109
- We'll check it out.
- Good.

320
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,408
Look for flowers. He poses as
a delivery guy to get in the house.

321
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:58,280
- All right, homes.
- Someone sees him, I want a call.

322
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:02,013
Hey. Aren't you gonna
swear us all in?

323
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:06,115
Blessed is he who delivers
this asshole unto me.

324
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:14,191
- What do you got, Carl?
- Pulled him over for rolling a stop sign.

325
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,030
- Barely. I mean, come on.
- Hey, somebody tell you to talk?

326
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,401
When he opened the window,
I noticed a strong marijuana odor...

327
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:21,599
emanating from
inside the vehicle.

328
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,506
- Which gave you probable cause to search.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:28,172
- We found these.
- Good work, Officers.

330
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,214
Don't you have
anything more important to do?

331
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,052
I'm sorry you don't think buying illegal drugs
is important. Fortunately, the courts do.

332
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:41,286
Have you heard about the asset seizures
we've been doing around here?

333
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:44,056
We caught you with illegal drugs.
That means we can take your car.

334
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:47,065
We find any weed in your house,
you can kiss that good-bye too.

335
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,226
- You can't do that.
- Watch us.

336
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,270
- He's not lying.
- Have you ever been to prison?

337
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,499
- Have you, Slick?
- Of course not.

338
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,337
Forty years old. You really wanna
start down that road now?

339
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,105
Look, it was just a couple
of reefer sticks. Come on.

340
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,238
You've got one chance
to help yourself.

341
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:06,375
After that, it's out of my hands.
Now who's your dealer?

342
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,846
Maurice. But he's not a dealer.
He's just a friend.

343
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,322
Hooks me up.

344
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:15,326
Got a few plants in his backyard.
Enough for him and a few others.

345
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:20,626
- Three plants in his backyard?
- Well, that's just his version.

346
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,099
The D.A.'s office is trying
to make us look like idiots.

347
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:26,195
- Why would they do that?
- Somebody is lying to somebody.

348
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:29,332
- Right now, Slick's the only person I believe.
- How was the interview?

349
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:32,411
Oh, our major drug dealer
is looking a little minor.

350
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:34,878
Slick's ready to cooperate.

351
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,040
If the D.A.'s willing to pull
you two out of mothballs...

352
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,050
there's plenty
I could use you for.

353
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:41,052
- Vic talk to you yet?
- No.

354
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:43,247
He will.

355
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:48,218
Ooh. Crushing crime
one blunt at a time.

356
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,792
Find what you need?

357
00:21:56,903 --> 00:22:00,805
I've been meeting with people
about staff jobs for my district office.

358
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:04,843
- / was just checking records.
- Resources are for law enforcement personnel.

359
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:08,345
Well, I'm a reservist,
so technically I am personnel.

360
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,712
Fell short of your
10-year pension, did ya?

361
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,944
Being a cop
gets in your blood.

362
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,452
So does being a politician
from what I hear.

363
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,921
If I can stay connected to the force
a couple of nights a month...

364
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,458
then I'm happy to serve.

365
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:24,226
I need some fresh air.

366
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,065
The effectiveness and fairness
of these seizures aside...

367
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,103
you're doing a bad job
selling them.

368
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,105
And you'd like
to be my publicist?

369
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:37,938
Forcing property forfeitures and asset seizures
on a community that's already decimated?

370
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:40,376
That's the current spin.

371
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,109
If this is about council getting a cut
of seized property, it's not my area.

372
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,549
I'm just making
a suggestion.

373
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:49,986
I've been where you are, and
I've learned there's always a compromise.

374
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:53,581
The policy
still needs time to breathe.

375
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,593
If I set up
a public forum...

376
00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:59,028
where you can present your plan,
answer questions, will you come?

377
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:03,131
Sure.

378
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:10,275
You want a tip?
Well, I got one for you.

379
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:13,243
Heard about some eses
runnin' some wetbacks over the border.

380
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:16,338
I can eat lunch downtown, trip over
one or two on my way in the door.

381
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:20,579
Shit. My mom's got half a dozen
sleepin'in the back room any given night.

382
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,781
Yeah, well, these Mexicans,
they check in, they don't check out.

383
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,484
What does that mean?

384
00:23:26,592 --> 00:23:31,996
They gotta find a family member
willing to pay a five grand relocation fee.

385
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,733
I got some credit now?

386
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:38,133
Yeah...

387
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:40,933
if the check clears.

388
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:49,208
Hey!
I heard about that rapist.

389
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:51,749
- Think you're close?
- I could use a break.

390
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:54,718
- What are you into?
- Got a line on a coyote farm.

391
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:56,914
We're gettin' ready to move.
Thought you might wanna hop on.

392
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:59,321
I could use a break,
not charity.

393
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,917
Peace offering, that's all.

394
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,227
You remember Shane Vendrell. He's got
something brewin' in our backyard.

395
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,393
Got word on a coyote farm,
hopin' maybe you could give us some backup.

396
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:14,303
- They're housing illegal aliens?
- Until the family can pay to spring 'em.

397
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,706
Just when they think they're free and clear,
boom, the final bill comes due.

398
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,142
All my officers
are tied up chasing Ruiz.

399
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,680
- So I guess we're on our own.
- Let me, uh-

400
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:24,943
Let me know when you're in position,
see what I can spare.

401
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:27,315
Thank you.

402
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,914
- Uh, so how's the hunt?
- I got some things worth looking into.

403
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,925
Well, look what the rat dragged in.

404
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:39,492
Uh- He's got a line on somethin'.

405
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,935
Some One-niner droppin'
stolen air bags at a garage on Third.

406
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,768
Think I'll cut out the back.

407
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,849
- So, what's going on with Webster?
- You tell me.

408
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:03,148
Are you saying
you don't have anything yet?

409
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:06,692
No. We hear he's got three
marijuana plants in his backyard.

410
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:09,284
Oh, well,
three is enough for us.

411
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:11,295
You said he was
a major drug dealer.

412
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:13,865
- He's selling drugs, isn't he?
- What aren't you telling me?

413
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:16,764
I'm not gonna push this
any further.

414
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:22,498
Webster's about to testify
for the defense in a murder trial...

415
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,076
and we'd like to
undermine his credibility.

416
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:29,342
You had us target a guy
to keep him off the witness stand?

417
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:31,349
That's bullshit!

418
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,851
You wanted out of the doghouse, remember?
You came to me.

419
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:36,353
And you knew if you laid it out for me,
I wouldn't go for it.

420
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,356
- It's not illegal.
- What? Just immoral?

421
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,689
- Not the way I see things.
- My partner doesn't like the smell of it.

422
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:44,558
Well, fortunately,
you promised to keep her under control.

423
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:48,156
But if you don't like the way
the deal is anymore...

424
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:50,758
we can go back
to the way things were.

425
00:25:57,243 --> 00:25:59,837
- So you'll go under with Slick, right?
- Do me a favor.

426
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:02,005
- Get somebody else.
- It's our case.

427
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:06,108
- Well, I'd rather not.
- Well, that's great.

428
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:08,119
That's fantastic.

429
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:11,122
Hey. Hey, don't you
walk away from me...

430
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:15,854
not after /'ve had your back
every day for the last six months.

431
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:22,701
Look.

432
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:27,462
This is our way
to get back into the rotation.

433
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:31,976
He'll never buy me in this world.
It has to be you.

434
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:38,846
- [Yelling, Shouting]
- Get on the sidewalk, now!

435
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:41,078
[Julien]
Back off! Hey.

436
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:43,280
Drop it!

437
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:47,086
- [Mackey] Holy shit.
- [Honking Horn]

438
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:49,218
Back off!

439
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,229
They think it's the guy.
They just started chasing him. He called 911.

440
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:54,697
Hey, hey, back off!

441
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,064
Back off!

442
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,163
He's not the rapist!
He's Chinese, for Christ's sake!

443
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,832
[Siren Wailing]

444
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:04,933
What's wrong with you people?

445
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,649
Hey, what happened
to callin'me first?

446
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,650
They thought they got him.
They got excited.

447
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,346
If he's a Chinaman
driving an actual floral truck...

448
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:19,891
then feel free to assume
he's not our escaped, Hispanic rapist!

449
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:22,187
Hey, all you said
was flowers, man.

450
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,957
I asked for eyes on the street,
not a lynch mob.

451
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:29,262
And trust me, you find him,
he won't enjoy the process.

452
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,359
For Christ's sake!

453
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,836
What happened?

454
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,534
Ah, runnin' down Ruiz
has everyone a little on edge.

455
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:40,305
On edge? You put
a street gang on payroll?

456
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:45,112
Look, I was just goin' for intel. These guys
follow the messiah, not Suge Knight.

457
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:47,118
We're lucky
they didn't kill him.

458
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,350
/t's under control.
/ got the genie back in the bottle.

459
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,891
Maybe you should've asked the genie
for three wishes. About as realistic...

460
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:56,427
as expecting a street gang
to do your policing for you.

461
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,997
- Yeah, I get it.
- Are you gonna burn me, Vic?

462
00:27:59,098 --> 00:28:01,862
No. I'm gonna catch this guy.

463
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:04,664
A lot of people warned me about using you.
Maybe I should've listened.

464
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:10,208
You told me to get creative.
That doesn't always go smoothly.

465
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,541
She's been sitting there all day
because she's afraid to go home.

466
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:17,207
Talk to Dutch?

467
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,363
Enjoy the show?

468
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:35,866
Deputizing vigilantes.
I gotta write that one down.

469
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,734
Yeah, well, the point is to find
this prick before he rapes again...

470
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,364
which is the only reason
I'd ask your opinion.

471
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:46,177
- Shoot.
- Ruiz had a roommate.

472
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,146
- He got a hundred bucks off of him.
- Worked once, it can work twice.

473
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:52,411
I'm on him.
You know about the fiancée.

474
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:55,214
- No family in town.
- You watchin' the border?

475
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:57,221
I got the street stuff covered.

476
00:28:57,323 --> 00:29:02,022
I need you to drop some profile bullshit
on me, preferably something useful.

477
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,094
He used to rape once
every two or three months.

478
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:10,760
- He's raped twice today already.
As I predicted, he's bingeing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,306
- You're a genius.
- What else does he binge on?

480
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:16,932
At the end of the day
these guys are all loners...

481
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:18,943
and loners become

So what else does he like besides raping?

00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:29,485
Kicking soccer balls, watching
video games, the same porn movie?

He should take
his own advice, right?

651
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:29,206
I got an idea
how to get him back...

652
00:41:29,307 --> 00:41:32,504
for all those sad
Christmas mornings.

653
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:36,274
Back up, man.
I don't like the dude...

654
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:39,782
but I ain't gonna help the
white occupation take him down either.

655
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:46,585
Look, I heard about the garage.
I passed on the info.

656
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:48,591
But I'm not gonna
guarantee these things.

657
00:41:48,693 --> 00:41:50,661
Look, I don't give a shit
about that garage.

658
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:54,220
- Then what in the hell is your problem?
- They busted my son.

659
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:58,697
You hear about that?
Huh?

660
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:01,671
They come around here
lookin' for help when they want it.

661
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:03,798
And then they go
and bust my son?

662
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:08,278
They bust my kid, man!
You think that shit is just bad luck?

663
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:11,781
I'll find out what I can.

664
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:15,410
They're comin' to get me through my blood,
man. That's what this shit is about.

665
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,420
He said he'd look into it.

666
00:42:17,522 --> 00:42:20,184
Well, get it looked into.
'Cause that's what you're here for.

667
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,192
You're startin'to sound
a lot like Halpern.

668
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:26,025
Maybe you're thinking about
droppin' a dime too.

669
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:34,065
It's cool, brother.

670
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:37,107
It's cool.

671
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:39,939
- [Sighs]
- But I thought you said you were
close to the seizures dude.

672
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:43,208
- I will be.
- Right.

673
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,310
Then I'm waitin' on you,
white shadow.

674
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:53,855
You've been holdin'my daughter
all night for a little graffiti?

675
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:56,792
Your daughter tags for one of
the most violent gangs in the city.

676
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,863
Not my daughter.

677
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:03,234
Hi, Mom.

678
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:06,270
So where should we
send the bill?

679
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:08,339

680
00:43:10,642 --> 00:43:13,577

- [Door Closes]

681
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,669
Love that.

682
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:22,045
- So I want back in.
- Really?

683
00:43:22,154 --> 00:43:25,851
Yeah, you're right. With this new captain,
Farm's where the action is.

684
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:28,289
But I'll need Army too.
We come as a package.

685
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:31,954
/ can't promise anything,
but /'ll grease the wheels.

686
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:36,090
Thanks. With that being said,
things are gonna be different now, right?

687
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:41,366
I'll report to you, but I answer to her
just like we talked about.

688
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:48,310
I could probably
make that work.

689

[Door Closes]

690
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:06,792
Beth /nsardi just called. The D.A. wants
the two of you on a fresh double murder.

691
00:44:06,898 --> 00:44:08,832
Great.
Where are the bodies?

692
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,664
/s the D.A. 's office
assigning cases now?

693
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,739
- I expected a smile or two.
- What did we do to deserve this promotion?

694
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,433
I don't catch your meaning.

695
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,442
Exactly whose agenda
were we servicing...

696
00:44:19,544 --> 00:44:21,944
by targeting and rolling
a three-plant drug kingpin?

697
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:25,912
- I'm not aware of any agenda.
- Right.

698
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:29,248
Shane Vendrell?

699
00:44:29,354 --> 00:44:31,549
- The guy who rolled those coyotes.
- Yeah.

700
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:34,216
/ know we're taking on new personnel.
Truth is...

701
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:38,524
I could really use someone like him
workin' the drug angle with these gangs.

702
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,030
He made a nice bust today,
but l-

703
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:43,862
I don't know him very well
other than what's on paper.

704
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:45,869
A lot of that's bad.

705
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:49,270
Aceveda hated Shane as much as he hates me.
That's what that is.

706
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:51,968
Didn't the two of you have
some problems bigger than Aceveda?

707
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:56,605
- Well, brothers fight. Who do you trust more?
- So you're vouching for him?

708
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,844
Yeah.
He's a great cop.

709
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:07,419
Okay.
