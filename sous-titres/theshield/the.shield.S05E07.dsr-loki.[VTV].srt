1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:03,301
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:06,667
You ever suck a dick like
a cell bitch, cop man?

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:11,434
I'm just gonna tell the whole
courtroom what went down with us.

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,734
Convince Juan
to miss his court date.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,700
Took a 40-pound dumbbell to
the back of the head in County.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,034
So Aceveda meets with
Juan and with Antwon.

7
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,101
Antwon gets a deal
and Juan gets killed.

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,934
I get to officially notify
you that Internal Affairs

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,734
is investigating your
famous strike team.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,967
I'm representing
all 4 of these detectives.

11
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:30,633
Vic gave me some cash
in a bag a while ago.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,867
How much?
65,000.

13
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,201
I've got lupus.
I've had it for 15 years.

14
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,934
You guys have a Fatima Gardner
sign in to see you this morning?

15
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,633
Her brother just
reported her missing.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,934
Maybe she started
looking at you funny.

17
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,334
So you killed her
and reported her missing

18
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,600
so you can make yourself
look innocent.

19
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:46,800
No! Don't talk to me
like that!

20
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:50,267
I'll talk to you
any way I goddamn can.

21
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:53,301
You can't arrest me!
And you're not helping me!

22
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:54,633
I'll find her myself!

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,567
Uni says it looks like
rape. His own sister?

24
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,734
It's not Fatima.
You recognize the haircut?

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,067
It looks like I got under
Kleavon's skin after all.

26
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:05,834
Come on! The other division stinks!

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,867
Come on, Lem! One to
tie, two to win it, baby!

28
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,468
This guy's pitching is as
bad as his arrest record.

29
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:14,401
Let's go!

30
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,301
Strike.

31
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:30,834
This is it!
This is it!

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,067
Here we go, Lem!

33
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,934
Big swing! Big swing!

34
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,800
Way to go!

35
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,368
Down! Down!

36
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,500
Safe!

37
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,101
Hey! There's no
contact allowed.

38
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,334
This is C-plus league softball,
for god's sake!

39
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,667
Oh, I tripped.

40
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,867
Bullshit! You gotta
call him out, Billy.

41
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,800
Will you guys calm down!
That's bullshit!

42
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,368
Cheap shot.

43
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,667
You know what?
You win some, you win some.

44
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:15,667
This ain't over!
Game's still tied, 6-6.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,134
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Back off!

46
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,934
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

47
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,334
If olympic division calls,

48
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,600
you tell them to shove it
up their ass!

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,900
Actually, Paul Reyes did
just call from olympic.

50
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,533
Is he still complaining
about the game?

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
That is a sore loser.

52
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,001
Let's call him back
and tell him

53
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,067
and tell him to shove it
up his ass times two.

54
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,034
Times two.

55
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,368
I think he wants
your help on a case.

56
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,401
Oh, sure. Tell him
I'll get right on it.

57
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,767
You know, Reyes is heading
up that citywide task force.

58
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,700
Maybe you better
give him a call.

59
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:53,834
All right.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Where's Sofer?
She called in sick...

61
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,167
and I can't do
her job and mine.

62
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,101
Goddammit!

63
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,934
I knew that baby
was gonna screw me.

64
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,167
Gardocki!
Got a minute?

65
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,934
No, he doesn't. I need him
for a special assignment.

66
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,234
I'm sure I can get him
freed up for an hour.

67
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,368
Who should I call?

68
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,401
Why don't you tickle
your balls on your own time?

69
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,468
I'll see you
in my office.

70
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,134
Not until his lawyer
gets down here.

71
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,567
Tell her to hurry.

72
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,567
We'll do that.

73
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm gonna feel him out,

74
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,800
then maybe spring
Fatima's visit,

75
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:22,967
his missing death kit
on him,

76
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,134
look for a crack.

77
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:26,434
Actually, I'm gonna
go at him alone.

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,034
That's not your
decision.

79
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:32,034
It was his the minute he cut Pauline
Wahler's hair to look like mine.

80
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:34,800
Ok. Ok. Ok, good. Good.
He knows how I operate.

81
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,334
He thinks he's got
a bead on me.

82
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,734
You'll come at him
from a new angle.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,067
I'm gonna watch on the
monitor, develop a game plan.

84
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:41,468
If you want me to jump in,

85
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,867
ask him if he wants you to
turn down the air conditioning.

86
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,301
It's a code.

87
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:06,201
Between San Antonio and here,

88
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,434
you've killed at least
8 women,

89
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,001
including one last night.

90
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,767
Your sister's missing
24 hours.

91
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,301
We think you
killed her, too.

92
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,734
Let's start talking.

93
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,201
If you're looking
for a rematch,

94
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,700
I left my cleats
back at the barn.

95
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,468
He left half his skin
on the dirt.

96
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,001
Unless it's the post-game
activities you're looking to finish.

97
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,667
You guys cheated us fair and
square. We'll get you next year.

98
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:29,867
Since when are you guys good losers?

99
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,800
Since I got the news my
task force was expanding.

100
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,734
I was thinking of offering
your team the new slot.

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,667
I hear the barn's
a sinking ship.

102
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,034
We could have discussed this over
a couple beers just as easily.

103
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,434
I was going to
after the game.

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,967
Didn't get the chance.

105
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,468
Figure we'd talk over
a couple bodies,

106
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,500
give me a chance
to see you in action.

107
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,167
I don't know
if you heard, uh...

108
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:52,967
I.A.D.'s had a wild hair
up their ass about us.

109
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,934
I've tangled with those
bastards a couple times.

110
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,867
It just means you're
getting shit done.

111
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:59,800
When this case is over,
we'll get those beers.

112
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,700
Hell, I'll even buy.
Let's go.

113
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:03,667
How old?

114
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,267
She was 2, maybe 3.

115
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:09,700
House belongs to
Maurizio Ochoa.

116
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,734
The dead woman's his
girlfriend, Jenny Rayball.

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,401
Shot 15 times.

118
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,567
We've picked up Ochoa
before. Deals meth.

119
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,800
Little girls name
was Violet.

120
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:18,934
Didn't Ochoa
get popped once

121
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,067
for busting up
his girlfriend?

122
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,600
Couple times.
Broke her jaw 6 months ago.

123
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,401
That sounds like
the crank talking.

124
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,867
Let me guess.

125
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:34,800
He took his stash
with him on the way out.

126
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,067
Ochoa hooked up with
a mexican cartel guy in Chino.

127
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,334
Convinced him he had
the chops to handle weight.

128
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,434
We've been set up
on Ochoa for 3 months.

129
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,767
Had our guy in place
to make the buy,

130
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,267
just waiting for
the word.

131
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,600
So, even if Ochoa didn't
do this, his business did.

132
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,800
He could be a rival slanger.

133
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,800
Either way, shot 15
times, it was personal.

134
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,368
We got to track down
Ochoa.

135
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,334
If he sticks his head up,
we'll be there to whack it.

136
00:05:55,401 --> 00:06:00,201
We think he's sitting on a
hundred pounds of meth... to sell.

137
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:05,001
I looked into
your finances.

138
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,034
You know what I found?

139
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,567
Yeah. Nothing unusual.

140
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:15,301
How did you manage to hide
your dirty money so well, huh?

141
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:19,434
The only money that I get
is from my weekly paycheck.

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,001
You trying to tell me that you never
took just a little bit off the side?

143
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,734
Why don't you provide
some proof

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,867
before you accuse him
of a crime?

145
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:29,067
Ronnie, you got
an idea

146
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:32,700
where Mackey came up
with $65,000 in cash?

147
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,800
Don't answer that.

148
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,667
You said
you wanted some proof.

149
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,034
I think you're bullshitting.

150
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:41,600
Vendrell, he's got money he
can't account for, either,

151
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,468
which means
one of two things.

152
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,700
Either these guys don't
include you in their bounty,

153
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,468
which should
piss you off,

154
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:55,734
or you're the one guy who's
bright enough not to leave a trail.

155
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,101
Which one is it?

156
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,134
You just said you checked my
records and you didn't find anything.

157
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:06,600
And I don't keep track of how the
other guys balance their checkbooks.

158
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,700
Hmm. One lawyer
for 4 guys.

159
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,667
Who's looking out
for your interests?

160
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:12,900
Because from what I see,

161
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,101
she seems to be
more concerned

162
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,101
with steering the
conversation away from Mackey.

163
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,934
Who hired her
in the first place?

164
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,834
Because she's certainly not
looking out for your interests.

165
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,700
Let's go.

166
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:22,900
My client
is cooperating.

167
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,334
He's willing to answer any questions.

168
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,734
If you have another one,
you let us know.

169
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,101
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,134
Ronnie. Ronnie,
you've been disciplined.

171
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,167
You've been careful.

172
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,567
But not them.

173
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,500
They're gonna
screw this up.

174
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,101
They're gonna
bring you down

175
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,934
for a mistake that you
were too smart to make.

176
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:44,434
That's it.
Let's go.

177
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,700
We're gonna pick this up
later, ok?

178
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,800
How'd it go
with Kavanaugh?

179
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:55,401
He asked me if I knew where
you came up with $65,000 cash.

180
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,900
65? Exactly?
Yeah.

181
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,334
They've been going through our
financial records, all of them.

182
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:02,867
He said this in front of Becca? Yeah.

183
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,533
What did you do with your
share of the money train cash?

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,934
I gave it to Corrine
for the kids.

185
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,167
So then she gave you up
to Kavanaugh.

186
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,134
What else could it be?

187
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,368
You said she wasn't
calling you back.

188
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,800
Look, I'll get
into it.

189
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,401
Tell me another way he could
have known the exact number.

190
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:16,667
That's gonna look
great at trial.

191
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,834
Your ex-wife on the stand
talking about dirty money

192
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,934
we stole from
the armenian mob.

193
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,134
She doesn't know
how we got it,

194
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,267
and she's never testifying
against me in court.

195
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:29,767
Now let's go find Ochoa before he
dumps these drugs on the street.

196
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,755
MAN INSIDE

197
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:39,900
Yeah?

198
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,900
We're looking for
Maurizio Ochoa.

199
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:42,934
What for?

200
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,134
He won the lottery.

201
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,334
We're here to give him
a check.

202
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,368
Face down
like your little girl.

203
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:17,067
Just sorry I can't put
a bullet in your head.

204
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:19,201
Get up. Get up!

205
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,967
Fatima came to us.
Brought us this.

206
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,267
Whose blood is that?

207
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,401
It's not my shirt.

208
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:28,934
She also let my partner
into your house.

209
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,134
He found a death kit,
tape, gloves, a knife...

210
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:34,600
to control your victims
before strangling, I presume.

211
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,301
Fatima would never
have come to you.

212
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,167
Or maybe you found out
she visited us.

213
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,434
Or maybe she got so nervous,
she showed her hand.

214
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,234
She's known for a while
how you hunt women.

215
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,067
If that girl had
a problem with me,

216
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,800
believe me,
she'd let me know it.

217
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,301
Where are we gonna find
Fatima's body?

218
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,800
Why are you so sure
there's a body?

219
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,967
Detective, you wanted to know
of any hits on a Fatima Gardner.

220
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:55,767
$2,300 master card purchase at
Hahn's furniture store on Western.

221
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,567
Sounds stolen, but whoever took
it may know what happened to her.

222
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,767
I can't leave here.
Can you...

223
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,700
We'll run it down.
We'll get right back to you.

224
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,234
Thank you.

225
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,067
<i>So, why did you follow
Fatima to L.A.?</i>

226
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,468
So she'd continue
to look out for you?

227
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,800
I thought it was because
those Texas cops

228
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,934
had you pegged
for those murders,

229
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,600
<i>so you decided to swim
to safer waters.</i>

230
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,401
They got the wrong guy... just like you.

231
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,767
Those boys still
living in Jim Crow.

232
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,034
They see a proud
black man,

233
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,101
they're gonna come up with a reason

234
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,800
to put his ass
in jail.

235
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:32,667
Press him!

236
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,734
What about me?

237
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,001
I just gotta see a proud
black man behind bars, too?

238
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,834
Oh, you're just like
them Texas cops.

239
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
Racist white folk.

240
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,334
Don't try to convince me
that you're sitting there

241
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,767
because I'm some kind
of Uncle Tom.

242
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,101
No better than
a house nigger

243
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,201
called up to the master's
room each night.

244
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,533
Ok. This guy's got
a real need

245
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,567
for black women
to be subservient.

246
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,667
Last time you got
in his face,

247
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,301
he lost it
and killed a woman.

248
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:08,468
We've got him trapped
here, so press him... hard.

249
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,533
Don't take his shit.

250
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,867
Just fling it right
back in his face.

251
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:13,234
He'll get angry,
lose his balance.

252
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,533
I need some water.

253
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,434
Take him into interrogation,
twist him.

254
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I'll be there in a minute.

255
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:38,767
When were you gonna tell me
about the $65,000?!

256
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,301
I wasn't.

257
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,101
First, you're being
persecuted,

258
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,767
then you're a prime suspect
in a cop killing,

259
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,267
and now you're just
a cop on the take?

260
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:55,201
Sometimes things
crossed our path.

261
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,767
Drugs, money.

262
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,767
Sometimes we took
a little to use later

263
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,700
to help with intel
on the street.

264
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,500
And some just ended up
in your pocket.

265
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,800
I gave it to my ex,
actually.

266
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,301
Looks like Kavanaugh
got to her.

267
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:16,034
I am trying to defend
you, do you get that?

268
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,401
I let you guys answer
Kavanaugh's questions

269
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:22,633
because I was told there
was nothing to hide.

270
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,667
If you really want me
to help you,

271
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:29,334
you better mend fences
with your ex...

272
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,533
and me.

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
We're not going to have
to worry about her.

274
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,533
We need to find out
what side she's on.

275
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,567
Look, I got two
autistic kids.

276
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:40,500
There's special schools,
doctors.

277
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,267
No, that's bullshit.

278
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm not gonna use
my kids as an excuse.

279
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,600
It's bullshit.

280
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,468
It was easy, all right?

281
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:01,034
No fuss, no victims.

282
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:06,633
I was clearing twice as
many cases as anyone here.

283
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,934
I worked my ass off.

284
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,600
I knew I was making a
difference, so I took some for me.

285
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,101
Me!

286
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:16,767
The city got their
money's worth, trust me.

287
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,734
But that was then.

288
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,633
I'm not the same
person now.

289
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,001
Why? Because you got caught?

290
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:30,034
Because I want
to still be a cop.

291
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,700
Because I don't
want to be smeared

292
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,101
and pushed out of my job
by the same people

293
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,468
who patted me on
the back

294
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,934
every time I brought some
murdering rapist asshole in here!

295
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,600
Because I can do better.

296
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,001
But if I'm gonna have
a second chance at that,

297
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,368
I'm gonna need
your help to get it.

298
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,468
You don't shoot
your lady 15 times.

299
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,301
Not unless you want
the bitch extra-dead.

300
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:06,368
It wasn't enough
to break Jenny's jaw?

301
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,434
Send her to the hospital
last summer?

302
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,101
I lost it a few times
and messed her up.

303
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,567
But I never hurt Violet.

304
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,800
You had a hundred pounds of
mexican weight you wanted to unload.

305
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,533
What's another 30 pounds
to a little girl?

306
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,567
You knew we'd rip
the place up once we found'em,

307
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,267
so you had a choice.

308
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,600
You move two bloody bodies
or you move the drugs.

309
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,967
Lot easier to hide
your meth stash.

310
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,567
A lot less messy, too.

311
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,468
You shot your girlfriend
15 times,

312
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,934
you killed your daughter,

313
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:33,468
and then you pulled your product
down from the kitchen ceiling.

314
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:36,600
Wait. Are you saying the drugs
aren't in the crawl space?

315
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,667
That's what we're saying.

316
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,667
He stole'em.
He killed'em both.

317
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,967
Who? Ted Someshit. Her ex.

318
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:47,167
He's the guy.

319
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,134
Someshit?

320
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,167
Why are you so sure
it was him?

321
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,301
Some meth head.

322
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:52,867
And he never
got over the fact

323
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,267
that his woman
left him for me

324
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,234
while he was doing a
year and a half in Folsom.

325
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,600
He just got out
last month.

326
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,167
So he wasn't too happy
when he found out

327
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:01,234
about the daughter
that she had with you.

328
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,567
She wasn't my kid.
What?

329
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,334
Violet was his,
Someshit's.

330
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,700
He didn't even know.

331
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,167
That's the way
Jenny wanted it.

332
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,234
He's name's
not Someshit.

333
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:16,667
Shusett. Ted Shusett.

334
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:23,800
M.E. called. Nothing on
last nights "vic" we can use.

335
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:24,867
Not even a hair?

336
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,434
He's that good.

337
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,867
He's such a perfectionist.

338
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:31,533
He killed extemporaneously
without leaving a trace.

339
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,834
He's made the move from
organized killer

340
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,533
to thrill killer
without missing a beat.

341
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,867
But he knows it wasn't
his best work.

342
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,334
He got impatient.
He rushed it.

343
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,600
He's probably on edge about
leaving trace evidence behind.

344
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:48,934
Hit that hard.

345
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,468
He screwed up.

346
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,533
Didn't take his time.
Didn't plan it.

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,734
He knows he left himself
exposed by cutting the hair.

348
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,101
He said too much with that.

349
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,934
He's gotta be kicking
himself for it.

350
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,334
Hey. Don't let up.

351
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,034
See you later.

352
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:15,201
Well, now I know why you
won't return my calls.

353
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,401
Shouldn't you be at some Lamaze
class or something for your new baby?

354
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,067
Is that what
Kavanaugh told you?

355
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:22,167
Is it true,
that pregnant cop?

356
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:23,334
She didn't tell me
I was the father.

357
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:25,800
But you're a candidate?

358
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:28,401
Well, you must be
very proud.

359
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,267
So you told Kavanaugh about
the money out of spite?

360
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,267
No.

361
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:32,468
I gave you the money
for our kids.

362
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,533
You get angry at me
for a second,

363
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,067
and... and you want
to send me to jail?

364
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:39,301
No, I didn't want that.

365
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:40,834
He was looking
into our accounts.

366
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,401
We didn't declare
that money.

367
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,567
You want to put me in jail?

368
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,800
He's bluffing.
He wants me.

369
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:48,201
What kind of a man puts the mother
of his children in this position?

370
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,101
What did you want me to do?

371
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,834
Nothing. I wanted you
to say nothing.

372
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,434
I'm sorry, ok?
I didn't want to hurt you.

373
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,834
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,134
Ochoa's alibi checks out.

375
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,734
He was at a house party
in Whittier.

376
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,867
We got a lead on
Shusett.

377
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,633
Apartment on Rowena.
Good.

378
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,934
Listen, you guys should know.

379
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,533
I told Becca about some
of our money skimming.

380
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,867
You did what?

381
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,967
I had to explain
the 65 grand.

382
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,700
So you just confessed for all of us?

383
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,067
She's our attorney.

384
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,767
Maybe we need
to talk about that, too.

385
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,067
It's all privileged.

386
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:26,667
She has to know how best
to protect us.

387
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:28,101
Vendrell.

388
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,900
Why don't you come on
up here, spin the wheel?

389
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,234
Bring Becca.
I don't want her.

390
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:37,401
Hey, we can't take
any chances. Trust me.

391
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,567
Counselor.

392
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,567
Get on the ground
right now! Get down!

393
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,267
Get on the ground!
Don't move!

394
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,368
Hands up! Hands up!

395
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:55,201
Sorry to crash
the party, fellas.

396
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,401
Which one of you
is Ted Shusett?

397
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:57,633
He ain't here.

398
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,633
Who are you?

399
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,867
Billy Boyd.
That's my brother Jimmy.

400
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,134
You know where he is?

401
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,800
He comes by at night
to crash lately.

402
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,533
I don't know what he does
in the sunlight.

403
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,667
He kills people,

404
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,800
like his ex-girlfriend
and his kid, for example.

405
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,934
Here. You hear from him,
you call that number.

406
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,667
You don't, I'll have you
both arrested

407
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,734
for conspiracy
in their murders.

408
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,034
You must be doing ok.

409
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:24,468
You bought a $600,000 house
in Atwater 6 months ago.

410
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:25,434
How do you like
the area?

411
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,667
We don't live there.

412
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:30,101
That's right. Contractor
said you gutted it.

413
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,434
Everything new from
the ground up.

414
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,934
Do you have a question, lieutenant?

415
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,700
Actually, you pay
as you go.

416
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:37,900
He gives your wife
the bills,

417
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,001
and she writes
the checks.

418
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,800
And we save every
goddamn receipt,

419
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,167
every invoice,
every cashed check.

420
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,767
Everything
is accounted for.

421
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,334
You wanna see'em?

422
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,334
I already have.

423
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,001
I've seen everything.

424
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:57,001
As I.A.D., you're only entitled
to look at department pay stubs.

425
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,800
You need a subpoena for
any other financial history.

426
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,134
Every penny
is accounted for,

427
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:06,834
except for the normal, everyday
expenses of people living.

428
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,334
We scrape by. You wanna jump in here?

429
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:10,900
You get any help
from anybody?

430
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,834
Your friends? Your
family? Your relatives?

431
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,567
You doing anything to
make a little extra cash?

432
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,800
Don't answer that.
We're done.

433
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,101
Next time, you submit your questions

434
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,034
in writing
to my office.

435
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:23,600
I just want to know where
you get the extra money from.

436
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,201
Come on! Vendrell!

437
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:27,201
She's defending me
like we're guilty.

438
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,334
Why don't you just put it up
in big flashing neon lights?

439
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm not the one with bags
of cash floating around.

440
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,667
And excuse me if I step
on his questions

441
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:35,767
to help keep you
out of jail.

442
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,567
This is about
more than that.

443
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,368
It's about keeping
our jobs.

444
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:40,700
It's about walking
out of here

445
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,167
with our pensions,
our reputations.

446
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:46,034
Keeping us out of jail is
just one piece of the puzzle.

447
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,468
Until Kavanaugh
charges somebody,

448
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,067
we just have to deflect,

449
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,600
hope he reveals
more than he should.

450
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,434
Not me.

451
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,134
I'm sorry, darlin', but you
don't represent me anymore.

452
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,834
Can you give us
a moment, please?

453
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,867
What the hell
happened up there?

454
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,567
He's looking into
my records.

455
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,034
What me and Mara
bring home,

456
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,967
what we're paying
for the house.

457
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,067
Yeah. I thought
that was all covered.

458
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,267
It is, to the penny.

459
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,301
Problem is,
there's nothing left over

460
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:14,600
and he knows it.

461
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,368
This isn't good.
No shit!

462
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:17,334
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

463
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,967
Let's just take
a deep breath.

464
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,567
While we still
breathing free air?

465
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,667
Vic, we got
a "shots fired" call

466
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,067
from the address
you guys just left.

467
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,500
All right.
Lemansky.

468
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,700
I need to see you
for a sec.

469
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,840
What happened?
Some kind of shootout.

470
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:38,441
Dead guy inside.
It's this guy's brother.

471
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,940
Who killed Jimmy?
Was it Shusett?

472
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,274
No. Saw him coming
up the stairs.

473
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,174
Knew some major stuff
was gonna go down,

474
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,507
so I went and got my gun.

475
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:50,707
By the time I found it,
Jimmy was all shot up.

476
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:53,241
Did you see
who killed him?

477
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:57,141
Some cholo dude.
Rolls with Ochoa.

478
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,340
I guess Ochoa's a little more broken
up than we thought about his dead lady.

479
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,308
Or he wanted
his drugs back.

480
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:05,907
He killed my brother, man.

481
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,007
My street intel says someone's
trying to unload weight.

482
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:11,373
Mexican meth.

483
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,907
Shusett didn't go to Ochoa's
to kill his ex crank skank.

484
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,574
He went to steal
his drugs.

485
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,274
When those things flood
the barrio, forget it.

486
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,540
So let's
find'em first.

487
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:23,074
Better yet,
let's buy'em.

488
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,941
Who do we know who could buy from
Shusett without raising flags?

489
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,540
I got a dealer. Street name's Burnout.

490
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,640
I think he got popped with
Shusett once for possession.

491
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,607
All right. Let me check in with my guys.

492
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,407
Let me know if you find them. Good.

493
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,540
My quota's a little
low this week.

494
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,974
Who wants to do
the bracelet dance?

495
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,308
Back up, Burnout.

496
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,340
We need you
to buy some drugs

497
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,941
from an old friend
of yours, Ted Shusett.

498
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,574
You guys got popped
together once.

499
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,373
Once a fellow fiend,
always a fellow fiend.

500
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,841
Partying together
don't make us tight.

501
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,907
Call him. Tell him your looking
for product. He'll listen.

502
00:21:57,974 --> 00:21:59,274
Do I look like
a stupid nigger to you?

503
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,774
Why do you think
we're talking?

504
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:01,841
Man, this is legit.

505
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:03,041
When he stole
those drugs,

506
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:05,740
Shusett killed a 2-year-old
girl and her mother.

507
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,574
So?

508
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,074
We tried to do it
the easy way.

509
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:12,141
Ok, hold up!
Hold up, man!

510
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,241
Look, a call
like that,

511
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,407
little girl
dead, man,

512
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:16,607
street's gonna know I'm
the one givin' it up.

513
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:18,373
That's pretty rough
on my reputation.

514
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,041
What's the going rate
for a reputation these days?

515
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,507
25 grand.

516
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,141
Get him outta here.

517
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,241
That's too much
for the department

518
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:31,208
to authorize on less
than 24-hours notice.

519
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:34,208
City council could
rubber stamp a reward, though.

520
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,907
See you guys inside,
all right?

521
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,107
Councilman?

522
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,174
I thought I could
catch you.

523
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,874
You got a minute?

524
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,274
I have a speech to give.

525
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,473
This is really important
for the investigation.

526
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,607
Have you ever heard of a
guy named Antwon Mitchell?

527
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:56,540
You know I have.

528
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:58,208
I talked to Lemansky,

529
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,540
and I don't want to push
on Antwon Mitchell

530
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,074
until I heard what you
got to say about him.

531
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:06,107
I don't know
what I can tell you.

532
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,774
How did Mackey learn that
Crowley was working with justice?

533
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:12,340
What does this
have to do with Mitchell?

534
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:13,807
Humor me.

535
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:16,640
I suspected
it was Gilroy.

536
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,141
Maybe it was you.

537
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,507
You set up Crowley.

538
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:21,807
You tipped Mackey.

539
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:24,107
Right. I'm also
the fifth Beatle.

540
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:29,607
Mrs. Mackey reported that
he gave her 65 grand in cash.

541
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,174
What was your share?

542
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:35,340
Running a political campaign
gets really expensive.

543
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,074
So's my time, and now
you're wasting it.

544
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,208
I'm just trying to figure out
how Antwon Mitchell

545
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:45,107
and a guy named Juan Lozano
figure into all of this.

546
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,874
Lozano was the guy...

547
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,740
wasn't that the kid
who assaulted you?

548
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,507
Yes!

549
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:52,674
Yes.

550
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,841
Who grabbed your gun?

551
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:59,141
You killed his buddy
during a robbery,

552
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,540
tracked Lozano down
yourself.

553
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,174
That's a pretty impressive
bust for a desk jockey.

554
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,740
And later, you visited
him in County.

555
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,774
Well, he was planning
to appeal his case.

556
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,540
Hmm.

557
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,141
I know that Mackey
and his guys,

558
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,674
they have some connection
with Antwon Mitchell,

559
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,041
and he was in
the same cellblock

560
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,774
when Lozano
was found dead.

561
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,241
There's something big
going on here.

562
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:28,841
You, Mackey,
Mitchell, Lozano.

563
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:31,340
You wanna fill me in?

564
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,141
Waste your time with
these conspiracy theories

565
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:38,074
and you'll find yourself even
more lost than you are now.

566
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:46,340
<i>Clerk said it was a black
woman who used the credit card.</i>

567
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,473
Wasn't sure if it was
Fatima Gardner.

568
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,574
Is anybody
listening to me?

569
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,274
What? Say again?

570
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,041
I said Terry's the guy
you're looking for.

571
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,107
I'm not talking
to you.

572
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:57,141
Say again, Julien?

573
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,041
<i>I said we've got
a motel address</i>

574
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,974
where the woman wanted
the purchases delivered.

575
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,440
We're headed there now.

576
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:04,674
Ok. Good.

577
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,907
You gotta find Terry.

578
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,208
He's the one that needs
to be in here.

579
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,740
Shut up.

580
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:15,674
Pretty sloppy work you did
last night, killing that girl.

581
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,308
Not your usual work of art.

582
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:20,141
Why'd you cut off
her hair?

583
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,174
Why did you
cut off yours?

584
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:24,907
Don't interrupt.
My questions, not yours.

585
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:28,373
You used to look
a lot different.

586
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,241
How long you been sick?

587
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:35,674
You're the one
who's sick, Kleavon.

588
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,974
Please, girl, you're wobbolin' more
than a squirrel fall from a tree.

589
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,440
Oh, you may act like
everything's all right,

590
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,774
but your needle's
going back and forth, yeah.

591
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:50,074
I hear your bones creaking every
time you get out of that chair.

592
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:56,707
Get in there!

593
00:25:56,774 --> 00:25:58,308
Hey, what am
I doing here?

594
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,974
One of the victims I.D.ed the
guy you sent to kill Shusett,

595
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,241
get your crank back.

596
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:05,308
We can lure Someshit out
if we make an offer to buy.

597
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,640
The only problem is we
need a 25 grand reward

598
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:09,841
for our conscientious
dealer first.

599
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,707
Why is this guy so important
you have to pay him?

600
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:14,407
'Cause he can guarantee putting
us in touch with the guy.

601
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,407
He knows Someshit.

602
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:18,373
It's the fastest way we can
get our hands on this guy

603
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,074
and the suitcase
full of crank.

604
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,074
All right.
How fast do you need it?

605
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,607
The guy stole
over a hundred pounds.

606
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:25,907
He's holding a fire sale.

607
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,807
It's only a matter of hours
before he finds a taker.

608
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:29,807
Or Ochoa's guy
finds him first.

609
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,807
My boys put a lot
of hours into this.

610
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:32,807
Hate to see it slip away,

611
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,407
end up on the street
after all that.

612
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,373
All right. I can
authorize the reward,

613
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,574
but expediting it's
another question.

614
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,941
A 2-yeard-old girl
was executed.

615
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,874
2-year-old? Hell,
I'll give you some money.

616
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:47,841
That's ok, pal.
We got it.

617
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,974
You didn't tell me I.A.D.
set up shop in the barn.

618
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,274
Yeah, well, this guy's a
special kind of asshole.

619
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:16,041
Kavanaugh's case
against you

620
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:19,241
is a hell of a lot
stronger than you think.

621
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:21,740
Since when are you
looking out for me?

622
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,674
He's holding back
his trump card

623
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,473
until he can nail
all 4 of you.

624
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,740
It turns out he reports
directly to chief Johnson.

625
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:31,208
Even the mayor's office
is involved.

626
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:35,774
The city is committed on getting
it's PR win off you guys.

627
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,308
But, uh...

628
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:42,340
I could broker a deal,

629
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,674
make sure that jail time's knocked
down to just one year for all of you...

630
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,507
No. Instead of the 7 to
10 you're looking at now.

631
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:50,041
No way.

632
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,574
Look, all you need to do is give
Kavanaugh something on the others,

633
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,807
something that will
give the city its win.

634
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,473
Give them Vic?

635
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,674
He's dragging you down.

636
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,607
And any of this "all for one, one
for all" pep talk he's feeding you

637
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:07,007
is a bunch of bullshit.

638
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:11,874
Fine, but you're gonna
let me know soon.

639
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,640
When are you gonna get
it through your head?

640
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:15,540
I don't want your help!

641
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,340
Just one year!

642
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:19,340
Lem, one year
for all of you!

643
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:24,373
Just one year for
all the shit you guys have done!

644
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,007
But you're too stupid
to take it?

645
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:29,640
Well, then the 4 of you
deserve everything you get.

646
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:38,641
Ok. Let me know
when you see him,

647
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:39,674
but let him get all the
way in the apartment.

648
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:40,807
All right. Copy.

649
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:42,274
Stay sharp.

650
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
You didn't say you was gonna
be using my house.

651
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:45,941
I would have
charged you more.

652
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,607
25 grand was
to lure him here.

653
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:50,474
I said nothing about
protecting you.

654
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,607
Well, shit...

655
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:59,574
Hold on.
Someone's coming.

656
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:02,807
I think that's him.

657
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:05,507
Ok.

658
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:12,407
Ok, we're ready.

659
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,707
This guy's tweaking,
big time.

660
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:19,774
Where's he going?

661
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,140
Shit. Vic, he's going
to the wrong door.

662
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,307
<i>Does he got the drugs?
No.</i>

663
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,440
Maybe in his car,
but it's not on him now.

664
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:30,407
What is he doing? I can't
see past this goddamn fence.

665
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,107
<i>He's arguing with
the woman next door.</i>

666
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,507
She's telling him he's
got the wrong place,

667
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:35,073
but he's not leaving.

668
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,440
We need him
and the drugs.

669
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:39,140
Goddammit.

670
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:42,340
Vic, Reyes and his guys
are moving.

671
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,407
We gotta go, too, man.
There's kids around.

672
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:46,307
No, goddammit! Stay put!

673
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:49,474
Goddamn you!
Speak to me in english!

674
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm supposed to meet
Burnout here right now!

675
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:53,908
Do you understand me?
I wanna see Burnout!

676
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:55,774
Chill out.

677
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,008
Hey! Let her go!

678
00:29:58,073 --> 00:29:59,274
Back! Back!

679
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,407
Let's go!

680
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:02,274
Go! Go! Go! Go!

681
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:06,607
Go! Get out of here!

682
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:07,841
Get back!

683
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,474
He's got a hostage.

684
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,607
And a damn good
vantage point!

685
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:15,040
SWAT's rolling.
15 minutes out.

686
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,207
Back off!

687
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,307
Shithead's on
a mexican high.

688
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:22,974
We don't have 15.
No.

689
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,741
Hey! I want a plane!

690
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,274
She's toast, man.

691
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,541
Pull back and wait
for SWAT.

692
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,941
Anyone got a better idea?

693
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:36,474
Department lets you guys
carry C4?

694
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,207
I just finished
my weekend in the guard.

695
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:41,507
Never hurts to bring home
some supplies from the office.

696
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,274
Whenever you're ready?

697
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,307
Are you sure
about this?

698
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:47,407
It's this woman's
best shot

699
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,240
at getting out
of there alive.

700
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,741
All right. Let's do it.

701
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:54,641
Yeah.

702
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:55,908
<i>It's just him
at the window now.</i>

703
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:57,674
It's clear. Go now.

704
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:59,474
Ok.
Ready?

705
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:00,774
Do it!

706
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,073
You ok? You ok?

707
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,140
Don't move!

708
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,741
Let's get out of
here. Come on.

709
00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:19,307
Come on.
Give me a hand.

710
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:24,641
You had the drugs.

711
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,240
Why'd you have to kill
that little girl?

712
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:28,307
It wasn't me.

713
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:29,841
Drugs were stolen
from Ochoa's house

714
00:31:29,908 --> 00:31:31,541
same time Jenny
and the kid were killed.

715
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:32,707
I got news for you.

716
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,107
That little girl,
the one you killed this morning,

717
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,674
she was your own blood.

718
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:38,008
You had a daughter, Ted.

719
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:39,908
You didn't just kill
an innocent child.

720
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:42,474
You murdered your own
baby girl.

721
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,974
21/2 years
plus 9 months.

722
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,474
That means you and the ex, what...

723
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,807
Christmas time.
3 years ago.

724
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,274
You do so much meth you forget
how to do a little arithmetic, Ted?

725
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,240
I wouldn't kill
my own girl...

726
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,374
not if I knew.

727
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:04,140
Hey. What was her name?

728
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,807
What was her name?!

729
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:09,607
It's good working
with you.

730
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,173
Pretty crazy stunt
blowing that wall.

731
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,040
Yeah. I talked
to my captain.

732
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:17,340
This I.A.D. thing is really
pretty entrenched, so... -

733
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:18,807
It means I'm getting
shit done, right?

734
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:20,707
Yeah.

735
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,307
I would love to work
with you again,

736
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,841
but the boss...

737
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,474
he won't have you
working for me, so...

738
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,274
You know what?

739
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,440
It saves me giving
the bad news.

740
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:30,574
Me and my guys,
we talked about it.

741
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,474
We're happy
where we are.

742
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,008
All right.

743
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:36,574
I'll see you on
the diamond, then?

744
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,908
Yeah.

745
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:44,073
Hey, listen to this.

746
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,307
When I was talking
to Kavanaugh,

747
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:46,807
I noticed he was wearing
a wedding ring.

748
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:48,741
But he's been divorced,
like, 2 years.

749
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:49,841
What's that about?

750
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:50,974
Hmm.

751
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,541
Maybe this gives us
something

752
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:55,440
that let's us put our boot
on his neck for a change.

753
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,908
Police! Open up!

754
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,607
Give me your key.

755
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,307
Ms. Gardner!

756
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:24,674
Fatima, you need to open up, ma'am.

757
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,274
It's all right.

758
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,774
It's ok!

759
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:35,107
It's ok, ma'am.
You're safe,

760
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,974
we're not here
to hurt you.

761
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,008
It's ok.

762
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:41,374
We have him in custody.

763
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,841
You have nothing
to worry about.

764
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:45,073
And what if you can't
arrest him again?

765
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,440
Now he knows
I've talked to you.

766
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,741
He values his
relationship with you.

767
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,140
He was always
our little prince.

768
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:57,674
A sweet, sensitive boy with
just me, my mom, and auntie.

769
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,073
We just wanted him
to know he was special.

770
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,641
Unfortunately, that
resulted in his narcissism.

771
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,774
So how do you want
to play this?

772
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:14,974
We found Fatima.

773
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,674
Strangled,
dumped in an alley.

774
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:22,908
I'd say sorry, but this is
the way you wanted it, isn't it?

775
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,507
It's all you,
your signature.

776
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:41,240
You're wrong.

777
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:46,374
You killed her
like you did those other girls.

778
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,374
You're telling me you have
blackouts after you kill them?

779
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,974
You don't remember it?

780
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:59,841
It's you.
It's your fault.

781
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,607
You should have
found her in time.

782
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:04,674
You didn't even try.

783
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:07,874
This was all you.

784
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,173
And now you sit here
blubbering,

785
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
expecting mercy
from god's vengeance

786
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,841
when you didn't even
give a damn

787
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,008
about those brothers
and sisters,

788
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,440
the mothers and fathers
of the girls you killed.

789
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:22,474
How many of them
had to suffer

790
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,941
because you felt you had
the right to kill?

791
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:27,908
You didn't respect them.

792
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:29,274
You didn't even
see them as people.

793
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,674
And now your own sister,
the one who took care of you!

794
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,707
Jesus.

795
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:48,741
He's not gonna
break.

796
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:49,874
He's cracking.

797
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,874
No, Dutch,
he's not.

798
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:57,474
His grief over his sister's
death is fueling his rage.

799
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,474
Just one more push.

800
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:02,874
I can't.

801
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,807
Well, don't pull out now.

802
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:10,107
Dutch...

803
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,707
I can't do this.

804
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,374
Well, you have to do it.

805
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,641
There's no evidence.

806
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:33,073
You've accessed this guy better
than anyone else ever has.

807
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,474
That's why it has
to be you, now.

808
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,407
You're... you're so close.

809
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:41,974
I can't.
Look at me.

810
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:53,173
You accused me of letting
you being sick get in the way.

811
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,107
Well, now you're letting it.

812
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,641
This guy is a killer,

813
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,908
and I don't
give a shit how tired

814
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:11,707
or weak or pained
you are.

815
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:13,040
If he walks today,

816
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,173
he's gonna come after Fatima
or you or some other woman.

817
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,574
So you get back in there
and you close him.

818
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:45,204
As your lawyer,

819
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,437
it's a mistake,
and a big one.

820
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:50,904
But you know
I have to do it.

821
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,637
You can't change
the past,

822
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,604
and it only makes
the present harder.

823
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,471
I can't get a fresh start
unless I know she has one.

824
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:01,337
It's dangerous.

825
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,304
It makes amends.

826
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,838
I'll deal with
the danger later.

827
00:38:20,571 --> 00:38:22,471
Haven't been here in years.

828
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,437
Young and poor.

829
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:27,070
We actually thought this
was fine dining, remember?

830
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:30,137
This doesn't feel
too weird.

831
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:31,604
Listen, I...

832
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:35,904
You and the kids can't
get caught up with this.

833
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,504
It feels like
it's too late.

834
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,904
No, it's not.

835
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,737
I want you to get
a lawyer.

836
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:43,137
Make a deal that gets you
clear with Kavanaugh.

837
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,504
Make sure he gets you
IRS immunity, too.

838
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:46,671
But you...

839
00:38:46,737 --> 00:38:48,237
And I want you to answer
all his questions.

840
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:51,270
From now on,
complete cooperation.

841
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:54,070
The whole truth, no matter
what it makes me look like.

842
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:59,070
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

843
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,637
Let me worry
about me.

844
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:06,370
You just worry
about our 3.

845
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:10,604
What do I say
about the money?

846
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:13,471
Well, when we needed it,
I came up with it.

847
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:16,571
I said I was gonna take some
overtime to cover the expenses.

848
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:19,003
As far as you know,
that's what I did.

849
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,070
But that's not gonna go with anything...

850
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:24,537
Let me worry about me.

851
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,804
The menu hasn't changed.

852
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:40,604
Some things never do.

853
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:46,237
Maybe I should just give them some
minor bullshit that won't stick,

854
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:47,537
get us all out of it.

855
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,938
You're gonna trust
Aceveda now?

856
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:51,170
Hey.

857
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,504
Why are we having this
conversation without Vic?

858
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:59,938
Because Vic's listening to his
lawyer more than he's listening to us.

859
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,904
I don't like her
representing all 4 of us.

860
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,103
But I hate to say it,

861
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,771
but we all have different
levels of involvement.

862
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,938
Yeah, they'll get Lem
on possession,

863
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:10,838
they'll get me and Vic
on tax evasion.

864
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:12,938
You're the only one
clean so far.

865
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:16,370
Hey, I'm in this with you,
and so is Vic.

866
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:20,804
But I don't like this
unified lawyer front.

867
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:25,704
Kavanaugh cannot handle 4
lawyers poking holes in his case.

868
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,771
I saw we all lawyer up,

869
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:29,838
get them to throw everything
they can at him.

870
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:33,170
Keep him off balance.

871
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:36,003
I mean, what are
we waiting for?

872
00:40:37,737 --> 00:40:39,137
Vic.

873
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,404
The medical examiner
found a hair

874
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:50,671
of an african-american male
on last night's victim's body.

875
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:53,337
<i>We're gonna need to draw some
blood and take some hair samples.</i>

876
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:54,537
<i>I won't agree to that.</i>

877
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,704
<i>It's not your choice anymore.
It's the court's.</i>

878
00:40:58,637 --> 00:40:59,904
Real stupid of you.

879
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,904
You got so pissed at us
asking you questions

880
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,970
about Fatima's disappearance,
you finally got sloppy.

881
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,737
Went out there,
killed in a hurry.

882
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:11,003
All the other times,
the planning was just perfect.

883
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,671
Why?

884
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,304
You sat here before.

885
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,404
What's different this time?

886
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,003
You had a fight with Fatima?

887
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,838
Did she confront you
about the other girls?

888
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:25,070
Is that why you finally
killed your own sister?

889
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:26,504
Or was it just me
you couldn't control?

890
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:29,070
I didn't kill her.

891
00:41:29,137 --> 00:41:31,404
You must have known
what was happening,

892
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,904
seen her loathing,
her disappointment.

893
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,370
When she came to see us,
she said it was all her fault.

894
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:39,804
She never came to you.

895
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:41,404
Said she should have
tried to stop you.

896
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:42,671
Is that what happened?

897
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:45,170
She tried to stop you?

898
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,537
You're bleeding.

899
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,804
Let's get some ice.

900
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:02,070
I'm fine.

901
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,871
Come with me.

902
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,904
No.

903
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:13,838
Fatima hated you.

904
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:16,771
Her own brother,
a killer.

905
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,370
She loved me.

906
00:42:18,437 --> 00:42:19,838
And you loved her?

907
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,904
Bullshit.

908
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,370
You killed her.
Over and over.

909
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:26,137
All those girls,

910
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:29,037
Texas, here, and god knows where else,

911
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:30,737
they were all
Fatima to you.

912
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:33,137
You needed her,
but you hated her,

913
00:42:33,204 --> 00:42:34,804
and you killed them
until you finally

914
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:36,938
got up the courage
to kill her.

915
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:38,304
No.

916
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,270
And now with that hair we
found on that woman last night,

917
00:42:40,337 --> 00:42:43,103
we got you,
you son of a bitch!

918
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,537
I got you for her!

919
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,737
And the jury,
if I got one,

920
00:42:47,804 --> 00:42:49,737
we'll put all the others
on you, too,

921
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:50,938
including your sister.

922
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:54,404
We have the evidence
this time.

923
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,304
I could never...
You killed Fatima...

924
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,671
and the hair proves you
killed a woman last night.

925
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,804
She was nothin'.

926
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,237
Those others were nothin'.
Fatima...

927
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:08,504
Fatima was my sister.

928
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:16,970
So the others,
you killed them?

929
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,804
Pauline Wahler
last night.

930
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:25,037
Mary Simpson.
Lana Gregory.

931
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,871
They were just... things.

932
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:35,103
You could hardly
call it killing.

933
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,838
The ones in Texas.

934
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:39,904
Them, too.

935
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,804
But not Fatima.
Not her.

936
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,404
She was a person.

937
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:48,337
I didn't kill her.

938
00:44:04,704 --> 00:44:04,804
Fatima?

939
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,137
You did this?

940
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:10,404
You helped them
make me think you were dead?

941
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:12,404
Your soul's gonna
burn, Kleavon.

942
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:15,204
And until it does,
I'll visit you.

943
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,637
You bitch!

944
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:19,537
You're never going
to see momma or auntie.

945
00:44:19,604 --> 00:44:20,737
They're crying now
over what you've done!

946
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:22,170
What's wrong with you?!

947
00:44:22,237 --> 00:44:23,471
Why'd you tell'em?!
Move!

948
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:24,904
Someone get him
outta here!

949
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:27,337
You traitor!
I'm your blood!

950
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:30,838
What's wrong with you?!

951
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:32,904
Put him in there
to cool off!

952
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,037
Claudette!

953
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:36,103
Oh, my god!

954
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:41,471
Is she all right?
Claudette?

955
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:42,604
He pushed her!

956
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:43,838
What's going on?

957
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:44,970
No, no! She fainted!

958
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:46,103
She was out before
she fell! Claudette?

959
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,070
She fell?
Is she bleeding?

960
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:49,871
Don't move her.
Call the paramedics.

961
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,771
Her neck is...
Call an ambulance.

962
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,804
Claudette?
Hurry! Hurry!

963
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:58,637
Who is going
to hell now?

964
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:03,337
Hey... hey, Claudette?
Claudette?

965
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,370
Claudette?
