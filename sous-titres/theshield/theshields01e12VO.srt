1
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:52,264
- Let's go! On the ground!
- Get down!

2
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,564
Police! Down!

3
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,564
Cethru, how many times
do I gotta tell you?

4
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:59,664
Firearms and alcohol
are a dangerous combination.

5
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,970
- See?
- Get down on your knees.

6
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,870
I said, get down on your knees.

7
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,270
Cethru is upgrading his merch.
Some of these might actually shoot.

8
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:18,204
Hey, Vic.

9
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,070
- Wishing your cock was that big?
- Man, these are beautiful animals.

10
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,870
I can't believe they just let them
rip each other apart.

11
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,870
- Just dumb birds, brother.
- Where they taking them, man?

12
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,970
- Three little letters: KFC.
- Come on, those are my best birds.

13
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,070
- Shut up. Move.
- Wait. Come on. I can help you, man.

14
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,970
Cethru's smalltime. You want guns,
I'll hook you up with the big guy.

15
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,070
Yeah? Who we talking about?

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,570
Listen, call off the butchers,
and I'll tell you.

17
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,070
Why don't you tell me first.

18
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,470
Pazi Arombula.
Is that big enough for you?

19
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,870
- You know where Pazi is?
- He loves birds.

20
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,370
- He's in town for Dos Días de Sangre.
- Two Days of Blood?

21
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,970
It's a big summer cockfight, all right?
I get you inside. You get Pazi.

22
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,270
Last I heard, those pits were filled
with Filipinos and Mexicans.

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,370
I get some of my best fighters
from rednecks in Louisiana.

24
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,270
- He'll blend right in.
- Blow me, chicken man.

25
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,670
Pazi Arombula, huh? He is bigtime.

26
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,070
I'll tell you when and where.

27
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,870
Check it out. Is it all there?

28
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,470
We're cool, man.

29
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,645
Here.

30
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,617
Tony!

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,037
Stop!

32
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,898
Tony!

33
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,770
Pazi's a gunrunning scumbag,
who's wanted...

34
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,370
...by Mexican, federal, state
and local authorities.

35
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,270
He's got close to a 3 million-peso
bounty on his head.

36
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,770
Three million? Let me see that.

37
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,170
Oh, Vic, you gotta let me go undercover
and clean up this grease stain.

38
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,970
Last time I let you go undercover,
you got beaten up by a stripper.

39
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,260
I was jumped by her thug boyfriend,
and she was a dancer.

40
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,616
Shut up!

41
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,770
Vic, you got a minute?

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,908
Yeah, sure.

43
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,018
I'm surprised to see you. What's up?

44
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,870
- You and I, we've had a rough year.
- Yeah, we did.

45
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,070
One rough year out of 20 years
of friendship. That ain't bad.

46
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,170
With those percentages,
I'd still be with my first wife.

47
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,670
- You're better off with Nancy.
- I know.

48
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,070
- What's up, Ben?
- I was in a hit-and-run tonight.

49
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,070
I think I killed the guy.

50
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,970
- You didn't stop?
- I got out to check on him...

51
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,770
...and his gangbanger buddy
took some shots at me.

52
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,370
I panicked and hightailed it.
Oh, man, what am I gonna do?

53
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,070
- Tell the truth. If he took shots at you...
- Vic, I been DUI four times.

54
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,470
I got it hushed up.

55
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,470
Word gets out that I killed this guy,
nobody's gonna believe I wasn't drunk.

56
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,170
- Oh, Christ, Ben.
- Imagine me in prison, Vic.

57
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,970
Now, I know as rough
as we left it last time...

58
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,270
...you can't want that. Right?

59
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,370
Can you help an old friend?

60
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:23,706
Ben, give me the keys. Shane, tell
Suvani repairing this blue Mercedes...

61
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,806
...is top-priority and top-secret.
I want it good as new by tomorrow.

62
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,806
- Right, boss.
- Lem, get Ben home.

63
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:30,879
- Okay.
- I'll find out who's on the case...

64
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,506
...make sure it never hits you.

65
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,067
Thanks, Vic.

66
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,406
It was some slide.
Impact dragged him 75 feet.

67
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:49,006
- Maybe you ought to call Guinness.
- No, record's over 30 miles.

68
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:54,206
This isn't even a footnote.
Anthony Nuñez, dealer extraordinaire.

69
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,306
Witnesses say he and a friend
worked the corner over there.

70
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:00,406
- Where's the friend?
- Didn't stick around.

71
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:04,306
- What about the car?
- It's a blue Mercedes, four-door.

72
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:09,606
Witness was vague. Guy driving, little
Latin number in the passenger seat.

73
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:13,206
High-end sedan. If it wasn't tricked-out,
he didn't live around here.

74
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,106
He must've been
in a hurry to get home.

75
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,606
I'm having trouble. Do you know
how to run this program?

76
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:26,506
- Are you doing okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

77
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:29,106
If you're not ready to go back out,
I understand.

78
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:34,306
No, really. I'm okay. It was just
a one-time thing. I'm fine now.

79
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,692
You sure?

80
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,906
I know you're worried because you
have to ride with me, but I'm okay.

81
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:45,006
- Yeah, well, it's my life too, you know?
- I know.

82
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,506
So say something
that will make me feel better.

83
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,806
- I'm not gonna hang you out.
- And?

84
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,606
And I'm gonna speak with my reverend,
sort through things.

85
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:01,606
But my head is in it 100 percent.

86
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:11,806
I heard you guys scraped a
dope-dealing banger off the pavement.

87
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,406
- Not pretty.
- Crash-test dummy got an ID?

88
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:17,306
- Claudette, can I borrow you?
- What for?

89
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:21,206
- A double homicide in the Grove.
- Some morning.

90
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,206
You need me? I can pass
the hit-and-run off to Walt.

91
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:26,406
Just Claudette.
I'm going over there too.

92
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:29,806
It looks like it could be
a messy situation.

93
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,506
Come on, we'll ride together.

94
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:36,406
- I'm still waiting.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:39,606
Victim's name's Anthony Nuñez.
You know him?

96
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:43,606
Oh, after summer vacation
was over, we stopped writing.

97
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:48,506
That area, he's probably a Toro.
Anything on the driver?

98
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:53,306
White guy, blue Mercedes, señorita
in the passenger seat. That's it.

99
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,206
- There was a passenger.
- Good news is, neighbours have seen...

100
00:07:56,406 --> 00:08:00,706
...the car parked in the area at night.
Sounds like a little love tryst to me.

101
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,506
Toros do this thing
called a toss-and-shoot.

102
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,406
- What's that?
- Toss a rival banger in front of a car.

103
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:15,506
They fire off a few rounds. Scare the
driver, make it look like a hit-and-run.

104
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:18,406
Maybe the driver killed the guy,
didn't wanna get caught?

105
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,806
Why don't you let me
give you a hand with this.

106
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,906
You wanna help me?

107
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:27,706
Ever since you rolled that serial killer,
you're the man around here.

108
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:33,106
- Right.
- C-note says this is a toss-and-shoot.

109
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:46,006
- Gonna tell us what's going on?
- Can I have your attention, please?

110
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:49,706
Now, people, please. Please, please.
We need you to listen.

111
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,906
Give us some time to go inside
and determine what happened.

112
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:56,306
We'll make an announcement
when we know something.

113
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:10,106
Sweet Jesus. What's burning?

114
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,506
It's the garbage disposal.
The motor burned out.

115
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,706
It looks like they were killed
with a meat tenderiser.

116
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,406
Killer panicked,
tried to dispose of the body.

117
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:25,106
The victim in the sink is Tanya Kramer.
The other is Violet Roosevelt.

118
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:28,206
- Any witnesses?
- Well, the walls here are pretty thin.

119
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,506
A lot of people heard the screams.

120
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,906
- Captain.
- Yes?

121
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,006
There's someone downstairs
who can identify the killer.

122
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:39,932
Down there.

123
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,306
- Karen Mitchell?
- You know her?

124
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,706
Yeah, I met her a few times
during Morgan's re-election campaign.

125
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:54,006
- Karen, hello.
- David.

126
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:57,706
- Councilman Morgan couldn't make it?
- He's in Sacramento moving.

127
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:01,206
- He asked me to come and be his eyes.
- Of course.

128
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:06,806
- So if you need anything, just ask.
- Well, I appreciate his help, yours too.

129
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,806
This is Maya Duffy. She saw the killer.

130
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:12,506
- Can you describe him?
- His name's Wally Forton.

131
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,306
White guy. He was dating
Tanya's daughter.

132
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:18,706
- What happened?
- What happened is, they called 911...

133
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,706
...and it took you
over an hour to show up.

134
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,606
- Over an hour. Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

135
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,706
We heard Tanya up there screaming
at Wally. She called 911.

136
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:32,406
- And he didn't leave?
- No, he went outside...

137
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:36,906
...waiting around for 20 minutes or so,
and then he went back and killed them.

138
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:40,806
- An hour. Can that be right?
- I'll have to review the 911 tapes.

139
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:45,406
If it was a black man breaking in,
it wouldn't take no hour.

140
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:48,206
Everybody gets equal treatment
from this department.

141
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,606
Why are they dead, then?

142
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:54,306
Ma'am, come with me, please.
I'll take the statement.

143
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,206
- Go by the car.
- Whatever.

144
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,706
They'll want answers, and frankly,
I think they deserve them.

145
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:09,406
Wally's girlfriend might be in danger.
We need to find him, her or both.

146
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:18,106
I pulled the dead guy's known
associates. Recognise anyone?

147
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:22,306
That's the guy's buddy right there.
He's the one that shot at me.

148
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,806
Jesus Rosales. Yeah, he's a Toro.

149
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:29,106
Warrants for possession and intent
to sell narcotics. No wonder he ran.

150
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,006
- Can you find him?
- Who are you talking to here?

151
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:37,606
He got a good look at me. What if he
decides I'm his bargaining chip?

152
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,706
We'll make him a better deal.

153
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:47,806
So when were you gonna tell me
you were shagging a Latina?

154
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:55,306
- I didn't wanna get her involved.
- She couldn't be more involved.

155
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:58,906
- Was she driving?
- No, it happened just like I said...

156
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:01,206
...except she was with me.
- Who is she?

157
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:06,202
Sedona Tellez. I've been seeing her.

158
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:10,206
- What about Nancy?
- We're all perfect?

159
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:14,306
Dutchboy's picked up her scent.
You're gonna have to send her away.

160
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,597
Okay. Good idea.

161
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,906
Hey, Vic, she's not just some lay.

162
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,451
I love her.

163
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,406
Melissa left for the gym
about two hours ago.

164
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:31,406
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

165
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,806
What about the boyfriend, Wally?
Have you seen him?

166
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:38,606
Wally. Oh, honey,
he's a cutie-pie for a white guy.

167
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:42,206
- You know him?
- Sort of. I hear them some nights.

168
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:46,606
- Hear them?
- Doing it. Honey, he's a screamer.

169
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:50,306
He's louder than she is. I thought
they split up, but I guess not.

170
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,506
- You know where we might find them?
- He came back about an hour ago...

171
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,706
...Looking for her.
I told him that she was at the gym.

172
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:06,006
Hey, our road kill pissed off a couple
of Los Mags a couple of days back.

173
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:08,306
It's looking more and more
like banger payback.

174
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,946
I found her.

175
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,706
- Who?
- The mystery woman.

176
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:16,206
I talked to a pizza delivery guy.
He's seen a blue Benz...

177
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:22,206
...on numerous occasions
at 2538 Mercado Avenue.

178
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:25,606
Sedona Tellez. She's our babe.

179
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:29,106
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- There's no one home.

180
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,406
But a neighbour swears
she jumped into a cab...

181
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:34,206
...with a bunch of suitcases
earlier this afternoon.

182
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,006
This is starting to get interesting.

183
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:40,006
Who knows if it's even the same Benz?
Maybe she just went on vacation.

184
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:45,906
Or she and the boyfriend skipped town.
Don't worry, I'll get them.

185
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,006
Cool.

186
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,806
Pazi's a badass with connections
to half a dozen gangs.

187
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,806
Why are you risking your life
to get off a misdemeanour?

188
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:58,506
Those cocks, I hatched them myself.
I raised them. They're all I got.

189
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,506
Okay. You get me in, set up a meeting.

190
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:05,906
Tell Pazi I'm willing to trade
feathers for hardware.

191
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:10,206
Trust me, if Pazi likes your chickens,
he'll trade anything to get them.

192
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,706
Good. So we got a plan, right?

193
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,006
Can I go home now? Am I free?

194
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,806
Let's just say that you're on parole
till this thing gets done. Understand?

195
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,906
Yeah, okay. Let's go to my yard,
and I'll teach you...

196
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,806
...everything you need
to know in the ring.

197
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:31,606
- Bottled water?
- The most important part of their diet.

198
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:35,406
- The poison out of my tap will kill them.
- I hear that, man.

199
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:39,806
- What kind of bird is he?
- Kelso, champion line. Never been cut.

200
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,906
Those three are Boston Roundheads,
the Solabina...

201
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:45,006
...and the blinker's a Johnny Jumper.

202
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:48,106
- Blinker?
- Blinker.

203
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,506
Oh, man, that's sick.

204
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:53,806
Hey, you got till tonight, man.
Learn as much as you can.

205
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,206
Pazi's gonna wanna know
how you raise these birds.

206
00:14:56,406 --> 00:15:00,706
Jesus. B12, vitamin K supplements.
They need all this stuff?

207
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:03,406
- If you want them to win.
- What's his name?

208
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:06,506
It hurts too much.
I stopped naming them.

209
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,006
They're all called nugget.

210
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:11,506
That's not funny, dude.
I mean, these are innocent creatures.

211
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,606
They are kind of beautiful,
though, aren't they?

212
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,206
I mean, in a snack food sort of way.

213
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,079
Jesus.

214
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:37,922
- Open warrant. Let's make this easy.
- He didn't do anything.

215
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:41,122
Look, kids, I'm in no mood to play.

216
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,862
Come on.

217
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:47,522
- Where you going, homes?
- Back off. I'm a cop. Back off.

218
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:50,822
If this was a real arrest, you would
have brought more. Let him go.

219
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,522
- He'll be out in 12 hours.
- I say he's out now.

220
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:55,622
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

221
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:00,722
I don't wanna shoot anybody today.
That's up to you.

222
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:04,522
- Gonna kill us all, ése?
- No, just the one who wants it first.

223
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:09,822
Hey! Get your hands in the air!
Back off! Back off.

224
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,971
Walk. Come on.

225
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,422
The witness at Melissa's gym
saw them leaving together.

226
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,922
- By force or willingly?
- The guy wasn't sure.

227
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,322
Karen Mitchell's here.
She's only gonna get in our way.

228
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,422
You could talk to her.
Tell her to back off.

229
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,022
- Me?
- You said you met her a few times.

230
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:49,722
You know, rumour is, she's Morgan's
handpicked successor for his seat.

231
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,022
- Really.
- Which means that she would be...

232
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:55,622
...running against you in the primary,
but you knew that.

233
00:16:55,822 --> 00:17:00,122
As wedge issues go,
two dead women is a bad one.

234
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:02,422
You wanna catch the killer
and cover your ass...

235
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,422
...but if you can't do both,
this is about catching the killer.

236
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,854
Karen.

237
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:12,022
I was hoping you had
some new information by now.

238
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:13,622
Unfortunately, no.

239
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:16,822
- Well, what about the 911 tapes?
- They're on the way.

240
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:20,522
We've been trying to find Melissa
Kramer before she gets her own tape.

241
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,422
Well, I'd like to listen to them with you.

242
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:30,322
Two women are dead, David.
I hope we're not playing politics here.

243
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:36,022
Jesus, we need your help
with something.

244
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:41,022
Now, we're sorry about your friend,
but that was an accident.

245
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,522
You dragged him halfway
down the block.

246
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:47,622
I saw your rap sheets.
You and your friend are no saints.

247
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,022
- Jesus, you know who we are?
- Cops.

248
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:57,722
No, we're not just any cops.
We're good friends to have, Jesus.

249
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,922
You ever get picked up for selling rock,
we're the guys to know.

250
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:05,022
- Yeah, if I keep quiet.
- If you keep quiet.

251
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,229
- Okay.
- Good.

252
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,722
You just made a smart decision.

253
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:19,422
I'll tell you what, Jesus.
I'm gonna write down a number.

254
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:22,722
You get scooped up,
you call me anytime...

255
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:24,807
Jesus Christ!

256
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,422
What did you do?!

257
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,322
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- I had to.

258
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:39,922
- Put the gun down, Ben.
- Relax, Vic.

259
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,822
- We don't have to worry now.
- He was cooperating.

260
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,976
- I was supposed to trust him?!
- He was innocent!

261
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:46,822
- He was a problem!
- Jesus Christ, Ben!

262
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,822
What did you do?

263
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,722
Nothing you haven't done.

264
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:59,322
- What?
- Terry Crowley. Any bells ringing?

265
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:03,522
You don't wanna say it, fine.
But I helped you get clear on that.

266
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:08,160
- Oh, man, this is your problem.
- It's our problem.

267
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:11,822
- No.
- His buddies saw you take this guy.

268
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:15,422
Now he's dead.
I picked you for a reason, Vic.

269
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:20,322
You've been through this.
Now help me get clear.

270
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,302
I appreciate this, Vic.

271
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:37,602
Drop this guy in Los Mags territory
and make it look like a gang hit.

272
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,891
That's smart. Yeah.

273
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,702
When this lands on your desk,
just bury it.

274
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:49,602
Hey, look, Vic, I'm sorry
about how this went down. I am.

275
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:53,302
Now just keep Dutch off my ass,
and we're home free.

276
00:19:55,502 --> 00:20:00,102
Vic, you and me. We're good, right?

277
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:08,302
No, not today.
That's two for 25 right there, pops.

278
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:12,502
That phone is 10 bucks. No problem.
Got change for everything.

279
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:18,502
- What can I do for you officers?
- Got a complaint about your yard sale.

280
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,202
- What kind of complaint?
- You've been robbing neighbours...

281
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:24,102
...and forcing them to buy
their property back.

282
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:27,002
Well, that's a lie.
All this here, this is all mine.

283
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:30,202
- The person said differently.
- Oh, yeah? And who was that?

284
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:33,502
They didn't give their name.
They said everyone's scared of you.

285
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:38,923
- You got any proof this stuff is yours?
- You got any proof that it ain't?

286
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:42,702
Look, officers, I'm just trying
to have a yard sale here, okay?

287
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:46,602
- There's nothing illegal about that.
- There is if you don't have a permit.

288
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:50,202
City-approved. Please believe it.

289
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,002
- Dookie?
- That's me.

290
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,302
Does any of this merchandise
belong to any of you?

291
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:02,502
If you speak up,
you'll get your stuff back.

292
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:09,202
If you guys are all done,
I've got business to attend to.

293
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,402
I'm gonna be keeping
my eye out on you, Dookie.

294
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:17,902
Stop by anytime.
I got great bargains for you two.

295
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,202
Watch it, pops. You touch, you buy.
You know the rules.

296
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:24,502
What, are you kidding me?
That's 10 percent.

297
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:31,102
I only get 20 percent, Einstein.
Ten percent is half my fee.

298
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:35,502
- You sure about that?
- Hey.

299
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:38,102
Lem, this is Jojo Rizal.
He's a bounty hunter.

300
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:40,502
- Bail enforcement agent.
- Curtis Lemansky.

301
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:42,802
Jojo here's gonna help us
with this Pazi deal.

302
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,302
- Help us?
- Yeah, like a piece of Pazi's bounty?

303
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,102
Cops can't collect bounty, dude.

304
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:50,402
I figured a way around
that little problem.

305
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:55,402
- What, the problem of us being cops?
- Bring me Pazi, I split my fee 50-50.

306
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,802
- No way.
- Come on. That's like 400,000 pesos.

307
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,102
That's gotta be, what?
A couple hundred grand?

308
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:03,302
- Try 50?
- Fifty?

309
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:06,802
- That's about right.
- Damn, Mexico.

310
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:10,002
- You know what? It's still worth it.
- No way. Forget it, man.

311
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,602
- Okay.
- Hold on. Hold on one second.

312
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:14,502
- What?
- I'm looking out for our interests.

313
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:18,202
Jesus. For once, can't we just do
what we're supposed to and then stop?

314
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,702
Hey, when you guys figure out
who's wearing the pants...

315
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:25,902
...why don't you beep me.
Oh, your cock's out.

316
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,255
Damn it.

317
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:35,402
Is that who you see yourself as?
A gay man?

318
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:42,202
Of course not, I'm just confused.
These urges, I can't beat them down.

319
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:47,902
So, what I'm hearing is,
you really wanna change.

320
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:50,802
That's why I'm here.

321
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:54,202
I was ashamed.
I didn't know what you'd say.

322
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:59,002
What's important is your commitment
to God, to your faith.

323
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:00,609
I know.

324
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:04,735
So, what can I do?

325
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:12,302
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

326
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:22,302
Vic, I researched our missing
femme fatale, Sedona Tellez.

327
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,402
Waste of time, Dutchboy.
Taggers found the victim's amigo...

328
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:28,402
...dead in a Los Mag tunnel.
Told you, gang hit all the way.

329
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:32,102
- What buddy? Jesus Rosales?
- Yeah.

330
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:35,202
- I've been looking for him.
- Well, stop.

331
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:41,102
Girlfriend bolts, friend gets hit.
There's something else at play here.

332
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:45,902
- What?
- Sedona Tellez is listed as a CEO...

333
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:48,402
...of a corporation based
in the Cayman Islands.

334
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:53,602
Its sole purpose? Buying up
real estate right here in Farmington.

335
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:56,802
- You're kidding.
- Nope. Not bad for an accountant...

336
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,002
...living in a one-bedroom
in slum town.

337
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:02,902
- Now this Jesus is dead?
- Yeah.

338
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:08,402
He was a Toro. I'll start with his crew.
Usually runs with five, six other guys.

339
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:11,202
- How do you know that?
- I have contacts.

340
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:13,402
- You do?
- Believe it or not.

341
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:17,102
- You found all this out since 4:00?
- Pretty good, huh?

342
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:20,402
- Too good, Dutchboy.
- Well, I have a rep to maintain.

343
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:24,402
You're gonna put me right out of a job.

344
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:28,202
One, two, three.

345
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,702
Let's go. Come on, come on, birdie, go.

346
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:37,202
Go, birdie, go. Go! Take him down!

347
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:44,702
Go, take him down!
Take him down, birdie!

348
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:03,402
What about it?
Who's ready for round two?

349
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:09,302
- What a badass!
- What, you saw Pazi?

350
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:13,702
No, man, Frank. He gets in there,
and it's like he's possessed.

351
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:15,802
This goddamn cock won 700 bucks.

352
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,702
- You named him?
- Frank.

353
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,802
- What? It's just a first name.
- Pazi was a no-show?

354
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:24,302
Yeah. Yeah. Gabo heard he's coming
tomorrow. You ready for round two?

355
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,402
You're sick, man.

356
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:28,402
Where's the police? Where are you?

357
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,702
Try to remain calm.
The police are coming.

358
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:32,502
- He's back again!
- Now!

359
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,402
- Who's back?
- Wally Forton.

360
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:37,302
At this point, it's been 47
minutes since the initial call.

361
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,202
- Jesus Christ.
- Somebody help us!

362
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:41,002
- Ma'am?
- Unbelievable.

363
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:43,402
- Help us!
- Mrs. Kramer...?

364
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,002
- Help!
- Are you still there?

365
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:48,802
- Bitch, you did this!
- Mrs. Kramer, are you okay?

366
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:50,542
Help us!

367
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,702
How does something like this happen?

368
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:56,602
It's a manpower issue.
We only had two units assigned.

369
00:25:56,702 --> 00:26:00,402
One was responding to a heart attack.
The other was involved in a pursuit.

370
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,902
- Why only two units?
- It's a new policy.

371
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:06,102
Saturating areas with more patrols.

372
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:09,302
- While other areas go unprotected?
- Not unprotected.

373
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,902
Statistically, it's smart policing.
A larger concentration of units...

374
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,802
...in one area reduces crime
by 65 percent...

375
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,702
You believe that?

376
00:26:22,402 --> 00:26:24,102
What happened today was an anomaly.

377
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:26,702
Tell that to the family
of those two dead women.

378
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,502
Usually, there's adequate backup.

379
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:33,502
David has the discretion
on how his units are assigned.

380
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:39,402
So you're the one who's responsible?

381
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:44,902
- You're blaming me for this?
- Payback's a bitch, huh?

382
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:48,502
- Thanks for tossing me a softball.
- This policy's your idea.

383
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:51,402
It's been in place for six months.
You had no problem with it...

384
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:54,402
...as long as you were sending the
patrols to Latino neighbourhoods.

385
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:58,002
- Wait a minute. This is not my mess.
- It is now.

386
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:02,002
So you better fix it.

387
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,502
- Vic, good to see you again.
- Business as usual, huh?

388
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:14,002
For the both of us.

389
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:39,402
Julien, I need a hand.

390
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:45,702
- I need your help with something.
- I'm done helping you.

391
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:49,402
Hey, I keep your secret every day,
just like I promised, right?

392
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:52,402
Every time you need something,
you'll twist a screw?

393
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,702
You're gonna help me
with something right now...

394
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:57,902
...or you're gonna see
just how hard I can twist.

395
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:01,202
This guy walks into the middle
of you and your friends...

396
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:03,602
...pulls a gun and walks off with Jesus?

397
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:06,602
- Yeah.
- Any idea who he is?

398
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:08,802
- Detective.
- Yeah?

399
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:11,202
- You're needed.
- I'm in the middle of something.

400
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:13,102
Captain said it was important.

401
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,602
I'll be right back.

402
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:20,402
- Where is he?
- I didn't talk to him.

403
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:23,002
I just had the message passed to me.

404
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:38,702
You listen and you listen quick.
Los Mags pulled your guy out.

405
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:42,402
You ID me, you'll be stone dead
15 minutes after you leave this station.

406
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:44,155
You hear me?

407
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,102
- Hey.
- Vic.

408
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,202
Thought I'd sit in.
Hope you don't mind.

409
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:53,902
Not at all. Anyway, you were
about to describe the guy.

410
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,102
Well, answer the man.

411
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,702
I didn't get a good look.

412
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,402
What did you see?

413
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:14,502
- He was wearing Los Mags colours.
- Los Mags?

414
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,802
A goddamn gang hit.

415
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,710
I told you it was boys in the 'hood.

416
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,310
He couldn't look you or me in the eye.
Kept scratching the top of his right...

417
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,610
- Wagenbach, stop.
- He's lying.

418
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,110
- A skin allergy means he's lying?
- He's covering for the Benz guy.

419
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,310
I can't believe this. Give it up already.

420
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,610
Even if you're right,
the driver is still a witness to a murder.

421
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,110
- I still have to find him, so let me.
- You don't need the witness.

422
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,810
Vic, follow up your gang lead.

423
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,810
I'm gonna track down the driver and his
señorita's Cayman Island connection.

424
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,910
Or is that gang related too?

425
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,210
Add units seven, eight and 10.
I don't want to...

426
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,362
...spit in the Grove without
hitting a police car.

427
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,510
- Put the Riot Squad on tactical alert.
- We found Melissa Kramer.

428
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,167
Where?

429
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,910
- You think she's in on it?
- I don't know.

430
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,010
Let's hope she's not down the disposal.

431
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,510
Forton brought
the woman here two hours ago.

432
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,310
They're in Room 19.
He had a bottle of champagne.

433
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,710
- To celebrate?
- Or to tenderise.

434
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,410
Police, freeze! Get your hands
where I can see them!

435
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,910
Oh, my God! Wait!
What did we do?!

436
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,810
- Wally Forton, you're under arrest...
- Stop it!

437
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,310
...for the murders of Violet Roosevelt
and Tanya Kramer.

438
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,910
- Murder? Wait a minute. What? Wally?
- They were just getting between us.

439
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,210
Read him his rights. Twice.

440
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,910
We're forever, baby. Forever!

441
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,310
They're dead?

442
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,710
- Caught the guy, huh?
- Yeah.

443
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,910
Nasty business
down there in the Grove.

444
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,810
Is that a joke?
Well, tell Gilroy I'm not laughing.

445
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,510
- What are you talking about?
- Like you don't know.

446
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:21,745
Pretend I don't.

447
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,810
Gilroy's diverted manpower
to other neighbourhoods.

448
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,810
Crime went down everywhere,
except the Grove.

449
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,610
Now he's letting me swing for
the department on these two murders.

450
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,610
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, now you do.

451
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,010
Tell me something.

452
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,410
What would be in it for someone
to buy up property in the Grove?

453
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,910
- Is this a real question?
- Pretend it is.

454
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,910
Well, that area's been ignored.
Crime's up. Land's cheap.

455
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,010
Other than that,
there's no reason to buy there.

456
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,210
- Why? Who's buying up land?
- No one. I'm just asking.

457
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,210
Did Gilroy say something?
I saw the two of you.

458
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,110
No, it's just a stupid idea.
If I get a good one, I'll let you know.

459
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,710
I was inflicted with homosexual urges
just like you.

460
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,210
I was tested constantly.

461
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,410
I used to think that I was gay,
that I had no other choice.

462
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,310
I even cursed God for doing it to me.

463
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,210
You ever heard of sexual-reorientation
therapy, Julien?

464
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,810
I read an article about it once.

465
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:36,110
Homosexuality is a disease
similar to alcoholism or drug addition.

466
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,110
The church offers programs
to combat these compulsions.

467
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,210
Through discipline, treatment, the
urges can be suppressed, eliminated.

468
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,810
- Really?
- I'm married to a beautiful woman.

469
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,510
I have a child on the way...

470
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,910
...and my wife and I both lead
a fulfilling, spiritual life.

471
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,010
- Is it that simple?
- No.

472
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,610
It takes hard work,
commitment, God's help.

473
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:08,510
- But I'm finally happy.
- Really a matter of what you wanna do.

474
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,110
- I don't wanna feel like dying.
- Jesus wants you to live, Julien.

475
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,410
- I'm tired of living like this.
- You don't have to anymore.

476
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,410
Oh, shit. Come on, now.
Come on, man. Come on!

477
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,910
Come on! Come on!
Oh, shit, man. No, no, no.

478
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,710
Come on, man. Grab him right there!

479
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,810
Oh, come on, now. No, no.
Sweet Jesus, just...

480
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,310
Get him right now! Underneath!
Underneath!

481
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,110
No! He doesn't know when he's down!
Get him. Come on!

482
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,010
Sweet Jesus! Come on, get up!

483
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,610
What the hell happened?

484
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,310
You lost, ése.

485
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,910
He's all right, man. I'm telling you.

486
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,210
Hey, Shane, man,
I'd like you to meet Pazi.

487
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,310
Gabo tells me you're interested
in making a trade.

488
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,510
Yeah, that's right.

489
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,510
- He was impressive.
- He's dead.

490
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,010
He is mismatched against that Jumper.
It's how he died that counts, huh?

491
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:35,980
Hey, man, he died good.

492
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,510
You gonna hook me up
with some firepower?

493
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,810
I need to see your other birds, Gomer.
Then we will talk, huh?

494
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,910
What's your grain mixture?

495
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,788
Sixteen percent protein,
10 percent whole corn...

496
00:34:57,893 --> 00:35:00,617
...and 9 percent scratch grain.

497
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,647
That's good.

498
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,110
- These all you brought with you?
- No, I got more back at the motel.

499
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,210
I got some Polaroids there on the front
seat if you wanna see them.

500
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,110
Hold it! Drop it, drop it! Drop it, ése.

501
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,704
Easy.

502
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,910
Drop it! Man, what are you thinking?
Get your hands where I can see them.

503
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,010
Dude, what are you doing?

504
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:41,179
I thought chloroform
was supposed to knock them out.

505
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,910
Guess this works better.

506
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,010
We were to wait until he
showed us the guns.

507
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,010
We take this guy in,
his case will be tied up for years.

508
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,010
I say we turn him over to the Mexicans,
where he'll be hung by his balls...

509
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,510
...and we make a few pesos
in the process.

510
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,110
- We were gonna play this one straight.
- How we changed our mind.

511
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,460
If you'll excuse me.

512
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,510
You've been manipulating police
resources...

513
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,510
...to crash land value
in this neighbourhood?

514
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,810
These flats have been
spiralling down for years, Vic.

515
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,710
Your mistress has been buying up
property in this area like she's Disney.

516
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,610
But it's not for her. It's for you.

517
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,810
Two women are dead because
of your little scam.

518
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,510
- And that banger?
- He had it coming.

519
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,510
You're playing violins
for these dope dealers now?

520
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,110
What's phase two?

521
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,610
Send me to clean up the area,
and you sell it off at a profit?

522
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,410
You and your boys
never supplement your income?

523
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,110
Look around, Ben. Where's the good
in what you're doing?

524
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,410
The good is, I'll cut you in.

525
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,810
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Gardner Bungalows, over Sunset.

526
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,810
- Just like the old days, huh?
- When do I start getting my paydays?

527
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,353
Soon. Real soon.

528
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:41,627
Hasta la vista, amigo. Different kind
of cockfighting where you're headed.

529
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,827
Yeah, you said it.

530
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:50,027
You lied to me, man. You lied.

531
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,427
I'm not doing anything
the Mack-man wouldn't.

532
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:54,727
- I'm just branching out.
- You lied to me.

533
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,927
Look, this is 25 G's, brother.

534
00:37:57,127 --> 00:38:00,327
Ten for you, 10 for me and five for Vic
because he's Vic.

535
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:03,027
- What about Ronnie?
- Screw Ronnie. He's off the clock.

536
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,327
If you don't want it, I'll share it
between me and Vic.

537
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:09,227
Look, you do this to me again,
I'm gonna kick your redneck ass.

538
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,927
Don't even give me that look, bro.

539
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:17,527
- I spoke to my reverend.
- Good for you. It helped?

540
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:20,827
God has a plan for me.
I'm gonna start this program...

541
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:24,927
...where I'm gonna be taught
how to reconnect with women.

542
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:29,927
- God's gonna make you straight?
- God's offering me a cure.

543
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:34,027
It's called sexual-reorientation therapy.
It really works.

544
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:38,527
You give me back my microwave.
I'm not kidding.

545
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:41,427
Pump your brakes, all right?
Welfare don't make you special.

546
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,727
- You got to pay like everybody else.
- I am not scared of you.

547
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:47,327
- Ma'am, what's the problem?
- He keeps taking our stuff...

548
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,927
...and make us buy it back.
That is my microwave!

549
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,127
- No, it ain't.
- Do you have any proof?

550
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:58,327
Sure. After he stole it the last time,
I carved my initials on the back.

551
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:02,176
E.B. That's me. Emily Berry.

552
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:06,327
Officer, she's lying.
E.B. Stands for excellent buy.

553
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,827
I mark all my best stuff like that.
How about my picture frame, then?

554
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:13,227
That is not your picture frame,
but you can get it for $10.

555
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:18,327
If that's your picture frame, how come
that's me and my granddaughter?

556
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:22,027
Dookie, you wanna turn around?

557
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,027
There's gotta be
some miscommunication...

558
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:26,727
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Oh, come on, grandma...

559
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,127
...ain't no love for Dookie?

560
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:29,527
None. Go.

561
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,827
All right, everybody.
Show's over. Come on.

562
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:34,627
Take what belongs to you
and just go on home.

563
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:38,527
Hey, come on. That's mine.
That's mine. That's my VCR.

564
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:43,627
- Come with me.
- What's the matter?

565
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:47,327
- Someone leaked the 911 tapes.
- Shit.

566
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,127
It's all over the press.
We got a situation brewing.

567
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:53,327
- Bad?
- When we get there, you do the talking.

568
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,027
Coming from you,
a plea for peace will sound more...

569
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,396
Black.

570
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,727
- What did you get on Gilroy?
- Checked out that hideaway.

571
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,127
- And?
- The mistress never checked in.

572
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:10,527
- Another lie? What is he doing?
- Maybe he stashed her someplace else.

573
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:13,127
- Or slashed her someplace else.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

574
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,627
- I took Gilroy for a quiet drunk.
- It's the quiet ones you worry about.

575
00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:19,327
He doesn't see a way out.
He just needs to calm down.

576
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:20,727
If that doesn't work, then what?

577
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,927
He's got you on the same hook
as him for that murder.

578
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,027
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me. Where are you?

579
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:30,427
- Still at work.
- Dinner's almost ready.

580
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,927
- I'm gonna have to miss dinner tonight.
- Vic.

581
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:35,127
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're kidding, right?

582
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:39,027
- Sweetheart, I can't make it.
- But Ben's already here.

583
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:42,527
- What?
- Come see the bowl I made in art class.

584
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:44,427
- Gilroy's there?
- In a second, Cass.

585
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:47,127
You invite him to dinner,
and you're not gonna show?

586
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,827
- Let me talk to him.
- Corrine!

587
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:51,627
Hey, buddy,
you gotta stop working so hard.

588
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,927
- What are you doing at my house?
- This case you're on, it's a dead end.

589
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:57,227
Ben, what are you doing?

590
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:01,827
- Why did you go looking for that girl?
- Hey, you lied to me.

591
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:05,427
- Where is she? Is she still alive?
- We were back in business.

592
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:08,427
- You should have just left it alone.
- I'll leave it alone now, Ben.

593
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:13,527
- No, you won't, Vic. I know you.
- Come see the bowl I made.

594
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,427
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Ben, this is between you and me.

595
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:20,827
- You leave my family out of this.
- You should have left Sedona out of it.

596
00:41:21,427 --> 00:41:24,227
- Spend more time with your family, Vic.
- You tell him.

597
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,431
- You'll lose them before you know it.
- Come on.

598
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:30,327
- You think about what you're doing.
- Here I come, doll.

599
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,183
No! No! Goddamn it!

600
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,627
The sheriffs can get there
faster than we can.

601
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:45,327
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

602
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:49,527
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

603
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:52,827
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

604
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,527
I know you're angry.
This is a serious problem.

605
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,927
- Be no problem in Beverly Hills.
- It won't be a problem here again.

606
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:03,027
- You have my word.
- Ain't no hour wait in Bel Air.

607
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:08,927
- We need to resolve this peacefully.
- Detective Wyms is right.

608
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,827
Violence will only undermine
what we need to do here.

609
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:15,227
- What we need is some new cops.
- What we need...

610
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:19,627
What we need is a new plan.
One that will protect all of us.

611
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,927
All units, pull back now.

612
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:32,627
Get the Riot Squad down here.

613
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:35,427
Get them down here now!

614
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:42,527
- Are you okay?
- Vic, what's going on? They broke in.

615
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,427
- Where are the kids?
- In here. Why are these sheriffs here?

616
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:49,027
- Where's Gilroy?
- He left. He said he'd take a rain check.

617
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:58,727
- Okay. Thanks, fellas. I appreciate it.
- Come on, let's go. I'll walk you out.

618
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,357
Let's go.

619
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:02,427
Daddy's okay.

620
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,327
Pack bags for you and the kids.
You're not staying here.

621
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:07,427
- What? This is our house.
- It isn't safe.

622
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,127
- Why not?
- I'll explain it later.

623
00:43:09,227 --> 00:43:13,427
- Explain now! What's going on?
- Corrine, don't ask questions. Do it!

624
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,816
Come on, come on.

625
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,927
He crossed the line, man.

626
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:21,517
He's done.

627
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:24,827
- Daddy.
- Hey, hey.

628
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:28,627
- Where are we going?
- It's okay, sweetie.

629
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:31,527
We're just gonna take a little trip.

630
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:06,827
Riot Guard. Let's go. Let's go.
Move. Come on.

631
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,428
Move. Let's move.

632
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:39,127
Pull back! Everybody pull back!

633
