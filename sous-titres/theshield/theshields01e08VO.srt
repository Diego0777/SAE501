1
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:05,024
One-tango-8,
in pursuit of a white, four-door...

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:08,619
...failing to yield, traveling eastbound,
approaching Alton.

3
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:11,665
One-tango-2,
we will be secondary in the pursuit.

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,493
Asking the Sergeant
for permission to take him out here.

5
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:20,837
One-tango-13, in the area,
paralleling the pursuit.

6
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,541
CHP's trying to get a tag strip here.

7
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:28,605
There's cross-traffic.
This is very dangerous.

8
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:32,514
They've stopped. He does not get hit,
goes through that intersection.

9
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:33,713
There's traffic up ahead.

10
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:37,224
He's gonna have to take
the wrong side of the road.

11
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,518
Julien!

12
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:44,724
Don't gun it! Too many people!

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,426
He's back on the wrong side.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,991
There's a vehicle!
That was nearly a collision....

15
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,732
"Farmington Cops
Investigated for Stealing Drugs"?

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,970
I was sick when I saw that.

17
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:59,979
The Chief dunked my balls
like doughnuts in his coffee!

18
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,674
Do you know how this got out?

19
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,341
Yeah! You leaked it!

20
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,475
Me?

21
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:07,077
You act like a crusading cop,
bucking the system.

22
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,178
We're all hurt by this.

23
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:11,747
I don't know your agenda,
but no one succeeds here by being anti-cop.

24
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:14,622
I'm anti-criminal,
even if they're wearing a badge.

25
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,856
I must've missed that quote in the paper.

26
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:20,058
What will you do about
the Strike Team? Suspend them?

27
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,068
What about innocent till proven guilty?

28
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:24,798
They can't be on the streets
with these charges pending.

29
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:27,898
And we can't suspend
decorated officers without due process!

30
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:31,001
Reassign the Strike Team
to the general detective pool.

31
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:32,545
Give them different partners.

32
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,673
In the meantime,
I'll see if I can figure out who leaked this.

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,217
Don't bother.

34
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,377
You want to pack your things now,
or would you like a few days?

35
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:44,322
"Firing the One Cop Who
Cares about Cleaning Up the Department."

36
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,519
I wonder how the Chief
would like that headline?

37
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,893
You got it all figured out, don't you?

38
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:01,132
Howdy, partner.

39
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,971
Slumming with us ordinary detectives?

40
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:05,274
Don't get too excited. It's just temporary.

41
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:07,041
Promises, promises.

42
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,945
Looks like we're running together today.

43
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:11,809
Yeah.

44
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,582
There's traffic up ahead.
He's trying to get....

45
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,187
North on Hoover.

46
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,452
He's coming our way.
Block this intersection.

47
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,757
When it's clear, pull out, cross the street.

48
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,994
-Shouldn't I follow?
-No, you're trailing.

49
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,835
Pull up and over, stay parallel.
They'll tell us when to converge.

50
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,345
Time to converge.

51
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:51,491
What the hell am I supposed to talk to
Shane Vendrell about all day?

52
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,356
It's good to shake things up.

53
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,987
I don't want to. I want my partner back.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,896
Aren't you sweet?
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

55
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:03,870
You're gonna miss me, too, right?

56
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:10,710
I called it in.

57
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,116
Danny.

58
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,825
Roman, pop the trunk.
Got it.

59
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,491
God!

60
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:38,796
God.

61
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,800
Could have used a higher sunscreen.

62
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,106
God!

63
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:59,311
The story's worse than you said.
It's all in there.

64
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,575
We're screwed.

65
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,518
Give me till the end of today,
this whole thing goes away.

66
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,782
What? We'll have to make this thing go...

67
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,957
...away.

68
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,424
Heard you guys
found yourselves a crispy critter.

69
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:13,292
It's a miracle he's alive.
Must have had it coming.

70
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:16,595
You got to piss someone off
to be tortured and stuck in a trunk.

71
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,191
Nobody deserves that.

72
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,693
He was probably a rat.

73
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:22,733
Back off, Shane!

74
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,672
Cut it out.
Julien's not a rat.

75
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,472
They run in packs now?
What is your problem?

76
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,375
Let's not make this into a bigger mess
than it already is!

77
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,513
Come on.

78
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:37,114
Come on!

79
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,883
Lay low, man. Do your work.

80
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,093
Leave this thing to me.

81
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm still here.

82
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:01,835
Julien.

83
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,106
I hear you.

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,875
You gotta help me out.

85
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,749
Nothing I can do.

86
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,341
How did that cop know about us?

87
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,886
I don't know.

88
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,290
I pulled some strings,
got you released until your court date.

89
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:23,260
-You did?
-Yeah.

90
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,200
I just need help with one thing first.

91
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,569
I'm filling out my arrest report,
and I'm a little confused.

92
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:33,234
When I busted in, it looked like
you had some cop's dick in your mouth.

93
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,542
That can't be right, can it?

94
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:39,139
You got something to say, say it to me.

95
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,376
Okay.

96
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:43,485
It's easy to make a mistake,
especially on a bust.

97
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,987
You think you see someone pocketing
two keys of coke instead of ammo.

98
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,126
-lt can be confusing.
-He's not confused about anything.

99
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:54,260
I'm not taking back my statement.

100
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,423
See?

101
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:00,030
And what you're saying that
he and me did, it never happened.

102
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,434
It never happened.
What?

103
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,235
Julien. Julien!

104
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,701
You heard him. It never happened.

105
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,646
-He needs me.
-Aren't you full of yourself?.

106
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,945
It's over.
That's not what he said!

107
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:16,680
That's what I say.
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

108
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,619
He doesn't need you complicating things.

109
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,254
Stay away.

110
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:21,791
You can't keep us apart.

111
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,357
I've seen your sheet.

112
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:26,924
Small time con men like you
only care about themselves.

113
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,788
Yeah, well, he cares about me.

114
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:31,164
You don't want me hauling you
in here all the time.

115
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,398
That's what you care about, so cut him off.

116
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,972
Man, look at this guy.

117
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,607
I ever get that bad,
pull the plug with both hands.

118
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:46,775
Not me.

119
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,142
What? You'd want that?

120
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,085
No, but it beats the alternative.

121
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:54,454
Just keep my machines juiced
until the Hoover Dam's out of business.

122
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:55,917
Detectives?

123
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:58,587
Dr. Crawford, how's the poor sap doing?

124
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:01,825
Third degree burns
over most of his body? He's gonna die.

125
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,561
Here are his things.

126
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:08,399
His skin showed traces
of red phosphorous and hydrogen chloride.

127
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,337
He blew himself up in a meth lab.

128
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,068
I see two, three of these a month.

129
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:16,078
Every bozo from here
to San Bernardino thinks he can cook crank.

130
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,873
Don't know what you're Boom!

131
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,680
Meth, courtesy of Cupid.

132
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,813
How lovely.

133
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,379
Meth's the drug of the day.

134
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,550
We've got a few ODs in the ER right now.

135
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,457
Could you take us down there for a look?

136
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:36,030
-He's tweeking.
-Third one today.

137
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,898
Could I see his belongings?
Over here.

138
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,835
May we see the patient's belongings,
please?

139
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,464
Thank you.

140
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,237
Call me if you get more.
I will.

141
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:48,905
Cupid's busy.

142
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,506
Looks like our mummy cooked up
some crap before blowing himself up.

143
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,746
Let's hope he's dumb and lazy.
No telling how much he churned out.

144
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,719
Got another college kid.

145
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:03,090
-How do you want to play this?
-We both have our own ways that work.

146
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,661
-Why don't we just take turns?
-Take turns?

147
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:08,524
We follow one lead your way,
follow the next one my way.

148
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,692
Your way won't land me in the papers,
will it?

149
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,965
-Don't believe everything you read.
-Okay. Who goes first?

150
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,266
Ladies go first.

151
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,773
All I know is the ID of the driver,
so let's start with his family.

152
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:19,900
Lead the way.

153
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,836
David.
Jorge.

154
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:25,473
-There's no turning back,
-I know I've burned some bridges.

155
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,710
Now's the time to build some new ones.

156
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:28,911
How so?

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,582
The good news...

158
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:34,212
...this headline is exactly what we needed
to brand you for the voters.

159
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,658
-lt came out well.
-I've decided to back you for City Council.

160
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,397
I was hoping that's what this was about.

161
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:43,190
Thank you.

162
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,168
I'd like you and Aurora
to join me for dinner tomorrow night.

163
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,328
Será un placer.

164
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,906
Bien. Bien.
You can meet the rest of your team then.

165
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,603
-I have a team?
-We have a lot of work ahead of us.

166
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,939
The neighborhood celebration
on Cinco de Mayo...

167
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,345
...will make a good
coming-out party for you.

168
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,575
Jorge?

169
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,819
I promise, I'm not in this to lose.

170
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,550
You can't afford to.

171
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,284
Don't believe everything you read.

172
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:13,292
You got to wonder
where they come up with this stuff.

173
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:15,423
-Anything break yet?
-Nope.

174
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:21,101
There's a crack den on Temple
due for a toss. You want to hit it?

175
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:25,267
I wish I could,
but I've got to go over some open files.

176
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,003
All righty, then.

177
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,810
Danny.

178
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:32,910
How was the sergeant's test?

179
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:36,386
I don't know. It's gonna be close.
I kind of froze a little.

180
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,045
I'll bet you did great.

181
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:41,575
Listen, pass or fail,
I do want to thank you for tutoring me.

182
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,950
Can I buy you dinner tomorrow?
Sure.

183
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,819
Great. Tomorrow night.
You pick the place.

184
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,726
-Can I help you?
-Yes. I'm looking for Detective Gannon.

185
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,964
I've been leaving him messages
for the last two months.

186
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,471
Detective Gannon retired last year.

187
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:06,305
He was investigating a case.

188
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,468
My husband was murdered.

189
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:12,977
Here. Have a seat.

190
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:14,515
Thank you.

191
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:18,850
I haven't heard anything in ages.

192
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,323
I couldn't understand
why he wasn't returning my calls.

193
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:22,416
What's your husband's name?

194
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,790
Kyle Kelner.

195
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,158
I'll pull the file.

196
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,662
I'll be right back.

197
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,398
So you lost your husband.

198
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:34,699
A year ago today.

199
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,107
I'm so sorry.

200
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,774
I don't understand.

201
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,970
I mean,
why would Andy run from the police?

202
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,377
He had a burn victim in his trunk...

203
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:46,340
...and methamphetamine in his pocket.

204
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,816
This doesn't make any sense.

205
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,487
This is from my daughter's
rubber stamp kit.

206
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,685
You didn't know your husband
was involved?

207
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,854
He's a web page designer,
not a drug dealer.

208
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:02,190
He and his friend Eric
had been looking for jobs...

209
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:05,030
...ever since the company
they worked for had gone bust.

210
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,160
Who's Eric?

211
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,770
Andy and Eric went to college together.

212
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,068
I tried to reach him
when I saw the chase on TV...

213
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:14,111
...but I can't get a hold of him anywhere.

214
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:16,738
I'm afraid I might know where to find Eric.

215
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:21,476
I can't even look at him like that.

216
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,778
It was a meth lab explosion.

217
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,247
What?

218
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,516
Meth lab?

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,724
I knew that my brother
was having money problems...

220
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:34,258
...but how was I supposed to help him?

221
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:38,698
He's the one who went to college.
Now they're asking me to end his life.

222
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,032
What do I do?

223
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,707
Look, thanks for standing up for me earlier.

224
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:50,372
That's what partners do,
even if you don't agree.

225
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,506
Don't agree with them?

226
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:54,745
Look, this is a brotherhood.
Everybody here knows that but you.

227
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,549
-You don't know what I've been through.
-You don't tell me.

228
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,648
Decide if you want to stay partners.
If you do, start opening up.

229
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,750
If you don't, talk to Aceveda.

230
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,226
Car's clean.

231
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:10,801
He already turned me down
when I asked him for a new partner.

232
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:13,166
Maybe he'll give you a different answer.

233
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,803
There's an unserved warrant.

234
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,602
Year-old lottery ticket.
Weight Watchers coupon.

235
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,540
Like that lard ass would ever use it.

236
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,942
He just dumped
his desk drawer into this box.

237
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:26,575
The clock ran out on this case a year ago.
I'm not shoveling the ice off the clue trail.

238
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,586
We owe it to her.
No, Gannon owes her.

239
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,121
You want me to fly solo?

240
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:35,450
No. Looks like it's the only action
I'm gonna get today.

241
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,583
Excuse me?

242
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:39,425
The "I lost my husband
but I'm still young and hot...

243
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,795
"...and need of an emotional release"
kind of sex?

244
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,128
You're kidding, right?

245
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,326
What?

246
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,933
You've never covered
an accident or homicide...

247
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,529
...and gone back a month later
for a statement?

248
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,106
This one's been hanging
on the vine for a year.

249
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,734
She is ripe.

250
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,147
Just give me two minutes, Fran!

251
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:06,917
She say you only last two minutes!

252
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,585
About as long as it'll take me
to whup your ass!

253
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:13,922
I'm telling you what!
Why you wanna go there?

254
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,795
Wait a minute. You guys again?

255
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:19,935
Weren't you with you,
and we busted you for slashing his tires?

256
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,266
Man, that was in the past!

257
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,432
Today you need to arrest him
for trespassing!

258
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:26,738
You got to own something
for me to trespass, welfare nigger!

259
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:30,406
My job is getting nasty with Fran.
Fran, don't do this!

260
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:32,506
We together now! What you want?

261
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,312
Let me talk! Give me two minutes, girl!

262
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:36,683
-You don't have two.
-Then give me one minute!

263
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,153
We're through, Hooper!

264
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,621
Fran, don't do this!

265
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,419
She won't give you the time of day.

266
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:45,326
Stop! He don't deserve you, girl!
Get on inside. Come on.

267
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:47,387
Come on, now! Don't do this, baby!

268
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:48,926
Querida?

269
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:53,298
I'm finishing the marketing plan.
It has to be done before I fly to Houston.

270
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,736
Don't think you're getting any.

271
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,069
Is that any way to talk
to the next City Councilman?

272
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,672
My God. Machado said yes?

273
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:02,235
We're having dinner
tomorrow night to meet the team.

274
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,645
The team? David!

275
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:07,412
I can't believe it.

276
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,579
Why aren't you more excited?

277
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:11,549
This is my shot.

278
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,958
I won't get another.
You won't need another.

279
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,628
Power is an aphrodisiac.

280
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:23,425
Died about 20 minutes ago. Second, so far.

281
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:27,137
Third one scrambled his brains.
And all from the same college.

282
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:30,307
We better find this stuff,
or you'll be stacking them higher.

283
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:31,568
Ambulances bring them in?

284
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,610
All but that one.
Who brought him?

285
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,408
That guy over there.

286
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:43,179
Police. You knew the OD victim?

287
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:46,648
He was rushing my frat.
I'm the Pledge Master.

288
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:48,824
This part of Rush Week?

289
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:54,656
-My father's a lawyer.
-Mine was a bricklayer. So what?

290
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:58,662
Fowler, Kaufman & Rose.
You want to talk to me, talk to them.

291
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:03,200
We are definitely doing this one my way.

292
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,639
Get the hell off me!

293
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:11,172
You wanted him to be your brother?
Yeah.

294
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,216
Kiss your brother.
Stop that!

295
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,218
Where'd he get the meth?
Please, no!

296
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,384
-Where'd he get it?
-I don't know!

297
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:19,082
Fine! Kiss your brother again!

298
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,288
We gave it to all the pledges!

299
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:24,156
It was supposed to be funny,
sending them to class on speed!

300
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:26,219
Jesus!
Where'd you get it from?

301
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,389
Effi!

302
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,657
Effi Montecito!

303
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,758
He deals to all the frats.

304
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,261
Good.

305
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:36,199
Now let me show you
how we haze our pledges.

306
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,816
Detective Gannon left a long list of TBIs.

307
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,043
"To be interviewed."

308
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,370
So we're starting from scratch.

309
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,182
What exactly was your husband's business?

310
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,847
Property management.

311
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,180
He owned condos, rented them out.

312
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,418
And he was found at a construction site?

313
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,761
Yeah. He and his partner Ari
were building a new complex.

314
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,854
Was he meeting someone?

315
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,399
I don't know.

316
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,266
I had just gotten home
from my parents' when the police called.

317
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,867
-I'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

318
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,911
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

319
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,471
Look, I'll get you some chips.

320
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,605
Thanks.

321
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,755
Have you talked to anyone,
like a grief counselor?

322
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,846
Didn't help.

323
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,754
I know some that are very good.

324
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,356
I don't know. It's already been a year.

325
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,490
I'm sure it feels like it was yesterday
when you got that call.

326
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,764
Our dealer Effi's a 25-year-old
still living in his old frat house.

327
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,705
-Can't seem to grow up.
-He'll grow up fast in San Quentin.

328
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,798
Real fast.

329
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,742
It'll take a few hours
to get the warrant. I'll start.

330
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,542
Not a problem.
I got some errands to run, anyway.

331
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,353
What's going on?
This IAD thing's still hanging out there.

332
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,156
-I told you. I'm not changing my statement.
-I'm willing to keep your secret.

333
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,992
-Sure, you are.
-I am!

334
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,462
What do you think,
I want to twist your arm?

335
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,262
-All you got to do is--
-Lie?

336
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,462
It's not a lie. You made a mistake.

337
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,335
We put boxes of ammo in that bag,
not bricks of coke.

338
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,069
I know what ammo looks like,
and blackmail, too.

339
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,068
It's not gonna work.
I got nothing to lose.

340
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,438
My guys have taken fire
from every scumbag in town.

341
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,747
They're going down because some rookie
thinks he saw something?

342
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,343
I did see something.

343
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,319
I'm not gonna let you destroy their lives.

344
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,751
So you're gonna try and destroy mine?

345
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,691
You're not giving me any choice.

346
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,797
Handing in this arrest report's
the only way I can stop you...

347
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,265
...from making a huge mistake.

348
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,564
That report doesn't prove anything.

349
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,006
I don't have to prove you're gay.

350
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,304
In this house, all I got to do is say it...

351
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,268
...and all the gory details.

352
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,394
There you go.
All right.

353
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,606
Vic!

354
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,878
I'm not sure they stole any drugs.

355
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,441
What?

356
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,850
It was dark. They were
at the other end. My view was obstructed.

357
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,912
You never said your view was obstructed.

358
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,918
It was.

359
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,791
You didn't see Mackey put bricks
of cocaine into a weapons bag?

360
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,056
I can't be positive.

361
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,860
You didn't see
Shane Vendrell drive off with that bag?

362
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,730
I don't know for sure what was in it.

363
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,632
-Mackey got to you.
-No.

364
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,830
He threatened you.
We can get him for that.

365
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,065
He didn't.

366
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,872
Then what?

367
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,643
Maybe I let his reputation
cloud my judgment.

368
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,446
Question. "Are you positive
it was two kilos of cocaine?"

369
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,005
Answer. "Yes. "

370
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,978
I'm not sure anymore.

371
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,419
Julien, failure to report corruption...

372
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,549
...and giving false testimony
are both serious offenses.

373
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,857
I'll accept whatever punishment I have to.

374
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,568
Sorry to disappoint you.

375
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,242
Yeah!

376
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,845
I told you it would go away.

377
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,390
-How'd you get him to back off?.
-I reasoned with the man.

378
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,119
You are my personal hero.

379
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,352
Get out.

380
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,955
Sure, boss. I got a big case I'm working.

381
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,136
-What did you do to him?
-To who?

382
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,499
Officer Lowe.

383
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,037
Nothing. Is he okay?

384
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,479
He changed his statement.
IAD hasn't notified me.

385
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,119
If anything happens to him....

386
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,815
Can't see why it would.

387
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,819
Listen, I got to run.
I'm touring a school for my kid.

388
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,089
Sorry your headlines got screwed up.

389
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,230
What now?

390
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,604
Look at this.

391
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,196
"Hoe"?

392
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:47,972
Goddamn bastard
call her that for everybody to see.

393
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,431
How do you know Hooper did this?

394
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,475
Hooper's not a very good speller.

395
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:56,672
Look it over. Sign right there.

396
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,947
-So he can't come within 10 feet?
-That's a restraining order.

397
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:02,713
-This complaint can justify it.
-What if he comes near me?

398
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:05,448
Then I'll make him my bitch. Now sign it.

399
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,816
-Sometimes I see him at the Vons.
-Vons? What Vons?

400
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,259
-He helps with my shopping.
-Helps you with your shopping? Hell, no!

401
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,796
That stops right here!

402
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,798
Back off. Just let her think it through.

403
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,026
She don't need to think.

404
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,260
-She needs to sign it!
-Okay.

405
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:20,902
It's all good.

406
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,136
So you were Kyle Kelner's
business partner.

407
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,932
Until he died.

408
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,539
Where were you on the night he died?

409
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,405
I told the detective last year.
I was in Phoenix on business.

410
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,145
Why are you just getting around
to Kyle's murder now?

411
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:39,416
Unfortunately, the file
slipped through a crack in the system.

412
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:43,252
Judging from today's newspaper,
I'm surprised any crack slips past you guys.

413
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,025
Those are just allegations.

414
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,491
Sure. Got to stick up for your own.
I understand.

415
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:53,927
He got along with everyone.

416
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:56,837
Nice, funny, a great boss, you know?

417
00:21:57,174 --> 00:22:01,440
Wish I could find another one like him.
I haven't had a decent job since he died.

418
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,703
Must be real tough on you.

419
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,274
Yeah.
Yeah.

420
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,449
It's times like this when you need
someone to lean on...

421
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,182
...like a husband or boyfriend.

422
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,289
I'm single.

423
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,094
Our specialized care is made
to meet the needs of autistic children...

424
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:23,758
...including speech,
occupational, behavior therapies.

425
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,563
The facilities are really nice.

426
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,900
I read that if you put a kid
with other autistic kids...

427
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,100
...it keeps them from socializing,
sort of lowering the bar.

428
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:33,841
Some people think that...

429
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,674
...but we've seen that autistic children
progress best...

430
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:39,238
...in a small class
with other kids their own level.

431
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,615
How does this compare with the
public schools? The pilot programs?

432
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:45,814
You risk Matthew being put
in a typical class with an aide.

433
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,117
What's wrong with that?

434
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,715
Throwing him in the pool
won't teach him to swim.

435
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:53,226
Here, Matthew will be a leader,
he'll gain more confidence.

436
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,554
So he won't be behind anymore.

437
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:58,662
We have one spot available.
It's sure to go quickly.

438
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:00,532
$25,000 is pretty steep.

439
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:02,532
Our services aren't cheap...

440
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:05,697
...but you ask any of the parents here,
they'll tell you it's worth it.

441
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,266
It seems wonderful.

442
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,677
I know it's an important decision,
but I suggest you make it quickly.

443
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,078
Excuse me.

444
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:17,586
Julien.
Reverend, why are you here?

445
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:21,590
Your captain said you were struggling
with a decision and need spiritual guidance.

446
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:23,785
For some reason,
thought I might be able to help.

447
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,886
Come on. Police stations
make me nervous. I need a smoke.

448
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:31,297
I went back on my statement
because I'm not sure what I saw.

449
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,529
Why did you sign it in the first place?

450
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:36,805
I don't know.
Too eager to do the right thing?

451
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,931
I overreacted.

452
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,603
I know an overreactor when I see one.
That's not you.

453
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,669
What's going on, Julien?

454
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,678
What do you do when the man that you are
isn't the man that you want to be?

455
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:52,415
Give the man
that you are a kick in the ass.

456
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,823
What's stopping you?

457
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,391
Nothing. I'll be all right.

458
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:03,327
Only thing better than unfiltered smoke...

459
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,424
...unfiltered prayer.

460
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:09,204
Just you and God, no secrets...

461
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,702
...nothing in between.

462
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,734
See you Sunday?

463
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:16,971
Yeah.

464
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:23,585
Okay, come on, boys.

465
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,052
Of course.
You want to go in there unprotected?

466
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:33,052
Let's go, ladies. Who's up?
Are you serious?

467
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:34,824
Tim, you just volunteered.

468
00:24:39,536 --> 00:24:40,798
Who's that?

469
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,664
Who the hell are you?
Decency police.

470
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:47,642
Let me guess, Effi Montecito?

471
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,204
Yeah.
You're coming with us.

472
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,372
What?

473
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:58,778
This one we do my way.
If you feel we have time for that.

474
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,382
I thought screwing sheep
went out with New Wave.

475
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,027
We wouldn't really make them do it.
Right.

476
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:07,563
We just wanted to see who would.

477
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,828
Wait, you dragged
my son here for a schoolboy prank?

478
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:13,335
Your son's here
on suspicion of drug trafficking.

479
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:16,205
What?
Dad, it's not true.

480
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:18,741
So far, three students
at Mission Cross Hospital...

481
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,299
...have died from your Cupid crystal meth.

482
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,302
That wasn't mine.

483
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,441
Apparently he supplies half
of fraternity row.

484
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:30,611
We have to get his latest batch
off the street before more kids die.

485
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,314
You're dealing drugs again?

486
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:34,186
Dad, they can't prove anything.

487
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:36,020
You're 25 years old!

488
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,489
Grow up, will you?
You stupid son of a bitch!

489
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:41,621
-What the hell's the matter with you?
-Stop!

490
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,928
Your stuff has killed somebody!

491
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:49,996
Guard!

492
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:52,439
You know
what you're doing to your family?

493
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,773
Go on! Let them take you!

494
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,142
Go on, you stupid piece of shit!

495
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,582
You see if I'm gonna bail you out this time!

496
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,784
I like doing things your way.

497
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,835
I told them to take the life support away.

498
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:16,701
Son, I don't mean
to be disingenuous, but I'm sorry.

499
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:20,939
What's disingenuous mean?
Means you're under arrest.

500
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:24,316
-For what?
-For shaking and baking crystal meth.

501
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,082
I don't know anything about that.

502
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:27,555
We talked to Effi.

503
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:29,922
He rolled on you, you roll on him.

504
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:34,221
Eric was mixing up a batch,
and it exploded...

505
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:37,332
...and he was screaming. His flesh was....

506
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:40,594
We couldn't take him to the hospital.

507
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:43,098
So you tossed him in the trunk.

508
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,505
Andy was gonna bury him in the desert.

509
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:47,099
He was still alive.

510
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:50,578
We thought that he would die
by the time that we got there.

511
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:52,581
Exactly how stupid are you?

512
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:55,641
You're six credits shy of graduating
for the last four years.

513
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,846
You're a drug dealer
who spends his free time...

514
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:01,118
...watching pledges hump sheep,
and he's the stupid one?

515
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,557
Any more bad crank still out there?

516
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:06,027
Only the stuff that Manny's
holding for collateral.

517
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:07,495
Who's Manny?

518
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:11,091
He's who we borrowed
the money from to start the meth lab.

519
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:15,194
When we couldn't pay right away,
he smashed up my hand...

520
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:17,771
...and he took half of the drugs as collateral.

521
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,103
How much is half?.

522
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,570
10 pounds.

523
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,212
There's still 10 pounds
of this shit out there?

524
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,508
Goddamn it.

525
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,679
If he hadn't of threatened us,
Eric wouldn't have rushed the last batch...

526
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:32,244
...and he would still be alive.

527
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,880
Who is this Manny guy?

528
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:35,848
Manny Sandoval.

529
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:39,061
Manny Sandoval skated
two murders I should have had him for.

530
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,097
I've wanted this bastard for a year.

531
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,223
If he's so bad,
how come I never heard of him?

532
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,700
Supercop,
you know every criminal on the street?

533
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,600
After we catch this guy, I will.

534
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,731
You want me to give you $20,000?

535
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,435
You can't be serious.

536
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,534
That's what our meth men owe this Manny.

537
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,903
They're both willing to wear a wire.

538
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,744
Nail him at the drop,
get the bad dope out of circulation.

539
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:02,979
Stop. You're under investigation
for stealing drugs.

540
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,147
I should give you cash?
Don't give it to Vic.

541
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:09,123
Give it to me so we can save some lives.

542
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:12,386
When do you need it?

543
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:13,755
Tomorrow.

544
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,596
So long as we're clear,
I'm giving the money to you.

545
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:23,771
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

546
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,035
I tried to call, but the phone's disconnected.

547
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:27,133
Yeah.

548
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:32,141
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. I just, forgot to pay the bill.

549
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:34,308
But it'll be on in a couple of days, so....

550
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,945
No problem.

551
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,852
I need to check on one thing,
and I'll be out of your hair.

552
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,720
Did your husband
have business ties to Phoenix?

553
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,790
I don't think so.

554
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:46,086
I know Ari has family there.

555
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:47,788
Your husband's partner?

556
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:51,425
Yeah. He was visiting them
the night that Kyle was killed.

557
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:56,200
I called one of those
grief counselors you recommended.

558
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:57,364
Yeah?

559
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:00,073
Have an appointment on Tuesday.

560
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:03,111
Good. I'm glad.

561
00:29:04,948 --> 00:29:08,281
-Thank you.
-Detective, do you have to....

562
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,609
Thanks...

563
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:13,454
...for taking care of this.

564
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:15,517
Thanks.

565
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,121
My pleasure.

566
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:18,992
Good night.

567
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,154
'Bye.

568
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,863
I called the Reverend Cook
because I was worried.

569
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:27,795
I know this is tough.
You shouldn't have.

570
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:30,164
I don't know what Mackey did or said...

571
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,239
...but I know it took fortitude
to come forward in the first place.

572
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:37,674
Where's that fortitude now?
I made a mistake.

573
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:39,615
Yes, you have...

574
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,115
...and I want to help you rectify it.

575
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,085
I don't want your help.

576
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:47,188
You should contact your PBA rep.

577
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:51,218
You're facing suspension,
probably termination.

578
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,760
I wish you'd gone down a different way.

579
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:02,127
We can skip the trip
to Lake Powell this year.

580
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:05,299
I can go back to work at the ER,
pick up some shifts per diem.

581
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,969
And spend half
the money you make on day care.

582
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,306
We'll lose that spot.

583
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:12,246
He'll go to school in the real world,
learn to socialize.

584
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:15,580
I want him in Glenridge.
He'll be happy there. I know it.

585
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:17,347
You know it, too.

586
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:21,088
All right. Call them tomorrow.

587
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:23,583
I'll have to pick up extra shifts.

588
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,991
We barely see you enough now.

589
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:28,758
What do you want from me?
I'm not mad. We just miss you.

590
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,018
Matthew ruined my notebook.

591
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:33,834
Let me see.

592
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,427
You know what?
We'll get you a new one, okay?

593
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,098
Why does he do stuff like that?
He never listens.

594
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,540
Matthew listens.
He just understands things differently.

595
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,175
Come here.

596
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:48,873
See how you make your letters so neat...

597
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,373
...get them to fit inside the lines?

598
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:52,509
Yeah.

599
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:54,347
Matthew...

600
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,184
...he doesn't know how to make things fit.

601
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,721
He needs help with that kind of stuff.

602
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,322
Big sister help?

603
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,728
Yeah. Big sister help. Come here.

604
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,164
Big sister help.

605
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:14,735
It'll be okay.

606
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,968
It's not okay. You don't deserve this.

607
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,603
So much for riding that headline
onto the City Council.

608
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,375
-You're more than just that headline.
-Not to Machado.

609
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:27,511
-When he hears that the case fell apart--
-If he backs out, what happens to your job?

610
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:28,918
Gilroy's getting squeezed.

611
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,548
First chance he gets,
he's gonna take it out on me.

612
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,617
There's got to be something you can do.

613
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,161
I can't think of what.

614
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,564
I really thought this was my shot.

615
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,434
I'm so sorry.

616
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,965
I knew twice in one day
was too much to hope for.

617
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:54,973
"Shoe"?

618
00:31:57,617 --> 00:31:59,107
What are you doing here?

619
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,912
-I told you, I only needed two minutes.
-He bumped into me at the Vons.

620
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,384
Who painted that "S"?

621
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,950
I couldn't scrub off "hoe,"
so I figured that was the next best thing.

622
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,863
-Why are we here?
-Lamar slashed my tires again.

623
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,194
He gets jealous.

624
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,861
I want my name
off that restraining order...

625
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,426
...and put Lamar's name on there.

626
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,473
-That's not gonna be a problem, is it?
-You, come with me.

627
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,537
We hooked up at the Vons!

628
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,875
Apparently,
these guys will do anything for you.

629
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,919
They're serious,
and you're leading them on.

630
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,010
I am not.

631
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,487
Yeah, you are.
Now stop stringing them along.

632
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,618
Just pick one and stick with him.

633
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,917
It's the right thing to do.

634
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,863
Go to Phoenix often, Ari?

635
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,357
Sometimes.

636
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,764
Who did you meet
the night that Kyle was killed?

637
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,233
A business acquaintance.

638
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:52,097
Did you have dinner?

639
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:55,238
No, I got in around 9:30. We had drinks.

640
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,871
Did you get a chance to see your family?

641
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,306
Family?

642
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:04,409
No, not that trip.

643
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,611
9:30. So, you were on the 8:00 flight?

644
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:08,813
Exactly.

645
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,617
I checked the flight manifests.

646
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:13,084
Your flight flew out at 10:00.

647
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,852
You want to tell me something, Ari?

648
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,161
You did it, ass wipe! Say it!

649
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,995
Yes, I killed him!

650
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,536
I didn't plan it!

651
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:27,835
He just found out I was stealing money
from our joint account.

652
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:31,900
He accused me.
I got scared, and I just killed him.

653
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:34,310
I didn't have a plan. I didn't have an alibi.

654
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,543
Why didn't you guys arrest me last year?

655
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,819
That rocked! Man, you set him up...

656
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,721
...I knocked him down.

657
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,260
Yeah. You are great.

658
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:55,362
Don't you just once
wish you worked for Beverly Hills P.D.?

659
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:57,599
I'll bet you their wires work.

660
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,729
You don't like the WWII hand-me-downs?

661
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:03,002
You guys still owe me $20--
The lab exploded.

662
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,100
Not my problem.
You want the drugs?

663
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,241
30 percent.
Damn. Did he say it?

664
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,304
I can't hear.

665
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,379
Your brother blew up--
'Cause of you, son of a bitch!

666
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,117
Stop, you goddamn crazy kid! My eye!

667
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,522
He'd still be alive....

668
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:23,821
What is this, is this a bug?

669
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:28,166
You taping me, bitch? You taping me?

670
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,259
I'm gonna kill you.
Drop it!

671
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,303
Don't make me kill you!

672
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,505
Self-defense, man!
Crazy bastard was trying to kill me!

673
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,068
Paul just attacked him.
He ruined everything.

674
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,581
-I told you, he's stupid.
-He killed Eric!

675
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,473
Okay, he killed my brother!

676
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,489
This doesn't screw up my deal, does it?

677
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:52,541
Your informant attacks me
while working a case for you?

678
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,638
My lawyer will buy a new home off of this.

679
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:57,582
-You were ready to kill Paul!
-But I didn't.

680
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:01,712
-And even if I did, it was self-defense.
-Why don't we let a jury sort that out?

681
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,124
Some kids croaked on meth, right?

682
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:08,392
You put me behind bars,
not only won't those charges stick...

683
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:11,158
...there's a good chance
that stuff gets on the street.

684
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:12,892
You sick bastard.

685
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,000
Only when I have to be.

686
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:18,033
We gonna help each other out, or what?

687
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:23,166
Why would Ari kill him?

688
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:25,641
He was siphoning off money
from the business.

689
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:28,875
Kyle caught him red-handed.
He was gonna blow the whistle.

690
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:38,616
-Thank you, detectives.
-Don't mention it. It's our job.

691
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:44,324
I'll check in on you in a few weeks,
just to make sure you're doing okay.

692
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:50,061
I hope you keep that appointment.
This is a lot to take in, I know.

693
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,169
I thought I'd be okay,
knowing what happened.

694
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,002
It doesn't make it any better.

695
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,336
It doesn't change anything.

696
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:04,379
He's still not gonna be there
when I get home, is he?

697
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:07,816
I just don't want to be alone anymore.

698
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,452
Listen, Danny, I know this
is short notice, but I have to break our....

699
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:17,359
Cancel our dinner tonight.

700
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,796
Everything all right?

701
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:21,129
Yeah. A friend of mine's having a crisis.

702
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:22,633
It's no problem.

703
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:23,727
I'm really sorry.

704
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,364
I'll just work a double.
I can use the extra cash.

705
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,135
Great. We'll do it soon.

706
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,938
They swept the whole area.

707
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:33,445
Garbage cans, dumpsters,
crawl spaces, nothing.

708
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,708
-What about his place?
-No cupid in sight.

709
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,773
Ten pounds of junk is out there.

710
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:40,411
Enough to kill dozens,
and he's holding all the cards.

711
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:43,479
This might be a good time
for us to start doing things my way.

712
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:45,422
And what way would that be, exactly?

713
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:47,887
Captain. Didn't see you there.

714
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,323
Someone should put a bell
around your neck.

715
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,398
Where are we with this meth thing?

716
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,526
Between a rock and a hard place.

717
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:58,162
Looks like we're
gonna have to do this Manny's way.

718
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,734
The drugs were
right where you said they'd be.

719
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,207
Lucky guess.

720
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:08,074
You're welcome for the public service.

721
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:13,950
Pleasure doing business with you.

722
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:16,114
You picked the right day
to cross paths with me.

723
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:18,783
I was handcuffed.
You guys got a lot of rules.

724
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:20,258
You know something?

725
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,558
You might not have pulled any triggers...

726
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:24,995
...but a lot of people
are dead because of you.

727
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:27,590
You're on my radar now.
Okay.

728
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:30,765
Trust me...

729
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,439
...that's not a good thing.

730
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:36,704
Just have fun tonight.
They're all dying to meet you.

731
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:38,239
That's why I'm here.

732
00:37:38,812 --> 00:37:41,406
It kills me, Jorge,
but this whole thing fell apart.

733
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:45,446
The key witness got cold feet.
The investigation's dead.

734
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,649
I wanted you to hear it from me.

735
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:51,523
That's not ideal.

736
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:57,162
But it's not disaster, either.
David, people remember the headlines.

737
00:37:57,464 --> 00:37:59,989
Most times,
they don't even read past them.

738
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:04,160
-This being politics....
-Perception is reality.

739
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:05,534
Learning fast.

740
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:09,105
Don't worry about it,
I live up to my promises.

741
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:12,270
You're my man. Get used to it.
I see you at 8:00.

742
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:17,108
How'd things go with Mackey today?

743
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,311
Fine.
Good.

744
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:23,386
I missed you, too, okay? You happy?

745
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:26,488
It doesn't matter to me.

746
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:28,626
How was your day?

747
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:31,991
Shane wants to hit
the monster truck rally on Friday.

748
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:48,178
Got to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna talk.

749
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:51,282
Not about anything they heard from me.

750
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:52,877
Hey.

751
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,151
It might not feel like it...

752
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:57,520
...but you did the right thing yesterday.

753
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:59,423
I'm not gay.

754
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,756
-Julien, come on.
-I'm not.

755
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:08,462
It's this thing inside of me.

756
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:11,596
I push it down, it goes away...

757
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,870
...but then it comes back stronger.

758
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:18,034
I shove it down again,
but it just keeps on coming back...

759
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:20,841
...till I don't
have the strength to push anymore.

760
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:23,240
God.

761
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:26,875
I am so weak.

762
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:31,085
I hate this thing inside of me.

763
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:34,655
Julien.

764
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:39,088
You can't go through life
hating who you are.

765
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:41,358
I pushed away everyone...

766
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,165
...my partner, my reverend, Tomas.

767
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:46,645
I'm alone.

768
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:48,930
No, you're not.

769
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,533
You were there for me.

770
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:54,772
I'm there for you.

771
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:05,341
It is so nice
to have someone else cook dinner.

772
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,745
It smells incredible.

773
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,347
Thanks.

774
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,355
One of the keys is basil.

775
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:17,659
You have to add it just before it's done,
otherwise you'll cook the flavor out of it.

776
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,891
-We wouldn't want to do that.
-No.

777
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,103
Strainer?

778
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,073
Today has been very emotional for you.

779
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:37,948
There's a lot of delayed grief...

780
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,416
...pent up confusion, misplaced feelings.

781
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:44,147
I'm not gonna take advantage of that.

782
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,652
You wouldn't be.

783
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,727
Hey.

784
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,372
What's up?

785
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:02,409
This whole IAD thing....

786
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,073
I shut you out. Looks like I was wrong.

787
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,447
This thing confused a lot of people.

788
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:10,710
Yeah, I know. It killed my partnership.

789
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:13,878
It's not too late. He's a good kid.

790
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:17,022
Maybe he deserves a second chance.

791
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:18,556
Most of us do.

792
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,558
I'll see you.
Right.

793
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,701
Sir.
Danny.

794
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:34,269
The Strike Team's back in business,
effective tomorrow.

795
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:37,242
Did you ever have any doubt?
I did this time.

796
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,411
I'm tired, Vic.

797
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:50,549
I just can't keep explaining these messes
or cleaning up after them.

798
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,817
Ben.

799
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:54,984
I'm not gonna let myself get burned.

800
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,290
We're done, Vic.

801
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:03,859
I just can't have your back anymore.

802
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:09,806
I thought I owed it to you to tell you.
