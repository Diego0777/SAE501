1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,831
911. What's your emergency?
I've got an officer down!

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,103
Could you repeat that?
This is Detective Vic Mackey!

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,940
An officer's down!
You have an officer down.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,811
The goddamn police radio
in the van isn't working.

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,477
What's the officer's condition?
Condition? He's dying!

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,816
We're in a...
I have the address.

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,823
Where are we?
An ambulance is en route.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,290
I'm coming!

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,485
Detective?

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,456
Detective?

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,663
He was about 10, 15 feet
in front of me and Shane...

12
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,462
...when I hear this gunshot,
and I see Terry go down.

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,695
Jesus.

14
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,394
Shane and I turn the corner,
and we see the guy in this back bathroom.

15
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,067
He gets off a few rounds. We hit back.

16
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,768
At least you killed the prick.

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,136
Hey.

18
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,112
Terry's a tough son of a bitch.
He's gonna be okay.

19
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,283
What happened?

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,698
- Terry's down?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,367
How is he?
Took a head shot.

22
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,229
Yeah.

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,510
I didn't clear the room.

24
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,818
I was point.
The first thing you do is clear the room.

25
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,443
We both missed him.

26
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,102
At 1:29 a.m., Detective Terry Crowley...

27
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,603
...was admitted for a single
gunshot wound to the face.

28
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,107
Surgeons made...

29
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,703
...every attempt to resuscitate him.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,008
Shit.

31
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,917
Ultimately,
their attempts were unsuccessful.

32
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:03,188
Detective Crowley was pronounced dead
at 2:13 this morning.

33
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,652
No!

34
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,985
Damn.

35
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,306
I'm responsible.

36
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,983
I'm responsible.

37
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,890
Responsible how?

38
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,192
It was my operation, and I called the shots.

39
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:48,661
What could you have done differently?

40
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,564
Terry asked me to move him up.

41
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,434
- He was part of your team.
- He wasn't ready for this.

42
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,804
Eight years as a cop,
a stint in robbery, two commendations.

43
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,242
Sounds to me like he was ready.
Strike Team's different.

44
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,605
Really?

45
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:04,705
We knock down the doors
other cops don't want to.

46
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:08,780
My guys accept the risk
because they know I will take care of them.

47
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:13,621
We go out on a mission, I expect
every single one of them to come home.

48
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,685
Anything else is unacceptable.

49
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:22,060
Why so long?
They're asking questions.

50
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,432
Yeah, how many questions can they have?

51
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,768
How would it look if I.A.D.
only took five minutes to decide?

52
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,170
They have to be thorough.

53
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,505
Aceveda's gonna use
this to shut us down.

54
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,307
Aceveda's a water boy. He can't do dick.

55
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,971
Why is it taking him so long?

56
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,573
This is the last time.
I answered your question.

57
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,911
Detective Vendrell.

58
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,578
Yeah, that's me.

59
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,959
Just tell them what happened.

60
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:49,818
Yeah.

61
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,736
What are you doing back here?

62
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,836
Not our crime scene anymore.

63
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,508
I.A.D. gave us a friendly shove.
You didn't shove back?

64
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,210
Assistant Chief Gilroy gave the order.

65
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,446
Gilroy? He's there?
He was.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,286
I don't like spending five hours
getting evidence for someone else.

67
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,223
Are we on this case, or aren't we?

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,784
David.

69
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,020
Sir.

70
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,596
Your office?

71
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,729
Thanks for your good work this morning,
Claudette.

72
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,737
It hasn't been wasted.

73
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,935
No, just our time.

74
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,905
Sir.

75
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:44,907
Where the hell were you last night?

76
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,948
What do you mean?

77
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,453
Detective Crowley got shot.
I left you a message.

78
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:50,749
Yeah, I got it.

79
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:51,914
So?

80
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,856
You didn't say I had to come down.

81
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,585
I shouldn't have to.
A fellow officer was dying in that hospital.

82
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,361
I said a prayer for him.

83
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,134
A prayer?
Yeah.

84
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:07,029
What?

85
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:10,536
I've been on the job for three weeks,
I didn't even know that guy.

86
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,737
Rule number one, he was a cop.

87
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,773
That means you knew him.

88
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:21,109
Two deaths, two investigations.

89
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,813
David, please.

90
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,948
You can't have your cops
investigating your cops.

91
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,323
If you clear the Strike Team,
that's gonna smack of favoritism.

92
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:33,057
If you actually find something,
you'll have a civil war on your hands.

93
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,031
Let Internal Affairs do their job.

94
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,640
Has anyone sent Department sympathies
to Crowley's family?

95
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,771
I spoke to his mother an hour ago.

96
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,145
Someone from our side
should speak at the funeral.

97
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:54,481
Perhaps you...
No. He was your man.

98
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,445
I'm sure you'll represent us well.

99
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,286
You're the first
Mackey brought aboard...

100
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,053
...when he assembled the Strike Team.

101
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,925
- We worked things together.
- So there was a comfort level.

102
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,793
Yeah.
Same with the others?

103
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,561
Vic knew them, too.
Detective Crowley?

104
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:12,535
No, he was recommended by someone.
I don't recall who.

105
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,162
So Terry was an outsider?

106
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:17,436
No, he was a new guy,
but once Vic puts you on the team...

107
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,534
...then you're on the team.

108
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,943
Hey.
Hi.

109
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,951
Strike Team's getting the third degree.

110
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,747
Yeah, looks like it.

111
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,718
You're assigned the crime scene, right?

112
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,816
We're off it now.

113
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,723
The guys are curious.
I said I'd find out what's going on.

114
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:37,955
Any idea?

115
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,897
Looks to me like Vic and his cowboys
went in undermanned with a half-ass plan...

116
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,094
...and managed to get a guy killed.

117
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,161
Then again, I'm off the case.

118
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:50,836
Later, okay?

119
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:54,039
Tell him this is L.A., not the Wild West.

120
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:03,053
- I'd know those fingernails anywhere.
- How you holding up?

121
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,080
I lost a guy. I don't like it.

122
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,287
- I saw you at the hospital last night.
- I saw you, too.

123
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:14,031
- You had a crowd. I didn't want...
- It's all right.

124
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,867
- Look, I don't want you to think that...
- I don't.

125
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:27,237
If you need a break from all this
and want to talk, come find me.

126
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:28,640
That's good to know.

127
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:36,045
Anytime someone kills a cop...

128
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,522
...scumbags get it into their heads
that it's open season.

129
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,692
- Police rule number...
- Three.

130
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,888
Cop goes down, we re-establish
our dominance on the street.

131
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,397
Someone mouths off,
they hit the pavement.

132
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,463
Someone resists,
we make sure they make a pit stop...

133
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,127
...at the emergency room.

134
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:56,835
We gotta make sure these assholes
know who's in charge. Right?

135
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,273
Loud and clear.

136
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,044
What happened to your hand?

137
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,602
I put it through a window.

138
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,175
Last night during the raid?

139
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,782
No. After, when I found out about Terry.

140
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,718
Is it all right?

141
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,053
Yeah.

142
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,023
Cut up pretty bad, though.
Any tendon damage?

143
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:16,019
Can we just get this
the hell over with, please?

144
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,028
Mackey sent Terry to get killed.
You don't know that.

145
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,233
Please.

146
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,806
Cops get killed in the line of duty.

147
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,972
Did you tell anyone
Terry was trying to take down Mackey?

148
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:36,877
Did you?

149
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,576
David...
I didn't, and Terry's dead.

150
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,948
I followed protocol.

151
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,350
Protocol.

152
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:47,087
Things that Terry wanted, a job,
a car, I'm not authorized to sign off on.

153
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,822
So you broke the circle.
I sent his requests up the ladder.

154
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:54,363
This is the Justice Department.
So they can be trusted?

155
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,900
I've got to go to I.A.D.
Why?

156
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,766
To let them know
exactly why Mackey wanted Terry dead.

157
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,773
You can't do that.
They'll let him walk, Moses.

158
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,173
If they have motive, they'll dig deeper.

159
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:09,543
You initiated an off-the-books
investigation into one of your own men.

160
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,840
You come forward, your career's dead.

161
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,043
We sent Terry to his own death.

162
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,746
What am I supposed to do?

163
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,153
What do you hope to accomplish?

164
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,756
It won't prove that Vic set Terry up.

165
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,527
You'll lose the power
you've worked your whole life to acquire.

166
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,890
I'm not gonna let him get away with it.

167
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:35,735
There is an epitaph
for an unknown soldier that goes:

168
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,604
"Do not stand on my grave and weep

169
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,167
"For I am not there, I do not sleep.

170
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,507
"With my brothers in the field, I kneel

171
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,447
"Their lives, my merit

172
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,174
"My death, their zeal."

173
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,553
I believe these words do express...

174
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,456
...the sentiments
of Detective Terry Crowley.

175
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,792
A good man and an
exemplary police officer...

176
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,626
...who served his community
and his department...

177
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,134
...with dignity, loyalty, and courage.

178
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:07,729
In the brief time that
I was fortunate enough to work with him...

179
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,536
...I came to know him
as a man who embraced life...

180
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,304
...adored his friends and family...

181
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,669
...and loved being a cop.

182
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,244
"I am the resurrection and the light.

183
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,214
"He that believeth in me

184
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,216
"Even though he were dead

185
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,277
"Yet, shall he live."

186
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:26,347
Amen.
Yes, Lord.

187
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:29,154
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

188
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,162
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures

189
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,289
"He leadeth me beside the still waters."

190
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,233
We will miss his service
and his good nature.

191
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:41,770
And I know I speak
on behalf of the entire force when I say...

192
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,900
...Terry, our lives are your merit...

193
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,444
...and your memory gives us zeal.

194
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,973
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

195
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,916
"He restoreth my soul.

196
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,155
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

197
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,713
"I will fear no evil

198
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,324
"For thou art with me

199
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,521
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

200
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,059
Fire!

201
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,590
Fire!

202
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:18,141
Baby, I'm sorry! Mama's sorry!
It's all right, now.

203
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,610
Mama's sorry, baby!
It's gonna be all right.

204
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:27,975
What are you doing?

205
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,749
- What?
- Save it for the car ride, Shane.

206
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:32,918
What's the matter with you?

207
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,358
- I didn't expect to see his mother here...
- He had a mom. So what?

208
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,396
So what did we do?

209
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,528
What we had to.

210
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:43,761
- Christ, come on, man.
- Enough. Come on.

211
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm cold, man.

212
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,967
Look, we made him one of us,
and what did he do?

213
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,406
- What did he do?
- He turned rat.

214
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,410
He tried to stick us both in a cage...

215
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,106
...with the same goddamn animals
we fight every day.

216
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,342
Now, did I enjoy it? No.

217
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:02,180
Did it need to be done?
You're goddamn right it did.

218
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:04,446
Now, listen to me...

219
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,485
...we're gonna ride this out. Right?

220
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:12,457
I'm so sorry for your loss.

221
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,085
Sir, step back.
It's cool. I called you.

222
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,787
- Step away from the body.
- I need the money he owes me.

223
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,420
Don't make me warn you again.

224
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,489
He's got my cash.
I'm not gonna warn you again.

225
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,433
I need the money he owes me.
What'd she say?

226
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,332
Let's go!
What?

227
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,241
I'm a good Samaritan here!

228
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,072
What were you doing to the body?

229
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,113
I heard he had the $100 he owed me...

230
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,273
...so I come here
and see somebody shot him!

231
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,045
So I went down the block
and called for 911...

232
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,245
...and come back here to get my money.

233
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,686
Jesus, Julien, this guy's still alive.
This is 1-Tango-13.

234
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,952
I need a R.A. to respond.

235
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,425
Keep fighting, man!

236
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,292
- Keep fighting! I'll collect from you later!
- Let's go.

237
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,271
Shane barely touched his pork chops.
I don't think he's doing well.

238
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,009
He's gonna be fine.
He don't seem fine.

239
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,812
It hasn't even been a week yet.

240
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,445
I'm coming, sweetie.

241
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,885
It's like he blames himself
for the whole thing.

242
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,359
It's not normal.
I mean, it's not like he killed Terry.

243
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,569
Ace of clubs.

244
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,137
I'm sitting poolside
with this guy named Frank...

245
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,047
- Transvestite?
- He's buying drinks.

246
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,345
That ugly one?

247
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,683
Yeah, the guy that I always hang out with.

248
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,482
50 years old!
You gotta be joking me!

249
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,556
You holding out on me, Shane?

250
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,927
I got the fresh meat.

251
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,589
This here's Terry.
He comes to us from Robbery.

252
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,565
Robbery?
You mean, like, the fag squad, man?

253
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,994
They ran out of fresh asses
over there...

254
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,698
...so I figured I'd try you
prom queens on for size.

255
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:38,799
If you're looking for fresh asses,
I'd cross Shane off your list.

256
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,644
Stop it, mister. Stop it!

257
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:46,178
It looks like it'll be a blast
to run with you guys.

258
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,583
Just make sure you keep up.
I'll try.

259
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,985
Don't let these pussies
haze you too bad either.

260
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,649
We love you pretty boys from Robbery.

261
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,089
Know how to play pitch?
No.

262
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,287
You bring your wallet?

263
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:01,196
Don't let them stick you with Shane.
He always loses.

264
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,734
'Cause you're cheaters.
And he's a crybaby.

265
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,429
You're all...
Shut up!

266
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,869
Don't trust one of these guys.

267
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,874
You know what?
He's the worst player in here.

268
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,307
To infinity and beyond!

269
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,678
Okay, Captain Infinity...

270
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,912
...let's get you ready for school. Come on.

271
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:27,549
Body was over there.
We found one shell casing a few feet away.

272
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,819
How's the victim?

273
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,225
Paramedic says
he's swirling down the drain.

274
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,662
- Who said that? Randy?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,699
Sounds like Randy. Cynical bastard.

276
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,932
Does the rookie ever talk?

277
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,694
Yeah, he talks.

278
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:44,441
What does this tell you?
Ma'am?

279
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:47,069
You're our first eyes and ears
on a crime scene.

280
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,238
What does this one tell you?

281
00:15:56,054 --> 00:16:00,320
Overturned carts, footprints,
clear sign of a struggle.

282
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,951
Actually, the struggle occurred
after we arrived.

283
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,753
A guy was going through
the victim's pockets.

284
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,629
After repeated requests to stop,
I pulled him off the body.

285
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:13,899
Knocking over the churro cart
and getting sugar spread all over?

286
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,633
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,732
Actually, it was my fault. I should've...

288
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:22,109
I hope this isn't the way you teach a trainee
how to preserve a crime scene.

289
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,047
This is how murderers go free, son.

290
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,116
Don't take it hard. She's in a pissy mood
'cause it's her birthday.

291
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:38,788
Did we...

292
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,858
Is this scheduled?

293
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:42,590
No.

294
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,358
Frances came by
to give me her preliminary report.

295
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,267
I wanted you to get a sneak peek at it, too.

296
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,136
We wrapped up the interviews.

297
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,698
I'll fast-track ballistics...

298
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:54,677
...and get you a final copy
in the next couple of weeks.

299
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:59,144
Bottom line, it wasn't a model operation,
but it wasn't a crime, either.

300
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,409
Vic and his boys look okay on this one.

301
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:02,942
Really?

302
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,183
The drug-dealer's girlfriend
confirms the team's account.

303
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,350
She puts the gun that killed Crowley...

304
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,122
...in the dealer's hands
seconds before the shooting.

305
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,791
Thanks for the fast work, Frances.

306
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,564
She must be good.

307
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,471
Two men killed, a dozen rounds fired...

308
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,306
...no ballistics,
and she's already making her call.

309
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,274
It's a preliminary report, David.

310
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,317
I just don't want us accused
of whitewashing anything.

311
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,076
The last thing we need...

312
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,781
...is another chapter
in the Rodney King-O.J. book.

313
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,483
I don't wanna be a chapter
in that book, either.

314
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:44,322
I'll make sure
she doesn't get lazy on this one, okay?

315
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:48,022
It was a great eulogy, by the way.

316
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,924
It was very nice.

317
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:55,602
If my dad dies, it's all my fault.
Why's that?

318
00:17:56,674 --> 00:18:00,166
Dad wanted me to go to college
around here. Live at home.

319
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,243
He's a vendor.
He doesn't make much money.

320
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,075
But I wanted Stanford.

321
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,549
I had gotten a scholarship,
but it didn't cover everything.

322
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,517
There was still books, housing.

323
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,416
When he found out,
he said if that was my dream...

324
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,417
...he'd make it happen.

325
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,656
That's when he stopped paying.

326
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,699
- Stopped paying what?
- Protection money.

327
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:27,596
This bully in the neighborhood
made all the vendors pay.

328
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,802
- My father wasn't licensed, so...
- So he didn't go to the police.

329
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:35,102
I told him he couldn't stop paying the guy...

330
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:38,213
...but he said it was
the only way I could go to Stanford.

331
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,642
He was so proud when I had gotten in.

332
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:47,618
I begged him to pay the money, but...

333
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:55,489
The thug that did this to my dad...

334
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,567
...can you guys really get him?

335
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,759
We can try. Who is he?

336
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:02,135
His name's Marlon Demrall.

337
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,008
Marlon Demrall?
Yeah. So?

338
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,075
You need to come with us.
Thanks, but I'll pass.

339
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,017
You can go peacefully or not.

340
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,146
Let's go.

341
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,747
How 'bout I don't go at all?

342
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,156
What's the emergency, brother?

343
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,716
Questioning in a shooting.

344
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,125
When?
Today.

345
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,788
I didn't shoot nobody today.

346
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,355
What're you doin' to him?
Come on, man.

347
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,302
Get the camcorder!
They're taking Marlon away!

348
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,096
Get the camcorder!
They're taking Marlon away!

349
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:34,697
What is wrong with you?
Stay inside.

350
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,502
Let him go. He didn't do it.
He's my son's father!

351
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,132
I didn't shoot nobody.

352
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,740
Right, yeah. You didn't do anything.

353
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,610
You a brother?

354
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,581
Or did you become one of them?

355
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,810
Look at what you're doing to a brother!

356
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,853
He's not my brother.
Let go!

357
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,286
Mama! Get the camcorder!
They're taking Marlon!

358
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,090
You got nothin' to do today?

359
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,414
He did not...

360
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,756
You ain't nothin' but a Uncle Tom!

361
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:58,886
Uncle Tom?

362
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:02,022
That's right. If the Oreo wrapper fits,
wear it, brother.

363
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,191
Shut up.

364
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,235
Don't go making it black and white, Marlon.

365
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,770
Take pictures!
Smile for the camera!

366
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,066
Goddamn cops!

367
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,198
But I'm like, where am I supposed to find...

368
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,756
...a dental dam at 2:00 in the morning?

369
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:38,859
What's a dental dam?

370
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:41,769
It's a rubber for your mouth
when you go down on a chick.

371
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,828
Are you serious?

372
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:46,000
If you need a dental dam,
I gotta question what your face...

373
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,237
...is doing down there in the first place.

374
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,576
She had made a specific request.

375
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:53,343
Sounds like a petri dish
with legs to me.

376
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,409
I'd invest in a couple
of syringes of penicillin.

377
00:20:56,487 --> 00:21:00,321
So I find this all-night
Vietnamese store that carries them.

378
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:04,025
Leave it to Charlie to put
the dental dams with the toothpaste.

379
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,152
Are you serious?

380
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,594
I rush back.

381
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:09,530
I slap this thing on, and I am goin' to town.

382
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,034
I swear, I'm like Gene Simmons on that.

383
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:15,196
I was like the tao of poon, I swear to God.

384
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:19,242
And she's like, "I don't feel anything."

385
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:23,270
And you're like,
"Really? 'Cause that's my dick."

386
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,711
Have you ever actually tried
to use one of these things?

387
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:31,050
I guess you and me
dated a different breed of woman.

388
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,756
Down and dirty. No pun intended.

389
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,689
Don't make me hurt you.

390
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:57,144
What time is lunch here?
Shut up.

391
00:21:57,214 --> 00:22:00,650
You worked me up an appetite.
Tom here could use a bite, too.

392
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:02,810
Sir to you.
Yes, sir.

393
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,717
Uncle Tom is looking very hungry.

394
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,018
Detectives, meet Marlon Demrall.

395
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,984
- Pleasure.
- Shut up.

396
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,085
Is that the only word
you ladies know?

397
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,288
Enjoy.

398
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,193
Happy birthday, by the way.

399
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,791
- You told her?
- No.

400
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:21,163
Yes. By accident.

401
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,471
Come with me, Marlon.

402
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,312
Whatever you say, birthday girl.

403
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,471
Hey, Lowe.

404
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,411
You gonna grab a beer with us tonight?

405
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:34,878
Can't. I've got other plans.

406
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:37,011
What's with your partner?

407
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,783
Can't spend quality time
with his fellow boys in blue?

408
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,552
I'm just going to church tonight.

409
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,183
God can wait.

410
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,820
Tonight, my friend,
you get your first b-and-b.

411
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,663
What's a b-and-b?
It's a tradition we have here.

412
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,025
Nothing like your very first one.

413
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:55,195
Be at the motor pool at the end of the shift.

414
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:58,469
- You skip out on us, it's your ass.
- Let's get out of here.

415
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,066
What's a b-and-b?

416
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:03,271
It's stupid and juvenile
and the sooner you get it over with...

417
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:06,180
...the sooner you'll be accepted
by Jackson and the rest.

418
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,343
Why should I care what they think?

419
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,176
Rule number seven...

420
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:15,715
...those guys might be overgrown frat boys,
but might someday be the only thing...

421
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,726
...that comes between you and a bullet.

422
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:19,886
What y'all got to eat around here?

423
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,064
How 'bout a nice churro?

424
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,924
You like churros, Marlon?

425
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,094
Yeah, that sugary shit is all right.

426
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,030
But what I'm really jonesing for
is a cheeseburger.

427
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,674
Let me see if I can accommodate you.

428
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:32,868
My man.

429
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:40,316
Come on, sweet thing.

430
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,547
Now I know you got a smile for me
underneath all that.

431
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:50,724
Dutch?

432
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,596
- Dutch?
- Captain.

433
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,261
I could use your help with an interrogation.

434
00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,626
I'm in the middle of a case.

435
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,035
Claudette's got it under control.

436
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,138
All right.

437
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,705
That's what all this is about?
Look, you could have saved me a trip.

438
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:14,808
Read my lips. I did not kill Poncho. Okay?

439
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:16,876
Nivan Gonzalez.

440
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:20,120
He's still alive at the moment.
Whatever.

441
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,819
I didn't shoot nobody this morning,
but I'll turn you on to who did, though.

442
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,418
Will you?
Yeah.

443
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:29,831
But I want something first.
And what is that?

444
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,993
A cheeseburger! I'm hungry as hell!

445
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:33,661
Talk first, then you eat.

446
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,570
Come on.

447
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:39,638
All right.

448
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:43,711
I had a protection thing
going on with those churro chumps.

449
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:46,108
It was a good gig, too.

450
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,143
Till last month.

451
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:51,051
This new Mexican gang
comes in, packing some serious heat...

452
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:53,715
...tells me they movin' in on my business.

453
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,957
And what gang was this?

454
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,994
Call themselves the Los Magnificos.

455
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:01,929
See, that's what's wrong with this country.

456
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:04,292
I'm prime example numero uno.

457
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:07,929
I'm trying to make a serious buck,
and then comes some wetback...

458
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,495
...that's taking away my job.

459
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:11,905
Your job?
My job.

460
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:15,908
Your job was illegally
shaking down churro vendors.

461
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,039
Look, a job is a job, lady.

462
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:24,378
Now, I like mine well done.

463
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:27,780
Just like me. With everything.

464
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,349
No onions.

465
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,023
They give me a rash.

466
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:34,696
I don't find you funny.

467
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,365
You lookin' for me?

468
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:41,326
We'd like to ask you some questions.

469
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,538
About what?

470
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:47,572
About how Terry died.

471
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,602
You I.A.D. now?

472
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,981
- Seems right up your alley.
- I don't feel they checked every angle.

473
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,918
So now you got questions.
I've got a few.

474
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:00,418
What's stopping me from having
my P.B.A. rep tell you to blow me?

475
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:02,452
Nothing.

476
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,226
If Vic Mackey
wants to hide behind a lawyer...

477
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,792
...then that's the way it'll be.

478
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:16,231
You got questions? Fine.

479
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,208
Ask your goddamn questions.

480
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:27,309
- Why'd you go in without more backup?
- A battalion of cops makes noise.

481
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:28,941
It's called the element of surprise.

482
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:31,509
lmagine my surprise
when I heard your guy died.

483
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:34,818
Those of us who venture out past our desks
sometimes get shot at.

484
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,450
More firepower wouldn't
have tipped him off.

485
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,188
Who should I have had
watching our backs? You?

486
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:42,526
I'd hate to have
to change your diaper afterwards.

487
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:44,725
Better than burying one of your own.

488
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,031
So you fired at the dealer,
the dealer returned fire, hitting Terry.

489
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:51,937
No. Like I told I.A.D.,
Two-Time shot Terry...

490
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,872
...then Shane and I returned fire.

491
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:55,807
Sounds textbook to me.

492
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,473
That's all we got.

493
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,817
Thanks for your time.

494
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:10,090
That's all we've got?

495
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,753
Was that supposed to make him
spontaneously confess?

496
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:15,353
No. It's supposed to make him feel safe.

497
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,992
Now we go after the weak link in the chain.

498
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:22,235
Who's the weak link?

499
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:27,164
What was that all about?

500
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:30,006
Aceveda is spinning his wheels, as usual.

501
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:33,774
Enter.

502
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:39,251
What can you tell me
about a new gang called Los Magnificos?

503
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:41,312
They're not so new...

504
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,450
...they been clawing up the food chain
for the last six months.

505
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:48,155
Someone from the gang
pulled the trigger on my churro guy.

506
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,857
Any bushes you can beat?

507
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:53,229
Looks like we've been invited
to the party, ladies.

508
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:54,728
Let's go.

509
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:58,903
I hear it's your birthday.

510
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:01,333
Happy birthday.

511
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,647
I need to ask Shane a few questions.

512
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,182
Me?
I need 10 minutes.

513
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,343
I'll send him to catch up with you.

514
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,708
I'm cool.

515
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,085
I'm gonna grab a Coke first.
Do you need anything?

516
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:15,487
No.

517
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,702
How's the paint brush, Van Bro?

518
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,298
Don't be coming around here
unless you lookin' to buy.

519
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,740
And no more freebies.

520
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,472
You want info,
you have to buy something this time.

521
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,478
All right.

522
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:42,273
- Lem, pick the poison.
- What do I know about art, man?

523
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:43,911
Ronnie?

524
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:47,888
I like the one with the clouds.

525
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:49,856
You got a place for it?

526
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,457
Yeah, I guess.

527
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,456
All right. How much?

528
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,022
Gimme $100.

529
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:01,336
And don't be hangin' it
in no bathroom, neither.

530
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,765
Looking for a Los Mag.
Shot up a churro vendor.

531
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:13,342
The people say
amigo didn't want to pay his freight.

532
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,212
He ignored a couple of warnings.

533
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:18,253
Los Mags sent in a baby banger
to do the dirty deed.

534
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:20,954
Earned him his stripes.

535
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,384
Initiation shooting?

536
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,957
Things they got these kids doing.

537
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:30,023
Did you have to bake a batch
of brownies back in your day, Van Bro?

538
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:34,296
Getting into life was a lot more fun
than getting out.

539
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:36,767
I heard you lost a man a few days back.

540
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:40,301
- Yeah.
- Tough times, Vic.

541
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:43,138
I don't know. Maybe someday...

542
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,447
...somebody even win this war.

543
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:46,947
I intend to.

544
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:50,479
VAN See you around, baby.
All right, man.

545
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,855
This little vato ready for the barrio?

546
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:18,541
The wannabe getting initiated,
he's our shooter.

547
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:19,603
I'll take him.

548
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,582
Anybody else gets caught in our net,
it's gravy.

549
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:25,847
- Are we goin' in?
- No. His punk ass wants a beating.

550
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,786
I say we let him have it.

551
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,664
What's he saying?

552
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,665
"Welcome to the life."

553
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,307
You were going to be his backup.

554
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:53,541
We were his backup.

555
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,583
Why is Terry dead, then?

556
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:57,478
Wrong place, wrong time.

557
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:01,649
Aren't you and Vic supposed to be
these kick-ass top cops?

558
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:05,019
How does somebody you're backing up...

559
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:06,928
...get blown away by some
pissant drug dealer?

560
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:07,656
...get blown away by some
pissant drug dealer?

561
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:09,822
I.A.D. cleared us.

562
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:11,421
I didn't clear you.

563
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,262
It just went bad. That's all.

564
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:16,395
You lie.

565
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,030
He squints when he lies.
You do.

566
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:21,734
No, I don't.
You're squinting now.

567
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:42,356
All right. Play time's over.

568
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,990
Last one down the hill
gets to drink the backwash.

569
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:48,297
All right. We're a go in three, two, one, go!

570
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:49,792
Go.

571
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:01,044
Police!

572
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:02,582
Stop right there! Freeze!

573
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:26,167
Bienvenido a la vida.

574
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,419
You let Terry get killed.

575
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:42,979
Why would we do that?
You know why.

576
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,222
I.A.D. cleared us.

577
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,191
You know a drug dealer
named Rondell Robinson?

578
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:52,232
No.

579
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:54,027
You're squinting. You don't know him?

580
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,526
I know who he is.

581
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,738
I meant I don't know him personally.

582
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:03,106
So if I had a witness that saw you and Vic
acting real friendly with Rondell Robinson...

583
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:04,705
...that would be a lie.

584
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:05,837
That's right.

585
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:08,143
So he didn't see
the three of you at a car wash?

586
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,749
Vic was just puttin' a scare into him.

587
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:19,486
Lettin' him know
that we were watching him.

588
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,528
So you lied.
No, I didn't.

589
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,529
I meant something else.

590
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:26,862
Terry knew you were
in bed with Robinson, so he had to die.

591
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,094
Terry was in our team.

592
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:29,864
He was your errand boy.

593
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:32,565
Bullshit.
You led Terry there to die.

594
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,664
Not true.

595
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,606
The one guy who disapproved...

596
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:39,612
...is the only one who didn't come out
of that house alive. That's a coincidence?

597
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,011
Believe what you want.

598
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,582
Terry was gonna turn you in,
so Vic wanted him dead.

599
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,778
- Vic needed him dead!
- No!

600
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:49,818
God.

601
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:51,719
The shot.

602
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,153
- That's what the last shot was.
- The last shot?

603
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:58,721
Two-Time's girlfriend said
that she heard the last shot...

604
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
...10, 15 seconds after the others.

605
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:04,767
When we approached Two-Time, he moved.

606
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,535
Vic couldn't leave it to chance.

607
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:11,478
Vic fired once more.
That's the shot that killed Terry.

608
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,877
- No way.
- Vic fired that shot, didn't he?

609
00:34:13,948 --> 00:34:16,041
- No.
- Stop squinting!

610
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:18,746
I know.

611
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:21,080
I know.

612
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:31,962
You're wrong.

613
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:35,666
I want Mackey.

614
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:39,034
- You don't have to go down with him.
- That is not how it happened.

615
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:42,075
Stop lying to me.
I know what happened.

616
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,044
I have a witness, Shane.

617
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:48,645
He connects you and Vic
with Rondell Robinson.

618
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,479
I have a witness.

619
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:54,281
Give me Vic and your problems end.

620
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,686
Just give me Mackey.

621
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,095
What the hell's going on here?
You've had him here for two hours?

622
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:09,568
He's making up sick shit about us.
Wait for me downstairs.

623
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:13,468
This whole thing is a joke.
Grab a sandwich, Dutch-boy.

624
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,276
I know what you did.

625
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,352
Up until now, I've tolerated you.

626
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:31,355
You come near my men again,
I'm gonna lose patience.

627
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,792
You listening?

628
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:38,091
I know.

629
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:55,012
The churro guy you shot's
in surgery. They don't know if he'll live.

630
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,948
Tell her you didn't shoot this man.

631
00:35:57,018 --> 00:36:01,079
If you tell me who had you
do this, I might get you into juvie court.

632
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:05,091
If you wait and he dies,
you'll be tried for murder as an adult.

633
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,354
Please tell her you didn't do this.

634
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:09,396
Of course I didn't.
You see?

635
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:12,797
I shoot someone,
he don't almost end up dead.

636
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,459
Bitch ends up all dead.

637
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:19,470
That's your alibi?
If you'd have shot him, he'd be dead?

638
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,132
Hell, yeah. That's my alibi.

639
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,211
Guess what?
Churro guy's actually gonna make it.

640
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:34,612
Good.

641
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:38,125
You're not gonna believe what went down
between Aceveda and Mackey.

642
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:40,820
- I don't want to know.
- Yeah, I know, but this is...

643
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:42,658
Anyone gets between those two...

644
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,530
...will end up with a hose full of piss
running down his leg.

645
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,398
Good news and bad news.

646
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:55,231
Bad news is...

647
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:59,010
...the churro vendor just died.

648
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,449
Good news for your son, though,
someone else is taking credit for the killing.

649
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:05,179
Thank you, Jesus.

650
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:08,222
Some guy named Marlon
walked in off the street...

651
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,382
...said your gang was trying
to muscle in on his business...

652
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:15,020
...so he decided to show all the vendors
your gang couldn't protect them.

653
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:16,324
Marlon didn't do no shooting.

654
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:20,231
He did. Everyone's talking
about how he showed your boys up.

655
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,792
That old man stopped paying us.
That's my shooting!

656
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,361
- He's just looking to piggyback a rep.
- Olman, no.

657
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,964
You're trying
to take credit for it now?

658
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:31,102
- Stop...
- I told you if I shot him, he'd be dead, right?

659
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,908
People need to know.

660
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:34,672
Los Mags own these streets.

661
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,086
- Who asked you to do the shooting?
- I ain't never telling you that.

662
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:42,021
These are my brothers now.

663
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:44,290
Do you know what this means?

664
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:45,825
Means I earned my way in.

665
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,691
No. It means you're going to jail.

666
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:57,164
At least I'll have family there.

667
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:12,646
Tell me you didn't reopen an investigation
that wasn't even yours.

668
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,119
There were unanswered questions.

669
00:38:14,188 --> 00:38:16,713
You accused Mackey
of working with a drug dealer.

670
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,191
- Who's your witness?
- Anonymous tip.

671
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,125
Anyone who can corroborate it?

672
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:29,129
Is there something I don't know
that explains why you're still pursuing this?

673
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,761
Well?

674
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:35,866
No.

675
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,004
Then it ends here.

676
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:42,315
Christ, David.

677
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:45,880
You're doing a good job.

678
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:48,119
Chief said so the other day.

679
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:51,881
Don't lose focus now.

680
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:53,851
I won't.

681
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:56,522
Good.

682
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:59,358
Thanks for getting
Captain Ass-lnvader off my back.

683
00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:02,129
It wouldn't kill you
to show him more respect.

684
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:03,261
Come on.

685
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:05,703
Vic, the men here take their cues from you.

686
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:07,468
I'm just saying dial it down.

687
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,374
I don't do my best work
with him nipping at my heels.

688
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:13,607
- Which is why I'm watching out for you.
- Good.

689
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,945
Question is, are you watching out for me?

690
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:17,578
Meaning?

691
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:20,620
My guys tipped you off
that Terry was looking to take you down.

692
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:24,886
- Ben, the bust just went bad.
- My source at Justice is all over my ass.

693
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:28,224
He wants to know if you made us
all accomplices to a murder.

694
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:32,397
I told him you'd never do that to me.

695
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,028
Would you?

696
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:41,867
Terry got overeager. He got himself killed.

697
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:44,908
End of story?

698
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:47,046
End of story.

699
00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:51,918
It better be.

700
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,523
Is this from you?

701
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:11,166
No. I know how you feel about birthdays.

702
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:17,943
Denture cream.

703
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,106
Thank you.

704
00:40:22,116 --> 00:40:23,981
'Cause I'm getting old.

705
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:26,881
I don't see a card.

706
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:29,184
Anyone want to take credit for this?

707
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:32,353
Not me.
I didn't think so.

708
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:36,196
- How's the birthday girl doing?
- Don't say that word.

709
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:39,494
- I came to take you dancing.
- I don't want to go dancing.

710
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,432
Now we gotta do something, honey.

711
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:43,732
It's your birthday.
So?

712
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:46,898
So, it's ladies night at the Crimson.

713
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:52,341
I have it on very good authority
that Franklin Green's gonna be there.

714
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:58,178
- His divorce final?
- Two weeks ago.

715
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:07,586
I can't let Franklin Green
see me looking like this.

716
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:10,721
Which is why we'll spruce up first,
then go to the Crimson.

717
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:14,598
- We too old to be chasing men around.
- I'm not.

718
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,568
Neither am I. Come on.

719
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:22,609
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

720
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:28,538
Who said that Jesus freak couldn't drink?

721
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:32,675
Your b-and-b's almost complete, buddy boy.

722
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,384
You had the beer.
Now it's time for the blow.

723
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,785
- You're kidding.
- I kid you not.

724
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:40,520
She's a badge sucker.

725
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:43,428
What's a badge sucker?

726
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:45,965
A badge sucker, man.
She digs cops, okay?

727
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:49,127
She's like the neighborhood
welcoming committee. Listen.

728
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:51,569
A better hummer you're not gonna find.

729
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,106
- Trust me.
- No...

730
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:56,538
I cannot...
No, stay, listen!

731
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,009
Sit down!

732
00:41:58,078 --> 00:42:01,206
This isn't torture, okay?
We've all gone through this.

733
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:03,782
Julien, say hi to Betty.

734
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:07,684
So this is the new guy?
Go!

735
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:11,018
Welcome to the force.

736
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,527
Handsome.
And he's lucky, too.

737
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:19,256
Wanna go for a walk?
Fellas, I cannot. No.

738
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,530
Come on, now. I can't!

739
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:23,792
Go!

740
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:30,801
Give it up, man.

741
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:36,843
Wait. Come on.

742
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,248
Come on.
All right.

743
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,354
Let's get you over here.

744
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:44,148
Relax, Officer.

745
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:47,052
This is a lot more fun than roll call.

746
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,931
You don't have to do this.

747
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:15,254
Yeah.

748
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,285
She love him long time.

749
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:23,824
Go!

750
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:34,440
Thanks a lot.

751
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:48,719
You don't put me in an interrogation room
without giving me all the facts.

752
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,122
I wanted them to think you had nothing.
Then I could take my shot.

753
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:55,025
You didn't think
they'd respect me enough to fear me?

754
00:43:58,032 --> 00:43:59,556
No. I didn't.

755
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:02,969
That's pretty shitty.

756
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:04,397
Sorry.

757
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:10,804
You really think Vic had something
to do with Terry dying?
