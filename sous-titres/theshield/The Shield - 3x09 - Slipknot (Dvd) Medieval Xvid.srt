00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,498

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,236

00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,585
- Are you okay?
- You didn't have to come

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,287
- What happened?
- I was patching up this Asian guy

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:33,059
and I saw he had
a gunshot wound to the arm.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,726
When I went to call it in,
he freaked out.

10
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,032
- Damn it
- Nothing's broken. I'll be okay.

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,607
I got all the details.

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,176
- Any gang tats?
- NoJust track marks

13
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,609
He's either on something
or off his meds

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,613
I told you this place was a zoo

15
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,007
Come on I'll take you home

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,177
I can get a ride

17
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,347
Uh no lectures I promise

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,362

19
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,400
- He's still working with Matt?
- Not now

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,436
- What happened?
- I'm okay

21
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,369
Some guy just went off
at the hospital

22
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,340
-Jesus!
- Calm down

23
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,934
- You're gonna get Matt all worked up.
- Matt can handle big feelings

24
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,842
- You an expert on my son?
- Yes, I am

25
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,609
- Vic
- Mommy

26
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,584
Mommy had an accident,
and I'll be okay

27
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:31,953
Cassidy, get your homework out.
I'll help you in a minute.

28
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:36,859
- I can handle things here
- Because you're an expert
on my whole family now?

29
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,431
No--

30
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,592
You should come down to the Barn,
look at the mug books

31
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,798
Wha-- Is that a good idea?
I mean, he knows where you work

32
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,000
What's to stop him from coming
back and hurting you again?

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,442
I'm what's stopping him
She picks him out

34
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,106
I find him, make sure he knows
going back isn't an option

35
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,016
It's not worth it
I mean,just leave it alone

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,183
You know I wouldn't ask you
to do this if I didn't think it was safe

37
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,816
I'll call you
We'll figure it out

38
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,328
- Fine You let me know
- Mm

39
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,662

40
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,602
- Sir, Aurora's on the phone
- Tell her I'm in a meeting

41
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,903
Are you? Because
I don't like lying to people

42
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,909
I'm in a meeting

43
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,605
Whatever you say

44
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,942
Oh, there they are!

45
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,683
- We heard dudes fighting or somethin'
- Yeah?

46
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,883
Saw the gate
Merril always locks it

47
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,862
- You guys did good calling us
- Thanks

48
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,865
Hey, hey, hey Wait here
Wait here, all right?

49
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,336
- I'll go right
- All right I'll flank left

50
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,992

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,338

52
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,648
No Danny!

53
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,080
Ripped by:

54
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,143
Hound

55
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,156

56
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,795
This is MerrilJindrich
Runs the community center

57
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,695
Says the name of the victim
is KleeJones Local kid

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,768
- Banger?
- Kid had no ink

59
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,927
No gang tags anywhere

60
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,235
He painted this He's got
others around the neighborhood

61
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,140
- It's beautiful stuff
- I always wondered who the artist was

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,614
Maybe we could get the Strike Team and
the Decoy Squad to help us run down leads

63
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,616
We don't know if it's
gang or drug related

64
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,811
I want to give Walon
some more cooling off time

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,388
Right now, all we have is a homicide

66
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,151
This boy wasn't just murdered

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,457
He was lynched You better
know there's a difference

68
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,298
I know
You two can handle it

69
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,130

70
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,971

71
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,443
- How's the stomach?

72
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,014
Ah-- Doc's got me on scrips

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:48,611
Listen I can understand you not wanting
to say anything in front of the others

74
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,418
- But if you took our missing
cash for any reason
- Vic.

75
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,584
I promise we'll make it all right

76
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,663
Look I didn't take it

77
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,255
Okay I just had to ask

78
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,961
Well, you know what, man?
Ask someone else

79
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,534
Where's your mom and dad?

80
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,045
Dead Me and Klee
pretty much raised each other

81
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,481
You know of anyone who
would want to hurt your brother?

82
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,711

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,983
People barely notice him
He's so quiet

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,622
Everybody loved his paintings

85
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,858
- We saw They're amazing

86
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,870
Ask Gitana I bet she's
got somethin' to do with this

87
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:49,277
- Who's that?
- This Mexicali girl Klee hooked up with

88
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,546
Her ex-boyfriend, all his friends
are straight-up gangsters

89
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,553
Los Profetas.

90
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,522

91
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:03,084
Klee was different Not all
about getting at my ass and tits

92
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:08,156
We'd talk about stuff--
art, love, you know, life shit

93
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,725
Just made me realize,you know,
I could do better for myself.

94
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,535
- Better than Neron?
- We understand your ex-boyfriend
was a member of Los Profetas.

95
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,109
Neron's a Cristo boy

96
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,703
- Didn't work out, huh?
- He wanted me to go to church and shit.

97
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,839
Meanwhile, he's
on the street thuggin'

98
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,284
Klee's sister thinks your gang affiliations
might have to do with Klee's death

99
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,880
A lot of the gangs was pissed
about him painting over their tags

100
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,186
Maybe Neron got jealous--
you dating a black guy

101
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:38,730
I'm fine, but I ain't killin' fine

102
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,603
I gotta ask you something

103
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,538
I counted right the first time
I counted right the last time

104
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,099
And I didn't take the money
Lem said you asked

105
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,145
You ask Shane yet?

106
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,147

107
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,616
Sir, I have Aurora.

108
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,086
No I have her here

109
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,623

110
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,293

111
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,801
Any leads on the lynching?

112
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,395
Claudette and Dutch are on it

113
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,770
Anyone in custody?

114
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,343
Just witnesses Why?

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,504
People are terrified

116
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,481
The black leadership's convening a rally
at the Hope Center You need to go

117
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,745
It's a crime scene, not a photo op

118
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,584
This isn't for the cameras You have to tell
them that you have everyone protected

119
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,591
- You make it sound like I'm checked out
- The last thing we need

120
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,958
is for a dark horse black
candidate to capitalize on this

121
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,395
run as an independent

122
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,763
Crazier things
have happened in this state

123
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,859
Well, I'm not worried

124
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,905
I've given you space
to get through whatever this is.

125
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,139
If you don't want to tell me what
the problem is, I'll find out another way

126
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,272

127
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,648
Sir, uh, you need to take this call

128
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,380

129
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:11,591
We heard some of the gangs were upset
because his murals covered their tags

130
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,925
We heard some of the gangs were upset
because his murals covered their tags

131
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,725
He got some threats
Talk mostly

132
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,357
I think some of the gangs
actually dug his stuff

133
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,596
-Just wasn't cool to say so

134
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,397
- Now what?

135
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,576

136
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,918
Do I really want to know?

137
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,019
Father Zavala
Stabbed five times

138
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,789
Must have come out of the sacristy

139
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,797
Wounds are to the back and neck

140
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,062
- Any witnesses?
-Just the calling card

141
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,728
- One-niner payback for KleeJones
- Klee wasn't a banger.

142
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:03,241
- This is bigger than gang beefs
- He was a black boy hanging from a tree.

143
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,833
The One-niners must think
Los Profetas are responsible

144
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,470
Zavala was their spiritual counsel

145
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,517
Bring in the Strike Team. Track down
the Decoy Squad and use them too.

146
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,951
Now that we know it's gang related?

147
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,182

148
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,091
- Vic, we got trouble
- What's up?

149
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,994
That's the money train fed He was
asking me where Aceveda and Dutch are

150
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,123
- What does he want?
- Nothing we do

151
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,202
They told him to wait upstairs

152
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,365
Detective, your team's
needed right away

153
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,806

154
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,539
Any inside info on Los Profetas?

155
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,582
Killers with a conscience
Got their little piece of the street

156
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,209
- Usually keep to themselves
- It's biblical with these cats

157
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,015
Which means
eye-for-an-eye time

158
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,988
You cover the priest
Dutch and I will stay with the hanging

159
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,423
Hey, look In this hood,
black kid ends up dead

160
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,587
it's 'cause a deal went bad
and someone's pissed off

161
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,665
Guilty until proven white?

162
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,064
Yeah Maybe we should get
the ACLU to solve it

163
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,935
We'll look under our rocks
You look under yours

164
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,811
These guys can't hear
anything right now

165
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,244
Let's check out the Niners first

166
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,748

167
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,479
That's a good decision,
should take care of you guys.

168
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,788
What's up, Tob? What's this?
Bring Your Daddy To Work Day?

169
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,794
Community outreach

170
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,057
Neighborhood's in mourning

171
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,225
I see that
Take the Shriners outside

172
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,428
All right
Let's go, pops Let's go

173
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,802
- Let's talk

174
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,281
Give up the booth, Twizzy

175
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,052

176
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,056
Where's Kern at?

177
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,718
- I think he's in Prague
- Touring

178
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,661
19 Playaz, huh?
One-niners funding that tour?

179
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,565
- We're creative partners.
- Kern's put a lot of faith in you guys

180
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,537
I bet he's gonna be pretty disappointed
when he finds out you knifed a priest

181
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,107
Oh, you gonna be disappointed
when you find out we didn't

182
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,439
No? Then who wrote
''1 -9'' across his face?

183
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,536
He was tagged, asshole.

184
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,547
What kind of crew
are you runnin'here, Tob?

185
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,015
One hand don't know
who the other hand's stabbing?

186
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,780
Look If one of mine did it,
I'll find out

187
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,413
Make sure you give him
a medal for it

188
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,425
Look, man. People loved
that kid's murals, all right?

189
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,961
But I didn't order no hit
on no priest

190
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,827
At least now the Prophets know
what it's like to lose a local hero.

191
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,804
You wanna tell me why you were
breaking bread with the thugs?

192
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,602
Like he said,
community outreach

193
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,041
You went to them for protection?

194
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,339
Don't make me dig deeper.

195
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:59,180
You see that billboard?
Can you read it? I can't

196
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,516
Decade ago, this whole block
was black owned.

197
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,317
Now me, Perry--
all that's left

198
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:10,054
Latin gangs hit my liquor store
1 9 times in the past year.

199
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,323
You think paying out
to the One-niners isn't robbery?

200
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,229
Banger gets shot in a drive-by,
that's one thing.

201
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,030
You put on the colors,
you live and die the life

202
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,506
But that boy, the painter,
he was just trying to do good

203
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,305
You know, we got grandsons
coming up in this neighborhood

204
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,472
One-niners might be the only thing
keeping them away from the noose

205
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,142
If you wanna feel safe,
you come to me.

206
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:38,190
I heard that for the first time
40 years ago, after Watts

207
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,420
Been hearing it ever since
from you boys, every few years.

208
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,600
Los Profetas didn't rope that guy

209
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,762
Is that what the Niners think?

210
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,966
Is that why they killed Father Zavala?

211
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,066
Your ex-girlfriend
had nothing to do with it?

212
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,111
Gitana?

213
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,045
Gitana was just a hit,
like nothing real

214
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,778
You think going to confession
once a week exempts you from
being a shitbag lowlife, Neron?

215
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:11,585
KleeJones saw an ugly world,
tried to make it a little more beautiful.

216
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,057
He gave back
What did you give?

217
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,130
What's everybody gettin' so torn up about?
There's dudes gettin' dead every day

218
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,361
This dude was lynched

219
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,836
- I thought he was hung
- Lynching is being hung.

220
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,567
- You ever read a history book?
- I tried not to

221
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,235
Lynching's what they used
to terrorize the ex-slaves

222
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,507
That's how the Klan
dealt with race mixes

223
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,573
Well, if I'm gonna do somebody, I ain't gonna
waste time looking for no tree and a rope

224
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,552
when there's a million
guns lyin' around

225
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,556

226
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,599

227
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,932
David, you're gonna shut down
all their street trade and lock them up?

228
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,233
How are you gonna follow up
on that threat?

229
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,740
We got a rally in two hours,
and I don't want bloodshed

230
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,210
Using that guy as your errand boy
is a short-term fix

231
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,577
That's all we got time for

232
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,618
Now get him out of here,
so he can pass on the message

233
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,813
Look what crawled
out of the gutter

234
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,686
I thought you guys were neck-deep in
that homeless torching thing

235
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,056
Six days of undercover
setup gone to shit

236
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,755
- Why? What happened?
- Claudette brought us out
for this lynching.

237
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,833
Why? It's pure gangland
It's not a Decoy thing

238
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,228
Oh, I'm sure she's got a plan

239
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,240
Why the hell did you pull us off?

240
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,243
I want Trish and Annie
inside this community rally

241
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,905
You want my team pressin'a crowd?

242
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,676
We've had two homicides that
have created enough racial tension--

243
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,184
And three homeless dead, and a fourth one's
gonna be toast because you can't keep your--

244
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,915
- Stop that right there!
- Last week, you tanked a major case

245
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,116
and now you want to turn us
into mall security!

246
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,920
- It's bullshit
- I made a mistake.

247
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,019
I start digging into your jacket,
I won't find a few?

248
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,564
None that almost killed a cop.

249
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,635
If you can't find it within
yourself to work with me, fine.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,829
You're docked
Catch up on paperwork

251
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,839
You signing off on this?

252
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:13,344
The job gets done when we trust
the decisions of our superiors

253
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,539
- If he's out, we're all out
- There's a chair!

254
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,743
There's six weeks of FI's to file

255
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,726
Mr Rabinowitz?

256
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:34,162
I thought you were a doctor
I've been waiting here 40 minutes

257
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,530
- You were mugged?
- Corman Street.

258
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,731
This man-- Hejumps from out of nowhere
with a pipe,yells, ''Give me your money!''

259
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,239
- And you did?
- Yes

260
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,903
And then he smashed my knee,
took my streimel

261
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,243
- He didn't have to hit you!
- What did I say?

262
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,476
When these things happen,
we must be strong

263
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,916
Can you, uh,
give us a description?

264
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,353
Asian. Black hair.
Had a bandage on his arm.

265
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,152
Bandage?

266
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,127
Our arrest percentages are down
30% since we've been here

267
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,596
- We never had this kind
of interference at Wilshire
- Yeah, it's not right.

268
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,067
We gotta get free again
This team is the assistant chief s baby

269
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,866
Phillips'll listen to me
I just need a witness

270
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,410
Look I don't want to be the one
responsible for letting you slip away

271
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,039
It'll all be off the record. Phillips just
needs to know that I'm not, uh, overreacting.

272
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,550
- He does that sometimes
- I can relate.

273
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,644
You can count me in as a witness

274
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,815
Hold on Hold on
You really want out?

275
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,691
Okay I'll back you up

276
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,859
But you gotta do the right thing.
I need Trish and Annie to work the rally.

277
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,903
My guys are the wrong
shade of black

278
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,905

279
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,909
- Hey, Vic, you got a sec?
- They're all yours

280
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,645
We just took a mugging call
at Mission Cross

281
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,480
- Sounds like the same guy who attacked your wife
- Any leads?

282
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,417
I'm tracking
the stolen credit cards.

283
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,512
- Let me know
- Okay

284
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,160
This guy hurt Corrine
He can't come in feeling good about that

285
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,289
What's the favor?

286
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,200
He turns up--before you
bring him in,you call me.

287
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,771
Okay

288
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,036

289
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,476
- Ready?
- You bet

290
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,780
We appreciate your support
and your concern Um--

291
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,254
Our purpose
for being here today

292
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,451
is notjust to talk about this
travesty thatjust happened...

293
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,324
but to create a forum...

294
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,490
for our awareness, answers--

295
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,298
- Stand over here.
- Now I'd like to turn over
the mic to Reverend Leeman

296
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,339

297
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,468
Would you all be kind enough
to join hands, please

298
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:05,107
Lord Jesus, we ask you to guide
our hearts and our minds.

299
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,051
Renew our faith, O Lord,
and open our eyes--

300
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,181
I hear you're responsible for having
Trish and Annie change their minds

301
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,522
Walon was way out of line

302
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,527
Thanks

303
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,688
No problem

304
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,531
...for your care is the prayer of God.

305
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,503
- What do you guys got?
- Not much conversation

306
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,336
but I spotted six
sporting One-nine ink

307
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,969
- Couple of baby bangers
- Four of them with unnatural bulges

308
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,879
Okay Point 'em out to my guys They'll be
the first ones we jump if this goes ugly

309
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,543
- Okay

310
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,315
- It's all stirred up, ain't it?
- Yeah

311
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,084
Hey, Vic!

312
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,627
Sorry, boys
Crusade's been canceled

313
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,096
Ain't no holy war, homes
Just come to listen

314
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,602
You're too smart for this, Suvuto You guys
get in your cars and bounce on out of here

315
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,899
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay where you are

316
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,442
- Let the police officers do their job
- Captain Aceveda is right--

317
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,603
Hey, you got balls tryin' to come here
and break up our rally

318
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,682
They're not lookin' for a fight,
and neither are you!

319
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,410
NahJust lookin'
for a priest killer, homes

320
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,919

321
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,252

322
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,593
- Get against the fence!
- Get down!

323
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,188

324
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,758
- Anybody hurt?
Everyone clear this area now!

325
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,430
Leave or you will be arrested!

326
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,532
Clear the area now!

327
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,903
- Hey, what's up with that?
- You got a name for me?

328
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,813
- Yeah, I got a lot of names for you
- Keep that sense of humor

329
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,820
Man, why you lockin' me up, man?
We was there like anybody else

330
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,187
No one else was jamming clips
into semi-nines, asshole

331
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,750
What you talkin' about, man? It was the
thorn heads who came lookin' for blood and shit

332
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,762
Why don't you guys
talk through the fence

333
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,798
Maybe some racial harmony
will break out

334
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,560
What's up? What's up?

335
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,967
We found firecracker scraps
That's what incited the shootings

336
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,198
Pol Com and the archbishop
have riot fears

337
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,468
They're pressuring us
to bring in the FBI

338
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,510
Put the National Guard on standby

339
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,511
That's a bad move.

340
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,241
Sends a message we've lost control.
- Oh, so we haven't?

341
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,340
We'll solve these
Calm the waters

342
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,351
How much time
before the feds show up?

343
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,785
The chief wants me reporting in
from here the next 2 4 hours

344
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,381
That buys us some time.
Let's see where we are by then.

345
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,057
I sense some disharmony
between you and Tobar

346
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,223
- Kern keeps us civilized
- Kern's in Europe.

347
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,893
I should've gone to you first

348
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,902
Come to me about what?

349
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,973
I gave Tobar the chance to give up
the Niner who offed the priest

350
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,770
He blew it I'm making
you the same offer

351
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,776
Okay, where's my upside?

352
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,142
You give up the killer,
with some proof..

353
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,342
I'll get you your boys
out of lockup

354
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,749
let you do business rent-free

355
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,515
Come on, Mackey. Everybody knows
you've been shut down.

356
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,524
You're not on the street
enough to landlord

357
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,652
I'm getting the keys
to the city back

358
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,829
Spoke to Lem and Ronnie When are you
gonna ask me about the cash?

359
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,904
Don't have to None of us took it
None of us spent it

360
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,566
Don't have to None of us took it
None of us spent it

361
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,767
Trail won't lead back to us

362
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,776
Yeah, I believe
Lem and Ronnie too

363
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,073
But that seven grand didn't
just spontaneously combust

364
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,876
And now Aceveda's pulling his
marked money list from the safe

365
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,577
He's hooking the Treasury guy
up with Rodriguez

366
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,745
Nothing's gonna lead back to us

367
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,882
Okay But if those flagged bills have
anything to do with our missing cash

368
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,552
I'd sure like to know
who the hell's spending it

369
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,962
Rodriguez, I thought you were pulling
those like-crime stats for me.

370
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,261
Sorry Wagenbach's
working the hanging

371
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,962
I got stuck working
this Armenian mob thing

372
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,039
I'll be in the car
We'd better hurry

373
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,074
It's a long trip
Place closes at 4:00

374
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,541
- Where you headed?
- Some bank in Indio

375
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,080
- Where the hell's that?
- Palm Desert

376
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,445
- Sounds hot

377
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,212
How the hell did our cash
end up in the goddamn desert?

378
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,721
It's not from the 20 grand Diagur took
Those marked bills were all scooped up

379
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,814
What gang's running meth
through that part of the state?

380
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:11,658
I don't know Aceveda and the chief have had
us out of the loop the last few months

381
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,323
Street sweeps and dime-bag bust
quotas have let us lay low

382
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,765
Laying low has kept us in the dark.
We gotta get back to basics...

383
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,836
plug back into the street intel...

384
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,201
make ourselves indispensable
to the department again

385
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,206
Best defense is a good offense.

386
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,300
How are we gonna get Aceveda
and the chief to unleash us?

387
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,177
We won't have to
Walon's gonna do it for us

388
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,546
In the meantime, as long
as there's no paper trail

389
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,677
leading from the marked bills
in Indio to us, we're golden

390
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,195
Can you tell us how long
Klee was painting that mural?

391
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,095
About two weeks

392
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,294
Did you ever see anyone
harass him, complain about it?

393
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:55,134
- No
- You ever talk to him at all?

394
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,141
- No
- He was right across the street for two weeks

395
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,643
You never spoke to him?
He didn't come in? Buy a soda?

396
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,214
Didn't pay the boy
that much attention

397
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,215
Not an art lover, huh?

398
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,548
Oh, his painting's good and all that
Just sends the wrong message

399
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,848
And what message is that, sir?

400
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,754
You know, in this neighborhood,
you gotta choose a side

401
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,850
I'm black That's my side

402
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,794
Should've been his side too, hmm?

403
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,364
Hey, Vic We pulled
a match from the books

404
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,905
Tung Yung?
I wish I felt like laughing

405
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,841
The other victim's in synagogue.

406
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,811
We're gonna need your wife
to make a positive ID

407
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,144
Okay Circulate this

408
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,687
There's a steak dinner in it for the first one
who gets me a face-to-face with this prick

409
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,187
The Squad is being wasted here.

410
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,725
Aceveda twisted the chief s
arm to get you guys

411
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,796
He's got us reporting to Wyms,
burying us in an extra layer of command

412
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,422
- It's not workin'
- I got my problems with Wyms too

413
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:59,436
But Aceveda threw her in the deep end
It's not her fault she's drowning

414
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,201
You want me to unplug you, I'm gonna need
a better argument than a personality clash

415
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,538
Providing for the homeless
is one of the mayor's pet projects, right?

416
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,079
Yeah

417
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,706
Might have a hard time
explaining to City Hall

418
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,344
why your crack Decoy Squad was
pulled off the homeless torching case

419
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,218
to file month-old robbery reports

420
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,692
- I'll need details

421
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,964
That's my case

422
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,193
- We were embedded six
goddamn days. Perfect cover--

423
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,100
- What?
- I figured out why Tobar was
flaking on giving up the knifer

424
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,400
- Why is that?
- It was his boy, Link

425
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,975
You'll find the blade
and the bloody wear at his crib

426
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,976
Good work

427
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,309
Next thing I know, me and my
team are ear-deep in Barn shit.

428
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,407
Hey, we got a break

429
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,078
Murder weapon
Blood-stained Yankee jacket

430
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,951
- It's a slam dunk
- Great

431
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,821
This job's still only half done
Where are we on the hanging?

432
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,259
Uh, well, all of the likely
suspects have come up clean

433
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,457
He doesn't circulate in the usual world
We're hitting dead ends

434
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,591
Decoy Squad hit a dead end too?

435
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,763
Father Zavala was killed by gang violence
That's the Strike Team

436
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,239
I know what
the Strike Team does

437
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,573
You have the Decoy Squad in your
house also Why not put them on this?

438
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,704
Because they were docked
for insubordination.

439
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,079
- You docked them?
- I did.

440
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,618
I'm trying to keep the lid
on a racial pressure cooker

441
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,883
- I know that
- You put an entire special unit
on a dead Latino priest

442
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,823
and docked the team that could
be solving the lynching of a black man?

443
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,054
- That's not the truth
- The truth is whatever it looks like

444
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,325
and this looks like racial
prioritizing, Councilman

445
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,569
Come on

446
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,614
- 'Bout time you let us outta here
-Just long enough to do this

447
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:55,209
Elias Linkletter, you're under arrest
for the murder of Father Oleos Zavala

448
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,222
- This is shit!
- No This is proof

449
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,818
Oh, Tob, man, I didn't kill him
I didn't kill no priest, Tob!

450
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,524
You can let this half go
Except for that one

451
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,862
Aiding and abetting

452
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,163
Hey, man, you hurt us,
you hurt Kern!

453
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,898
Kern's licking caviar
off a Czech whore's nipple

454
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,941
He won't be too hurt

455
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,035

456
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,350
I want you
to tell me what's wrong.

457
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,852
- Aurora, I--
- I went to Rigoberto Spoke to him

458
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,823
Whatever your secret is,
he's keeping it.

459
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,291
There's no secret

460
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,522
You tell your cousin
but not your wife?

461
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,397
A less secure woman might think
there's someone else

462
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,731
- Babe, I'm not screwing around
- You're hiding something.

463
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,000
- Please let this go
- What is it?

464
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,871
Act like a husband

465
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,606
- Please,just trust me
- Trust me!

466
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,909
Aurora!

467
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,117

468
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,180
I'm very scared, David

469
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,160
Hmm

470
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,296

471
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,876
Those guys I fought--

472
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,615
One of them assaulted me

473
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,584
But you're okay now

474
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,417
They tied my hands

475
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,486
and they made me get on my knees

476
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,860
They made you... suck?

477
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,261
- Both of them?
-Just one of them

478
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,333
You didn't.

479
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,273
Oh!

480
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,746
Wait You're a cop
You're trained in--

481
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,050
I-I was alone
I was in-- I was--

482
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,150
No, David

483
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,630
How-- How could you
let that happen?

484
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,328
Because I wanted to live

485
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,363
For you

486
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,376
I wanted to live
for you and Sophia

487
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,346
I can't talk about this here

488
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:51,720
I never saw that knife, and
I'd never be wearing no Yankee rag

489
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,924
I was born in Boston, man I'd rather
take a knife than wear an ''NY''

490
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,129
I'm not sure if I'd use the Red Sox
defense in a Dodger town

491
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,206
That was a horrible thing
they did to KleeJones.

492
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,042
Lynching a brother's some wrong shit

493
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,134
Lynching a brother's some wrong shit

494
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,303
Maybe you wanted
to send them a message

495
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,574
make sure it didn't ever happen again

496
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:14,516
You got the right message
but the wrong messenger

497
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:19,249
No, we don't You stabbed Father Zavala
five times this morning

498
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,587
No!

499
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,184
This morning?

500
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,992
I was at my group

501
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,624
- Group?
- Anger therapy.

502
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:35,832
Kern's shrink Been learnin'
to keep my emotions in check

503
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,303
He's probably lying about the therapy
session At least when he got there

504
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,642
The parish raised bail for the Prophets.

505
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,616
One murder still unsolved, and now
all the players are back in action

506
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,515
Put Walon's team into the mix.
Let them spend the night on the street.

507
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,321
- You said you'd back me on that decision
-Just do it already!

508
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:00,420
Hey, whatever's been eating at you
lately, don't take it out on her

509
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,796
She's the main thing keeping
this place glued together

510
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,359
- That's enough, Dutch
- No You've got her juggling
a full detective load

511
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,372
plus this supervisory post, and
then you hang her out to dry

512
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,910
- That's not leadership
- How's your detective load, Wagenbach?

513
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,003
Anything new on the sick
bastard raping grandmothers?

514
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,776
No

515
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,181

516
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,220
Hey, Cobalt How's business?

517
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,755
We're looking for a friend of yours--

518
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,950
an Asian guy trying
to score painkillers

519
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,084
- Aren't we all?
- Mind if we take a look inside?

520
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,527
Mind letting me see a warrant?

521
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,621
That's okay
We'll just wait for him here

522
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,566
- Greet your customers

523
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,569
Who you lookin' for?

524
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,041
He was around.

525
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,136
Junkie tried to give me a ton
of Sudafed for a few dozen Percocet

526
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,681
- This is a cash-only slot
- Where'd you send him?

527
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,149
This Thai cat sells scrips
out of a clinic on Hanover.

528
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,812
Should be there in the morning

529
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,616
Thanks

530
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,054
His anger management alibi
checks out

531
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,118
He's got a shrink and eight fellow
hotheads who can account for his time

532
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,892
How did the knife and bloody sweatshirt
get in his place?

533
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,991
I'll follow up on that
I need a minute

534
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,934
- What is it?
- I bet on the wrong scumbag

535
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,842
- How did you do that?
- You and Wyms have had me buried with bullshit

536
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,073
- I'm outta touch
- Oh, what? So it's my fault?

537
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,650
- I'll bring in the right guy
- Good

538
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,742
But I'm never gonna
let this happen again

539
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,050
I'm no good half in, half out
You gotta make a choice

540
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,785
You either let me do what I do,
or I'll pull the plug on the Strike Team

541
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,260
Take my boys
to another part of town

542
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,133
Lose the hardware!
Lose it!

543
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,830
- Get on the table! Get on the table!
- On the table! Drop it!

544
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,999
- What the hell's goin' on, Mackey?
- Closing time

545
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,704
My first task as the new landlord:
get rid of the old tenants

546
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,440
This was not a part
of our transaction.

547
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,608
That deal went south the second
you screwed everyone else in this room

548
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,017
Screwed who? Oh, shit.

549
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,057
Seems you fingered a man
with an airtight alibi

550
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,422
- Pig's tryin' to turn us against each other, Tobar
- Shut up, bitch

551
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,087
I can see I'm in the way

552
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,596
What are you talkin' about?
You can't leave me with them

553
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,463
I can't take you with me
You're an innocent man

554
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,093
Unless you got somethin'
to confess, Twizzy

555
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,435
- I didn't do nothin'
- Okay. Take care.

556
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,374
Vic, where you--

557
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,570

558
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,946
All right! All right, Vic! All right!

559
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,414
How'd the knife and the Yankee rag
end up under Link's bed?

560
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,788
Not so sure if I remember
all the details now

561
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,952
Let me refresh you on the math

562
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,896
You framed number two,
which implicated number one

563
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,968
which bounced you from number
three to the new number one

564
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,503
And that gets you... zero.

565
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,638
All right, asshole Let's let Tobar
and Link finish the interrogation

566
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,713
Let's go clubbing

567
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,614
Hey, man, look what
we found at Twizzy's place

568
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,687
It's the same rope
Klee was hangin' from

569
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,652
Oh, shit

570
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,587
Shit Damn it

571
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,459
Ain't no one gonna
save your ass, Twizzy

572
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,057
That camera
hasn't worked in months

573
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:29,105
Now, you talk to us, or you can talk
to your boys between beatings

574
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,574
I strung him

575
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,407
You're damn right I did!

576
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,413
Someone's got to be
the martyr here

577
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,415
It might as well be me

578
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,075
Why?

579
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,585
'Cause that Rainbow Coalition
shit was crushin' us

580
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:48,785
Kern and Tobar caved on me.
They punked out.

581
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,726
Wanted to strike deals
with the Lats.

582
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,959
So you decided to set off
the racial bomb

583
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,596
The priest?

584
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,899
I wanted to see the Prophets cry

585
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,505
- Fuel the war
- Get the black back

586
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:13,050
Farmtown,Jack Uzis,
the local businessmen--

587
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:19,386
I got them all sitting down,
talkin' about working together

588
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,980
I did

589
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,957
Black-on-black lynching

590
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,624
Is that better or worse?

591
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,894
Worse

592
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,995
Hi What's up?

593
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,575
Open it

594
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,748
Locked

595
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,752
It's funny, you know
I never really lock my lockbox

596
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,379
Okay

597
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,064
The reason I never lock it

598
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,068
is because I can never remember
where I put the goddamn key

599
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,765
But somebody locked it.

600
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,674
I-I was looking
for some old photos

601
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,838
Some stuff I don't know
anything about your family I--

602
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,542
You know, I really know a lot
about your family

603
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,244
I called your mom in Indio.

604
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:27,757
She told me about the $7,000
care package that you sent

605
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,884

606
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,225
You'd disappear at night

607
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,232
I saw you take the key
a couple of times

608
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,894
So you decided
that you would steal from me?

609
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:43,167
I found a receipt
for a storage facility

610
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,265
with your handwriting
and a fake name

611
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:49,574
You've been lying to me.
What did you expect me to do?

612
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,583
Jesus Christ! You have no idea
what kind of trouble this is

613
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,745
You know what trouble
I've been going through?

614
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,086
- Why are you hiding money from me?
- You stole from me!

615
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,160
You stole from me!

616
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,923
That trunk was filled with cash!

617
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,090
I just took
what I needed! For us!

618
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,964
Us! What happened to us?

619
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,935
- You gonna lie to your child too?
- Hey, don't turn this around

620
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,443
My mother's a goddamn cancer

621
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,279
She was being evicted She would've
showed up on our doorstep

622
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,479
I didn't want her to ruin this.

623
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
You shouldn't have looked
into those trunks

624
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,855
Is there money in all those trunks?

625
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,933
- Is it drug money?
- You don't get to ask that question

626
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,406
- But it's from your job, right?
-Just stop asking

627
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,978
Should I ask Vic instead?

628
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,417
Is it Vic's money?

629
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,151
- Did you steal it from him?
- No

630
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:08,021
- Then where did it come from?
-Just forget that you saw it

631
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,561
How am I supposed to do that?

632
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,823
You just do it

633
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,002
- Hey

634
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,941
Look You don't take
any more cash

635
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,172
Don't breathe a word
about this to anybody

636
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:34,115
We gotta figure out what to have your mother
say in case people start asking her questions

637
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,312
Wh-- Who's gonna
ask her questions?

638
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,288
The money wasn't
supposed to be spent

639
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,661
When it comes to money,
we can't trust her

640
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,702
Then we're gonna have to find
a way to control her

641
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,863
Because if this money
gets traced back to me

642
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,431
this is life and death shit

643
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,704
For all of us

644
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,761
Is this the man who attacked you?

645
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,262
- Yeah, that's him
- Great.

646
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,924
The old Jew he mugged
has been in temple lockdown

647
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,867
Now we can finally
arrest this prick

648
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,033
I say something wrong?

649
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,041
I'm sorry Are you Jewish?

650
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,111
Someone keyed Owen's car

651
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,305
They scratched ''stay away''
across the trunk

652
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,976
- You think I did it?
- It had to have been done
last night before I left here

653
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,384
If I wanted you to stay away,
I wouldn't scratch it in your little Volvo

654
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,423
- What? You'd scratch it across my face?
- What are you tellin' this guy?

655
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,550
Nothin'that I can't see for myself.

656
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,561
- You keep your mouth shut in front of my kids!
- Don't yell at him!

657
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,962
Stop it! I wrote it.

658
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,035
- Cassidy.
- I'll do it

659
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,143

660
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,616
I don't want him here

661
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,621
Owen makes your mommy
happy, honey

662
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,089
Why can't you make Mommy happy?

663
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,389
I'd be hurt if I were you too

664
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,526
I will always be your dad

665
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,964
and your mommy'll
always be your mommy

666
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,536
That's never gonna change

667
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,435
Everything is changing

668
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,676
Yes?

669
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,111
The Decoy Squad's being
transferred to South Central

670
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,115
- When?
- Tomorrow

671
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,117
- Who--
- It was the assistant chiefs call.

672
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,188
I didn't fight it
It wasn't gonna work

673
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,689
We can still get done what
we need to with the Strike Team

674
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,228
Vic and his guys are going back
to full-time anti-gang and vice status

675
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,162
You're putting them back on the street

676
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,428
I'm no longer running the team

677
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,628
I had no time to consult with you.

678
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,069
It all went down pretty quickly

679
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:14,577
You, uh-- You'll resume
your regular detective rotation.

680
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,875
So strike one and I'm out

681
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,645
It was my fault
I had you half in, half out

682
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,346
- I should've just let--
- You're the boss

683
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,515
You don't have to explain
your decision

684
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,901
Charges against your boys
have been dropped

685
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,904
I heard

686
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,133
You also hear that
we know who did it?

687
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,938
Tell Los Profetas
no more retribution

688
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,013
That's God's decision

689
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,413
God's decided to put me
back in business

690
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,485
My streets, my rules

691
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,487
- Niners ain't playin' by the rules
- Twizzy was a rogue

692
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,683
Kern, Tobar-- never
would've let that happen

693
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,488
We still got pain

694
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,031
Twizzy will be in County
till his hearing.

695
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,192
That'll give you a few weeks
to get someone inside

696
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,395
stop the pain

697
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,241
Anything after that--
commit any sins--

698
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,937
I'll be nailing you to a cross

699
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,330
Thank God you caught the guy

700
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,368
Yeah People are relieved

701
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:49,098
The election should be
smooth sailing

702
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,106
Good

703
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,278
I just came home to change

704
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,280
Okay

705
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,782
He's early

706
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,123
- Tung Yung?

707
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,689

708
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,804

709
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,041
Stay down!

710
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,839
Stay down!

711
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,378

712
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,803
What's the target?

713
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,773
Blue house Russians
Fresh from the Kremlin

714
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,209
Movin' in Movin' weight
China white

715
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,372
I got some bad news, Boris

716
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,045
The air just tastes better
today, doesn't it?

717
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,056
Yeah

718
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,218
Vic, I, uh--

719
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,596
What?

720
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,326
It's good to be back

721
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,528

722
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,314
- Where do you want him?
- Put him in two

723
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,729
Knock, knock

726
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,073
- On the ground right now!
- Down! Now!

727
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,510
Welcome to the neighborhood
