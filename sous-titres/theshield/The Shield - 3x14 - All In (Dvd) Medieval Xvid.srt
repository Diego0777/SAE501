1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,561
The mole is a local from Glendale.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,606
He worked a kibbutz in Israel for two years
He was enjoying the nightlife in Tel Aviv

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,404
when some connected Russian émigrés
got their claws into him

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,274
- What's his connection to O'Brien?
- None

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,872
He provided the Armenians with
classified intelligence in return for cash.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,543
Had a few girlfriends
with expensive tastes.

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,519
Sounds like you've got things handled
Why am I here?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,216
We set up a trap
on our computer system.

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,726
He signed on, accessed information
on four of your men.

10
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,353
Which officers?

11
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:44,838
You gave the Armenian mob
information on my men?

12
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,539
They called. Asked for intel
on the Farmington Strike Team.

13
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,379
- How much information did you pass on?
-J-Just names and photos

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,249
Did they ask for anything else?
Home addresses? Relatives?

15
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,586
They wanted everything The system here
shut down before I could get the rest

16
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,556
The Armenian mob
is on a killing spree

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,685
If my men are in danger,
I need to know

18
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,162
If they ask for information,
I get it to them

19
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,800
But in your experience,
what does that mean?

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,398
It probably isn't good

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,773
- Hey, what's with the uniform?

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,648
I spoke to Heather
about cutting back my hours

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,049
I'm, uh, working
part-time days now

24
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,678
I thought you were quitting

25
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,984
I'm only gonna work when the kids
are at school or with the therapist

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,583
I'm not going to give up
every other aspect of my life

27
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,254
Heather said that
I could choose my own hours.

28
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,629
Listen, uh, as soon
as the house is livable again

29
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,635
I'd like for Cassidy
to stay here with me for a while

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,037
It'll give you a chance
to focus on Megan and Matthew

31
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,042
I'm not splitting up my family

32
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:55,240
They'll still be together, on weekends, holidays.
I'm just talking day to day.

33
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,749
- A trial basis
- How can you even handle her on a day to day?

34
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,650
I'll do whatever I have to do.
I'll hire people,just like you.

35
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,155
Now,you're doing your best.

36
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,954
But Matthew almost burnt the house down
It's not working

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,062
Sojust this once,
I'm gonna try it my way.

38
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,225

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,373

40
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,934
Hey

41
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,775

42
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,948
Brought you some contraband

43
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,419
Don't let the nurses see it

44
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,957
When we get you outta here, we're gonna
rustle you up some live ones

45
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,050
I bet

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,989
Um, they're, uh, sending someone
over from the station to talk to you

47
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,127
- They come by yet?
- Uh, tomorrow, I think

48
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,003
Oh, good Last thing you need
is IAD crawling up your ass

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,076
H-How do you mean?

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,049
Well, if they found out you started
the fight with Shane, hit Mara--

51
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,254
You could lose yourjob,
your pension.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,789
Maybe even your health benefits

53
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,293
Lem said you don't remember
much about what happened

54
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,456
I-I don't,
but I wouldn't hit a woman

55
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,698
Mara's pregnant Remember?

56
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:29,002
The department could
come down pretty hard

57
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,202
Look You know,
I'll tell my side of the story

58
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,371
Let him tell his,
and then they can just sort it out

59
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,110

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,986
- Tavon didn't bite

61
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,653
What if I come forward?
I take responsibility for hitting him?

62
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,890
That's smart.
Just walk into a police station...

63
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,092
and admit the three of us
have been covering it up for two months

64
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,533
- I'm just trying to do what's best
- I gave you the chance to--

65
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,401
Hey, look I made the call
I mean, can't you just talk to him again?

66
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,940
He's not listening to me

67
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,239

68
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,140
Well, Tavon's always had
a soft spot for Lem

69
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,879
Maybe the both of you
can work on him

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,551
All right, it's time to go
bitch-slap the Armenian mob.

71
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,559
We'll talk about it on the way

72
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,891
Try not to land the three of us
in jail while we're gone

73
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,299

74
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,527

75
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,661
- What are you looking at?

76
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,846
What's this?
Something for me?

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,349

78
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,749
Euro Rug Imports
Is that your business?

79
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,288
- I do work for them
- What kind of work?

80
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,358
Euro Rug Imports

81
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,358
Right

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,829
Show and tell, kids Show us what
you're doing We'll tell you why it's a crime

83
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,492
- Hey!

84
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,772

85
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,711
- Oh, shit

86
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,748
That's Armenian for ''Oh, shit''

87
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,841
Ripped by:

88
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,444
Hound

89
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,525

90
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,691
That was some serious bookkeeping
you had going on down there

91
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,698
Wanna tell me what
all the accounting was for?

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,668
- What, did you open up a branch of H&R Blochian?
- I'm in the rug business

93
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,068
There are only a half dozen rugs
in that place

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,802
The numbers your girl
was crunching went into the six digits

95
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,740
My guess, we'll have to sweat her.

96
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,214
- No, she doesn't--
- She doesn't what?

97
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,615
We're all just in
the rug business

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,713
Three months ago,you're in a duplex in
Kirovakan, running your family's tile business.

99
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,849
You're educated,
no criminal record

100
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,120
How'd you end up
in the asshole of LA

101
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,253
cooking the books
for the Armenian Might?

102
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,132
What do they have on you?

103
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,312
My-- father

104
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,745
uh, lost money to them

105
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,784
He got sick, couldn't pay

106
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,684
And now you're covering the debt

107
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,657
He died two weeks after I left

108
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,853
Then why do you stay here?

109
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:41,264
My sister, Sosi.
He has her here.

110
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,927
He will kill her
if I do not keep helping

111
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,971
- Who has her?
- Don't know name

112
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,237
They fear him
Long hair

113
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,676
Margos

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,341
- Is he here in Los Angeles?
- Yes Not know where

115
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,648
He tells Petrosh nothing.

116
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,654
Treats him like dog

117
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,016
Uh, tell me
about the accounting

118
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,654
They steal gas,
sell it, pay no taxes

119
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,702
Sosi

120
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,000
she doesn't even know
our father is dead

121
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,547

122
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,847
The DA asked me to come down

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,116
- A public defender was shot?
- Lisa Kensit

124
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,819
She was a good lawyer
She tried a bunch of cases of mine

125
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,726
Made me look like a fool
a couple times on the stand

126
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,992
I know.
It's hard to believe.

127
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,567
She's at Mission Cross.
Don't think she's gonna make it.

128
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,070
- We know what happened?
- She'djust come from sentencing for her client.

129
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,231
A gang member in the One-niners

130
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,502
He got 1 0 in Chino,
no chance of parole

131
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,443
- You think this is payback for a guilty verdict?
- No one likes lawyers

132
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,413
Having a thankless job
is bad enough.

133
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,780
Getting shot for it is just insulting

134
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,479

135
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,491
Hey! Hey, pull over!
Right here! Pull over!

136
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,766
Put your hands
where I can see 'em

137
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,859
License and registration

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,870
Get your ass
down here right now

139
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,703
- I-- Did I do something wrong?
- Sit down

140
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,004
What were you doing at Gas 5 5?

141
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,376
-Just making a delivery
- Tanker's at 92% capacity

142
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,279
Just making a delivery, huh?
You were delivering for 20 minutes

143
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,284
- Your tanks are almost full
- I just started my run

144
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,752
- Maybe you're filling up and not dropping off?
- Let's go, gas man

145
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,551
- Right?
- Protection for fuel--

146
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,252
Is that the deal the Armenian Might
cut with the local pumps?

147
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,195
Once a week-- Once a week,
I hit about three or four places

148
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,200
I fill up the truck, and then
I unload the gas at our stations

149
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,293

150
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,236
We closed down your stations.

151
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,276
Confiscated your tankers

152
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,612
You're outta gas, Petrosh

153
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,512
We got no problem with the Armenians
trying to do business

154
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,608
We just can't have some psycho
chopping off people's feet

155
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,916
- and leaving the dead stumps in our backyard
- Margos

156
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,287
He's a problem

157
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,260
Your bookkeeper
confirmed his Interpol mug shot

158
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,262
We know he's in town

159
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,265
Come on. I know you hate
this guy as much as I do.

160
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,977
You need to--
You need to stop Margos for good

161
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,978
He'll be stopped

162
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,146
When our money laundering
operation took a hit

163
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,653
the bosses back home got angry

164
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,589
They sent Margos to stabilize,
get us back to the basics

165
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,127
- Basics? What, drugs?
- Heroin.

166
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,356
From his connections in Peru

167
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,025
Margos has organized
weekly shipments

168
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,068
- Where is he?
- He doesn't tell us.

169
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,437
But Kail Saffian

170
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,238
he sets up deliveries,
distributes

171
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:18,307
All right,you and Ronnie take
the first watch on Margos's distributor, Kail.

172
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,784
- Lem and I will go see Tavon.
- Okay

173
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,625
Hey, thanks for
helping me out on that

174
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,559

175
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,826
There's some bad blood between
old-world and new-school Armenians.

176
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:38,529
Margos Dezirian's stateside,
looking to revitalize the heroin trade

177
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,664
- How do we get to him?
- Gonna sit on his distributor.

178
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,442
You guys find Margos
before he finds you

179
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,979
- What's that mean?
- A mole inside Treasury...

180
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,811
passed on your names and photos
to the Armenian mob.

181
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,587
- Anything else?
- Your personnel files weren't breached.

182
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,590
But if you want
department protection--

183
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,455
The Armenians
need protection, not us

184
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,425
They could be looking to retaliate

185
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,987
I take it as a compliment
Means we're making a dent

186
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,198
All right Let me know
if you change your minds

187
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:18,106

188
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,373
The Armenians think we know
something about the money train.

189
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,641
- Diagur or O'Brien told them
- They have our names and pictures.

190
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,649
We're walking bull's-eyes, man.

191
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,879
We've been turning over Little Armenia
for days now It's payback for the raids

192
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,548
Margos is in town.
He's here about the money, not the raids.

193
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,149
Look. In the next few days, that money
will be turned into untraceable real estate.

194
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:40,927
In the meantime, we get
to this Margos prick before he gets to us.

195
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,332
I just heard from Nell Why didn't
you tell me Treasury found their mole?

196
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,735
Because a public defender was shot
I needed you working on that

197
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,932
- So, what'd they tell us?
- They caught the guy

198
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,976
trying to access information
on the Strike Team

199
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,137
-Just the Strike Team?
- You sound disappointed

200
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,476
I'm not

201
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,380
It's just we were all looking
into O'Brien, including you and me

202
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,886
Vic and his guys have been tossing
Little Armenia all week

203
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,583
Yeah
The question is why

204
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,064
What?

205
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,066
Well

206
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,734
Vic knew the name
of the bar

207
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,072
that O'Brien says he found
the marked money in

208
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:29,011
And you and I were the only ones
who saw the case file

209
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,907
You-- You think Vic's involved?

210
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:40,014
Here's a guy who can overturn
the Armenian mob in a week

211
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,220
but hasn't been able to find anything
on the money train in three months?

212
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,288
If he's that good, how does
a multimillion-dollar laundering ring

213
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,267
get ripped off in his backyard
without him knowing anything about it?

214
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,739
Maybe he found out who did it,
is protecting him

215
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,038
Keeping the money safe,
in return for a cut of the action

216
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,079
No, he came begging
to me for some OT

217
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,842
He's worked three security details
in the last two weeks

218
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,248
This is not somebody
who is flush with cash

219
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,151
I'm not saying
he'd be stupid about it

220
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,451
Stick with Claudette
I'll look into it

221
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,891
All right Vic says this distributor
is supposed to be short

222
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,930
How short?

223
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,159
That short.

224
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,135
- Kail's got kids
- What, bad guys aren't allowed?

225
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:29,469
I just think a guy with kids,you know,you'd
think he'd pull his act together. That's all.

226
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,711
Oh, Christ.

227
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,111
Well, he can call them
collect from prison.

228
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,950
Report to Labor and Delivery.

229
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,485
- He's sleeping
- Come on

230
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,584
Let's go

231
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,599
Hey, man, you ready
for that sponge bath?

232
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,080
I thought I asked
for the nurse without the hairy knuckles.

233
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,057
Vic says you don't remember
hitting Mara

234
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,593
Yeah, 'cause I didn't

235
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,631
Okay?

236
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,829
Shane called me down
after the fight

237
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,963
You hit her right above the eye
and in the side

238
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,137
- No
- I treated the cut.

239
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,408
I saw the bruise

240
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:47,713
The reason we didn't take her to the hospital
is so you wouldn't get implicated

241
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,788
Mara just got you
worked up, man

242
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,758
Believe me, I've wanted to
crack her a few times myself

243
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,728
Look.
You can't let one stupid mistake cost you.

244
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,666
Jesus.

245
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,574
Did I--
Did I hurt the baby?

246
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,006
No, no, the-- the baby's fine

247
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,812
Though Mara did have some bleeding
for a couple of days

248
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,984
Um--

249
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,996
What do you--
What do you want me-- What do I--

250
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,228
What do I say to the investigators?

251
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,169
Just keep it simple

252
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,175
You were tired,
fell asleep at the wheel

253
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,745
Next thing you know,
you--you woke up here

254
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,648
Okay

255
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,350

256
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:03,952
Can you, uh--
Do you think you can ask Mara to come--

257
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,395
Mara to come down here
and see me?

258
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,198
- I just want to tell her how sorry I am
- Yeah

259
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,204
Sure

260
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,245
Don't sweat it, man
We got you backed up

261
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,424
Parking attendant gave us your license plate
number You were in court today?

262
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,798
I just finished as a juror
in a tax fraud case

263
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,098
Six weeks of trial,
two more in the jury room

264
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,233
I was the only one who graduated
from high school It was a little slice of hell

265
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,607
She said you were in a rush
to leave the parking garage

266
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,839
I just did my civic duty
for two months

267
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,917
Wasn't really looking to get involved
as a witness in a murder trial

268
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,919
I never mentioned anything
about murder Dutch?

269
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,990
Give us a place to start We'll try to
keep you off the witness stand

270
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,422

271
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,929
Let's just say
I heard a story once

272
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,022
about a black guy
who shot a woman

273
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,466
Ran down a stairwell after that
and took off in a green Toyota.

274
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,804
She came in
heavily anesthetized

275
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,898
Doctors are afraid if they operate,
she could go into cardiac arrest

276
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,807
- What was she on?
- Opiate levels in her blood...

277
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,073
are typical ofhigh doses
of OxyContin.

278
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,809
- How big a dose?
- Enough to kill a normal person

279
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,785
She's apparently developed
a high resistance

280
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,856
Uh, she's a junkie?

281
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,424
Doctors say she could have dosed
as early as this morning.

282
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,926
She was in court this morning

283
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,129
Shane, Shane, where you at, man?
You copy?

284
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,295
Yeah, man, I'm here

285
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,273
- Where's Kail?
- He's the midget into his third stack of hotcakes

286
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,674
Hey, man, how did everything
go at the hospital?

287
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,681
Good Everything's fine

288
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,119
Thank you

289
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,021
- He's moving

290
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,253
Okay, he's, uh--
He's-- He's moving

291
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,261
He's in the silver Expedition

292
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,354
On a booster seat

293
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,457
Okay, we got 'im.

294
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,696
You already got me bugging cars
in my garage What else you want, man?

295
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,402
Tell me more about
how your operation launders cash

296
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,570
What, you plan on
jacking a bank, Captain?

297
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,979
It's an additional part
of our investigation

298
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,074
Didn't Detective Mackey
go over this with you?

299
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,313
He never said shit

300
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,688
Well, let's say you've got
two, three million dollars in cash

301
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,693
What would somebody do with it?

302
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,331
Not everyone's as smart
as I am about this

303
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,096
- Let's pretend they were
- First thing you do is nothing

304
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,103
You hold on to it
until the heat goes away

305
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,105
- Hold it where?
- Not home, not work

306
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,801
Someplace close
in case you need to access it quickly

307
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,741
Low profile
Untraceable

308
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,814
Me? I prefer shell corporations

309
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:14,750
Mere mortals, they use warehouses,
storage lockers

310
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,913
And you're tapped into
other money launderers, yeah?

311
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,753
- I gave everything I'm giving you, man
- I want you to spread word

312
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,987
that the feds are onto the crew that ripped off
the Armenian mob six months ago

313
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,189
- For real?
- Yeah

314
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,994
And if whoever's facilitating
the cash claim comes forward now

315
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:33,868
reveals who's got it,
they're looking at a free pass

316
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,942
We're north on Kenmore
He's driving with purpose

317
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,712
Yeah, we got him.

318
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,344
West on Fountain
West on Fountain

319
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,452
- Shit!

320
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,690
He's evading. He's driving smart.
Don't tip him off.

321
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,790
We got him. We're smarter.

322
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,836
He's driving this careful, he's going
somewhere he doesn't wanna see us

323
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,332
We're circling back around to you.

324
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,069

325
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,205

326
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,806
- Shit! What's he doing?

327
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,114
- He just made a U-turn
He's heading back your way

328
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,849
- Ah, he's by us
- Goddamn it

329
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,323
I need an APB
on a silver Ford Expedition

330
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,759
The reason you're here is Lisa Kensit
paged you eight times last month

331
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,296
- Twice last night
- She's my lawyer

332
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,389
- Trial was three years ago.
What'd you talk about?

333
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,300
- It's privileged.
- The office said your name
wasn't on the sign-in sheet

334
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,100
We met outside
She liked the fresh air

335
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,005
We checked her cell phone records
You were the last person she spoke to

336
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,601
- before she was shot
- I didn't shoot her.

337
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,240
Maybe you slipped off the wagon
She threatened to tell your PO

338
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,217
- I've been clean a long time
- Why don't you just tell me why you paged her...

339
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,550
and I'll let you go home

340
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,286
She had a habit

341
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,796
So, how'd you
come into that?

342
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,196
I told her I'd report her
if she didn't get me out of trouble

343
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,131
And she got you probation?

344
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,729
Pulled every favor she had
at the D.A. 's office.

345
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,708
So,you needed help
keeping out ofjail.

346
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,869
She needed help finding fixes?

347
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,208
How long you have
this arrangement?

348
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,410
If, uh, you delivered the drugs,
who was her dealer?

349
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,044
No, no, no, in a minute
How long did you have this arrangement?

350
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,646
All we want is the dealer

351
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,725
- What are you doing?
- You're shifting focus

352
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,319
We need to find the shooter, not get
the down and dirty on Kensit's social life

353
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,490
Maybe her social life
got her shot in the first place

354
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,593
- But that's not why you're asking
- What are you afraid of?

355
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,036
If you establish a timeline
for her addiction

356
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,701
any lawyer worth their salt's
gonna push to retry her cases

357
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,404
If she were high in court,
they should

358
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,141
She defended Bob Lindhoff

359
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,218
He cut off Kayla LeSeur's arm
and left her in a trunk to die

360
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,219
You wanna roll the dice
on a retrial for him?

361
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,221
You're worried
about your conviction rate

362
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,760
Witnesses get lost, change their story
Criminals will go free

363
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,122
If we know she was high, that's one thing.
I'm just saying...

364
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,700
we don't have to work
so hard to find out

365
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,474
Let's find the shooter

366
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,207
David Aceveda for city council.

367
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,875
He's cleaned up Farmington
He's gonna clean up LA

368
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,886
David Aceveda for city council
and a better future

369
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,183
Ma'am, management
wants you to move

370
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,486
Of course they want me to move
They're big business

371
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,788
- Ma'am, we're gonna have to make you leave
- David Aceveda

372
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,387
For everyday people
I-Is David aware of this?

373
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,024
- He's a police captain
- Yeah, we know

374
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,468
- He's our boss
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

375
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,336
Hey! Wh-What's with that?
What are you doing?

376
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,341
- Okay, come on
- Yeah No, no, no, no

377
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,378
- Why are you harassing his supporters? Huh?
- Ma'am--

378
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,540
- Is it because he fights police corruption?
- It's time to go

379
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,742
- Come on
- I'm not moving

380
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,353
Watch your step.

381
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,618
David It's him David!

382
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,920
- Quiet down.
- Someone call for me?

383
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,394
Your biggest fan. She's been campaigning
outside of supermarkets...

384
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,398
harassing customers for days.

385
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,593
David

386
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,399
You're gonna win
You'll be mayor one day

387
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,440
No, governor

388
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,177
I'll talk to her

389
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,270
No reason to put her
through the system

390
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,207
Uh, so, what's your name?

391
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,945
- Carol
- Well, tell me, Carol

392
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:48,958
Are you involved in my campaign
in a-- in an official capacity?

393
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,429
No I do this all by myself

394
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,901
Well, I appreciate your support,
but all I really need is your vote

395
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:03,134
So, I'm-- I'm gonna let you out, but I trust
you're not gonna break the law again. Okay?

396
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,940
That's it?

397
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,113
I'm out there 1 2 hours a day,
and-- and that's how he thanks me?

398
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,025
6-Paul-1 1,
we have a visual on your Ford Expedition.

399
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,157
- Should we pull him over?
- Negative

400
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,328
Gimme his location
Keep tailing and stay outta sight

401
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,066
I got you now, you jerk bastard

402
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,206
- Who's Kensit's dealer?
- I can't tell you

403
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,213
Can't or won't?

404
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,549
The dealer, Mary

405
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,150
Is it cold in here?

406
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,383
No Why?

407
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,222
I noticed the goose bumps
Show me your eyes

408
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,358
I told you I'm clean

409
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,707
How long did you deliver
Oxy to Kensit?

410
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,807
- You're under arrest
- On what charges?

411
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,282
Obstruction of justice

412
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,717
being under the influence
of a controlled substance

413
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,621
The only thing I'm on
is allergy medicine

414
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,625
I don't think so

415
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,989
- You can't hold her
- Sure I can

416
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,192
Besides, she won't
be in here for long

417
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:43,335
Another hour or two, she'll be jonesing
Tell us everything we want

418
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,073
Kail's outside the warehouse
with three other guys

419
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,310
- Armenian swap meet.
- Can I interest you in a little smack, anyone?

420
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,014
- A rug?
- Yeah, with horse rolled up inside of it

421
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,819
Yeah? What if it's not?
We blow this chance to get Margos...

422
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,985
we might not get another

423
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,562
I hope the rug fits in his cell

424
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,336
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

425
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:17,738
Do it now! Hands on your head!
Get on your knees, fatty! Get down!

426
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,140
Right there
Let's go Right there

427
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,145
Up against the car, man
Let's go Up against the car

428
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,374
Stay right there
Right there

429
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,473
Clear

430
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,726
Oh, I want the rest of the day off.

431
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,490
- Where's Margos?
- Who?

432
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,125
- Hold 'em off
- We're good

433
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,800
Margos, where is he?

434
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,342
You do have the right to remain silent,
but I wouldn't recommend it

435
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,714
Jesus Christ, Vic.
Shit!

436
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,617

437
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,025
Where you meeting Margos?

438
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,027
Where are you meeting Margos?

439
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,791
Jesus, I'm seeing
a lot of windows here, goddamn it

440
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,802
You heard Aceveda

441
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,964
These assholes didn't get our names
and our pictures to send us Christmas cards

442
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,974
- We're getting Margos
- Shit.

443
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,772
Before he finds us
You still thirsty?

444
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,212
- Help!
- Huh? You still thirsty?

445
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,342
- Maybe I should top you off
- Goddamn it Shit That's enough, Vic

446
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,352
- Get off me!
- Come on, bro!

447
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,649
He's talking or he's drowning

448
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,019
Now that can't taste good

449
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,392
In the car
Address in the car

450
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,658
- Where?
- On the visor

451
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,996
- Check it out

452
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,467
On your knees

453
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,368
Shit That's a block away

454
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,998
Jesus Christ

455
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,407
Is he watching us?

456
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,004

457
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,916
Sosi

458
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,827
You see?

459
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,166

460
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,763

461
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,342

462
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,174
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

463
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,081
- Ram it!

464
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,186
Something's blocking it

465
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,759
- Oh, goddamn it Lem!
- Oh, shit!

466
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,427
- Shit, shit, shit, shit
- Find him!

467
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,436
She's alive!

468
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,476
- Clear. Not here.
- He stabbed her in the back of the neck.

469
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,909
He saw the whole goddamn thing

470
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,175
- She needs an ambulance.
- There's not enough time. Get her in the car.

471
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,382
No Margos

472
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,752
- Call the hospital Tell them we're coming

473
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,849
- Get the sister down there
- Hurry up!

474
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,019
- What about Margos?
- Keep looking for him

475
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,724
- We got it. We got it.
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up!

476
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,290
- Come on, faster She's going white

477
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,735
- Is she conscious?
- No! No, man

478
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,273

479
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,540
I hear you wanna talk

480
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,581
Looks like you'rejonesing
for more than allergy medication.

481
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:49,585
His name's Marlon Gault

482
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,588
- That wasn't so hard
- He's my boyfriend

483
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,490
- He took care of me
- I can see that. Did he shoot her?

484
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,461
I don't know

485
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,762
He just told me to arrange a meet
at the garage so they could talk

486
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,604
How long have you been delivering
OxyContin to Lisa Kensit?

487
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,145
Three years

488
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,752
Do you have any proof, uh, paperwork,
receipts You could verify it?

489
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,949
No I just arranged the meets

490
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,925
Marlon always took
the money himself

491
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,443
She's gone

492
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,455

493
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,022
We won't stand
for his gestapo tactics

494
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:14,696
He doesn't care about working families
Just himself Huh?

495
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,471
- Uh-oh

496
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:22,171
Here come
his storm troopers now

497
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,180
Okay

498
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,877
Would you please
turn around, ma'am?

499
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,351
Your girlfriend flipped
on you, Marlon

500
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,362
She puts you at the crime scene.

501
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,694
She'll be saying something else
the trial comes around

502
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,393
If Kensit dies, you've got no chance
of helping yourself

503
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,733
- I didn't shoot the bitch

504
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:54,009
Amazing what a junkie will tell you
if you threaten to put them in detox

505
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,913
Lisa Kensit owed you $ 1 5,000.

506
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,417
Sounds like motive

507
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,147
That's a lot of money
for a pissant drug dealer like you.

508
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,156
She couldn't pay you back,
so word hit the street you were soft

509
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,658
- Can I chime in here?
- I'll talk to the D.A.

510
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,925
But he'll need something
on the drugs you sold to Kensit

511
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,762
How's dealing to her for three years
gonna give me time off this shooting?

512
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,768
Depends

513
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,034
If you can provide us with any proof
that she was using during that time

514
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,908
Shit, I got proof
I need years off

515
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,914
516
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,543
Make it quick
I'm hunting someone down

517
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:39,282
We're gonna have to hold off
on this real estate transaction right now

518
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,826
It's-- Something about
the Armenian mob being ripped off

519
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,124
Treasury's onto
the guys who did it.

520
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,494
- Who told you this?
- Well, the word spreads.

521
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,501
Bottom line is a big transaction like yours
is gonna be too dangerous right now

522
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,697
- I don't know what you mean
- The money.

523
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,934
- Cleaning it
- You got the wrong guy

524
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,942
What, you think
I'm wired or something?

525
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,070
I don't know who you are, man,
or why you called me down here

526
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,014
I thought you could give me a heads-up
when the heat's off, and it's safe to do business

527
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,745
Hey, listen, pal, I'm a cop
You're talking about doing something illegal

528
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,220
You keep pushing, I'll haul you in
Now get the hell lost

529
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,090
Tavon changed his story

530
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:24,066
We're gonna be fine
We're gonna be fine

531
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,175

532
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,642
Babe?

533
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,078
I've made a decision

534
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,208
- I don't want Vic in our lives anymore
- Excuse me?

535
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,415
- You can transfer to a new team, right?
- No

536
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,423
- I don't want him around us
- No

537
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,618
I don't want him around our child

538
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,128
Mara, he's my best friend

539
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,563
Would a best friend
allow some scumbag to get away

540
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,600
- with taking a shot at you?
- Oh, come on Goddamn it, Mara!

541
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,500
We've already--
That guy is going to jail

542
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,971
Not long enough
You said so

543
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,599
And when you told him
that you didn't take that seven grand

544
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,701
- he didn't believe you, did he?
- That's because you took it

545
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,178
- But he didn't-- he didn't know that then
- You took it!

546
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:14,980
You told him the truth,
and your best friend still blamed it on you

547
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,291
Vic's in our lives. All right?
He's staying in our lives.

548
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,696
So, you're just gonna have to
find a way to make that work

549
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,823
- All right?

550
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,833
Excuse me

551
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,268
Captain
Hey Everything okay?

552
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,571
Yeah I, uh--

553
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,704
- Hi
- Hey

554
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:48,252
I've got a house
I gotta get ready to show for tomorrow

555
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,981
- Bye
- Bye

556
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,519
Uh, what's up?

557
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:02,830
I talked to a guy who said
he rented out a storage locker to you

558
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,870
He ID'd your photo but said
you used the name Cletus Van Damme

559
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,871
- Why are you--
- I was on something else

560
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,704
- but that is your locker, right?
- Yeah

561
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,075
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When, uh, when Mara moved in

562
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,171
she wanted me to get
rid of my old furniture

563
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,274
I didn't know if we'd make it or not,
so I just put it in storage

564
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,649
So why the fake name?

565
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,279
In case they called
and she answered

566
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,881
I don't want her thinking
I might be having second thoughts

567
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,962
I mean-- I mean, you know how chicks are

568
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,669
What's this about?

569
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,033
I don't have a legal right
to search that locker

570
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,972
so I was wondering how you would feel
about showing me what's inside?

571
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,442
What's-- What are you looking for?

572
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,672
Hopefully nothing

573
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,046
Yeah, when Mara and I got married,
I just kinda threw everything away

574
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,314
I had to sign a year lease though

575
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,224
I still got the key
Go see for yourself

576
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,632
- Come in

577
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:19,699
Our money launderer claims the feds
are onto whoever ripped off the Armenians

578
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,778
- Oh, shit!
- So the feds know it's us?

579
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,870
I didn't ask
He could have been wired

580
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,280
Aceveda was here Wanted to
see the storage locker we cleared out

581
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,580
- What? Well, how long ago?
- Half an hour.

582
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,656
He knew I put it
under the name Cletus Van Damme

583
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,816
- Well, how'd he track you down?
- The manager.

584
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,952
- He ID'd a picture of me
- So Aceveda and the feds are tracking us

585
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,793
- We don't know exactly.
- What ifhis next stop is where
we're really stashing it?

586
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,595
We can't wait to find out
We move the money right now

587
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,000
- Figure it all out later
- Look They'll just keep looking for it

588
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,368
If-- If they catch us
with it now, man, we're done

589
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,566
We're driving it up to Bakersfield

590
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,009
- Well, who decided this?
- Me and Shane

591
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,444
- Really
- There's hundreds of storage units up there

592
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,778
They'll never look

593
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,547
Here Go Up! Up!

594
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,385
Okay All right

595
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,624
- We'll keep in contact by phone
the whole way there
- Okay

596
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,167
All right. Shane and I will take off first.

597
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,069
Get about five miles out

598
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,405
We'll look for tails, eye in the sky,
surveillance teams

599
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,944
You have to evade choppers,
you know what to do

600
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,946

601
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,710
Just drive the speed limit
You'll be fine

602
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,922
Call us when you get
on the road

603
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:45,289

604
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,195
All right. Check the back. Make sure
the trunks are covered up, all right?

605
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,569
Okay.

606
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:00,667
Hey, man, my phone's not getting reception
Let me see yours

607
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,271
- Yeah, it's good
- Is it?

608
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,196
Hey, it's locked
Hey, it's locked

609
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:36,036
What are you doing?
Lem! What are you--

610
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,844
- Lem! Jesus!

611
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,441
Lem!

612
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,282
Lem!

613
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,151
You made the arrest,
got the shooter

614
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,458
What if she were trying
all her cases high?

615
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,398
How could a public defender be an addict
for three years and no one pick up on it?

616
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,436
Scrips aren't like ''H'' or crack
It's easier to be functional

617
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,371
I sat with one in Interrogation
They had no idea

618
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,374
We checked Kensit's court records

619
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,912
- Her acquittal rate is below average
- Other PDs have worse results?

620
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,641
- Yes, but--
- So, does that mean they're using drugs?

621
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:16,948
You're talking about reopening cases
that will cost the city millions of dollars

622
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,318
only to reconvict people
that we know are dangerous

623
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:23,018
The DA will never agree to a deal
that turns the system upside down

624
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,027
Then I'll get an assistant DA

625
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,900
Dutch, give us a moment, please

626
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,832
Sure

627
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,942
Do you know for an absolute fact
this woman was abusing drugs?

628
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,378
- Not yet.
- You have knowledge
that she was using in court?

629
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,076
- She used drugs this morning
- That was a sentencing, not trial.

630
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:51,280
Oxy is not recreational.
This is an addiction.

631
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,016
- You can't prove that
- I can try.

632
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,524
You have open cases
that need solving?

633
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,651
That's your job
Not this

634
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,870
I wouldn't just be fighting the DA,
would I? I'd be fighting you

635
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,462
Yeah, well, when you're in command,
you'll learn to make these kinds of decisions

636
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,566
- I hope to God not
- Every cop in this house worked
hard to earn those convictions

637
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,805
- You'll be alienating everyone here
- I can't worry about that

638
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,815
You need to if you intend
to be their leader

639
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,013
If you think the D.A. and the chief
are gonna stand and cheer...

640
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,385
while you risk putting these kinds
of people back on the street...

641
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,981
you are seriously
overestimating your support

642
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,029
What if one of the people
she was representing is innocent?

643
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,362
The chief will not promote you

644
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,596
He will look
for the first chance to fire you!

645
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,730
- You understand that, right?
- I understand I can't take a promotion

646
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,607
if the only way to get it is to stick
my conscience in a drawer!

647
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,612
Oh, please

648
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:52,983

649
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,214

650
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,515
- What happened?

651
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,489
- He just took off
- Which way did he go?

652
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,560
He took a right on Sunset,
then disappeared

653
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,289
- Lem's not answering his cell phone or Ronnie's
- You say anything?

654
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,298
- No!
- Lem ripped us off?

655
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,836
No No way
He was never in it for the cash

656
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,269
He always thought
the money was a problem

657
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,805
- Oh, no No
- What? What?

658
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,347
I know where he's going
Oh, God, no!

659
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,423

660
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,668
Don't, Lem!

661
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,237
Lem, stop it!

662
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,769
Back off Back off

663
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,074
- What are you doing?
- Keeping us safe

664
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,215
Put the goddamn money
down, Lem!

665
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,808
This won't help us.

666
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,447
If there's no money to find,
Aceveda and the feds can't touch us.

667
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:10,755
Lem, back off.
Back goddamn off right now!

668
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,362
- Back off,man. I mean it.
- Shane

669
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,368
Shane, put down the gun.

670
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,267
Shane!

671
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:31,514
Please, man
Don't do this, man

672
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,279
Please.

673
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,318
It's gonna be all right
I promise

674
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,723
- Oh, man
- Come on, man Come on

675
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:51,394
You guys-- You guys are the only family
I got, all right?

676
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,436
I'm not gonna let
any of us go to prison

677
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:57,530
That's a decision for the four of us to make,
not just you

678
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,109
I've always gone along
with everything you ever wanted.

679
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,179
And all it's done is get us
deeper and deeper into shit

680
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,181
- Stop it!
-Just let me finish this, please

681
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,283
Get off me!

682
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:16,849

683
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,850

684
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,122
It's over It's over

685
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,658
It's over

686
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,668
It's over
