00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,975
You may have all worked out
a deal, but I haven't.

160
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,316
Now you want my help, I want
to know what's in it for me.

161
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,516
- That's not what we talked about.
- I need $20,000...

162
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,356
for Sebastio to get help,
like Vic's kid gets.

163
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,453
- Let's talk about this later, okay?
- No. Now.

164
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:04,002
This department's always
looked out for you.

165
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,833
You help us crack this, there'll be
something in it for you.

166
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,441
Maria says the bosses are
shipping grenades into L.A.

167
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,485
<i>They're assembllng them here.</i>

168
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,781
<i>Otherwlse, they could explode</i>
<i>durlng shlpplng.</i>

169
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,516
They're looking for cutters,
help 'em put them back together-

170
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,957
Nimble-fingered girls
they can trust.

171
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,893
- Why do the Salvadorans need grenades?
- They're making a play...

172
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,329
to get back into the drug
protection business.

173
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,833
The Colombians control the drugs. They
use the Mexicans to mule it from Bogotá...

174
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,904
into the black
dealers' hands in L.A.

175
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,499
Now the Salvadorans used to protect all of it-
mules, routes, distribution centers-

176
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,670
Till we busted their general, Bonilla,
last year, crippled their L.A. Power base.

177
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,079
Colombians exporting blow figured if
the Salvadorans couldn't protect themselves...

178
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,208
why pay them to protect
their product?

179
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,516
So they're bombing their way
back into their business? Extortion.

180
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,613
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>Rlght.</i>

181
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,022
Hope it's not too late
for you to get that job.

182
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,494
No.

183
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,191
But I'll need to call Maria.

184
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,766
Let's set up a meet.

185
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>Lleutenant.</i>

186
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,006
- How's your partner?
- Getting better.

187
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,206
<i>- Nasty fall.</i>
- She'll be back soon.

188
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,108
I'm glad to hear it.

189
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,256
You, uh, finding anything
on the Strike Team?

190
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,622
- That investigation's ongoing.
- You checking into their finances?

191
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,598
Their money? If you're not
looking, you should be.

192
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:48,170
- What do you think I'd find?
- Not here. Later.

193
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,243
And don't talk to me out there
like we're friendly.

194
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,819
Kyle? What's-What's going on?
Why's Emolia moving?

195
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,588
<i>Emolla's contact made a last-mlnute change,</i>
<i>moved the meet.</i>

196
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,562
- Okay, follow her. Maintain a visual.
- Mackey disagrees.

197
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,997
<i>Thlnks her contact mlght have</i>
<i>eyes out for a tall.</i>

198
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,467
I don't care what he thinks.
Let's just move.

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,301
<i>Look, she's wlred up. She's</i>
<i>got G.P.S. Tracklng on her cell.</i>

200
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,137
She's got eyes and ears
on her at all times.

201
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,507
I never authorized
the use of a wire here.

202
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,843
Well, I know how much you love 'em,
I figured I'd try one for a change.

203
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,180
Give 'em a five minute
head start, then we follow.

204
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,464
<i>- Oh, great.</i>
<i>- Kavanaugh's comlng.</i>

205
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,871
Nothing like a large black man
wearing a suit...

206
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,965
- jumping into your van to maintain your cover.
- Is she okay?

207
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,840
- No reason why she wouldn't be.
<i>- [Emolla On Radlo] Thls</i>
<i>the place we do the work?</i>

208
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,846
<i>[Woman] Not yet. There's someone</i>
<i>who needs to meet you first.</i>

209
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,685
<i>Tejado runs securlty.</i>

210
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,381
<i>Guardo Is In charge.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

211
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,125
<i>Guardo.</i>

212
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,161
- Who are they?
<i>- [Man On Radlo Speaklng Spanlsh]</i>

213
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,368
- I don't use.
<i>- I check every glrl I hlre.</i>

214
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,875
This isn't the same
as H-cutting.

215
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,878
<i>You need cojones,</i>
<i>qulck fingers.</i>

216
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,346
<i>One mlstake, your face</i>
<i>gets blown off.</i>

217
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,543
First, you reset the striker
in the fuse head.

218
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,986
<i>Attach the spoon.</i>

219
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,526
- He's assembling a live one.
<i>- Lock the strlker In place</i>
<i>by Insertlng the safety pln.</i>

220
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,222
<i>You know,</i>
<i>once you remove the pln...</i>

221
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,232
and the handle's released,
you have five seconds...

222
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,202
to put the spoon and the pin
back before it explodes.

223
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,398
There's a live grenade in there?

224
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,740
Catch.

225
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,710
No, no, no. It's okay.
He's bluffing.

226
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,115
<i>[CIIcks]</i>

227
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,226
That grenade wasn't armed.
[Laughs]

228
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,461
<i>You never lost your nerve.</i>

229
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,767
Tejado will call you
with instructions...

230
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,967
let you know when
and where to start working.

231
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,772
Come on.
Let's go.

232
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,714
- How'd you know he was bluffing?
<i>- Because once you pull the pln</i>
<i>there's no turnlng back.</i>

233
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,115
- He knew it wasn't live.
<i>- Let's move.</i>

234
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,244
- Make the bust.
- No. It's too early.

235
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,915
We bust them now, we only get
a couple of players off the street.

236
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,584
There'll still be
grenades out there.

237
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,253
<i>We squeeze Tejado and Guardo, and then</i>
<i>they glve It up. That's what we do.</i>

238
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,524
<i>Fresh off the boat</i>
<i>Salvadorans rarely rat.</i>

239
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,567
- They'll take a needle before they talk to cops.
<i>- We follow Guardo.</i>

240
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,160
- Let him lead us to the grenades.
<i>- He must be parked out back.</i>

241
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,638
Hey, hey.
Emolia's still up there.

242
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,936
They bought her cover. She's fine.
I don't move now we're gonna lose him.

243
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,477
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- We're not leaving Emolia here.

244
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,309
<i>All rlght, all rlght.</i>
<i>Make sure Emolla's all rlght.</i>

245
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,475
<i>We'll find Guardo</i>
<i>on the street.</i>

246
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,914
<i>- How'd It go?</i>
- They bought her cover.

247
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,117
<i>They're gonna call wlth</i>
<i>a tlme and place.</i>

248
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,888
In the meantime she'll wait up
in Observation.

249
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,226
Marcus Dunn-
A.K.A. M.C. Dunn-Good.

250
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,824
<i>Hls mother's house was hlt thls mornlng.</i>
<i>Found a drugstore In hls bedroom closet.</i>

251
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,496
You and Ronnie hit the street.
Find out whatever you can about Guardo.

252
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,166
- We'll take M.C. "Dumb-shit"
upstairs, have a little chat.
- Come on, let's go.

253
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,003
<i>Uh, Lleutenant,</i>
<i>you've got a telephone call.</i>

254
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,672
- Can you take a message for me, please?
- They said it's urgent.

255
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,910
- Who said?
- She says her name's Sadie.

256
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,813
Excuse me.

257
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,499
Sadie?

258
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,534
Detective? I need you to give me a ride
to the 300 block of Forestry Street.

259
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,234
- What's there?
- A crime scene.

260
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:22,303
- You're gonna be the primary.
- I've got work, and you don't
hand out my assignments.

261
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,314
Do I have to remind you
how many rungs...

262
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,316
detective falls below lieutenant
on the department ladder?

263
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,852
<i>You get your ass out of that chalr</i>
<i>and you meet me In the motor pool...</i>

264
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,185
before I open an insubordination file on you
and put your picture up on my wall.

265
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,930
Come on!

266
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,464
I was only making sure I wasn't too
friendly to you on the floor.

267
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:55,172
Come on, man. I was just maintaining your
cop cred with the other I.A.D. Haters.

268
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,248
You should be thanking me.

269
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,943
Next time, I'd prefer
the silent treatment.

270
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,422
So? Mackey's finances?

271
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,256
You ever hear of
an Armenian money train?

272
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,229
<i>It's a money launderlng</i>
<i>operatlon of the Armenlan mob.</i>

273
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,028
I think the Strike Team
ripped them off.

274
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,933
- Dangerous enemies to make.
- Not if you get away with it.

275
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,939
<i>And I thlnk we're talklng</i>
<i>about a lot of money.</i>

276
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,705
Mackey gave his ex 65 grand in cash
they can't account for.

277
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,905
Corrine's got nothing to do
with anything illegal.

278
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,539
This is-
This is all Vic.

279
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,211
Can I get a look at your notes?

280
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,379
- Sure.
- Thanks.

281
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,822
So what's this case?

282
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,559
I got a call from my ex,
Sadie.

283
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,861
She was just raped.

284
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,809
<i>Is that too tlght?</i>

285
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,171
<i>Breathe normally.</i>

286
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,250
Jon.

287
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,910
Are you all right?

288
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,954
I don't know.

289
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,655
What happened?

290
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,921
She was attacked
as she got out of her car...

291
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,827
dragged to the other side of the vehicle,
out of sight of anyone passing by.

292
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,832
And no witnesses yet.

293
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,562
We need to get her to a hospital
right away. Do a kit.

294
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,662
I stopped him. I stopped him
in the middle.

295
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,333
I fought back
like you taught me.

296
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,535
I hit him
and I hit him and...

297
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,307
I hit him until he got
off of me and he ran.

298
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,316
- L-l-I refused to be the victim.
- The victim. I know.

299
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,616
That's good. This is
Detective Wagenbach.

300
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,021
<i>He's gonna be handllng</i>
<i>thls Investlgatlon, okay?</i>

<i>We're gonna take</i>
<i>good care of you, ma'am.</i>

302
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,487
Did you, uh, get a good
look at your attacker?

303
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:57,001
<i>Mexlcan.</i>
<i>Um, mld-30s.</i>

304
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,037
<i>Dark eyes</i>
<i>and a mole.</i>

305
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,039
Right here.

306
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,809
<i>I took a plcture ofhlm</i>
<i>In my head when I was...</i>

307
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,334
<i>I took a plcture ofhlm</i>
<i>In my head when I was...</i>

308
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,175
fighting him 'cause you,
you always said-

309
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,808
I know. I know. You did great.
You did great.

310
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,376
Next thing is these officers
here, they're gonna-

311
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,423
<i>they're gonna take you to the hospltal,</i>
<i>and they're gonna do some tests...</i>

312
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,050
to preserve evidence, okay?

313
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,726
You-You're gonna
be with me, right?

314
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,858
I'm gonna ride with you

You do.

Look, we can sit here
all day, Marcus.

323
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,020
That's not gonna change the fact
that you got a big problem.

00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,191
Yeah. I know.

00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,739
I told you. The bosses in Bogotá
ain't gonna go for that.

330
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,646
Well, the bosses aren't having
grenades shoved up their asses.

331

Colombians control the product. They make
the rules. Ain't shit I can do about that.

I'll have to ask her doctor,
but, um, I think so.

367

- She's that way.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

- Inside.

There you are.
Why'd you bring her here?

383

Uniforms pulled over a Salvadoran a block
away who fit Guardo's description.

384
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,398
Mackey wanted her here
to make a quick I.D. It wasn't him.

385
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,942
- What if somebody saw her?
She could've been compromised.
<i>- You were off the grld...</i>

386
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,671
- so I made a command decision.
- What, to get her killed?

387
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,749
That'd be great for you, wouldn't it?
You been with her every second?

<i>- Yeah.</i>
- He didn't try to talk to her?

<i>- No.</i>
- So, what happened?

390
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,021
Four grenades were thrown
through four windows simultaneously.

391
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:52,222
The house was hit on all sides.
A gas pipe exploded in the kitchen.

392
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,821
Whoever tossed them wanted to make
sure no one made it out alive.

393

<i>- [Mackey] No, It Isn't.</i>

So it's not a Spookstreet
drug crib?

396
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,106
Only drug we found was some Metamucil
in the medicine cabinet.

397
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:11,615
<i>- Must've been taklng a nap</i>

<i>- So, what? Marcus Iled?</i>

398
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,378
- Gave us a bad list?
- An old list.

399
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,784
We busted this place last year.

400
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,220

<i>untll Rawllng selzed It,</i>
<i>put It up for auctlon.</i>

402
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,824
Salvadorans were protecting Spookstreet
product last year, they'd know this place.

403
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,900
This was an old drug crib.
Last year's.

404
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,232
Yeah. The Salvadorans are
workin' on an out-of-date list.

405
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,900
- How old a list we talkin' about?
- About a year-

406
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,809
Ayear. Maybe two. Write down
as many as you can remember.

407
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,906
I'll do my best, but
I ain't got a memory for this.

<i>You can take hlm.</i>

00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,360

him in Interrogation.

<i>You seem to be unclear</i>
<i>on the concept of parole, Emmanuel.</i>

See, we give you an early chance at freedom,
you return the favor by not raping anyone.

- Who's he?
<i>- Where were you thls mornlng about 10::00?</i>

414
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,366
- Filling out job applications.
- Where?

415
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,706
All around. It's not that easy.
Gotta report my status.

416
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,280
As a registered sex offender.

417
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,440
You sure you didn't take
a break between references...

418
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,212
to rape a woman in a parking lot off
Forestry Street this morning?

419
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,049
- Hell no.
<i>- You remember where you</i>
<i>filled out those appllcatlons?</i>

420
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,955
- Not the names.
- It would help provide you with an alibi.

421
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,619
Yeah, but I don't got it.

422
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,697
- He's lying. Can't you see that?
- Yeah.

423
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,822
It's just a couple things
bother me.

424
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,801
His previous sexual assaults were against
teenage girls, not adult women-

425
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,963
- Assaults that we know about.
- Yeah.

426
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:45,941
Also Sadie referenced a mole
a couple of times. Olivo doesn't have one.

427
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,410
That's one detail off.
All the others match though.

428
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,947
- You gonna put him in front of Sadie to make sure?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

429
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,949

and then we'll sweep in and bust his crew.

440

And the list of Spookstreet drug cribs Marcus
Dunn gave us? You got that done already?

of each one.

443

that pickup for another couple hours.

444

You don't-You don't know
how much I appreciate it.

470
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,693
That's the thing. It's not-
It's not really closed.

471
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:29,467
Why didn't you tell me that Sadie
has a history of mental illness?

472
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,538
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jesus Christ!

473
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,912
- You've been digging up dirt on her? Huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

474
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,645
- I've been investigating the claims of a witness-
- A victim!

475
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,278
A victim.
Right. Right.

476
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,857
- But we have no physical evidence.
- Because she fought him off.

477
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,983
Okay, okay.

478
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,187
Right, and we are-

479
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,764
We are all grateful
for that...

480
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,062
but it presents problems
if the case goes to trial.

481
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:01,070
You see? She's our sole witness
and she's got a history of mental illness.

482
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,403
It's all in the past.

483
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,069
<i>O- Okay.</i>

484
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,612
How bad was it?

485
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,649
Few years ago
she had a rough patch.

486
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,946
She, uh-

487
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,647
Paranoia. Psychosis.
Depression.

488
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,815
- We're talkin' depression.
- Dementia?

489
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,449
- Difficulty understanding reality?
<i>- No.</i>

490
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,791
She always knew who she was
and where she was. She just-

491
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:30,266
<i>Shejust became dlfferent,</i>
<i>all rlght?</i>

492
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,804
- Okay. A-And now?
- We got divorced, and she went
and found some doctors.

493
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,601
They treated her.
She's fine.

494
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,676
- She's back.
- She's reliable?

495
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,439
- Yes. That's what I'm telling you.
- She's solid?

496
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,810
- Yes.
- 'Cause we don't have any corroborating evidence.

497
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,883
Then why don't you get back
to the goddamn crime scene...

498
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,952
with some extra hands
and find the evidence...

499
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:53,046

00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,857

- Yes, yes.
- Assuming an arrangement can be made.

518
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,098
Did Detective Wagenbach arrange or suggest
for you to be the attending nurse for Sadie today?

519
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,638
You're here to tell
the truth or you're not.

520
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,173
He suggested it, okay?

521
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,073
He said that if I helped her, it might earn
goodwill with you. Is that wrong?

522
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,944
There is nothing illegal about a registered
nurse caring for a patient.

523
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:28,041
- No. Wasn't wrong of you.
- Dutch didn't do anything wrong.

Look, this is a black hole we're sending
her into. We know nothing.

She fooled me for six months.

- That he would save you?
- Look, Vic is a great cop.

It's no wonder

610
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,739
Ten square blocks around
Sadie's crime scene...

611
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,909
are plastered with
flyers like that one...

612
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,511
warning the community about a registered
sex crime offender in their neighborhood.

613
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:43,356
<i>Note the mole on hls cheek-At least</i>
<i>It appears to be a mole at first glance.</i>

It's really an ink stain.
It's on all the flyers.

615
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,455
She I.D.'d him off that,
not because he attacked her.

616
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,625
She works in the neighborhood.

617
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,966
She probably saw the flyer, when he
raped her, the memory came back.

618
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,369
- This doesn't change what happened.
- I went back to Olivo...

619
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,136
told him about the rape hanging over
his head and he came clean.

620
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,177
He wasn't filling out job
applications.

621
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,476
He was at a local high school watching
the girls' cross-country team run laps.

622
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,346
<i>He dldn't tell us before 'cause</i>
<i>It's a vlolatlon ofhls parole.</i>

623
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,942
Of course he's gonna admit to
that before admitting to rape.

624
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,682
The coach saw him
hanging around.

625
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:24,031
We, uh, found this bottle in the nearest
trash can near Sadie's parking lot.

626
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,333
There's vaginal residue,
pubic hair...

627
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,839
<i>all over the mouth</i>
<i>and outslde of the bottle.</i>

628
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,569
Now maybe it was used in the attack,
but she never mentioned it...

629
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,512
<i>and she's polntlng a finger at</i>
<i>a perverted but Innocent guy.</i>

630
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,854
Where is she?

631
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,600
- I wonder what that's all about.
- I don't know.

632
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,864
<i>Whoever the woman Is, she's</i>
<i>got hlm pretty shook up.</i>

633
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,319
How long till I can leave?

634
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,387
Not long.

635
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,456
L-I'm meeting someone tonight.

636
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,419
- How you feeling, Sadie? You okay?
<i>- Yeah, I've been good.</i>

637
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,089
Been real good.

638
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,965
L-l- I made
a life for myself.

639
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,232
<i>- I know you dldn't thlnk</i>
<i>I could do that on my own.</i>
- Same medications?

640
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,467
Same- Same dosages?

641
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:43,240
- Jon-
- I just wanna know which Sadie
I'm talking to right now.

642
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,982
Ask me to come back again.

643
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,987
I'm asking
for the truth, Sadie.

644
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,082
The truth is you've lost
some weight...

645
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,388
haven't you?

646
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,694
<i>Why doesn't It look healthy,</i>
<i>though, Jon?</i>

647
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,893
I mean,
what's going on with you?

648
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:09,302

651
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,807
I'm asking for the truth
about this morning.

652
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,943
About the rape.

653
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,112
- I want you to kill him for doing it.
<i>- Klll what?</i>

654
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:29,022
A soda bottle?

655
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,028
Ask me to come home, Jon.

656
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,622
I'll say, "Yes." I am ready to come home
to our bed now.

657
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,862
I am.

658
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,373
<i>Please, just ask.</i>

659
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:49,640
You're gonna be charged with
filing a false police report...

660
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,045
and you're gonna be remanded
for psychiatric care.

661
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,710
That's what you have to do.

662
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,881
I'm-I'm-I'm not sick

<i>Sadle, you took a soda bottle</i>
<i>and you shoved It up yourself</i>- 

665
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,895
But I knew what I was-
I knew what I was doing.

666
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,401
No, listen. No, listen.
No, it was wrong...

667
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,938
but I knew.

668
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,274
I wasn't confused.

669
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,143
<i>L- I just dldn't know how else</i>
<i>to talk to you.</i>

670
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,273
You pick up the damn phone.

671
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:31,480
<i>- You just call me on the phone.</i>
- Yeah, but I wanted you to be able to save me.

672
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,755
See, I did it
'cause I knew...

673
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,557
you want to save me...

674
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,790
Jon.

675
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,231
To de- deserve me again.

676
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,701
<i>Because I want</i>
<i>to come home now, Jon.</i>

677
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,501
I'm ready.
I'm ready to come home now.

678
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,940
So, just-

679
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:57,776
God, just ask me already.
Come on.

680
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,031
Jon.

681
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,412
Jon.

682
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,575
You're gonna be charged...

683
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,312
with filing
a false police report.

684
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,448
You're gonna be remanded
for psychiatric care.

685
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,256
No.
That detective...

686
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,388
he's done everything
you've asked him to do.

687
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,900
So you just tell him
that it was a mistake.

688
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,163
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

689
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,171
I won't.

690
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,970
- You're gonna abandon me again, Jon?
- No.

691
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,568
Like-Like the last time?
You're-

692
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,911
You're gonna leave me
alone again?

693
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,450
- I'm going to help you.
- Then take me home.

694
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,146
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>There are rules.</i>

695
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:15,021
- Then break one.
- What I do is I stop cops from breaking the rules.

696
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,286
I can't stop them
if I can't stop myself.

697
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,386
Then you try bending one
just once.

698
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,863
I'm an Internal Affairs
lieutenant. That's-

699
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,936
- That's who I am.
- And I am your goddamn wife...

700
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,129
and when I got sick...

701
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:32,174
you left me alone, Jon!

702
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,642

<i>- You tell the truth.</i>

705
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,782
- You didn't want to!
- I was...

706
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:49,086
- tired.
- Of taking care of your wife?

707
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,894
<i>- So you left.</i>
- I'm sorry.

708
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,262
You can shove "sorry"...

709
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,631
right up there
with the pop bottle.

710
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,297
- Don't say that, okay?
- [Sobbing] I wasn't worth taking care of...

711
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,636
- and now I'm not worth shit and you-
- It's okay.

712
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,142
- No! I wanna go home!
- It's okay.

713
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,577

- Shh.

715
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,447
<i>- Please?</i>
