1
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,734
<i>No. No.</i>

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,934
No!

3
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,712
I sent Corrine's picture to hotels
with weekly and monthly rates.

4
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,078
Night manager called
when he got the fax.

5
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,515
Said she checked in about a week ago
as a... Jan Murphy?

6
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,460
Which room?

7
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,088
She's not alone up there, Vic.

8
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,294
- I know. She's got my kids with her.
- No kids.

9
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,328
There's someone else.
Ran the plates.

10
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,197
Guy's name is Steven Linfield.
He owns a yoga studio.

11
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,040
She's probably takin' classes with him.

12
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,134
When my gash of an ex-wife
ditched me, first thing she did...

13
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,645
was got that ass real tight.

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,307
- Manager said the guy's
been up there every night.
- Which room?

15
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,340
It's 209.
Vic, wait.

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,517
<i>Wait.</i>

17
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,585
<i>Vic, don't...
don't do this.</i>

18
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,969
<i>What the...</i>

19
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,805
What do you want?
Who are you?

20
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,645
I'm s...

21
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,117
I-I don't know. I...

22
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,689
Manager confirmed two different photos,
swore it was her.

23
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,750
You've been on this thing for a month.
You can't find three kids and a housewife?

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,021
No money trail.
The kids haven't been in school.

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,966
She's not with friends
or relatives.

26
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,265
<i>Look, if we don't expand
our search beyond So. Cal. ...</i>

27
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,639
<i>You know,
maybe I should, uh...</i>

28
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,631
- check hospitals, accident reports...
- Look, they're alive.

29
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,001
Just find them.

30
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,271
Come on. Hurry up.

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,050
Fresh from Mexico.
Still has its cherry.

32
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,084
Crack the seal.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,455
Two shipments in a week.
That's not bad.

34
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,203
- We're pregnant.
- Beautiful.

35
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,647
<i>Wrap it up.
We'll follow you home.</i>

36
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,652
You know, when we double up on shipments,
sooner or later someone's gonna notice.

37
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,854
Hey, Vic put me in charge, all right?
It's working, okay?

38
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:55,764
So just roll with it.
Oh, Christ. Couple of salties.

39
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,960
- They're gonna roust 'em.
- What do we do if they find that coke?

40
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,165
- That's 50 grand each, gone.
- Three black guys with
a trunk full of cocaine...

41
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,367
<i>can't drive the goddamn speed limit?</i>

42
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,876
Ohh. Great.

43
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:11,380
<i>- I knew this was a mistake.
- Shut up. Let me think.</i>

44
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,985
Hey, you're in charge.

45
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,018
Hey, we're in this together.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,525
Hey, lookee here, Clark.

47
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,523
- Whoa!
- Don't shoot!

48
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,066
- Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
- I'm a brother cop.

49
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,032
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all right.
It's cool. We're cops.

50
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,936
Here you go.

51
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,172
<i>Look, uh, you're not gonna believe this,
but you just nailed my informant.</i>

52
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,112
<i>We're on our way to a bust.
That's-That's our coke.</i>

53
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,687
- Who's in charge of the sting?
- Mackey's our team leader.

54
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,450
I'll give him a call
and get him down here.

55
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,286
- Who's your C.O.?
- Aceveda.

56
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,791
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call him too.

57
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,192
Sure, if you don't mind
waking up a captain.

58
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,997
I don't mind.

59
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,937
<i>Burning necklaces
have been gaining popularity...</i>

60
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,633
<i>in Central and South American
drug cartels.</i>

61
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,342
<i>Only a matter of time
before se mueve al Norte.</i>

62
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,379
South Africa's A.N.C. also
used tire necklaces...

63
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,276
<i>to torture and kill impimpi.</i>

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,350
<i>- Impimpi?
- Police informants.</i>

65
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,680
<i>- And since when do you speak Spanish?
- I'm taking a class.</i>

66
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,125
<i>I work in Los Angeles.</i>

67
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,822
Not knowing the language was limiting me
from being the best detective I could be.

68
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,871
Hiya. I'm Detective Vic Mackey.

69
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,376
- These your men?
- Depends.

70
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,946
What'd they do?

71
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,381
We pulled over these guys, found some
weapons and a sizable amount of cocaine.

72
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:57,683
<i>- These guys say it's for a buy-bust.
- That's right.</i>

73
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,917
They were supposed to
meet me over in Farmington.

74
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,788
<i>Nobody notified
our department.</i>

75
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,260
We're waiting on a Captain Aceveda
to clear things up.

76
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,090
Ah, it's not necessary. We're late as it is.
By the time...

77
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,762
Aceveda shows up...

78
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,977
What's going on?

79
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,708
We pulled over these men
with several kilos of cocaine.

80
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,476
<i>- I was gonna give you a heads-up.
- They claim they're on their way to a bust...</i>

81
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,643
- you authorized in Farmington.
- I didn't have...

82
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,394
I didn't forward the C-90.
I take responsibility.

83
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,460
Apologize to your C.O. for me.
I guarantee it won't happen again.

84
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,802
Sure. Sorry to hold you guys up.

85
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,068
No, no. You were right to call me.

86
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,269
Look, I'm sorry about...

87
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,445
- You're on your way to a bust, right?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,116
- Then go arrest someone.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,693
You and I need to talk...

90
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,853
now.

91
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,180
<i>Hey, thanks for cutting us some slack
on that little paperwork snafu.</i>

92
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,416
You've been logging less hours.
Arrests are way down.

93
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,419
Bad guys must be hibernating.

94
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,285
<i>- Is everything okay with you?
- Sure.</i>

95
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,791
Because you're a lot of things,
but sloppy isn't one of them.

96
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,659
Why don't you just give me
a demerit and call it a night?

97
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,960
A civilian auditor's
been assigned to the barn.

98
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,030
She gets a whiff
of what I've been smelling lately...

99
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,032
she's gonna slam a lid
on this whole place.

100
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,040
<i>Well, that's your problem.</i>

101
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,838
<i>I don't think she'll be as understanding
of your paperwork snafus as I am...</i>

102
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,677
<i>which makes it
our problem.</i>

103
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,078
<i>- This drug business tonight...
- Shane and the boys are out
making arrests as we speak.</i>

104
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,808
You better find your game,
and you better find it quick.

105
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,652
I never lost it.

106
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,394
<i>The two victims have been I.D.'d
as Pablo Fernando and Christopher Reyes.</i>

107
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,589
<i>Street names are
Bang Bang and Cuca.</i>

108
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,293
We got two dead bangers,
two different gang affiliations.

109
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,266
<i>A Los Mag and a Toro.</i>

110
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,338
Both high-level lieutenants
in the drug racket.

111
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,906
You can understand why they'd want to kill
each other. Who'd want to kill 'em both?

112
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,478
<i>- Well, that's the mystery, isn't it?
- Keep an eye out for the tag.</i>

113
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,205
Talk to your contacts.
Find out what's brewing.

114
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,577
Maybe it would help
to recreate the crime.

115
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,152
<i>¡Ay, Dios mio!
I'm burning!</i>

116
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,419
<i>Hey, hey, Smitty.
Get these two to the morgue A.S.A.P.</i>

117
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,232
Just a reminder: Lanie Kellis will begin
observing activities today in the barn.

118
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,532
She's a civilian auditor.

119
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,540
I know, but there was a riot...
the whole Gilroy scandal.

120
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,440
<i>You can't expect the city council
to do nothing.</i>

121
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,182
Say hello to fall guy number one
and fall guy number two.

122
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,174
- Hey, why are you turning in Tio's stash?
- It's not Tio's coke.

123
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,188
- It's theirs.
- They had that much blow on 'em?

124
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,486
- I thought they were small-time.
- They were until tonight.

125
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,621
I see you've made some arrests.

126
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,453
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

127
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,961
Finish the paperwork, return the coke
to Property, and move on to your next case.

128
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,724
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

129
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,200
That's a ton of weight.
Did he say who's running 'em?

130
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,773
- Alvarez.
- Well, we better go talk to him...

131
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,673
find out why he's moving
from the minors to the majors.

132
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,438
<i>Aw, goddamn it. What now? Yeah?</i>

133
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,005
<i>Tio, I don't like being here.
What's the problem?</i>

134
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,583
That.
He's puking up blood, man.

135
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,776
- Aah!
- What the hell did you call us for?

136
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,013
Like I'm gonna call a bunch
of paramedics to my drug crib.

137
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,056
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell's wrong with him?

138
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,022
- I don't know, man.
He looks like he's gonna die.
- Well, did he eat something?

139
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,286
He snuck a few lines
just to check the stuff out.

140
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,489
Snuck a few lines?
What did I say about that?

141
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,157
<i>- Is he allergic?
- Oh, man, he's going into cardiac arrest.</i>

142
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,099
Shit. Get me a towel.
Towel, towel!

143
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,209
Oh, shit.

144
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,681
Come on.

145
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,478
God, it's beating.
We gotta get him to a hospital quick.

146
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,817
Drop him off. Don't answer any questions.
Just get the hell out of there.

147
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,448
- Move.
- Hurry up.

148
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,121
Jesus...
How much did he do?

149
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,096
Just a couple lines. He's not allergic.

150
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,769
<i>Was he mixing?
Maybe the coke's bad.</i>

151
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,395
The coke is not bad. It's-It's fine.
Tio just needs to step on it a little more.

152
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,565
You're so sure. Do a line.

153
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,542
- Have the lab run a sample.
See if someone spiked it.
- Yeah.

154
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,839
Who's gonna mess with my stash?

155
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,745
Somebody with enough product
to step in.

156
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,250
<i>Asshole, 12:00.</i>

157
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,117
<i>Hey, Alvarez.</i>

158
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,058
<i>- You're out early.
- What do you want, man?
- Tell me something.</i>

159
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,060
How does a pissant
crack dealer like you...

160
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,291
suddenly start carrying heavy weights
of high-grade coke?

161
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,662
- I'm clean, brother.
- We picked up a couple of your guys.

162
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,034
Who gave you the coke?
Who's trying to push their way in?

163
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,505
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, man.

164
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,236
<i>Let's see if a car ride
jogs your memory.</i>

165
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,751
I guess you don't get to visit
One-niner territory that often...

166
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,120
you being natural enemies and all.

167
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,125
<i>Hey, Mo!</i>

168
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,132
Your sister's ass really taste as sweet
as Alvarez here says it does?

169
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,657
He wants to know what your mama's
putting in the corn muffins.

170
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,131
Excuse me?

171
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,141
- You messing with Tio's coke shipment?
- What? No.

172
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,538
Who gave you the drugs?

173
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,872
You don't help me out,
you're gonna have to find another ride.

174
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,508
<i>Hope those $ 100 pair of
Cortezes help him run faster.</i>

175
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,986
- All right. The Quintero brothers.
- Never heard of'em.

176
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,150
Armadillo and Navaro.
They're from Tijuana.

177
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,195
They told me to get ready
to flood the streets with blow.

178
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,529
They think they can just come
into Farmington and take over?

179
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,634
- I guess so.
- Guessed wrong.

180
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,738
Hey, get me
out of here, man.

181
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,068
Get out of the way!

182
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,270
Claudette? Your dead guys
may have been cooked up...

183
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,041
- by a couple of Mexican nationals.
- You got some names?

184
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,843
One. Quintero.
They're brothers...

185
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,077
Navaro and Armadillo.

186
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,759
- See that guy with Vic?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,229
He's been in a few times lately.
Any idea who he is?

188
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,268
- Nope.
- He had to sign in at the front desk, right?

189
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,633
- That's the policy.
- You wanna check the log?

190
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,242
Love to.

191
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,537
I'm part of a network
of private investigators.

192
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,704
For a fee, I can get
your wife's info out...

193
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,340
- to over 200 P.I.s throughout the U.S.
- How much?

194
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,819
For 20 grand,
I can get to half the agencies.

195
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,151
It's good coverage, but less bodies.
Things are gonna move slower.

196
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,953
How much to make things
move faster?

197
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,164
50 grand will cover the entire network.

198
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,463
If she's anywhere in the free 52,
we'll find her fast.

199
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,962
- Do it.
- They don't get started...

200
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,697
unless they have half the fee up front.

201
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,534
I need 25K, like, now.

202
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,336
You'll have your money in an hour.

203
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,342
<i>Who would have wanted to kill your brother?</i>

204
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,573
<i>- You know who Cuca was?
- Drug lieutenant for the Toros.</i>

205
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,688
<i>He was killed along with his counterpart
from Los Mags.</i>

206
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,680
- Were they doing business together?
- Don't know.

207
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,820
<i>Your brother was burned to death. Is there
anything you do know that can help us?</i>

208
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,829
- Nope.
- Mrs. Reyes?

209
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,366
Does the name Armadillo
or Navaro mean anything?

210
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,040
- Armadillo?
- Mayda doesn't know anything about this.

211
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,807
- None of us do.
- Again...

212
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:17,218
I'm so sorry for your loss.

213
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,062
Hey, what's up?

214
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,930
I need to make an emergency withdrawal
from our retirement fund.

215
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,966
You got the key, right?

216
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,975
Vic, there's nothing in there.

217
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,500
- You gotta be joking me.
- No, we took it.

218
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,043
Me, Lemon and Ronnie,
we took it to invest.

219
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,108
- Without telling me?
- You put me in charge while
you were taking time off.

220
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,484
A quarter of that stash is mine.

221
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,852
And I'm in the process
of tripling it for you.

222
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,790
It was... It was
gonna be a surprise.

223
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,792
It is. A bad one.

224
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,794
Look, I've been giving this thing
a lot of thought.

225
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,002
Yeah? And what's your plan, exactly?

226
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:06,233
I've been stepping up shipments.
I've been overseeing distribution.

227
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,369
Distribution?

228
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,702
We're middlemen keeping the peace, not
drug dealers. What the hell are you doing?

229
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,846
I'm not doing anything
that we weren't doing before.

230
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,440
- I'm just bumping things up a level.
- Well, what level is that?

231
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,976
Prison?

232
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,721
All right.
Where's my investment now?

233
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,449
It's all tied up in the coke shipment.

234
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,560
That coke that had Tio's guy
bleeding from every orifice?

235
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,892
- We don't know that that was the coke.
- I need that money.

236
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,961
Yeah?
Well, we all do.

237
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,535
No, I need it now
to get back my kids.

238
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,902
- What are you talking about?
- They're gone, Shane!

239
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,867
Corrine took 'em and disappeared.

240
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,240
What? When?

241
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,815
- Five weeks ago. God.
- Oh, Jesus.

242
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,249
And I need 25 grand right now
to find them.

243
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,547
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You screwed me!

244
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,424
I didn't...
I didn't screw you.

245
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,484
- I-I was just trying to make things up to you.
- Goddamn it!

246
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,656
I didn't know!

247
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,321
- I lose my family, and now this?
- I didn't know.

248
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,125
- What am I supposed to do now?
- If I'd known, I'd never...

249
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,133
What am I supposed to do?

250
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,614
Cuca's friends say
you were his girlfriend.

251
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,383
You left him for Armadillo?

252
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,888
No.

253
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,855
Jessica Hintel...

254
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,030
senior at the Wedney School for Girls.

255
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,658
Father's chiropractor
to the stars in Bel Air.

256
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,658
How does your father feel about you...

257
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,134
trading down from Westside cheerleader...

258
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,274
<i>- to barrio gang babe?
- That angel tattoo on your face...</i>

259
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,505
He must love seeing that
in the family Christmas cards.

260
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,413
- It's a dove.
- Oh.

261
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,460
Two weeks ago...

262
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,054
Cuca and I were
walking down Olympic.

263
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,929
Armadillo and a few
of his guys...

264
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,971
came up to us...

265
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:22,372
and asked Cuca
if he had changed his mind...

266
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,502
and Cuca said no.

267
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,508
<i>Armadillo took me...</i>

268
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,280
away from Cuca...

269
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,248
to his house.

270
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,317
He told me to take my clothes off.

271
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,992
When he'd finished with me...

272
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,596
he held me down
while another one gave me this tattoo.

273
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,436
A dove...

274
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,103
to remember him by, he said.

275
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,448
When I went back to Cuca...

276
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,490
and he saw the tattoo...

277
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,990
<i>he called me puta.</i>

278
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,463
He wouldn't touch me anymore.

279
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,000
Can you have my dad pick me up, please?

280
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,382
Oh, God. I fell asleep.

281
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,011
Yeah.

282
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,722
What are you gonna tell your wife?

283
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,827
She's out of town.

284
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,293
This is, like, the fifth time this month.

285
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,027
Is it?

286
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,899
We're not wrecking something
that's working, are we?

287
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,439
<i>Nah. We won't let it
turn into a thing.</i>

288
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,908
<i>Good, 'cause
I don't mind a thing. I just...</i>

289
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,843
I just don't want a thing.
You know what I mean?

290
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,543
Yeah, sure.

291
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,889
Hey.

292
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,525
I'll see you around.

293
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,397
Sit down.

294
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,472
The coke's worthless.
It's got rosary pea mixed in it. It's poison.

295
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,939
<i>- Well, he tested it.
- For coke.</i>

296
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,511
<i>Not if it was any good.
If this shit hit the street...</i>

297
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,045
God knows how many bodies
we'd be picking up.

298
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,706
I'm telling you, man. That seal was intact.
These guys saw it.

299
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,250
- You messed with it beforehand.
- I'm a customs guy, for Chrissake.

300
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,251
<i>I was making money
off this stuff too.</i>

301
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,753
If somebody screwed with it,
it happened on the Mexican side.

302
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,519
Well, who handles things
on the Mexican side?

303
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,753
It's, uh, Rosalina Imports in Tijuana.

304
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,888
It's a front for some guy named Navaro.

305
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,864
Navaro Quintero?

306
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,764
Yeah, yeah. That's him.

307
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,338
Jesus Christ.
These guys are up my ass.

308
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,944
Better come out here. Oh!

309
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,071
I got the other P.I.s started on it.
You got the dough?

310
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,911
Not yet.
There's a problem.

311
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,847
These guys only started
without the deposit as a favor to me.

312
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,815
You gotta front me.
You'll have the money soon.

313
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,580
- It doesn't work like that.
- You make it work.

314
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,157
- Just keep 'em looking.
- I don't have that kind of cash on hand.

315
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,761
Gordie.

316
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,796
These are my kids, man.
Please.

317
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,265
I'll tell 'em the money's coming tonight.

318
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,667
Thank you.

319
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,238
But this is my reputation, Vic.

320
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,242
You don't have that cash
in my hands by 10:00 tonight...

321
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,438
I'm pulling them off the case,
and I'm off it too.

322
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,090
Ditch your weapons. We're headed south
to get our money back from Navaro.

323
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,960
- What?
- Just do as I say... for once!

324
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,527
Vic, we've been looking for you.

325
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,572
I'd like to introduce you
to Lanie Kellis.

326
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,044
- I'm a little busy right now.
- Miss Kellis is our civilian auditor.

327
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,841
There's some things I'd like
to talk to you about.

328
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,004
I gotta go.

329
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,144
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

330
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,555
What the hell are you doing?

331
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,853
- I don't have time for this.
- Why? And where are you going?

332
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,955
- Tijuana.
- Mexico? What for?

333
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,961
Someone's putting poisoned coke
out on our streets. I'm gonna stop 'em.

334
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,358
Well, you don't have
jurisdiction across the border.

335
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,836
- Well, I'm taking the day off.
- I'm not authorizing it.

336
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,304
Well, if you want dozens of potential voters
keeling over dead...

337
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,502
so be it, but I'm taking the day off.

338
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,993
Hi. What's the nature
of your visit to Mexico?

339
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,362
Little bit of everything.

340
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,867
Go ahead.
Welcome to Mexico.

341
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,154
Okay, get out.
Go find some guns.

342
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,556
- They got gun stores?
- It's Tijuana. Use your imagination.

343
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,095
Got it.

344
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,062
If we find him, we'll call you up.

345
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,031
<i>Where the hell is Calle Mar Campio?</i>

346
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,637
Come on. Nice girls.
Come on. Come on.

347
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,607
Come in, inside, with girls, nice.
Nice ones. Come on.

348
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,709
- Come over here please.
- Let's go.

349
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,243
<i>Rosalina Imports.</i>

350
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,609
It might as well read "dead end."

351
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,651
- Now what?
- Goddamn it!

352
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,650
Police.

353
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,323
Is everything okay?

354
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,755
Yeah. We're just
looking for someone.

355
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,123
We're police too, from L.A.

356
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,390
<i>You should be more careful.
This part of town isn't so tourist-friendly.</i>

357
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,558
- A lot of muggings.
- Yeah. Kidnappings too.

358
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,670
A friend of mine's sister
got nabbed here two days ago.

359
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,639
I am sorry to hear that.
Did your friend file a report?

360
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,073
We'd rather pay the ransom
and get her back.

361
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,009
We're looking for
a Navaro Quintero.

362
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,613
Navaro.
I'm not surprised.

363
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,552
He and his brother
are our biggest problem.

364
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,452
Your own government has
a federal warrant for Navaro.

365
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,589
But as long as he's on
our side of the border...

366
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,785
Look, you know where
we can find him?

367
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,967
- Where are we goin'?
- To get your guns.

368
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,263
Keep following.

369
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,863
You know, this place could
be nothing but casinos...

370
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,577
and poontang,
and white-sand beaches.

371
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,308
Instead, look at it.
It's the goddamn asshole of South America.

372
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,213
Mexico's in Central America.

373
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,383
Hey, man, where the hell
are these guns?

374
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,623
Right here.

375
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,488
Where is your money?

376
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah! Your money!

377
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,057
Come on.

378
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,998
Aw, this is bullshit.

379
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,661
Shit, man. Goddamn it.

380
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,740
Give it.

381
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,743
Come on! Give it!

382
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,745
<i>Come on.</i>

383
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,050
Now get out.

384
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,416
Get out!

385
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,584
Get out!

386
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,754
- Detective Wagonback?
- Wagenbach.

387
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,696
Oh, sorry.

388
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,165
Lanie Kellis, civilian auditor.

389
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,533
Oh, uh, right. Hi.

390
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,004
I understand that you were
the lead detective...

391
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,972
in Assistant Chief Gilroy's case.

392
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,340
- Yes, I was.
- The hit-and-run or the land fraud scheme?

393
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,277
Uh, knee-deep in both.

394
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,781
Could I get a look
at your personal notes on that case?

395
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,819
His bail hearing's coming in a few weeks,
and I want to make sure...

396
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,253
- that nothing surprises us.
- I'm certainly the man...

397
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,486
to, uh, get you that file.

398
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,826
<i>Um, I'll get it to you
as soon as I can.</i>

399
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,490
<i>- Thanks. I appreciate the help.
- Mayda.</i>

400
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,465
You forgot your notebook.

401
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,070
- Thank you.
- Did you catch him?

402
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,036
- Who?
- Armadillo.

403
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,232
He's the one who
killed my brother.

404
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,405
Armadillo,
he came to the house one day.

405
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,946
He told Cuca
he could join him, or he could die.

406
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,410
He said that with
you in the room?

407
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,852
He kept looking at me,
like he was trying to scare me...

408
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,491
but I'm not afraid of him like Topo is.

409
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,389
Hey, sweetie, how you doin'?

410
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,894
- Dutch.
- Be right back.

411
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,605
- What's she doing here?
- She came in on her own.

412
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,570
Where's the mother?
The brother?

413
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,766
You're interviewing a minor
without a guardian present.

414
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,707
She implicates Armadillo directly.

415
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,709
He made threats to Cuca
right in front of her.

416
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,577
What exactly are we supposed to do
with all that information?

417
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,841
Put her in front of a grand jury,
arrest this guy.

418
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,882
If she can lead us
in the right direction, great.

419
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,282
- But her family doesn't want her to testify.
- She wants to testify.

420
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,414
- And her family doesn't.
- So?

421
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,356
So if you had kids,
you'd understand.

422
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,722
- Mayda?
- Yes?

423
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,559
Hey, come with me, baby.

424
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,098
I'm gonna take you home.

425
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,528
Oh, I lost my barrette.

426
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,572
I'll get you a new one.

427
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,480
- Is something wrong?
- No. I'm gonna take you home.

428
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,550
Are you going to arrest
Armadillo?

429
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:01,951
We are gonna try.
You're a brave girl for helping us.

430
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,318
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,296
Only two guys. You'd think he'd have
more firepower around him.

432
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,924
Probably thinks no one's
crazy enough to mess with him.

433
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,600
Oh, great. We're after
the ugly one up high.

434
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,335
- Give me a piece.
- We had a little problem with the guns.

435
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,305
- What kind of problem?
- Montezuma's revenge.

436
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,275
<i>Oh, shit. They're leaving.
We gotta go.</i>

437
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,381
<i>What?
Th-They're packin'!</i>

438
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,849
- Boss, this is nuts, man.
- Ronnie, go get the car.

439
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,677
Shane, Lem, you take the two big guys.
Take their guns.

440
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,750
<i>I'll take el feo.</i>

441
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,752
Easy, easy.

442
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,064
Hey, can you tell me where
the donkey shows are around here?

443
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,940
<i>Up against the wall!</i>

444
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,046
<i>Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

445
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:05,073
- He's here! Come on!
- Don't even think about it.

446
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,212
- Come on!
- Okay.

447
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,221
Go! Go! Go! Go!

448
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,019
<i>- Here you go.
- You got my boy in here?</i>

449
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,718
- Randall?
- Are you his mother?

450
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,387
- Yes. Why is he locked up?
- Buzz her in, John.

451
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,033
- What did he do?
- A hardware store owner...

452
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,832
- caught him shoplifting some spray paint.
- No.

453
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,769
He says he's seen him and his friends
tagging other buildings in the neighborhood.

454
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,107
Is that true?
Did you steal?

455
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,444
You vandalizing now?

456
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,125
We don't usually bring them in this young,
but we couldn't get ahold of you...

457
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,150
and this guy's pretty adamant
about pressing charges.

458
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,291
Look, I cut back on my hours,
so I could be home nights.

459
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,829
I am active in his school.
We go to church...

460
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,094
and still he does this.

461
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,568
What else can I do?

462
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,730
Let me see if I can help.

463
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,271
- She's pretty upset.
- She should be.

464
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,451
He's only ten, and already
he's racking and tagging.

465
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,215
Next, it'll be armed robbery. Before you
know it, we'll be mopping him off a sidewalk.

466
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,715
The mother's doing the best that she can.

467
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,654
I think I can make a difference here.

468
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,384
Julien, come on. You want me
to tell you how this story ends?

469
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,158
Okay, fine.
Knock yourself out.

470
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,734
Who knows?
Maybe it could do some good.

471
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,579
<i>I ain't payin'you nothin', ese.</i>

472
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,917
- Really?
- You let me go right now...

473
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,112
I'll let you get back
across that border alive.

474
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,553
Toss me one of them.

475
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,391
This what your brother Armadillo
does to people who don't cooperate?

476
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,327
You're not cooperating!

477
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,195
Douse him.

478
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,190
Last chance.

479
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,956
How much money are
we talking about, man?

480
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,462
Three-fifty, American.

481
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,467
I can do that.

482
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,130
- Plus 50 for ruining my day.
- Come on, Vic. Don't push it.

483
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,368
Shut the hell up!

484
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,254
Armadillo Quintero?

485
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,958
Yes?

486
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,496
<i>You're a hard man to find.
We'd like to talk to you.</i>

487
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:12,124
<i>What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Armando?</i>

488
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,669
You mind if I call you Armando?
I have a hard time...

489
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,865
keeping a straight face when I hear
the name "Armadillo."

490
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,177
I'm looking for
new opportunities.

491
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,348
Those opportunities include...

492
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,578
<i>moving the Toros and the Los Mags
out of the drug business?</i>

493
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:30,010
It's a little early in the interrogation
to be showing all your cards.

494
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,055
Where do you go now
when I say...

495
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,955
<i>"I don't know who the Toros
or Los Mags are"?</i>

496
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,154
- Our house, our rules.
- Oh, this hasn't always been your house.

497
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,099
<i>This used to be Mexico.</i>

498
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,463
And I've been reading
about your rules.

499
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,368
Yes, we saw the law books at your place.

500
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,077
You could only keep me here for six hours
without charging me with a crime.

501
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,569
<i>You're a prime suspect
in the fire murders of two men last night.</i>

502
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,708
- We can hold you for 24 hours.
- And I can provide many people...

503
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,981
who will be happy to say
I was with them...

504
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,817
when this awful crime took place.

505
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,015
Six hours.

506
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,925
<i>You're not here to fight
the Toros and the Los Mags.</i>

507
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,462
You're here to unite 'em.

508
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,897
One gang, one leader: you.

509
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,477
<i>Uniting the Toros and the Los Mags?
Come on. Think about it.</i>

510
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,380
They stop pissing on each other and turn
their guns on everyday folks... it's not good.

511
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,451
- So how do we keep him here?
- The girlfriend won't testify.

512
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,148
<i>- Mayda will.
- I'm not putting a 12-year-old girl
in the middle of this.</i>

513
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,953
<i>Not with him involved.
We'll find another way.</i>

514
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,900
Here, man.

515
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,150
I have a bad feeling about this.

516
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:09,847
Keep it to yourself.
All right. No guns, no games.

517
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,087
Drop your guns on the ground!

518
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,722
<i>Okay.</i>

519
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,867
<i>¡El dinero!</i>

520
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,578
What are you doing?

521
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,225
Jesus Christ!

522
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,788
Let's toss him!

523
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,039
- Anybody hit?
- No, man.

524
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,236
<i>Holy shit.
I just leased this car!</i>

525
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,280
What are we doin'?

526
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,385
He's got a federal warrant.

527
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,479
If the feds want him,
I say we let him start doin' his time.

528
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,686
We can't make arrests in Mexico.

529
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,893
Once we get him back home,
won't matter how he got there.

530
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:24,195
This is insane! His buddies are
out looking for us right now!

531
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,992
We got our money.
Let's just dump him and go.

532
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,863
This prick was willing
to poison dozens of strangers.

533
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,662
If we leave him here, you think
he won't come lookin' for payback?

534
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,364
- How we supposed to
get him across the border?
- In the trunk.

535
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,304
- Same as the money.
- That's if we even make it to the border!
Look at the car!

536
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,068
- How am I gonna pay for this?
- He'll be kicking and screaming
the whole way.

537
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,840
<i>There's 20 farmacias on every block.
We'll go and get a bottle of roofies.</i>

538
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,349
- What, the date rape drug?
- Don't pretend like you don't
know what they look like.

539
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,317
We're gettin' 'em.

540
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,493
Armando was an orphan,
lived on the streets.

541
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,155
I spoke to a woman who
was a social worker years ago.

542
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,459
On a hunch, she gave him
an I.Q. test at age 11.

543
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,197
- He lasted a week and a half.
- Didn't fit in?

544
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,000
He raped and beat his teacher.

545
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:15,111
<i>- When he was 11?
- Two years in Sinaloa juvie,
back on the street after that.</i>

546
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,976
If he hasn't been caught since,
he's gotten a lot smarter.

547
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,980
<i>I'll call I.N.S., see if the rape's...</i>

548
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,176
a violation of his visa requirements.

549
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,027
- Do you have that file for me?
- I'll get it to you soon.

550
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:39,864
When I ask for something,
I ask politely because that's my nature.

551
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,631
But when you make me ask a second time,
I lose my patience.

552
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,608
This squad has been the epicenter
of police corruption...

553
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,975
civil lawsuits,
and most recently a riot.

554
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,313
<i>The people I work for want answers.
They expect me to get them.</i>

555
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,718
I have the power to recommend changes,
get people fired...

556
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,391
even shut down this entire building
if it's warranted.

557
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,088
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Detective?

558
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,328
Yes, ma'am.

559
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:15,772
Good. Um, if you could
get me the Gilroy file...

560
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,704
- I would really appreciate it.
- Sure.

561
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,774
Thank you.

562
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,663
- Oh, man.
- Shut up.

563
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,506
How do we explain
400 grand in cash...

564
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,510
and a doped-out
drug lord in our trunk?

565
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,910
Nobody breaks a sweat,
we won't have to.

566
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,552
Come on, boy.
Search.

567
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,925
<i>Any sign of Detective Mackey?</i>

568
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,865
He's still in the field.

569
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,368
"In the field."

570
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,100
Is that code for "He pretty much goes
wherever he wants without any supervision"?

571
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,051
You're not after Mackey, are you?
You're after me.

572
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,685
I'm not after anyone.

573
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,756
- You have enemies on the city council.
- Who?

574
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,225
They're not thrilled that you
parlayed a scandal and a riot...

575
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:49,194
- into a 15-point lead over Karen Mitchell.
- 17-point lead.

576
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,337
They take the heat.
They get bashed in the press.

577
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,202
While you come out
looking like a reformer?

578
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,302
- I'm gonna be a reformer.
- Not if you don't get elected.

579
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,067
I have a 17-point lead.

580
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,145
They're hoping I'll find
something that will change that.

581
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,747
They know I'll be fair,
but they also know...

582
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,247
that if there's something to find,
I'll find it.

583
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,457
I'm glad you know.

584
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,160
Randall. The owner
left it up to me.

585
00:38:16,195 --> 00:38:17,923
He won't press charges
if I vouch for you.

586
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,394
Let's go.

587
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,292
Okay, tell me why
I should let you go.

588
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,233
I don't want to go to jail!

589
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,100
- I don't believe you.
- Henry and I needed some cans.

590
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,404
Henry? Henry who?
Do I need to arrest him too for coercion?

591
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,537
- No. I won't do it again.
- Are you sure?

592
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,689
Okay.
I tell you what.

593
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:49,456
I'm gonna give you this one.
But remember, I'm vouching.

594
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,055
And if this happens again,
you will have to answer to your mother...

595
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,824
and you will
have to answer to me!

596
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,161
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

597
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,070
Go sit over there a minute.

598
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,141
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He'll think twice next time.

599
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,747
Thank you.
I'm so worried about him.

600
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,483
You are doing your best.
It's tough these days.

601
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,489
What church do you take him to?

602
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,731
- Faith Temple.
- I've heard good things about them.

603
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:30,292
- I go to Covenant.
- That's Reverend Cook. Bad smoker, good man.

604
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,068
Yeah, that's him.

605
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,837
So, you gonna be home tonight?

606
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,671
I don't know. Why?

607
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,409
Because I'm not allowed to ask someone
out on a date while I'm on duty and...

608
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,843
Mmm.

609
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,548
Come by.
Maybe I'll be home.

610
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,471
Here you go.

611
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,272
Thanks.

612
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,703
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

613
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,464
It's been six hours.
You're free to go.

614
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:46,177
I guess what I did
when I was 11...

615
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:49,169
doesn't stop me from
visiting your country.

616
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,681
- Okay, stop right there.
- Okay, work it.

617
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,422
- Come on, boy. Work it.
- I.D.s, please,
and can you pop the trunk for me.

618
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:05,161
Sure. Busy day
for you guys, huh?

619
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,796
Work it. Come on.

620
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,558
- You boys are cops?
- Farmington Division, L.A.

621
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,328
<i>- You guys have a rough time
on the other side?
- Bachelor party.</i>

622
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,302
- Can barely remember the last few days.
- Pop the trunk for me, please.

623
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:20,671
<i>Sure. Um,
the trunk latch is broke.</i>

624
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,711
<i>Sir, stay in the car, please.</i>

625
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,643
<i>- I will take the keys.
- Sure.</i>

626
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,585
What happened back here?

627
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,721
Oh, uh...

628
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,723
We were in Rosarita.

629
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,362
Madame Marie introduced us
to some of her friends.

630
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,088
<i>Came out this morning,
and it looked like that.</i>

631
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,996
You boys are lucky
you got off with just a few stickers.

632
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,534
<i>Yeah. Hey, you need
some help back there?</i>

633
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,833
You're gonna need to get rid of that wire.
I think I got some pliers in here somewhere.

634
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,409
No, that's all right.

635
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,943
You guys have anything to declare?

636
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,571
Just that it's great
to be back in the States.

637
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,579
Welcome home.

638
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,758
- Get in there.
- Give me the Polaroid.

639
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,806
Quesadilla!

640
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:25,934
Just wanted to give your little brother
something to remember you by.

641
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,343
- It was creepy.
- How?

642
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,055
The way he laughed to himself,
like something happened.

643
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,250
<i>He was sitting alone for an hour.
What could have happened?</i>

644
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,921
- I don't know.
- Maybe he's just creepy.

645
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,894
No, he was reacting
to something.

646
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,056
<i>- Oh, Ms. Kellis.
- Detective Mackey.</i>

647
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,634
I'm really sorry about
hustling out on you earlier.

648
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,566
It did seem very abrupt.

649
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,366
Well, we had a tip
about a Mexican drug lord being in town.

650
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,440
Anyway, we just brought him in.

651
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,237
Got him just as he was about
to head back across the border.

652
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,473
Wanted by the feds on about 15 different
counts. Pretty bad guy.

653
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,347
Uh, but I just wanted to sit with you
and answer a few of your questions.

654
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,580
It can wait until tomorrow.
Congratulations on the arrest.

655
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:17,286
- Aw, it's a team thing.
- So, we'll talk tomorrow.

656
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,291
I look forward to it,
Ms. Kellis.

657
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,090
Me too.
And call me Lanie.

658
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,670
Unbelievable.

659
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,368
- Did anyone talk to him?
- Who?

660
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,515
Armadillo, when
he was in interrogation.

661
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,814
<i>- Nobody was supposed to.
- You check the tapes?</i>

662
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,060
What was that?

663
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,333
What is that?

664
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,638
It's Mayda's barrette.

665
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,147
Oh, God. He knows.

666
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,045
Tio found someone with
an emergency supply.

667
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,752
Enough to get him by till
the next shipment comes in.

668
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,153
- Give me the leftover cash.
- Here you go.

669
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,121
You know, even after writing off the car,
we still come out ahead on this deal.

670
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,721
Asking for 50 grand
for ruining your day was sweet, man.

671
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,818
<i>- Give me your keys.
- What?</i>

672
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,685
I can't trust you with them anymore,
so give 'em to me.

673
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,053
Come on.

674
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,061
Here you go.

675
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,469
- Where's Mayda?
- A friend's house. Why?

676
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,902
Call and check.

677
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,207
- Mayda came to talk to us.
- What?

678
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,112
- She told us about Armadillo.
- No. I told her not to!

679
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,082
We think he knows she spoke to us.

680
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,654
She never what?

681
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,918
- She never showed up. I'll make the call.
- Where is she?

682
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,654
- We'll find her.
- He's gonna kill her!
- We'll find her.

683
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:46,035
Hey. You okay?

684
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,274
Hmm?

685
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,054
- Mayda...
- No!

686
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,092
- I'm here. It's okay.
- Topo, let us get her to a doctor!

687
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,033
Stop!

688
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,035
- Stay away from us!
- Stop!

689
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,171
Topo! Please!

690
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,181
<i>Let us help her!</i>

691
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,249
<i>Topo, let us help her!</i>

692
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,952
My guy in Denver got a hit
on Corrine's driver's license.

693
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,990
She got a warning
for rolling a stop sign last week.

694
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,601
- In Denver?
- Colorado Springs.

695
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,899
He tracked the license plate,
the address she gave.

696
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,406
Long story short...

697
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:52,534
he took this photo
about three hours ago.

698
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,509
<i>That's them, isn't it?</i>

699
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,047
Yeah, that's them.

700
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,118
My guy lost 'em in traffic...

701
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,486
but if they're shopping for groceries there,
they gotta be close by.

702
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,023
<i>We're gonna get 'em, Vic.</i>

703
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,187
<i>- Can I keep this?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

704
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,356
I'll call you in a few.

705
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,739
Hey. I didn't know
you made house calls.

706
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:06,248
This P.I. you've been meeting with,
has he found them?

707
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,580
- Found who?
- Your family.

708
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,418
I assume if they were here, your place
would be in a slightly better condition.

709
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,153
At least now I know
what's been making you so sloppy.

710
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,696
By this time next year,
I'm gonna be on the city council.

711
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,702
In six years,
I'm gonna be mayor.

712
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,035
<i>By then, I'll have
much bigger problems than you.</i>

713
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,041
In the meantime,
how do we solve this problem?

714
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,706
<i>- I don't see a problem.
- I do.</i>

715
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,249
Her name's Lanie Kellis.

716
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,650
And as much as I'd love
to see her take you down...

717
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,515
I don't need a scandal right now.

718
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,021
So you and I need
to come to an understanding.

719
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,185
You and me? Right.

720
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,931
I don't see how
you have much choice.

721
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,332
<i>You don't want her and me
gunning for you, right?</i>

722
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,971
You're smart enough
to know that.

723
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,017
<i>- You're gonna watch my back.
- Until the election.</i>

724
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,683
In exchange for what?

725
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,621
You get your head
back in the game.

726
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,719
Get your boys under control,
and don't do anything to embarrass me.

727
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,296
How do I know I can trust you?

728
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,298
<i>How do I know I can trust you?</i>

729
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,070
I guess we have a deal.

730
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,307
Fine.

731
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,616
This doesn't mean I like you.
Try to screw me on this...

732
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,788
I'll bury you.
