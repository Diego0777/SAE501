1
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:06,081
Detective Terry Crowley.
Remember him?

2
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:08,148
21/2 years ago, he was
on your Strike Team.

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,647
He was undercover, part
of a federal investigation.

4
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:12,914
He was your teammate,
he was a threat,

5
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:15,847
so he had to die.

6
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,580
We killed a cop.

7
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:21,580
Get over it and don't
bring it up again.

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,947
You didn't know, did you?
Vic never told you.

9
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,613
Vic did not
kill Terry.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,081
So prove it.

11
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:30,814
Wear a wire.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Hey.
Hey, man.

13
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,147
We need to talk.

14
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,181
You lied to me.
Don't lie to me.

15
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:37,247
What are you doin'?
Stop.

16
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,981
I need
sound.

17
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,780
They asked me to wear a
wire. Just disconnected it.

18
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:43,847
They're watching us
right now.

19
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:47,281
They busted me with heroin, and they're
talkin' prison if I don't do this.

20
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:50,081
Why is it even a question?
I think you're lying to me.

21
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,747
Look me in the eye and tell
me the truth about Terry.

22
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,981
Don't buy into
their bullshit.

23
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,714
Look me in the eye.
You tell me the truth.

24
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:00,613
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,714
What happened to your mic
last night?

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,414
It got disconnected in the
fight. How much you get?

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,414
Nothin' after you two
started to mix it up.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,081
You wanna fill me in?

29
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:16,580
I asked about him Terry. He still says
it was the drug dealer who shot him.

30
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,814
How'd it get physical
with Vic?

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,981
Guys like him don't come out
and tell you shit.

32
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,480
I had to make it personal
to get the truth.

33
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:28,214
I can't believe I was stupid
enough to let you in my head,

34
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:31,714
make me think Vic had something
to do with Terry dying.

35
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:36,847
Lift up your shirt.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,147
Nah. I'm done with that.

37
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,914
Done? Let's put a pin
in Terry for a minute.

38
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:47,214
I still need to get a sense
of what your team is into.

39
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,147
And I got a 15-year sentence
hanging over your head, so...

40
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:54,014
please, lift up your shirt.

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,780
Let's avoid any technical
malfunctions this time.

42
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:04,114
A'ight? OK.

43
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:09,047
Hold on, buddy.
Hey, what is it?

44
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:11,947
When we're alone, man.

45
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:15,181
Baby, can you take him?

46
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:18,513
Hey, guys.
Come here, cutie.

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,014
Be just a second.
OK.

48
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,381
I love you.
I love you, too.

49
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:25,047
Yeah. What's up?

50
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,181
Lem got picked up
by I.A.D.

51
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,381
For what?

52
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,047
They nabbed him
for heroin.

53
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,047
Heroin? We haven't busted
any heroin in a while.

54
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,747
What's Lem doin' with horse?
He's not using.

55
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:36,947
You tellin' me he's runnin'
somethin' on the side?

56
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,981
He wouldn't do anything
without tellin' us.

57
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,814
Like burn
the money train cash?

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,181
I.A.D.'s got him
wearin' a wire.

59
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,181
So they're comin' after us.

60
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,214
We planted a gun
on Doomsday

61
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,448
and dropped him off
in Mexico yesterday.

62
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,680
Lem wasn't there. He was coverin' us
the whole time. We didn't have a clue.

63
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,281
What do you think
they're lookin' at us for?

64
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:56,981
How long's this
been going on?

65
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,613
I don't know, but now we gotta
stay focused on Lem,

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,247
figure out exactly what they have
on him, how we can get him out of it.

67
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:06,147
How we gonna do that
is he's wired?

68
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,547
Grab your laptop.

69
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,947
Sweep the Clubhouse for bugs
and meet us there in a few.

70
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:14,081
Hey, let's keep
our regular routine.

71
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:17,780
I.A.D. Gets a whiff that Lem
tipped us, it's over for him.

72
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:27,747
Lem asked me about Terry
last night.

73
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:30,081
On tape? He pulled the mic out first.

74
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:32,780
What did you tell him?

75
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:36,014
Nothin',
but he knows.

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,247
So what are we gonna do?

77
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:45,014
Lem needs help right now.
We gotta back him up.

78
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,014
We'll explain
everything to him

79
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,081
once he's
out of trouble.

80
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,814
First, downtown asks us for
our records on Terry. Now Lem.

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,348
You think
he told 'em something?

82
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:53,814
He's got nothing to tell. That's
my I.A.D.'s coming after us!

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,480
You and I were the only
2 people in that room.

84
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:00,947
Nothing that Lem or I.A.D. Can do
can ever change that simple fact.

85
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:04,814
Just gotta
stick together.

86
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,947
First one in. Came to put
the java on when I found 'em.

87
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,947
What time was that?

88
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:13,448
Let the detectives
handle the interviews.

89
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:16,147
We just need to preserve
the crime scene.

90
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,314
What do you think,
heart attack

91
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,647
and then she got crushed
underneath him?

92
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,214
Talk about
coitus interruptus.

93
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,580
Oh, Christ.
She's alive.

94
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,914
Gimme a hand.

95
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,480
Jesus.

96
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:39,947
She looked dead.

97
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:52,214
You got no sense of humor,
asshole. It's not that funny.

98
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:57,580
Tell me this isn't...
hysterical. Don't tell it again.

99
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,780
You got 3 explorers
in the Congo, right?

100
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,981
They get captured by natives,
who tie up the 3 bodies.

101
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,181
They bind and gag 'em.

102
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:09,513
Chief walks up to the
first explorer and he says,

103
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,381
"you have 2 choices... you
can choose death or chi-chi."

104
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:16,580
First explorer doesn't wanna die,
so he says, "I'll take chi-chi."

105
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,680
12 men grab him, rape him,
sodomize him for hours,

106
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:22,314
cut off his dick and balls,
shove 'em into his mouth,

107
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,547
send him into the woods
bleeding from every hole.

108
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:29,914
The chief walks up to the
second explorer, and he says,

109
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,947
"you have 2 choices. You
can choose death or chi-chi."

110
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:36,480
The second explorer debates in
his head. He doesn't wanna die.

111
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:38,981
He says,
"I'll take chi-chi."

112
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,814
18 tribesmen grab him,
rape, sodomize him for hours,

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,914
cut off his dick
and his balls,

114
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:47,513
shove it into his mouth, send him into
the woods bleeding from every hole.

115
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,147
The chief goes up to the last
explorer, right, and he says,

116
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:53,147
"you have 2 choices.

117
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:56,647
You must choose death
or chi-chi."

118
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,747
Third explorer,
big macho guy, mustache,

119
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:04,513
looks at him and says,
"I'll choose death."

120
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,947
The chief turns to his entire
tribe of a hundred natives

121
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,448
and says...

122
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:14,314
"very well, then.
Death by chi-chi."

123
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,348
I told you it was funny.

124
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,814
That's not funny.

125
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,714
Guys,
it's locked.

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,947
Hold on. Sorry about that.
Didn't know it was locked.

127
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,381
You got a dead body.
Possible sex crime.

128
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:32,647
Can you give that to somebody
else whose time isn't as valuable?

129
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:37,680
We got a million balls in the air
right now. Welcome to my world, hon.

130
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,414
Boys, what do you say we clear
this d.b. By lunchtime?

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
All right, man.

132
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,680
You OK?

133
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,981
Yeah.
He just kicked.

134
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:48,081
He? It's a boy?
Congrats.

135
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,414
Thanks. I just found out.

136
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
Congratulations.

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,947
I'll get the car.

138
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:02,014
We're gonna find out everything
we can about this Kavanaugh

139
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,747
sweating Lem.

140
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,747
What about the heroin
they got him on?

141
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,880
Could be chum
to set us in motion.

142
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,747
No, let's get a bead on this guy
before we take his bait.

143
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:11,981
OK.

144
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,613
We found him on top of
an unknown female.

145
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,580
Arms were bound.
We found keys on the table.

146
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,747
Guy's got a truck outside.
Let himself in.

147
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:23,314
Poppers.
Intensifies the orgasm.

148
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:27,348
Guess he popped more than
he bargained for. Run it.

149
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,680
Shop owner
called it in.

150
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:32,880
You know this guy?

151
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,914
Never seen him before.

152
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,814
Really? Then why does he
have keys to your place?

153
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,414
It's a teamster shop.

154
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,448
Shane, call the local 629.

155
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:49,281
Tell 'em Rick here is taking
hard-earned cash out of their pockets

156
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:52,348
and feeding it to
the non-union wetbacks.

157
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:56,680
Rodrigo's a part-time driver.
He never made trouble before.

158
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,381
Union wages are killing
my bottom line.

159
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,981
I see the scabs are working out
real nice for ya.

160
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,847
Where's his rig parked?

161
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:10,448
You know what? Check the cab
for a purse. We need an ID.

162
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,081
Check 'em.

163
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,314
Dude, no drugs,
no candy.

164
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,047
Nothing in the cab.

165
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,580
Hey, guys...

166
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:36,580
yo.

167
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:39,613
Lemme see that crowbar.

168
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:44,281
Help me out.

169
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,314
Watch out,
watch out.

170
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,547
Oh, Jesus.

171
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,513
Watch out, watch out.

172
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,081
Come on, let's go!

173
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:03,281
They gone?

174
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:04,847
Yeah, all three of 'em.

175
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,011
JAILBAIT

176
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:20,653
Guy covered up the vents with
electric tape to keep 'em quiet.

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,720
Shithead suffocated them
all. No ID's on any of 'em.

178
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:26,321
Rodrigo did a nickel in chino
for assault and rape

179
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:27,321
a few years back,

180
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,987
and you saw
the Los Perdidos ink.

181
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,421
Must have expanded from drugs
to skin trafficking.

182
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,054
License address is old, but
his p.o. Gave me a new one.

183
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:40,088
Why don't we file
for a warrant?

184
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,387
Gotta check out his crib,
see what's there.

185
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,153
Lem and I will hit mission cross,
see what we can get from the victim.

186
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,288
How's she doing?

187
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:53,254
She's sedated and severely
dehydrated, but she'll live.

188
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,026
Any signs
of sexual assault?

189
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,133
There's multiple tears.
It's pretty bad.

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,866
Tox report shows
rohypnol in her blood.

191
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,100
She give you a name?

192
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,899
Magdalena. Says that
a federale in Mexico

193
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,499
sold her and her little
brother to Mexican gangbangers.

194
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,733
She's not too big on cops.

195
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,899
I told her you were
2 of the good guys.

196
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,871
Come on.

197
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,740
We found 3 girls in the
truck. We didn't find your brother.

198
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,873
It's OK to talk to them.

199
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:27,840
They drop him off
just before we stopped.

200
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:31,073
I heard a man take him.

201
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,040
About 10 minutes later,
we stopped again.

202
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:38,773
That's when the driver
took me inside...

203
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,006
forced me...

204
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:46,439
then he... just died.
Ha ha ha ha.

205
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,973
Is there anything you could tell
us about the men who sold you

206
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,006
or who you were
supposed to go to?

207
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:54,239
They tell us nothing.

208
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,439
My brother Pablo.

209
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,673
Please find him.

210
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,073
We're gonna do
everything we can.

211
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:37,906
Excuse me, detectives.
I have an attorney here for you.

212
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm Becca Doyle.

213
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,439
You arrested my client,
Evan Dayne,

214
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:44,107
for the cafeteria shooting
during the school riot?

215
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,439
Evan? Calls himself
"Every-Day."

216
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,639
How'd that come to
your attention?

217
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,339
I represented him 2 years ago
when he was guilty.

218
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,506
This time he's innocent, so I
offered my services pro Bono.

219
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,006
What makes you think
this guy is innocent?

220
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:58,339
Is there someplace
we can talk?

221
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:02,339
Several eyewitnesses
I.D. Ed your boy.

222
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,272
I re-interviewed
your witnesses.

223
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,806
Sorry to say,
pretty shoddy work.

224
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,940
Mariano gave us Evan.

225
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:10,873
4 others confirmed it.

226
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,140
They're all Mariano's close
friends. Did you know that?

227
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,740
We're not gonna
reopen this case

228
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:16,740
based on who's
in what clique.

229
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,239
Mariano gave you a Patsy,
and his buddies backed him up.

230
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:23,673
You didn't look into your original
witness very hard, did you?

231
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,973
Evan has a history of
weapons and assault.

232
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,073
And he's cleaned
himself up since.

233
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,940
He's stayed away
from guns and gangs.

234
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,239
I've checked in with him every
few months for the past 2 years.

235
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:35,140
We do our own
investigations.

236
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:38,239
Look, we all
have tough jobs

237
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,740
and we all
make mistakes.

238
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,372
Mine's having a little
bit too much faith

239
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,539
in my clients
sometimes.

240
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:48,773
But this time,
my faith is justified.

241
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,606
We'll look into it.

242
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:56,140
Thank you. I'll wait.

243
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:57,873
Yeah, all right.

244
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,140
No. You got it.

245
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,372
The coroner says rodrigo
died of a heart attack.

246
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,606
Mixed too much
party fuel.

247
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:05,706
Shane and Ronnie
got the warrant.

248
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:07,140
Call 'em back. Tell 'em
we'll meet 'em there.

249
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:09,040
I'll see you at the car in a minute. OK.

250
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,606
Has anyone from the
department come around

251
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:14,639
asking
any questions?

252
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,506
What are you
talking about?

253
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:17,840
There's a rumor
flying around

254
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,573
that someone might be trying
to make political hay

255
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,806
by coming after my team.

256
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,207
Could be I.A.D.

257
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,573
And this
is just a rumor?

258
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,940
We're clean.

259
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,439
But they might come poking
around asking questions.

260
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,706
But the fact is that
you and I were married,

261
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:32,706
so spousal privilege
applies to that entire time.

262
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:35,207
So you don't have to
tell anyone anything.

263
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,906
What do I say
if they ask?

264
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:39,806
Just tell them nothing.
Call me.

265
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,506
What?

266
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,706
Is there something that
I need to hide from them?

267
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:44,873
Of course not.

268
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,973
Listen, thanks for the help
with Magdalena.

269
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,940
Rodrigo's place.

270
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:55,940
Something wrong?
No, I'm fine.

271
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,873
Come on, ladies.
It's playtime.

272
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,539
Police!

273
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,173
Clear!

274
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,873
Clear.

275
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,873
Tear it up.

276
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,339
Yeah.

277
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:15,639
Rodrigo's gonna be pushing the
snooze button in hell from now on.

278
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,040
Nothing.

279
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,906
Nothing.

280
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,873
No, it can't be
that easy.

281
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,506
He's an ex-con
from Mexico.

282
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,606
It damn well could be.

283
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:37,673
Oh.

284
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,840
Jackpot.

285
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:50,073
Pictures of girls,
a few boys.

286
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,372
Hey, it's Magdalena.

287
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:57,673
The other 3 girls
in the truck.

288
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,706
That accounts
for 4 of them.

289
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,306
What about the rest
of these kids?

290
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:01,406
Where are they?

291
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:03,740
Hey, Magdalena's
brother.

292
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:05,473
Names, prices.

293
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,239
A passenger manifest.

294
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,740
It's a goddamn
kiddie catalogue.

295
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:12,272
Hey, what's granny
doing in here?

296
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,940
I don't know. Either
someone's into dry pussy

297
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,740
or she's helping him
traffic these kids.

298
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,306
5th and alvarado.
Let's go.

299
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,272
I just checked
with my witnesses.

300
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,207
Those kids are contradicting
everything they told you.

301
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,006
They still say
Mariano's innocent

302
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,706
<i>and Every-Day
did do the shooting.</i>

303
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,272
Maybe it's time
to reexamine your faith.

304
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,073
Mariano must have scared
his friends

305
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,339
to keep their mouth
shut.

306
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,473
We just want to get
to the bottom of this.

307
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,706
You don't know anybody who would
be willing to give up Mariano?

308
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,806
If he did, I would've
given it to you already.

309
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,539
Look, Mariano's
a bad dude.

310
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,906
Besides, it was a riot.

311
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,506
We were all running.

312
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,806
Maybe I was the only one
that seen him pull a gun.

313
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:51,272
So right now, it's still his
word against 5 others, right?

314
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,940
No one said
this would be easy,

315
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,606
but someone will tell
the truth, eventually.

316
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:57,239
Or maybe it's just
a play on your part.

317
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:59,706
You get us
to reopen the case.

318
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:02,173
That creates the reasonable
doubt you need to go to trial.

319
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,539
He's facing 12 to 25.

320
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:07,840
All I'm asking
is we be sure.

321
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:11,339
Why are you still
playing along with her?

322
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,173
You know witness statements.

323
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,706
They go down quick.
Maybe we got taken.

324
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,140
No, this is about
something else.

325
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,639
No, it isn't.

326
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:20,073
You're pissed that I called you
out about dragging your feet,

327
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,506
and now you're undermining
a case I pushed for.

328
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,673
Excuse me, detectives. I'm really
shorthanded. Is one of you free?

329
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,073
Dutch is.

330
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,873
Dutch? This is parole
officer Marshall Traynor.

331
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,940
He's got a case. I think
it's right up your alley.

332
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:39,639
Loel missed his court date the
other day, violated his parole.

333
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:42,140
Means he goes back
for another 2 years.

334
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,940
My friend ned just did a
stretch for armed robbery.

335
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,906
Some dude was taking
care of his dog,

336
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,673
and ned asked me to
drive him to pick it up,

337
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,473
but the dude wouldn't
give it back.

338
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:53,073
So we go to this guy's
place...

339
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,073
A trailer.

340
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,339
Where?

341
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,940
Somewhere around here.
He doesn't remember.

342
00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:01,140
So I'm sitting in the
truck and all of a sudden

343
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,107
ned comes out
all bloody and shit.

344
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:06,372
Tells me the guy wouldn't
give him back the dog.

345
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,306
They fought and ned did him
in the head with a shotgun.

346
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:12,207
So you just decided to hang
around and violate your parole?

347
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:15,207
Ned had the gun. Made me grab
the dead body, hack the head off,

348
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:18,272
bag it in a field and
then... chopped up the body.

349
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,173
What'd you do with
the body parts?

350
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,306
There's this junkyard...

351
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,339
with like half a dozen
guard dogs.

352
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,606
I was an unwilling
participant, OK?

353
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,040
Did you buy his story?

354
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:37,272
I believe
he's telling the truth.

355
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,140
Because you dealt
with him a lot?

356
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,207
'Cause his brows were raised,
his lips parted and stretched.

357
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:45,006
I've studied up
on reading faces,

358
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,773
and I'm pretty good
at it.

359
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,906
L... I've read up on
micro-expression facial action units.

360
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:53,372
It's fascinating stuff.
The results are disputed.

361
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,140
Proof's in the pudding.

362
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,940
So can you spare some time
and help me find

363
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,140
this headless pile
of dog food?

364
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:05,073
Yeah. Uh, first,
though...

365
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,840
what do you think
of this kid?

366
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:09,439
I don't know, Every-Day.
You sure you're not wasting our time?

367
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,272
Lady, I don't have a lot
of friends at that school.

368
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,873
But I ain't never
shot no one.

369
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,306
My initial hit
is he's being truthful.

370
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,740
There's our granny.
Who's she with?

371
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,740
Abuela!

372
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,207
Hey, hey! You get the
tortoise, we get the hare!

373
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,906
Get out of the way!

374
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,207
Stop! Stop!

375
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,606
Drop the knife.

376
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,639
Drop it!

377
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,040
You got him?
Yeah!

378
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,606
Gimme your hand!
Gimme your other one.

379
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:20,873
I want my lawyer.

380
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,873
In a minute, you're gonna want a doctor!

381
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,973
Take it easy!
Hey, hey, hey!

382
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,140
Hey!

383
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,239
If he wants his lawyer,
he gets his lawyer.

384
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,006
Big, macho guy,
mustache, looks at him and says,

385
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:37,573
"I'll choose death."

386
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:41,239
The chief turns to his entire
tribe of a hundred natives

387
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,306
and says, "very well then.

388
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:47,073
Death... by chl-chi."

389
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:51,539
I always get a kick outta that one.

390
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,706
He's got it wrong,
right?

391
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,506
It's kee-kee.
Not chl-chi.

392
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:59,107
Must be some kind of
white thing or something.

393
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:03,639
I got your message about
Lemansky's wire mishap last night.

394
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:06,873
You think your
operation's compromised?

395
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,339
I sweated him
pretty good.

396
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm hoping
we're still OK.

397
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:13,506
You're still making the same
mistakes everyone else makes.

398
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,973
And what is that?

399
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,473
I used to think that Mackey was
the luckiest son of a bitch alive.

400
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,173
That things just fell
into place for him.

401
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,840
Then I realized...

402
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,740
he was creating
his own luck.

403
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:33,406
So what you see as... a
simple microphone malfunction

404
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:36,673
I see as calculated.

405
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,973
The worst animal
in the joint...

406
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
98% of the time,

407
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,372
he's just like
everybody else.

408
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,606
Anybody.

409
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,873
It's the other 2%

410
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,272
that lands him
where he is...

411
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,606
and I'm going to know
everything... everything

412
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,006
about Vic Mackey.

413
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:01,673
And when he goes into
the 2% zone,

414
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,539
I got him.

415
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,439
You still don't know
who you're dealing with.

416
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,473
Maybe you're still
too convinced

417
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,406
that he's evil
100% of the time.

418
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,439
And that's why you keep grabbing for air

419
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,040
and he keeps...
slippin' away.

420
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,539
You never looked
Mackey in the eye,

421
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,639
had him lie
straight to your face

422
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:27,973
and made you doubt yourself even
though you know he was full of shit.

423
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,239
So until you do...

424
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:34,539
this... is all just
a waste of time.

425
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:39,239
I am so surprised
that you're here.

426
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,140
Yeah, you knew
I couldn't let go.

427
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:46,006
Well, Terry was your guy,
so I understand.

428
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,306
Stop playing me
and start worrying about Mackey.

429
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,806
This could be
our last shot at him.

430
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:56,606
And I'm gonna be right here
to make sure you don't blow it.

431
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:04,106
Here, here, here, here.

432
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:05,707
Now, where are these kids,
lady?

433
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:07,673
<i>¿Señora, donde estan
estos niños?</i>

434
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,473
You're not exactly
his type.

435
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,606
Nixon was in office the last time
you could pull off wearing a skirt.

436
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:17,406
Rodrigo
likes the young bloods.

437
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,573
<i>Rodrigo le gusta
Las jovencitas.</i>

438
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,540
<i>¡Escucheme bien,
pedazo de mierda!</i>

439
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,670
Listen to me,
you piece of shit.

440
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:32,836
I don't know these girls, and
I've never seen them before.

441
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:38,103
And I don't have to talk
to no goddamn cops.

442
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:39,903
This is just more
gringo bullshit...

443
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,636
<i>... una pobre vieja...</i>

444
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:46,070
threatening me because I'm
some poor, old, sick Mexican.

445
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:51,003
I hope your syphilis-
infected dick

446
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,469
hey, come on. Gets ripped
off by rabid dogs...

447
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:57,369
and fed to your whore mother,
and may she rot in hell.

448
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,037
That's enough of that.

449
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:02,137
I want to talk
to an attorney.

450
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:04,836
Did you get that?

451
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:14,603
That is one cold slice.

452
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,302
It's a skill she picked
up doing a dime and a half

453
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,636
in chowchilla for murder
30 years ago.

454
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:21,070
How's this going?

455
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,703
It's not.
She lawyered up.

456
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,670
There goes 8 hours
before we can push her p.d.

457
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,070
About these missing kids.

458
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,670
Call a public defender's
office.

459
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,003
See if they can get
a lawyer here soon.

460
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,403
All right.

461
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,302
You got a minute?
It's Doyle, right?

462
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:37,403
I'm working a case
now...

463
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:39,137
that's funny. So am I.
Got a little old lady

464
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:41,137
right in the middle of
a sex trafficking ring.

465
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,070
Uh... she needs a lawyer.

466
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:45,837
I'm sure the public
defender's office

467
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,269
will send a capable
candidate right over.

468
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:51,869
It can't wait. I still got almost
50 Mexican sex slaves in play.

469
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:54,803
Once word hits the street that
grandma and jethro got busted,

470
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,536
whole operation goes underground,
they cover their tracks.

471
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,837
How'd you like to do a
good deed for the day?

472
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,703
Already have.
And I seem to remember

473
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,936
you have a talent for shading things
on the witness stand, detective.

474
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,503
I think you'll be fine.

475
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,703
You still upset
about the crawford case?

476
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,670
The jury felt that
that guy was guilty.

477
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:14,336
You can't hold that
against me.

478
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:16,336
The case rested solely
on your testimony.

479
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:18,436
Which was completely
on the level.

480
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:20,703
Sorry. I have my hands
full.

481
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,737
So you'd rather hold a
grudge than help make a case

482
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:25,536
that could save lives?

483
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,136
Actually, it's about picking
and choosing my clients.

484
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,869
As appealing
as your offer sounds,

485
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,902
I'd rather not devote
the next month of my life

486
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:36,470
to protecting a sex
slave master grandmother.

487
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:39,036
All I'm asking is an hour.

488
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,670
<i>Usted puede contestar
Las preguntas.</i>

489
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:53,603
They bring me the girls to the
fruit stand, a few at a time.

490
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,536
Her job is to take them
to the drop-off point.

491
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,869
<i>¿A donde?</i>

492
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,936
<i>Diferentes partes.</i>

493
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:03,969
Different places. Places
with a lot of kids around.

494
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,069
A bunch of teenaged kids with
a little old lady like yourself

495
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,636
doesn't raise eyebrows.

496
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:09,770
Who's the contact?

497
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:11,570
<i>¿Quien es el contacto?</i>

498
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:17,737
It always changes. He finds
her after she makes the call.

499
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:20,203
We gotta set up a meet.

500
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,670
That's not part
of the deal.

501
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,703
I have to send one
of my people to the meet,

502
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,636
then we follow the contact and
bust up the whole operation.

503
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,636
If you want her doing field
work, which wasn't in the deal,

504
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,403
then I need probation.

505
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,103
Dream on.

506
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:35,303
If everything hinges on her, I'd
be a fool to give up that hammer.

507
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,570
Just like you were foolish
for letting me know

508
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,503
how important she is
to making your case.

509
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:43,636
Come here.

510
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:47,969
You'd set her free.

511
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:50,703
No. You will.

512
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,770
And maybe next time, you
won't make that mistake.

513
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:56,303
Right now, it's the
only deal to be made.

514
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,269
We're gonna be able to
hear every word you say.

515
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:04,336
You're gonna be in our
sight lines at all time.

516
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,002
Questions?
No, I'm good.

517
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,336
Officer Lowe
has some misgivings

518
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,703
about putting
his trainee under.

519
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,103
She's still
on probation.

520
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,969
Decoy's supposed to
look young.

521
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:14,570
Wide-eyed and new to
the game works for us.

522
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,136
The only thing I don't
want is the bad guys

523
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,936
getting even one whiff
of cop off of her.

524
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:20,436
Could jeopardize
the whole takedown.

525
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:22,636
What about you, honey? You
think you can handle this?

526
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,636
They got me covered.
I don't see a problem.

527
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:26,770
Well,
let's do this.

528
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,403
Julien, you're in charge of uni backup.

529
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,837
I appreciate
the support.

530
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,503
You heard my reasons.

531
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,603
My only concern now is
getting you home safely.

532
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,703
Hey, Vic?

533
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,869
Yeah.

534
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:43,136
That, uh... report
you asked for.

535
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,636
Everything we could find on
Kavanaugh on such short notice.

536
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:53,370
Word is, he gave up his
own partner to I.A.D.

537
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:54,869
Back in the day.

538
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:57,203
Flies solo. Only investigator
that works without a partner.

539
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,036
Means it's 4 and 1.
That's good. Anything else?

540
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:02,203
He grew up in inglewood.
Poor kid done good.

541
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:04,902
Put himself through school with
degrees in psychology, criminology.

542
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,470
Bookworm.

543
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:08,670
No. Golden glove
champion at the academy.

544
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,837
5 in vice, a stint
in robbery homicide.

545
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,103
Family?

546
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:13,403
Divorced. No kids.

547
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,936
We gotta figure out
what this guy has to lose.

548
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,002
Look, everybody's all-American
can't be that clean.

549
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,670
Keep diggin'.

550
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,169
She's droppin'
her off.

551
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,169
What's this guy doing?

552
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:54,370
Teresa?

553
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:55,470
<i>Sí?</i>

554
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:57,069
<i>Vámonos.</i>

555
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,902
Looks like
our trafficker.

556
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,603
They're
getting in the van.

557
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,370
You speak english?

558
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:04,869
Sure.

559
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:07,303
Julien, the suspect's driving
a brown 2-toned shit-box van.

560
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,936
Just keep your team
in position.

561
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,936
The gringos, they
like it when you talk in english.

562
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,036
Whatever you want.

563
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:13,636
Hey, move it, shithead!

564
00:28:13,703 --> 00:28:14,837
Hey!

565
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,436
Hey, move your car!

566
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:18,770
Shithead, get outta the way!

567
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:21,336
Hey, buddy, move!
Move outta the way!

568
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:23,136
Move your car!
Get outta the way, man!

569
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,236
Hold on!

570
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,303
Shit, shit,
shit, shit!

571
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

572
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:29,136
Turning left
on Wilshire.

573
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,570
Come on, man.
We're losing her.

574
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:38,236
When you get to the
house, señorita gets you started.

575
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:41,169
- Gives you clothing, makeup, morning-after pills.
- He's turning again.

576
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,470
Vic, where are you?

577
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,737
Minor detour, Julien.
Just hold your position.

578
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:47,136
When can I see
my brother Pablo?

579
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,969
You turn a lot of tricks,
then you get the privileges.

580
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:50,503
Till then,
just do as we say.

581
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,737
Is he safe?

582
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:53,770
Yeah. As long as you behave,
he'll stay that way.

583
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:56,269
He's turning
into the alley.

584
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,803
What is going on?

585
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,803
He's stopping
in front of the gate.

586
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,370
Get down on your knees!
What?

587
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:09,803
Fiesta time, amigos!

588
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,203
It's fiesta time.

589
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:13,336
It's a gang-bang.

590
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,770
Screw it.
Let's go, man.

591
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:15,969
No, no. Hold on.

592
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,503
You boys
got a condom?

593
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,503
We're gonna do your mouth,
not your clam, bitch.

594
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,636
Come on, open up.

595
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:25,603
L... I got gonorrhea
in my throat.

596
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,737
What?

597
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,403
Look, I'll suck
you boys off,

598
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,570
but don't hit me later
if it burns.

599
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:34,503
Forget about it.
Never mind.

600
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,236
When we get
to the house,

601
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,002
we're gonna run
a train on your ass.

602
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,936
And don't you be telling any
customers that you're sick.

603
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:41,470
Good girl.

604
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:43,703
Yeah. Shorty's
got game.

605
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:48,403
They're movin'.

606
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:57,203
You, uh... you sure
they're chained up tight?

607
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:00,203
As long as you don't
piss me off, we're good.

608
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:02,902
I always thought, uh...

609
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,670
face reading should be one
of the first things they teach

610
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,002
at the academy.

611
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,336
I taught myself.

612
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,936
Be happy to lend you
some books and dvds.

613
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:12,503
If you wanna grab
a bite later,

614
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,403
I'll give you
a quick rundown.

615
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,236
Yeah. Sounds good.

616
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:18,536
You'd be surprised how
transparent people become.

617
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,136
Your partner,
for instance.

618
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:21,503
Claudette.

619
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,603
She's trying to hide
something from you.

620
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,203
It's pretty obvious.

621
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:27,737
Something's
in the closet.

622
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,236
Whole pack was over
here the entire day.

623
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,269
That's when
I found him.

624
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,770
Well...

625
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,203
thanks for the hand.

626
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:48,536
Is this his place
or they run girls from here?

627
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,069
Hold on.

628
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:52,869
We jump too early,
we'll get nothin'.

629
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:59,269
OK...

630
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,837
looks like the madame to me.

631
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,670
All right, that's it.
Everybody move in!

632
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,737
Hope you take
walk-ins!

633
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:25,103
Get up now! Get up!

634
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:27,136
You, right now!

635
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:29,269
Hands behind your head!

636
00:31:29,336 --> 00:31:31,936
On your knees!

637
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:34,969
On your knees!
Get down!

638
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,670
Get on the
ground right now! Down!

639
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:38,803
Down! Turn around!

640
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,303
Hands behind your head!

641
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,969
- Hey, find Tina!
- Vic!

642
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:43,570
Clear!

643
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:44,570
Tina!

644
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,803
Vic!

645
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:49,203
Vic!

646
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,670
Don't you move!

647
00:31:50,737 --> 00:31:51,603
You OK?

648
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,103
Yeah. Didn't have
my baton,

649
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,603
but every guy's
got their weak spot.

650
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,169
How right you are.

651
00:31:59,203 --> 00:32:01,303
Good girl. Nice work.

652
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:07,190
Where's the kid?

653
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:09,023
This idiot's acting
like he doesn't understand.

654
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,456
Got 10 girls off this sheet.
The rest are still missing.

655
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:14,523
You don't know about Pablo?
What about the rest of the girls?

656
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,123
And the boys?

657
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,923
I want my lawyer.

658
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,756
Is that the first thing they teach
you pricks once you cross the border?

659
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:24,156
Put him in the van.

660
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:27,656
Hey, we take this shithead to
the Barn, he's gonna clam up.

661
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:31,323
Word gets out about this bust,
we'll never find the rest of 'em.

662
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:36,056
Well, maybe he's not
as stupid as he looks.

663
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:38,656
Come on.

664
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,323
Let's go,
asshole.

665
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,623
This is a shitty day.

666
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:46,223
We only got about
half those kids.

667
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,257
At least we get to stick
the needle in someone for it.

668
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:52,422
What are you talkin' about?
Gutierrez is gonna get 5 to 7, max.

669
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:54,357
Hey, we got
3 dead girls.

670
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:56,056
This asshole
was nowhere near that.

671
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:58,656
We got conspiracy charges, so
he's up for the murders, too.

672
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,956
That's right.

673
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,056
That... that is good news.

674
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:05,422
Doesn't mean he's gonna get
the death penalty, though.

675
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:07,522
Well, calhoun
is prosecuting.

676
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,190
Man, so I guess
that means he will.

677
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:11,756
Who's calhoun?

678
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,990
Hey, shut up, you prick!

679
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,023
You wanted a lawyer,
now we can't talk to you.

680
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,756
Yeah, but I ain't getting
no death penalty

681
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:18,823
for some girls I didn't
kill, man, I didn't even see.

682
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,257
Save it for your last
words lyin' on the gurney.

683
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:25,123
I wouldn't expect any clemency
with the Terminator as governor.

684
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,290
Carlos odonez.
He's the boss.

685
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:31,323
Whoa, ho, ho!

686
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:34,223
You waiving your right
to an attorney?

687
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,589
Of your own free
will?

688
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,623
Yeah.

689
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:39,357
But you'll help me, right?

690
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,456
Where are the rest
of the girls?

691
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,789
There's a house in colquitt.

692
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,023
Another one on adams.

693
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,190
And the boy Pablo,
where's he at?

694
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,923
Bangkok. They flew him and the
rest of the boys out this afternoon.

695
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,522
Bangkok?

696
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:55,257
Jesus.

697
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,489
Corrine.

698
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:01,856
Hey.

699
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,656
Jon, hi.

700
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,323
Hey, help your sister
in the car, OK? Thanks.

701
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,656
How you holding up?

702
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:11,689
Good. Andy's a handful,
but, you know, it's worth it.

703
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:14,422
Yeah, listen. Here is my
address and phone number.

704
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,556
We still on for
that Friday play date?

705
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,556
Yeah. I mean, if there's
a problem, I'll call you,

706
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,489
but, yeah, I'm looking
forward to this, really.

707
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,357
OK. Where's andy?

708
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:24,389
Sometimes I wonder
if this extra program

709
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:27,090
is just an excuse to
bilk me outta extra money.

710
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,190
From the school, yes.
But teachers, no.

711
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:31,090
You liking the teacher
or...

712
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:34,090
I'm blanking on her name
right now. Um... remind me.

713
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,789
It's the woman
with the, uh...

714
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:39,290
um... I thought Mr. Dunhill
taught the after school program.

715
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:43,489
He does. But I'm talking
about her aide. His aide.

716
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:46,056
Anyway, look,
I'll see you on Friday,

717
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:47,856
if not sooner.

718
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:49,856
Yeah, good. I gotta
get my kids home,

719
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,823
but I'll see you then, OK?

720
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,223
See ya.

721
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:59,656
Just got this case
an hour ago.

722
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,090
Why is my client arrested
for second-degree murder

723
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:04,990
when another boy
was already arrested?

724
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:08,190
I'm sure you've heard Every-Day's
attorney is making my life hell.

725
00:35:08,257 --> 00:35:10,656
She's taken depositions
from half the high school,

726
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:13,257
depositions listing you
as the shooter.

727
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,756
Bullshit.
My friends were there.

728
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,389
They saw Every-Day
pull that gun.

729
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:17,656
What are you writing?

730
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:19,123
Every-Day's release.

731
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,956
The D.A.'s decided to drop
the case, charging your client.

732
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:25,756
Based solely
on witness statements.

733
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:31,090
They also just found
gun reside in his locker.

734
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,689
Ha ha ha ha.

735
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,190
What else do you have?

736
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:38,656
D.A. Doesn't want me revealing
it until we're closer to trial.

737
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:42,156
This does not need
to go to trial.

738
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,723
What do I have to do
to make a deal?

739
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:52,357
Convince your client to drop
the high school clique crap,

740
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:54,522
school him in what it's like

741
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,623
to have this evidence,
a high-priced lawyer,

742
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:59,589
and a very pissed-off cop
working against him.

743
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:03,890
Gun residue
in a locker?

744
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,357
I'd never let you
get away with that.

745
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:09,090
Cops are allowed to twist
the facts to suspects.

746
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:11,123
I directed my comments
to him.

747
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,290
Evan's being released
tonight.

748
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:14,290
I know.

749
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,290
Thanks for your help.
I owe you one.

750
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:19,323
I mean that. You call in a
favor whenever you need it.

751
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,190
I will.

752
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:25,023
I, uh... I heard.

753
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:27,990
Nice work.

754
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:30,522
Thanks.
How's yours going?

755
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,589
Turns out the parolee
was coerced.

756
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:35,389
So he won't go down for the
murder or hacking up the body.

757
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,689
<i>The other guy's going
away for a long time.</i>

758
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,023
And I'm, uh,
sure about him.

759
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,123
Good! Well, where you
running off to?

760
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,990
Dinner with Marshall.

761
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:49,190
I can't have other
colleagues as friends?

762
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:50,956
Marshall has quite
a reputation

763
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:53,956
<i>as a man's man,
if you know what I mean.</i>

764
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,990
He's... he's gay?

765
00:36:56,056 --> 00:37:00,156
While you were reading faces,
he was reading your package.

766
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:02,156
Have fun, though.

767
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:13,456
Cage would look
a whole lot prettier

768
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,257
with Abuela's
ugly mug in it.

769
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:17,323
Sure you don't wanna find
a loophole in our deal?

770
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:20,090
I couldn't let you run
rough-shod over a little old lady,

771
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,890
much as she deserved it.

772
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,522
You lookin'
for more business?

773
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,823
I appreciate the offer,

774
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,456
but I'm OK watching from the
sidelines while they get theirs.

775
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:31,257
Right now, I'd like to go home
and wash this place off me.

776
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:33,456
You talkin' about the cops
or the criminals?

777
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:36,156
See you in court some day,
detective.

778
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,756
Vic.

779
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,956
I got something important.

780
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:47,890
Someone has been
asking questions.

781
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:49,123
Who?

782
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,223
This man. He's
approached me a few times.

783
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,422
Where at?

784
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:53,589
Glenridge. He, uh...

785
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:57,090
he said he was a parent
of an autistic child.

786
00:37:57,156 --> 00:38:00,190
But I've been around cops long
enough to know what they sound like.

787
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,956
Besides, I've never
even seen his kid. So...

788
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:04,623
that him?

789
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,056
Yeah.

790
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:08,856
Why's he coming
to our school?

791
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,056
What'd he ask ya?

792
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,589
I'm trying to remember.

793
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,422
Something about
paying the tuition

794
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,589
and how we do it,
how involved you are.

795
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,422
What'd you tell him?

796
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:21,456
Told him you give us money
for whatever we needed.

797
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:24,990
I was trying to sell you
as a good dad.

798
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,556
I didn't tell him
about the cash in the bag.

799
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:35,257
Good.
Don't tell him shit.

800
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,223
Asshole has no business
talking to you about this.

801
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,056
It's my problem.

802
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:41,323
And I'll take care
of it.

803
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,689
All right?

804
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:20,653
Everything OK?

805
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,253
Yeah.

806
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,286
Yeah?

807
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,420
That was great.

808
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,653
But, uh...

809
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,986
you were somewhere else.

810
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:43,453
Is it about
that meeting this morning?

811
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:48,053
Yeah.

812
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,520
Lem's in some
hot water.

813
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:53,119
Yeah.

814
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:55,986
How hot?

815
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:58,019
I don't know yet.

816
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:03,053
I thought you said that
you were done with all that,

817
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,119
that you were gonna
keep clean.

818
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,986
I have been. I swear.

819
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,852
Then why are you
so worried?

820
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:16,986
Hmm?

821
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,986
Don't you worry.

822
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,752
OK?

823
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,852
We'll figure it out.

824
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,786
Figure it out.

825
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:28,553
"We" meaning...
you and Vic?

826
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,053
Together as a team,
standing by Lem.

827
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,719
Listen. Listen to me.

828
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:34,486
Listen to me.

829
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:38,220
Team's one thing,
but family's another.

830
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:42,587
All that stuff that I had with Antwon...

831
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:43,919
you know?

832
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,086
Yeah.

833
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:47,986
I was looking at prison
in the eye.

834
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,220
I know. I know.

835
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:51,253
Hey...

836
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,386
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to us.

837
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:01,453
Jackson needs his father.

838
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,886
Well, I need
the both of you.

839
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,653
Buddy in immigration called.

840
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,919
He's putting the word out
on Pablo.

841
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:23,786
Spoke to an American
diplomat in bangkok.

842
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:27,486
I meant what I said about
not giving up on him.

843
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,752
OK. Good.

844
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:35,153
I feel like there's some
unfinished business between us.

845
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,687
What's that?

846
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,420
It's this Terry thing.

847
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:46,687
You thought I was
hidin' something from ya.

848
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:50,386
Here's the truth.

849
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:55,220
I swept through
that house.

850
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:58,153
I cleared
that bathroom.

851
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,719
At least
I thought I did.

852
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:04,153
Somehow, two-time
got past me.

853
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,086
I left Terry exposed.

854
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:15,353
I made a mistake.

855
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,819
I never told anybody
I thought it was my fault.

856
00:42:17,886 --> 00:42:21,053
That's something I been livin'
with for a long time now.

857
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,053
Finally, I decided
to move on.

858
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:35,019
Something you're gonna
have to push past, too.

859
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,986
Yeah.

860
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,453
OK.

861
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,486
Hey, Vic.

862
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:03,353
Her majesty Billings
needs to see you.

863
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,053
Tell him
I'll be right there.

864
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,320
Got it.

865
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:18,353
What's up?

866
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,819
Somebody here to see you.

867
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:23,119
Jon Kavanaugh.
Internal affairs.

868
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:24,919
Vic Mackey.

869
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:26,153
Yeah.

870
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,520
You mind if I have a
moment alone, captain?

871
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:30,687
No, not at all.

872
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:32,186
Thank you.

873
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,019
What can I do for you,
detective?

874
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,253
It's lieutenant.

875
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,186
Right.

876
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,587
We're just cops
just like you.

877
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:47,353
I guess the good looks, it
just throws everybody off.

878
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,353
Anyhow...

879
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,520
we're making a tour
of the division.

880
00:43:52,587 --> 00:43:54,752
With the budget cuts,
the bosses,

881
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:57,286
they're afraid that
there might be, uh...

882
00:43:57,353 --> 00:44:00,386
a lot of temptation
to take shortcuts.

883
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:03,719
And I'm just here to
remind everyone that...

884
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,620
I'm still on the case

885
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:08,220
and there is a right way
to do things.

886
00:44:08,286 --> 00:44:10,186
I've been a cop
for 14 years.

887
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:12,620
You guys never toured
before.

888
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,553
New management.

889
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
Putting
a friendlier face

890
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,687
on the old rat squad.
Ha ha ha!

891
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:23,620
Anyhow, there is no reason why you
and I should not be on the same page.

892
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:26,019
Why are you talkin'
to me?

893
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:28,186
You run a special team.

894
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:31,220
Those get most of
the abuse allegations.

895
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:33,486
And from what I hear,

896
00:44:33,553 --> 00:44:35,486
those people out there,

897
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:37,320
they all follow
your lead.

898
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:39,852
Well, can't blame 'em
for having good judgment.

899
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:41,153
Ha ha!

900
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,286
Is there anything brewing
that I should know about?

901
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:47,119
I mean, anything
at all... suspicious?

902
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:49,953
Not that I can think of.

903
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,852
You sure?

904
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:00,786
It is good to meet you.

905
00:45:03,353 --> 00:45:05,153
You, too.

906
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:17,953
