1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,300
- How can I come up with the money?
- It's easy, Rondell. Sell drugs.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,400
- Stop snorting your profit.
- Oh, man, don't be like that.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Hey, you gotta hook me up, Kern.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,000
Man, you got Paula so high trying
to get laid, she couldn't even sing.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,400
I'll make it back up to you, Kern.
I always do.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,900
Listen, don't make me beg, brother.
Just hook me up with the 50 grand.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,500
Since when am I a goddamn ATM?

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Oh, shit!

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
Shit! Rondell, you all right?

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
- Where's this 50 grand?
- Rondell should be here.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,500
We don't ever touch the cash
or the shipments.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
- I'm not waiting around here all day.
- He'll be here.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,200
- Thought you knew how to do this.
- We do.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Then what's with the goddamn
amateur hour?

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,100
Know how many people want
a crate through customs?

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,500
Let's set a new meet for tomorrow.
I'll drag Rondell here myself.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
- We'll get this all squared away.
- Tomorrow?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,800
I won't sit on that package.
It goes to the highest bidder.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,100
If something comes into this
neighbourhood, it goes through me.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300
Guys come up with 50 grand,
you call me.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh, I'm gonna kill Rondell.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,300
See, this is why I didn't show.
Bastards tried to kill me!

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,100
- Wait till I find who shot my ride.
- Good you got armour.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,200
- Who else did you call?
- Just you. I had some product on me.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
What about the 50 grand
to give to Jasper?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,300
- I'm a little short on the 50 G's.
- Short? You don't have the money?

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,600
These guys were breaking
in my business!

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,300
- Who?
- Them bean-selling, bow tie-wearing...

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,200
...skinny-suited, Nation
of Islam terrorists.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,700
- Same guys who shot at me!
- What?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,700
Yeah, they been rousting my
dealers, scaring away traffic.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,900
So yesterday, when
three of them rolled up...

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,200
...start preaching and babbling all
sorts of biblical nonsense...

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,300
...I swung on the main cat!

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,300
- He didn't even see it coming.
- So the Muslims shoot at you?

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
I figure they come for payback.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Why you been hanging around
me all day, then?

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,300
I didn't think they was gonna touch
you. And I don't got no armoured car.

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,200
- What?!
- Stay here till I get back.

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm gonna go talk to them.
Which way to Mecca?

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,200
That's the one.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,100
Police. Are you all right in there?

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Entering the premises.
Step away from the door.

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,900
One Tango 13, requesting an R.A.
And additional units.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,600
We have a possible homicide
and assault.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Roger that, One Tango 13.
R.A. And backup.

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
She's gone.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,500
Clear.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,100
They nailed his feet to the floor.

50
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,500
What do you want me to do?

51
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,800
Pull the nail out of the floor...

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,100
...without pulling it through his foot.
I'll get some towels.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Prop his feet up.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Gun!

55
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,100
Julien!

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,100
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Jesus.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Are you okay?

58
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,268
- Yeah, sister, read it.
- No, no, no.

59
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,468
- Excuse me, brother.
- How about you, brother?

60
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:10,868
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

61
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,468
- How about you, sister?
- Come on, sister.

62
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:18,668
As-salaam alaikum, my brother. May I
interest you in one of our magazines?

63
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,768
You wandered into the wrong
prayer group, frosty.

64
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,468
We're looking for Xavier Salaam.

65
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:27,968
- Xavier Salaam.
- I'm Xavier Salaam.

66
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:32,668
Formerly Xavier Chris. Spent six
years in Chino for manslaughter?

67
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,068
- That's right.
- I'm Detective Vic Mackey.

68
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:39,868
- We'd like a few words with you.
- I'm happy to cooperate.

69
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:45,068
I hear you had a little run-in with
Rondell Robinson the other day.

70
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,568
You wanna tell me about that?

71
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,668
I was trying to distribute my magazines
on the same corner...

72
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:54,268
...that Mr. Robinson's men were
attempting to distribute his drugs.

73
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,168
We fought briefly, it concluded.

74
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,268
- You two kissed and made up?
- There will be no retaliation.

75
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,768
I thought you guys were an eye
for an eye, whacking off hands.

76
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,368
Those are the Jews
and fundamentalist Muslims.

77
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:08,068
Nation of Islam is
an African-American way of life.

78
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:11,768
So you didn't shoot up Kern Little's
car, trying to get to Rondell?

79
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,168
The Nation does not murder.

80
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:17,268
You committed murder.

81
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:22,368
That was a long time ago.
And it was manslaughter.

82
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:27,468
- Why this neighbourhood?
- Because it needs cleansing.

83
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:29,468
What if I said that's my job?

84
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:33,568
I'd say you were doing it poorly.

85
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:37,968
- You can do better?
- Yes.

86
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,168
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

87
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,768
Get some rest, son.

88
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,068
Don't bother with that one.

89
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,568
Thanks.

90
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,068
You want someone
to take you home?

91
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,168
- No. I'm okay.
- Okay.

92
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:07,168
Murder, torture, suicide.
Where to start?

93
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,468
Home invasion. Looks like
they were after the life savings.

94
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,768
Family bank.
Brought their distrust of institutions...

95
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:16,568
...with them from North Korea.

96
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,868
- Forced entry?
- No, that was us.

97
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,168
Neighbours said they heard
a conversation for five, 10 minutes...

98
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:24,268
...then arguing, then loud music.

99
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,568
- They recognise any of the voices?
- No, said they sounded young.

100
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,368
What a mess.

101
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,868
We just spoke to Xavier.
I don't get the feeling he's behind this.

102
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,968
- I'm telling you, they did it.
- If not them, then who?

103
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,668
Who else wants you out of the way?

104
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,068
All kinds of rival dealers are
popping up, taking away my business.

105
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:51,868
I've had shipments stolen. And now
these Muslims messing things up.

106
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,468
What am I paying you for?

107
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,968
Another dealer comes in,
I'm happy to clean up.

108
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,068
But there's no way I'm strong-arming
a law-abiding citizen.

109
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,568
- Find a way to work around it.
- So do something about these dealers.

110
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:05,868
I will. I'd be trying to come
up with the 50 grand...

111
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,168
...and hoping Jasper agrees
to another meeting.

112
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,668
I can't come up with the cash
till I got the drugs.

113
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,268
Well, he's not coming up with
the drugs until he's got the cash...

114
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,768
...which screws both of us.
So think of something!

115
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,668
Let's sweep up some
of these dealers.

116
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,068
Twist their arms till they tell you
who's running them.

117
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,668
Be a pleasure.

118
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,868
Right there, right here.
He's going, he's going.

119
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,468
Come here!

120
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,268
Where you going? Come here.

121
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:45,368
Hold on, right there.
Where you going?

122
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:56,168
Where you going, huh?

123
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,568
- You're Rondell's friend.
- His right-hand man.

124
00:07:58,768 --> 00:07:59,768
I am.

125
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,568
One of your dealers broke him
and took away his Pop-Tarts.

126
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:06,668
Selling Rondell's dope while he's
out chasing a bunch of bow ties.

127
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:10,168
- That's a pretty ballsy move.
- You give me too much credit.

128
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:13,868
I guess we should just apologise,
let you go, then, huh?

129
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,268
- No. We gotta settle this.
- Settle what?

130
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,168
You say you didn't shoot
up Kern's car. We think you did.

131
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:22,968
- That's what we're gonna tell Kern.
- Not a good enemy to have.

132
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,068
Things gotta change.

133
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,968
The Nation is bad for business
and Rondell wasn't hearing it.

134
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,368
So you figured he'd hear about
50 slugs in the side of Kern's car?

135
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,668
I just know it's gonna take a smarter
man than what we got now.

136
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,868
And you're dumb enough
to think that smarter man is you?

137
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,368
Things are about to get crazy
and dangerous out there.

138
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:51,468
Well, lucky for you, you'll be sitting
safe and snug in a cage in here.

139
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:57,468
- You're expecting some kind of reward?
- We solved 23 murders with one bust.

140
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:01,368
What do we get? No bonus, no time off,
no commendation. What is that?

141
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:05,768
You broke one serial killer case.
Get off your high horse.

142
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:16,068
You think they noticed us?

143
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:20,168
Police. We're looking for Rhee-Soo.

144
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,968
- Rhee-Soo?
- Are you Rhee-Soo?

145
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,368
Is there a place where
we could talk?

146
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:30,168
It's about your father,
Young-Ho.

147
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,468
Young-Ho?

148
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:38,768
- Can anyone help us?
- Does anyone here speak English?

149
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:41,468
You'd better come with us.

150
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:46,768
No one here speaks English?

151
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:52,068
- I know it was rough.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:56,268
Don't spend too much time asking why.

153
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,868
Vic says if it was Dragon 10 or Flaming
Fists they would've tagged the walls.

154
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,968
So our killers are merely working
freelance? What a relief.

155
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,568
No telling how much they got.

156
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,268
Our victims had a checking account,
but no savings.

157
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,468
They'd deposit $1000 every two weeks
to write checks against.

158
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,668
Father owned a butcher shop
for years.

159
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,768
Probably squirreled away
a small fortune.

160
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:24,468
We should put out the word
for any kids blowing cash.

161
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,068
- What?
- I should've thought of that. Good idea.

162
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,268
You would have, given time.

163
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:32,168
Dae, you're here.
Could you do us a favour?

164
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,168
- What?
- We need to talk to this woman.

165
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,968
She doesn't speak English.
Can you translate for us?

166
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,168
- I don't speak Korean.
- Really?

167
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:41,868
I was born in Torrance.

168
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:47,068
- Dae speaks less Korean than you do.
- Better call Division for a translator.

169
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:50,168
Already done.
You feeling all right?

170
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:51,468
Yeah. Sure.

171
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,468
Then pick up the pace.
You're doing a 12-minute mile.

172
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,768
- Hello, Maureen.
- David Segovia Aceveda.

173
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,368
I knocked but...

174
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:31,668
A little out of your comfort zone,
aren't you?

175
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:38,068
I struggled with whether to come here
or not. A phone call didn't feel right.

176
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:42,768
- I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.
- She interviewed me two days ago.

177
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:48,168
When you pursue a council seat,
they open up all your closets.

178
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,068
And I'm your biggest skeleton.

179
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:54,968
Actually, it was quite healing,
sharing what happened.

180
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,568
And what did you tell her happened?

181
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:01,568
The ambitious Latino pursued the rich
white girl, got her drunk, tied her up...

182
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,268
...subjected her to sexual acts
against her will.

183
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:07,668
He continued to stalk her obsessively
until one night she was forced...

184
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,668
...to fend him off with a penknife.
Am I leaving anything out?

185
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,968
Just the truth.

186
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,968
I thought maybe your hatred
for me would...

187
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,368
- It's been 15 years, Maureen.
- Fifteen years later, I still hurt.

188
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:21,568
- What do you want from me now?
- An apology.

189
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:23,868
- I'm sorry you felt hurt.
- An admission.

190
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,768
- I did nothing wrong.
- We'll let the public decide.

191
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:30,468
My friends, they know people
at this newspaper.

192
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,468
One phone call, the whole story
will just disappear.

193
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,868
Then why did you come here?

194
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:39,568
I thought we could make some sort
of peace after all this time.

195
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:43,268
Then you wasted a trip.
I have to get back to work.

196
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,768
What happened?

197
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:02,168
We were gathering peacefully,
then shots rang out.

198
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,968
How's your buddy?

199
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,968
He hit his head diving for cover,
but that's the only casualty.

200
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,468
- Lucky.
- Allah's will.

201
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:13,268
- Know who did it?
- Rondell Robinson.

202
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:15,768
- How do you know that?
- Because we saw him.

203
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:19,168
He was fast and we tried to catch him.
We couldn't, but we will.

204
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:22,368
No. I will.
You just file your police report...

205
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,968
...and let us handle grabbing
up Rondell.

206
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:28,868
- I have little faith in your cooperation.
- Sounds like we're working together.

207
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:32,268
We're not.
You stay out of my way.

208
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:36,368
That's easy.
We're headed in opposite directions.

209
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:49,968
My father lost his life savings.

210
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:52,968
He couldn't protect my mother.

211
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,568
He would've been ashamed.

212
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,368
He must've felt he had no choice.

213
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:05,368
We think her father knew his attackers.
They talked for a while before.

214
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,668
Does she have any idea
who would do this?

215
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,168
No idea.

216
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:19,368
We're sorry about your loss.

217
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,468
I'm off in there.

218
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:28,668
Leave your A game
in your cereal bowl?

219
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,468
Through a translator, there's
no back and forth. No rhythm.

220
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:36,068
- I say she's lying about something.
- You learn Korean in the last half-hour?

221
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:39,668
I don't tell liars by listening.
I tell them by watching.

222
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:42,768
Body language? Come on,
it's a completely different culture.

223
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:45,668
People are people, aren't they?

224
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,868
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
Matthew's been wait-listed.

225
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,268
- Wait-listed?
- But you said we were in.

226
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,968
The board had to review
your application.

227
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,268
What's the problem?

228
00:14:56,468 --> 00:15:00,168
The Glenridge families
are a very tightknit community.

229
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:03,568
The admissions board selected
a family they felt...

230
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,468
- The Demicellis interviewed last week...
- Last week?

231
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:08,768
I thought the deadline
was three weeks ago.

232
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,468
- There were special circumstances.
- What special circumstances?

233
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:17,468
Some of our trustees saw an article
in the paper.

234
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,568
- You and some other officers...
- My husband didn't steal those drugs.

235
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:24,668
- The charges were dropped.
- Yeah, if I really did that...

236
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:28,268
...do you think I'd still have my job?
- I'm sorry.

237
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:31,568
There are other programs that
are quite good for autistic children.

238
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:34,768
We don't want another program.

239
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,468
- How long is the wait list?
- Nine months, a year.

240
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:41,268
Matthew's behind already.
He's drowning socially.

241
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:44,168
I really am very sorry.

242
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,768
- Hey, Danny, you got a sec?
- What's up?

243
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:51,568
Linda here decided to have
a crack party in her El Camino.

244
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,168
That's nice.

245
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:56,368
Problem is, she likes to keep her
stash where the sun don't shine.

246
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,668
- You up for a strip search?
- Ask some rookie.

247
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,868
You're the only female uniform here.

248
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,568
Come with me.

249
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:15,968
- Okay, lean over.
- I got my period.

250
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:19,468
- Keep your mouth shut, please.
- Yo, my lips are sealed.

251
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:22,168
Not for long.
Put your palms on the floor.

252
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,968
Come on.
You don't have to touch my string.

253
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,568
Hey.

254
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,368
Who's in charge here?

255
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:40,368
- I'm the captain. Can I help you?
- We have a citizen's arrest.

256
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:43,868
They were selling crack cocaine
on the street corner.

257
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:48,168
Go ahead and book them.
I'll need your statement.

258
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:52,868
This is my statement:
We will not rest until the dealers...

259
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:57,668
...and the police who provide
them comfort are brought to justice.

260
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:12,268
Farmington has a veneer
of tranquillity...

261
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:14,768
...but the dermis is infected.

262
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,568
Could you be more specific
about the dermis?

263
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,768
Those drug dealers that we
apprehended, they might as well...

264
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:24,468
...have been wearing a sign that read,
I have no fear of being arrested.

265
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,468
- Really?
- I couldn't believe it. It...

266
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,768
It was clear that they
were just soldiers.

267
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,568
The captains and the general
are still at large.

268
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,768
Any idea who they might be?

269
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,568
Hey, Vic.

270
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:41,268
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Look, this is the only place safe, man.

271
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:43,968
I tried to kill them bastards,
man, but I missed.

272
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,068
I can't let them find me, Vic.

273
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,968
Vic.

274
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,668
You're a dealer!
You can't be coming where I work!

275
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,968
- They looking for me out there!
- They're looking for you in here!

276
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,768
You're supposed to help me, Vic.

277
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,968
You been telling the Muslims
I'm backing you?

278
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:04,268
What kind of good is police protection
if no one knows about it, huh?

279
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,468
- Go home. Stay there.
- I can't go home!

280
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,068
They could be waiting for me, man.

281
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:13,468
Well, go somewhere
because you ain't staying here.

282
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,968
If I go down, I ain't going
down alone, Vic!

283
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,268
- What?
- That's right. You heard me.

284
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:23,468
You better do something about it.
You better do something.

285
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,968
I've had my suspicions
about Rondell.

286
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:36,068
Questioned how he so easily
operated within our district.

287
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:38,468
What cops do you believe
he's in league with?

288
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,268
I'd rather not say at this time.

289
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,968
- Come on.
- Not until there's 100 percent certainty.

290
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,968
The wait won't be long.

291
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:48,568
Where will you be if I need
to speak with you?

292
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,868
In your lobby. Until we're
satisfied that this matter...

293
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:55,868
...has been settled, the Nation
is not leaving this building.

294
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:26,468
Tomas, I spoke to your legal aid guy.

295
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:31,268
Stealing CDs, look,
what were you thinking?

296
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:35,468
With your prior record,
he said you could get prison time.

297
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:42,168
Hey. Say something.

298
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:50,168
- You abandoned me.
- What?

299
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:55,168
- You never called.
- That cop told me not to call.

300
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,368
He tell you the same thing?

301
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,468
I wanted you to call.

302
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,368
I needed you to call.

303
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:09,168
- I'm sorry.
- It's too late now.

304
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,068
I'm going away.

305
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:16,168
I'm scared.

306
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,868
I screwed up, I know, but...

307
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:29,068
...where were you for me?

308
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,968
What do we know about the family
that got Matthew bumped?

309
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:42,068
Banker and his second wife, living
large. The got a house in Brentwood...

310
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:43,568
...a ranch in Telluride.

311
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,768
So Matthew's stuck because this
rich prick can buy his way in?

312
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:48,668
It sucks. I'm sorry.

313
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:51,468
- What about the dirt on him?
- There's nothing. Nothing.

314
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,768
There is nothing.

315
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,868
- What about Ms. Emerich?
- She's clean.

316
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57,668
- There's gotta be something.
- She's an administrator.

317
00:20:57,768 --> 00:21:00,768
- She's pristine.
- Domestic abuse, an alcoholic brother.

318
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,268
Give me something I can use.

319
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,368
The only record of her
is a police report...

320
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:07,068
...that she filed
when her house was broken into.

321
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,368
Well, let me see it.

322
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,868
Excuse us, detectives.

323
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,768
What? I got a million things
going on here.

324
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,868
A million and one.

325
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,468
Xavier Salaam has an interesting take
on how dealers keep managing...

326
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:33,568
...to slip through the cracks.
He's got his men out doing your job.

327
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,968
Salaam also thinks someone
took a shot at him.

328
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:40,468
- Rondell Robinson, to be exact.
- Still to be proven.

329
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:43,168
By five or six eyewitnesses.

330
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,468
Couple of uniforms went by Rondell's
house. He wasn't there.

331
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:49,968
He shouldn't be too hard
to find, though.

332
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:53,268
It'll be real interesting to hear
what Rondell has to say.

333
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,668
You doing okay?
You don't look so hot.

334
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:01,468
- I'm fine.
- Good.

335
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,968
I'll leave you to your work, then.

336
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:15,568
Maybe it's all in the family.
Rhee-Soo has a son with a rap sheet.

337
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,468
Think the kid went
from loitering and shoplifting...

338
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:22,568
...to strangling Grams and nailing
Grandpa's feet to the floor?

339
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:25,668
They probably had 10s of thousands
of dollars in that mattress.

340
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,868
Who else but a family
would know about it?

341
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:32,368
No way. Robbing the grandparents,
maybe, but nailing the feet?

342
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,368
You rarely see that kind
of sadism amongst family members.

343
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:38,368
Let's see your list of suspects.

344
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:42,068
Three Korean male teens just spent
a ton of cash on jewellery.

345
00:22:42,268 --> 00:22:44,968
I wrote the address in English for you.

346
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:47,768
Thanks.

347
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,868
Hope you found your game
because I'm on mine.

348
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:58,668
Three boys. Very flashy.
Spent over 7000.

349
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:01,568
- On what?
- Chains. Men's and the woman's.

350
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:05,768
- Thank you.
- Have you seen any of these boys?

351
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:13,168
Him. He bought the biggest bracelet.

352
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,268
He paid for all the stuff in cash.

353
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:18,168
Probably Christmas gifts
for the rest of the family.

354
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,868
Do you have the cash they spent?
We need it.

355
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:25,468
- You give me different $7000?
- No. We'll give you a voucher.

356
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:29,968
- When do I get the money back?
- It's evidence in a murder.

357
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,968
If we retrieve the merchandise,
we'll see it's returned to you.

358
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,368
So I never get my jewellery
back either, right?

359
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:39,468
- Why did I even call the police?
- You're a good citizen.

360
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,568
Not anymore. Too expensive.

361
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:49,068
All right, ladies, backs
against the cage. No talking.

362
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:53,668
You finger yourself after
you finger me? You bitch.

363
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,168
Hey, watch your mouth.
Show her some respect.

364
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,368
Hey, relax.

365
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:02,368
Come on, ladies, your ride's here.
Move it along, single file.

366
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,468
I don't need you in someone's face
every time they look at me.

367
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,068
I'm just sticking up for you.

368
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,968
Yeah, like you did with that
drag queen who bit me?

369
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:11,268
What?

370
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:14,568
Mackelroy just told me about
the blanket party you guys threw.

371
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:17,168
What the hell were you thinking?

372
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,668
Julien, that guy is seriously hurt.

373
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:23,268
Why would you do that?
Is that who you are now?

374
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:25,968
- After what he did to you?
- Exactly. To me.

375
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:28,668
- You should've stayed out of it.
- He tried to kill you.

376
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,468
He's the criminal, remember, Julien?

377
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,468
After all the problems we had,
I thought the one thing...

378
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:37,868
...that I could count on was
the fact that you had a good heart.

379
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:43,568
Okay, boys, your turn. Let's go.

380
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,468
Machado and his hatchet men
had my story killed.

381
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:54,068
I'm sure there'll be more.

382
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,668
Like the Nation of Islam standing
in your lobby.

383
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:01,368
That'll be the second one I sell.
I left La Unidad.

384
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:05,068
I'm freelancing now.
My first sale was to the Times.

385
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:07,568
It's a piece about an ambitious
police captain...

386
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:12,568
...who uses aggressive tactics
to hurt people and squelch the truth.

387
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,368
Just like you did 15 years ago.

388
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:17,668
I thought you'd like
to see a first draft.

389
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:20,168
Feel free to call with any questions.

390
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:22,668
If he ain't here,
I don't know where he's hiding.

391
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,068
We used to come up here all the time
when we were shorties.

392
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,568
Yo, Rondell!

393
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:33,068
Rondell! Put the gun down,
you shithead!

394
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:36,268
- Vic!
- Yeah, and Kern!

395
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,868
- You two okay, man?
- You shot at me!

396
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:41,168
- Mackey, let me talk to him.
- Well, I'm done!

397
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:43,268
Vic, I didn't know it was...

398
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,868
- You shoot at me, you die!
- Vic, man, no!

399
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:51,468
- No! No! No!
- Chill, man. What you doing!

400
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:53,568
- No!
- Chill, Mackey. Mackey...

401
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,368
- You wanna join him?
- Vic!

402
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:57,768
Look at all the people
down there. That's my boy.

403
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:00,868
- We got history. Chill.
- He could've killed you and me.

404
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:03,368
- He's a problem.
- No, no!

405
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:04,668
- No! Chill, man!
- No!

406
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:07,068
No, Mackey, no! No.
Chill. Chill, man.

407
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,168
He won't be a problem.
I'll take him someplace...

408
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:12,568
...where these cats won't get him.
Just chill. I'm all over it!

409
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:14,968
Just chill, all right? Just chill.

410
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,868
Come on, man.

411
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,668
If he's a problem again,
you got a problem.

412
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,468
Next time you better grow wings.

413
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,168
- What are you doing?
- Getting us privacy.

414
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,368
- What for?
- Explain to me why it wasn't...

415
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:52,268
...the stupidest move of your life to try
to take out Kern Little with Rondell.

416
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:55,268
Rondell was telling everybody
that you and Kern had his back.

417
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:58,768
That y'all were dealing out retribution
if any harm came Rondell's way.

418
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:01,468
Let me get this straight.
After Rondell and Kern...

419
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:04,468
...you were gonna come after me?
- No way, man. You?

420
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:07,268
- I knew I could reason with.
- Start reasoning, then.

421
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,268
What do you wanna know?

422
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:12,068
Why are you a better dealer for me?

423
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:15,268
I don't use my own product.
Rondell does, more and more.

424
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,868
He's getting sloppy. This Nation of
Islam thing came on when he was high.

425
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:23,168
- How would you have handled it?
- Let them have the corner.

426
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,668
Move three blocks over.

427
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:27,768
Dopers follow the dope.

428
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:30,668
Pissing off the bean pie crowd
gives them a reason to live.

429
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:35,468
Throw a little bit of that peaceful
resistance right back at them, huh?

430
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,468
Now, if I'm done filling
out the job application...

431
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:42,568
...let's talk about how
much rent's gonna be.

432
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:50,268
Actually, 50 grand lets
you move in right away.

433
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:54,168
Good thing I've been saving.

434
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,268
It's a good thing.

435
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:13,568
David...

436
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:17,168
...what's wrong?
- Hang on.

437
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:21,868
Shit.

438
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:32,768
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to focus.

439
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:37,768
- Varela interviewed Maureen Wilmore.
- Oh, God.

440
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,768
She still blames me
for what happened...

441
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,868
...and now the article
could run in the Times.

442
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,868
Great.

443
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:48,668
- I went to talk to Maureen.
- What? When?

444
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,168
- Today.
- Why?

445
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:54,068
I thought maybe
if I could convince her...

446
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,968
But she's sticking to her story.

447
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,068
- What did you expect?
- I was hoping I could reason with her.

448
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:01,668
Reason with her?
You said she was a crazy girl.

449
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:07,268
- That was 15 years ago.
- David, 15 years is nothing to a woman.

450
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:17,068
My guy at the Times says the editor
likes it, but can't confirm it'll run.

451
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,868
What happens if it does?

452
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:23,268
Change your name to Kennedy, move
to Massachusetts and you'll be fine.

453
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:26,868
- It's critical, but it's not fatal...
- Isn't this libel?

454
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:29,768
Technically, yes. The law
presumes a statement is false...

455
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,868
...unless she can prove the contrary.

456
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,968
You show damages, you have a case.

457
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:36,368
But the damage to you
will already be done.

458
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,468
- What are my options?
- You get this woman to recant.

459
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,968
- I already tried.
- Try again.

460
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:46,668
She wants me to admit I hurt her.
Apologise for a rape I didn't commit.

461
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,968
- I won't do it.
- If she's willing to make it go away...

462
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:51,768
...you give her what she wants.

463
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,068
Won't Varela still print the story?

464
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:57,768
Not if this woman denies it.
It's survival, David.

465
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:59,968
You wanted in the game.

466
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:02,768
Now is when it starts to get fun.

467
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:07,968
- Ms. Emerich.
- Mr. Mackey.

468
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:12,768
- Look, I understand your frustration.
- Actually, I'm here on police business.

469
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:13,968
What's that?

470
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:17,668
I understand you had a ring stolen
from your house about a month ago.

471
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:20,068
The report said it was an heirloom.

472
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:23,968
Yes, it was my mother's. I was hoping
to give it to my daughter someday.

473
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:27,068
- Can I be brutally honest with you?
- Okay.

474
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:29,768
Hollywood Division's never
gonna get your ring back.

475
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:32,068
- I figured.
- Let me explain.

476
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:35,068
The police have the resources
to solve almost any crime.

477
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,868
Just a matter
of making it a priority.

478
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,368
To them, a stolen ring
doesn't rate very high.

479
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:42,568
I guess not.

480
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:46,068
I can see it's very important to you.

481
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:49,968
Maybe there's something I can do.

482
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:57,368
Looks like they're not budging.

483
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:59,868
Guess not. Did you find the ring?

484
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,868
I gave your guy
a detailed description.

485
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,168
It hasn't passed through his pawnshop,
but he's checking around.

486
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:09,768
Guy's kind of whacked. He bet me
50 bucks he could find it in 12 hours.

487
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,768
- Did you take the bet?
- Oh, damn right.

488
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,868
Bad move. You don't know Felipe.

489
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:21,168
We know your son, Nam Yung,
has been in trouble before.

490
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,368
She only wants to talk to him.

491
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:32,168
- What? Why?
- Because she doesn't wanna talk to me.

492
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,368
Why?

493
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:40,168
- Oh, no. You tell her we don't do that.
- Dutch, whatever. As long as she talks.

494
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:43,168
Fine.

495
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,168
Ask if there's any ill will between
her son and her parents.

496
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:48,468
- She won't answer.
- Would you let her decide?

497
00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:50,668
I'm sorry. I know she won't.

498
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:53,668
If she thinks we're prying into
her family, she'll shut down.

499
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:58,068
- So I can't even do my job now?
- Dutch, just work with it.

500
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:05,268
We're looking for Nam Yung
and his friends Kenny and Paul.

501
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,268
They were arrested together
in the past.

502
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,168
Do you have any idea
where they are now?

503
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:20,968
He stayed at Kenny's house
last night.

504
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:25,668
We talked to Kenny's mother.
She thought they were at your house.

505
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:32,368
I guess teenage lies
are pretty universal.

506
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,668
I never told that one before.

507
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,668
Detectives, there's been
another home invasion.

508
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:42,768
Our home-wreckers left
their hammers behind.

509
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:44,268
This family gave it up.

510
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:47,668
No one's talking, but whatever
they took, they took it all.

511
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:50,468
- Who called 911?
- I did.

512
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:56,368
They don't like to talk about these kind
of things in front of other people.

513
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:04,868
- What happened?
- They got all our money.

514
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:08,068
They took my Xbox.
They took the games too.

515
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:09,968
Well, did you recognise any of them?

516
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:13,568
Sure, it was my cousin
and his two buddies.

517
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:19,468
Look, I just want my Xbox back.

518
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,868
Graduation party. Kid's got a gun.
One Tango 13...

519
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,768
...requesting assistance,
8266 Alameda.

520
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:40,668
You go through the house,
I'll take the side.

521
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:47,868
Come on, stay out front. Move.

522
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,968
Go. Move.

523
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,068
Julien, wait!

524
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:21,068
One Tango 13, shots fired!
Move it!

525
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:47,868
Get back.

526
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:50,568
I'll shoot, man.
I swear, I'll shoot.

527
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,868
Are you deaf?

528
00:34:57,468 --> 00:35:01,368
I said, I'll shoot you.
Get away from me.

529
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:03,968
- Go ahead.
- You wanna die?

530
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:08,168
- Shoot me.
- I said, I'll shoot you!

531
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:10,468
Shoot!

532
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,768
Julien!

533
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,668
Give me the gun.

534
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:22,068
- Get on the ground.
- Julien.

535
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:23,868
I got him.

536
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,068
I got him.

537
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,268
Hey, you guys all right?

538
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:52,768
- Nice work, Julien.
- I'm just glad everyone's safe.

539
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:54,268
Well, it could've been bad.

540
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:58,668
Who knows, come commendation time,
maybe we'll hear your name.

541
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,968
Way to go.

542
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:08,568
- Yeah, you're a real hero.
- What's that supposed to mean?

543
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:13,768
- You're not wearing a vest, are you?
- I forgot to wear it today.

544
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,568
You holstered your weapon
at the scene.

545
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:18,868
- After the suspect was on the ground.
- I talked to the suspect.

546
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:22,668
- I made the arrest, all right?
- Did you wanna get shot?

547
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,668
Julien, did you wanna die?

548
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:34,068
Why? You can tell me.

549
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:38,168
I do things that can't be forgiven
and I can't stop myself.

550
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:39,968
I know.

551
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:43,968
- You have no idea.
- You're gay, okay?

552
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:48,168
I'm your partner.
I know it's not worth dying for.

553
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:54,368
- Fighting this is killing me.
- Then stop fighting.

554
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:58,868
- I would rather die than be that.
- You don't mean that.

555
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:02,468
I can't go on like this. I can't.

556
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:08,768
What's up, money?

557
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:11,768
I got the name of your shooter.

558
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:13,968
- Who?
- Tio.

559
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,868
- That's Rondell's dog.
- Used to be.

560
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:20,468
I'll make sure no blood
don't spill your way.

561
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,268
There's more.

562
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:25,968
- Rondell's out. This kid, Tio, he's in.
- What?

563
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,968
Rondell's been blabbing
you and me are protecting him.

564
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:30,868
That's just Rondell talking.

565
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:34,468
Well, that talk got your car shot up
and the Nation of Islam camped out...

566
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,768
...in my back yard trying
to make me the devil.

567
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:41,168
Rondell's using.
He could've killed us both yesterday.

568
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:45,468
He nearly messed up a relationship
that's gonna be very valuable to me.

569
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:52,368
He got one of my acts high.
Ruined the whole session.

570
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:57,568
Tio's prepared to make restitution.
I'm making the change.

571
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:00,868
Whether you wanna fight it
or not is up to you.

572
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:07,068
Me and Rondell, we grew up together,
man. We got a lot of history, son.

573
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,468
People change.

574
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,668
I don't really recognise him no more.

575
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:18,168
So, what do we do now?

576
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:22,368
Tell him it's safe to go home.

577
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,568
Then we let the street take care of it.

578
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,268
Freeze! Facedown!

579
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:48,168
Get your hands behind your back!
Get down!

580
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,768
- We're clear!
- Clear!

581
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:54,168
When I was a kid,
we just tipped cows.

582
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:59,568
The three of you decided
to rob your own relatives?

583
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:03,368
We just wanted what
the other kids had.

584
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:08,868
- You killed your grandmother.
- No, Kenny did that.

585
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:11,268
You didn't stop them.

586
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:15,668
They should've just told us
where the money was.

587
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:20,368
You nailed your grandfather's
feet to the floor.

588
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:23,268
Kenny did that too.

589
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:25,568
Why?

590
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:29,068
Grandfather kept following us around.

591
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,968
He wouldn't sit still.

592
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:49,168
- Oh, my God.
- It's beautiful.

593
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:52,968
- I can't believe you got it back.
- Just have to know where to look.

594
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:55,868
I don't know how to thank you.

595
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:58,668
You know how to thank me.

596
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:03,668
- I don't know. It's a little late.
- Special circumstances.

597
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:08,168
Look, my family will be
a great asset to this school.

598
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,268
You win.

599
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:19,868
- You've arrested Rondell Robinson?
- Not yet.

600
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,268
But he's not gonna be a problem
for you anymore.

601
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:25,668
- He was your problem, not ours.
- Well, we're both on the same side.

602
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:27,968
I doubt that.

603
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,568
There's nothing I can say
to you, is there?

604
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:33,868
Admit you're evil.

605
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,368
I'm out of here.

606
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,968
Sure you don't wanna wait
this out at a Best Western?

607
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:44,668
- Hell of a lot more restful.
- You get your rest, detective.

608
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:48,668
The peddlers of illegal drugs can hide,
but we know where to find you.

609
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:52,768
As long as you keep it legal,
you'll get no trouble from me.

610
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:54,968
You have a good night.

611
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:01,568
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What do you want, David?

612
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,768
I know you're still upset.
I understand that.

613
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:07,368
But I need you to tell the truth
about what happened that night.

614
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,568
You need me?

615
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:16,768
- Don't.
- Remember?

616
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,868
I'm married now.

617
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:37,268
- Stop it.
- You wanna save your political career?

618
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:40,868
Then I want you to say it,
say it just once.

619
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:44,668
Admit what you did to me
so I know I wasn't crazy.

620
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:00,568
Asshole.

621
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,768
You're recording this?
You're unbelievable.

622
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,368
Varela said it was the only way
to print the story.

623
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:07,268
Why are you doing this?

624
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,668
I was just a kid.

625
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:12,468
I wanted to explore sexually.
So what?

626
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:15,068
- That's right. You wanted to explore.
- You loved it.

627
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:18,368
Then you go tell your friends
about the crazy white bitch...

628
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:20,268
...who likes to be tied up
and choked.

629
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:23,768
- What?
- Two of them came to my room.

630
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:28,268
They held me down and raped me.

631
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:31,868
They said they heard
that I liked that.

632
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:33,868
Oh, my God.

633
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:37,668
- Who?
- Mark and Peter.

634
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:40,868
Don't tell me you don't remember.

635
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:44,368
I don't. Mark and Peter,
I barely knew them.

636
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:48,268
You knew them well enough
to tell them how to hurt me.

637
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:51,968
- Oh, Maureen.
- You sent them there to rape me.

638
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:56,768
- No, I didn't. I am so sorry...
- Don't touch me. You are responsible.

639
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:58,968
- Maureen, I am so sorry.
- Stay away from me.

640
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,968
You tell that slut you married
I feel sorry for her.

641
00:43:02,168 --> 00:43:04,068
Maureen.

642
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:12,768
Hey.

643
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:17,868
- Something you wanna tell me?
- I love you?

644
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:20,468
Well, I love you too.
Now, how'd you do it?

645
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:21,868
Do what?

646
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:24,768
Matthew was accepted
into Glenridge.

647
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,068
- Really? That's great.
- Oh, please. Stop with the act.

648
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:31,768
Yesterday you were a criminal,
today she calls to set an orientation.

649
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:34,768
- Fess up.
- It could happen.

650
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:38,268
- What did you do?
- Nothing any dad wouldn't do.

651
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:40,868
Come here.

652
00:43:42,768 --> 00:43:46,968
Well, thank you.
Matthew really needs this.

653
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,768
What about the other family?

654
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:54,268
They missed the deadline.
They broke the rules.

655
00:43:56,668 --> 00:44:00,068
Don't worry. They'll be fine.
They're loaded.

656
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:03,168
