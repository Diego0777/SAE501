<i>[Rebecca] If everything hinges on her,</i>
<i>I'd be a fool to give up that hammer.</i>

for letting me know...

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,441
how important she is
to making your case.

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:18,278
- You lookin' for more business?
- Right now I'd like to go home
and wash this place off.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,843
Has anyone from the department
come around askin' any questions?

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,049
<i>Someone has been asking questions.</i>
<i>He said he was the parent of an autistic child.</i>

9

<i>- Yeah.</i>

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,661

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,226

<i>It was the right one.</i>

<i>First time a police officer</i>
<i>stepped foot in here.</i>

45
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,823
- I've got a case that'll interest you.
<i>- My schedule's full.</i>

46
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,365
- I've been finding my own cases since I was 30.
- Not like this one.

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,168
Five minutes.

48
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,840
Everything I'm about to say
falls under attorney-client privilege.

49
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,241
Yeah, but it doesn't
obligate me to take your case.

50
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,805
I.A.D.'s launched an investigation
into one of the guys on my Strike Team.

51
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,010
I don't represent cops...

52
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,019

53
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,180

<i>This is about the system</i>
<i>turning its back on four of its own.</i>

- You shuffle gangbangers...

56
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,161
in and out of jail all day.

57
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,099
This is a chance for you
to take a shot at the big boys.

58
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,372
<i>What do they have on him?</i>

59
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,601
They claim they found a brick
of tar in his glove compartment.

60
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,735
- It's bullshit.
- What else?

61
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,370
The only thing I know
is they're goin' after my whole team.

62
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,244
Guy named Kavanaugh is in charge.

63
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,979
I'd dig into it myself, but it would
raise too many red flags.

64
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,714
Now there's the first
real truth I've heard.

65
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,655
You wanna keep your knowledge
of the investigation secret...

66
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,817
and no one would suspect
I'm working for you.

67
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,088
So we agree that you work
for me then.

68
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,462
I've got an old boyfriend
in the City Attorney's office.

69
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,935
I'll ask a couple questions.
But that's it.

70
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,211
<i>[Woman Sobblng]</i>
<i>I just came In, and he was laylng there.</i>

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,685
- Just lookin' out for ya.
- Look out for the tape.

74
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,915
Tape?

75
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,087
- Angle looks car-to-car.
- Bumper's got a dent Could be fresh.

76
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,429
So maybe there's an incident out on the road,
someone in the other car shoots...

77
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,934

Somebody cut that baby out
of the woman's stomach.

86
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,063
Then get me a witness, a description
of the other car, something.

87
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,364
If they wanted the child, why risk
pumping the mother with bullets?

88
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,700
Someone wanted it to look random.
Maybe the boyfriend.

89
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,206
- [Billings] What do we know about him?
- Works nights in a machine shop.

90
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,869
Hasn't been home since the murder.
I've got unis stationed at the house.

- I'll get rid of'em.
<i>- Wait, wait. No, no, no.</i>

00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,580
Uh, you keep working.
I'll do it.

<i>Wilshire's not giving us any</i>
<i>bodies for the search team.</i>

- That's bullshit. Call again.

98
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,897
No, I'll call.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,991
Who would do something like this?

100
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,966
- What'd the ex have to say?
- Absolutely nothing.

101
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,201

I went to school with.

102
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,073
- Quiet on all fronts.
- Good.

103
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,943
Not good.
None of them offered to look into it for me.

104
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,211
Which means they know
something major's in motion.

105
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,412
What haven't you told me?

106
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,922
- David Aceveda's name come up with your friends?
- The city councilman?

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,926
He's assisting Kavanaugh
with his investigation.

108
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,427
Why?

109
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,761
Because he used to be
captain here. Had me, uh...

110
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,994

a couple times when it meant...

<i>gettin'a killer off the street,</i>
<i>making him look good to the voters.</i>

112

he can steer it away from himself-

113
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,878
make me and my guys
play the heavies.

114
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,106

115
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,150

116
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,118
- What does he say about it?
- Haven't been able to ask him.

117
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,815
I.A.D.'s got him all wired up,
listening to our every word.

118
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,882
Well, they wouldn't make that move unless
they had a witness or corroborating evidence.

The knife goes in, goes straight down-

00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,514
I'd say it's intuitive.
You wouldn't need medical training at all.

- You've got to convince them to come to us.

Smells like you already did.

143
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,405
All right, we got five minutes to hear
what's going on with Kavanaugh.

00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,810
<i>- Every detail.</i>
<i>- He suspects I'm protecting you.</i>

145
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,314
All right?
I've been helpful, but not too helpful.

146
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,908
- Nothing he can check out.
- Any chance he's got a witness?

147
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,046
- Someone who saw you take that tar?
- Shit. Pitarrio.

<i>- No, no.</i>

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,157
If they got Pitarrio, man,
I'm screwed.

and you'll seal us off
from this, right?

160
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,625
- Look, the shit you've done,
and I'm the one going to jail?
- Nobody's going away.

161
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,289
<i>- Hasn't been a jam yet</i>
<i>we haven't slipped out of.</i>
- There hasn't been a witness...

162
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,389
or an I.A.D. Cop wiring one of us.

163
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,025
Nobody jumped ship when Antwon
had your balls in a sling.

164
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,401
And I was willing to put a bullet into Antwon
to keep it off the rest of you, remember?

165
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,531
We got you out of that before
you had to go through with it.

166
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,839
Which is exactly what we're gonna
do for Lem. But if we can't...

167
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,710
you're gonna look out for us, right?

168
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,588
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

169
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,252
Okay.
We're gonna get you clear of this.

170
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:27,128
Ronnie and I'll track down Pitarrio,
and we'll squeeze his balls.

171
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,602
- I hate this.
- Don't worry. We got you.

172
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,070
Let's get the wire back on.

173
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,937
What kinda person cuts a baby
out of its mother's stomach?

174
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,136
The kind that
should've been an abortion.

175
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,405
- There's the man. Gimme a sec?
- For what?

176
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,247
Aceveda's been updating me
on a few things.

177
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,253

Some asshole dumped a few couches over

Billings is too squirrelly to ask
the city for an extra dime.

- Someone's gotta do it.
- [Curtis] Hey, we got a 187!

Anyway, Farmington's garbage

That's a little below my pay grade.
Call someone in Waste Removal.

189

Okay. But I'd hate to see
your entire district become a fire hazard.

<i>- Yeah. He was very helpful.</i>

191

- The car was headed south down there.
- Hank Preminger.

192

Green Explorer came around the corner,
started blasting at him as he exited the diner.

- [Shane] Nice piece.
<i>- Let this be a cautionary tale.</i>

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,166
who worked with Isabelle Arrington.

211
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,103
So far just petty stuff.
Here's our grieving boyfriend.

212
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,534
<i>Your neighbor told us Isabelle</i>
<i>was screwing somebody else.</i>

213
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,669
<i>- That's bullshit.</i>
- Baby probably wasn't even yours.

214
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,543
Don't you say that,
you goddamn liar!

215
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,617
<i>If the baby's alive, tell us.</i>

216
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,347
Oh, God.

217
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,787
- Please let him be alive.
<i>- [Claudette] It's a boy?</i>

218
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,882
<i>You notice that when you</i>
<i>cut him out of Isabelle's stomach?</i>

219
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,894
We did one of those scans.

220
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,521
[Laughs]
We saw his stuff.

221
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,728
You gotta believe me.

222
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,608
Okay. Uh-We'll get somebody
to give you a ride home.

223
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,234
<i>Stay by the phone.</i>
<i>I may have more questions.</i>

224
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,371
<i>You accuse me of slicin'my baby</i>
<i>outta my girl's stomach...</i>

225
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,677
and now you want me
to go home and wait on you?

226
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,584
- We're sorry for your loss.
<i>- I don't want your damn apologiesl</i>

227
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,885
I want you to find out
who did this to her...

228
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,516
and where my baby is!

229
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,329
Victim did a stint in Lompoc eight years ago.
Been clean ever since.

230
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,131
No family, but coworkers at the pet store
said he's got no enemies.

231
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,105
These matches to the partial
plate on the witness?

232
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,371
I've ruled out 50 of'em.
Got about a half dozen possibles here.

233
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,149
Pitarrio hasn't been
arrested in six months.

234
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,447
That's the longest he's gone
since he turned 18.

235
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,545
He's off the grid.

236
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,216
If the feds picked him up and he
made a deal to give up Lem...

237
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,190
that arrest
wouldn't show up on his record.

238
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,365
Check this out. Leon Frankel- lives
in the same building as our victim.

239
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,663
Turns out they both got
their G.E.D.'s in Lompoc.

240
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,170
Well, let's find out
why Hank's study buddy...

241
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,673
didn't stick around
to talk to the police.

242
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,441
<i>[Shane] We lookin'at this guy</i>
<i>as a coward or suspect?</i>

243
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,073
Whichever jacket fits.
Hold on. Hold on.

244
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,145
- Is that Leon Frankel?
- That's me.

245
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,984
We were just on our way out
looking for him. What did he do?

246
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,389
We were canvassing on that baby. He threw
a bottle at the car, cracked the windshield.

247
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,430
- Then he asked if he could smell my sweet spot.
- Even Shane stopped usin' that.

248
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,500
Pretty stupid way
to get yourself arrested, Leon.

249
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,796
[Leon]
I had a bad day.

250
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,838
That bad day include seeing your
pal Hank Preminger shot dead?

251
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,502
A friend of mine was in trouble,
I'd do everything I could to help him out.

252
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,774
<i>Sit down.</i>

253
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,406
I was scared, I heard shots, I ran.

254
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,748
<i>Hey, look.</i>
<i>Maybe if I sit here for a while...</i>

255
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,345
something will come to me.

256
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:22,052
You're walkin' down the street
with your enemy-free friend, Hank.

257
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,722
Shots go off, he's dead. But you know
those bullets were meant for you.

258
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,061
Now you're not safe.

259
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,830
You're too damn cheap
to spend 20 bucks on a fleabag motel.

260
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,872
<i>You get yourself arrested, 'cause</i>
<i>it's safer in here than it is out there.</i>

261
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,171
- Only we're not your goddamn bodyguards.
- [Mackey] Who did it?

262
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,578
L- I don't know.

263
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,614
Get out.

264
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,116
- What?
- Get out!

265
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,118
Get the- Get out!

266
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,356
No.
W-Wait a second.

267
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,756
I remember a green S.U.V.

268
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,852
Great!
Think of anything else, give us a call.

269
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,863
I'm releasing Leon on his own
recognizance.

270
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,263
<i>- Wait a minute. He's supposed to post bail.</i>
<i>- I'm overriding bail.</i>

271
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,996
- Buzz him!
- Jesus, you're gonna get me killed out there.

272
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,063
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.
- Okay, okay. Come on. Please.

273
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,837
Couple days ago, I had a client
fell behind on his payment.

274
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,005
Awesome pool player.
Now, I knew this guy, right?

275
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,710
He did me a solid back in the day.
We used to hang out at Gary's Tavern...

276
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,185
- little place on Sunset-
- Cut to the part where someone wants to kill you.

277
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,990
My boss, Gus, wanted me to take
a crowbar to his right arm.

278
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,324
If I did that,
his break would never be the same.

279
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,956
So I gave him an extra 24 hours.

280
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,467
Most loan sharks don't take too
kindly to independent thinking.

281
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,197
Yeah, Gus never would've known.
But this ungrateful prick...

282
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,797
disappears
with the 40 large he owes.

283
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,537
Now Gus thinks we split the money,
and he wants me dead.

284
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,546
<i>And your friend Hank</i>
<i>takes the hit meant for you.</i>

285
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,110
- Aw, I feel like shit about that.
- Who shot at you?

286
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,179
I'll bet ya anything it was that
little ass-suck works for Gus.

287
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,919
He's always tryin'
to hone in on my business.

288
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,291
<i>- What's his name?</i>
- I don't know.

289
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,296
I just call him ass-suck.

290
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,764

<i>all these young guys comin'up behind me.</i>

- Jesus, what took so long?
<i>- I had to track Pitarrio through I.N.S.</i>

295

with payroll two months ago.

297
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,220
- Scumbag got a real job?
- He's workin' at a site over on Hillhurst.

298
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,085
If Pitarrio's breaking a sweat,
we know he's in with the feds.

299
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,091
- Let me wrap this up.
- Okay.

<i>- He's good actually.</i>

304

He's inside.

305
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,006
Um, I was wondering.
How old was Andy when he was diagnosed?

306
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:57,014
Around three.

307
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,346
There's an Andy at this school,
but he's not your son.

308
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,511
What's going on? When were you
planning on telling me you're a cop?

309
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,181
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

310
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,986
I was married to one.
I see them every day in the E.R.

311
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,061
You all walk the same.

312
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,097

Yeah, we do.

00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,970
You'd make a good detective, Corrine.

315
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,268
I don't know what you want or why
you've been lying to me, but stay away.

316
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,037
Ms. Mackey, I need you to know that your
husband and his team are under investigation.

317
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,045
So what?
I was his wife, not his partner.

318
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,047
I don't know what
your involvement is yet...

319
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,947
but you and I are gonna do
a lot more talking.

320
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,783
And you mention anything to him
about me or this investigation...

321
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,914
and it's obstruction of justice.

322
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,618
So, I find out that you told him...

323
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,356
that he learned anything
about this case, it's on you...

324
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,455
and that's prison.

325
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,672
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

326
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,174
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
a baby, just so you know.

327
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,441
It's very generous of you to come in.
Could you tell us what you saw?

328
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,540
That pregnant lady decided she
had to turn all of a sudden...

329
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,812
almost drove into that other car.

330
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,718
Other car-
think it was white-

331
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,690
goes honking,
gets crazy, starts shootin'.

332
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:18,752
<i>911 put me on hold-</i>
<i>5:30 in the morning-so I hung up.</i>

333
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,355
<i>You said you saw something on a car?</i>
<i>Something that could help?</i>

334
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,925
<i>The white car had one of those</i>
<i>decals on the back window.</i>

335
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,597
- What did the decal say?
- "Jevontrey."

336
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,267
I have a nephew named <i>Devontrey,</i>
so I remembered the decal.

337
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,537
It was one of those RI P ones.

338
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,381
<i>- [Curtis]... stomach?</i>
<i>- [Mackey] Kind that should've been an abortion.</i>

339
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,444
<i>- There's the man. Gimme a sec?</i>
<i>- For what?</i>

340
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,547
<i>Aceveda's been updating me</i>
<i>on a few things.</i>

341
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,388
Be right back.

342
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,328
<i>Councilman, a moment of your time.</i>

343
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,626
<i>- [Aceveda] What is it?</i>
<i>- ##[Radio: Music]</i>

344
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,633
<i>- [Knocking]</i>
- [Turns Recorder Off] Come in.

345
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,739
You said you have an update?

346
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,501
Lemansky's birthday's today.

347
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,377
His pals, they either don't know
or just don't care.

348
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,041
That's the update?

349
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,143
My best friend forgot my
birthday, I'd be pissed.

350
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,950
This could be a way in.

351
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,490
[Scoffing Laugh]

352
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,527
- Anything interesting happen with you today?
- Like what?

353
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,260
Like... visitors?

354
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,997
- Mackey?
- He came by the office.

355
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,572
- What about?
- Some bullshit sanitation complaint.

356
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,910
I think he just wants to shove it in my face
that he's de facto running the Barn.

357
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:49,784
You didn't call him- don't have regular
sit-down meetings with him or anything?

358
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,348
Just trying to figure out which uniform
you're wearing, Councilman.

359
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,950
Well, it sure as hell isn't Mackey's.

360
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,758
Sorry for getting you down here.

361
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,325
Next time I have a birthday alert,
I'll just call you on the phone.

362
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,147
- [Knocking]
- You're not safe here anymore.

363
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,090
- I'm taking you. We gotta go. Gotta move.
- Why? What happened?

364
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,458
Got a couple possible leaks. Get your stuff.
Whatever Sebastio needs, okay?

365
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,555
- You said Vic wouldn't find out.
- I'm not saying that he has.

366
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,134
Either way, he calls, you don't answer.

367
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,329
He comes by, you're not gonna even be here.

368
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,668
The volume on this thing
just got turned <i>way</i> up.

369
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,673
Let's go.

370
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,441
- Pitarrio. Where is he?
- Well, as far as I know...

371
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,245
he's right over there.

372
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,612
<i>- [Mackey] Pitarriol</i>
<i>- Sí.</i>

373
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,782
<i>Yes. I am Pitarrio.</i>

374
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,985
- Nice try, dickwad. We know the guy.
- [Grunting]

375
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,756
Where is he?

376
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,626
- Gimme your papers.
- Let's see 'em!

377
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,862
Let's see it.
All right, you got a job off this.

378
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,700
- What'd Pitarrio get for his papers?
- He- He got dead.

379
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,502
<i>- Dead?</i>
- What? You sure he's not laying low...

380
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,271
takin' a cut off
your hard-earned money, huh?

381
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,404
No. Three months ago...

382
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:26,280
we were down in El Salvador
doing a heroin deal.

383
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,945
And La Sombra Negra, he got to him.

384
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,022
And sliced his neck in half.

385
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,819
<i>[Shane]</i>
<i>Look, you gotta consider Emolia.</i>

386
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,988
They might have some other kind
of corroborating evidence against Lem.

387
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,828
Man, she's got a messed up kid.

388
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,868
She's got no job.

389
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,602
<i>Look, I.A.D. Offers her a deal,</i>
<i>she could've jumped at it.</i>

390
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,868
I spent time with this girl <i>and</i> the boy.

391
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,309
- She's not gonna turn on me.
<i>- Well, just call her then.</i>

392
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,404
Check in.

393
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,680
Emolia!

394
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,687
Emolia!

395
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,590
<i>Sir?</i>
<i>Have you seen the woman who lives here?</i>

396
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,188
<i>- ¿Qué?</i>
<i>- Niño. Mujer.</i>

397
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,065
Se fue.
Hace como dos horas.

398
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,071
Se metió en un carro
con un negro.

399
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,608
<i>Gracias.</i>

400
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,510
Thanks. I've got every decal place
in town checking special orders.

401
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,672
Meantime, I need an extra pair of eyes.

402
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,343
Three years of death in L.A. County.
Holler if you see a Jevontrey.

403
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,353
[Ringing]

404
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,487
<i>- Wagenbach.</i>
- Dutch, it's Corrine.

405
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,586
- You there?
- Hey.

406
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,527
- What's, uh-
- I need to ask you some questions.

407
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,531
Oh, l- I ca- I can't right now.

408
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,227
Please.
I'm pulling up now. It's important.

409
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,566
Sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

410
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,765
I can't stay long.
What's going on?

411
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,842
Promise this stays between us, okay?

412
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,709
Promise that you're gonna give me straight
answers no matter what you think of Vic.

413
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,078
- Of course. What is it?
- Some I.A.D. Guy's been coming
to the kids' school...

414
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,617
trying to get me to say
things about him.

415
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,382
I.A.D.'s into Vic?
I wonder what they got on him?

416
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,220
- I mean, probably, take your pick.
- Listen, I don't know.

417
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,625
But he threatened to send me to jail
if I said anything or if I don't cooperate.

418
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,822
I need to know
if he's bullshitting me.

419
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,796
I mean, can he send me to jail?

420
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,461
A lot of times, the person who goes down
didn't have anything to do with the original crime.

421
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,437
They found out about it
afterwards, lied, covered it up.

422
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,804
<i>Well, what about spousal privilege?</i>

423
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,469
They can't force you to talk,
but if they can prove...

424
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,479
you knew about any of Vic's actions,
makes you a coconspirator.

425
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,017
What's gonna happen to your kids
if something happens to you? You see?

426
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,086
You're their best leverage
against him.

427
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,884
- But I don't know anything.
- Well, then take away their leverage.

428
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,358
Be completely up front and honest.

429
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,789
L-l-I'm sorry.
I've really gotta go.

430
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,128
Hey, um, why would
someone take prednisone?

431
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,730
I don't know,
a lot of reasons- arthritis, lupus...

432
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,833
uh, asthma, Crohn's disease.

433
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,242
It's a common anti-inflammatory.

434
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,008
Thanks. I'm sorry.

435
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,686
<i>You don't have to memorize every picture.</i>
<i>Just flip.</i>

436
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,552
- Flip it, man.
- You want me to make a mistake?

437
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:24,118
<i>Hey, cut the guy some slack, all right?</i>
<i>He's got a target on his back.</i>

438
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,959
Emolia, it's me again.

439
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,694
Got a Salvadoran thing goin' on.
It's kinda time-sensitive, so call me back.

440
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,703
- I need some air.
- I'll come with.

441
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,937
<i>That's the guy that works for Gusl</i>

442
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,345
- That's ass-suck, right there.
<i>- [Curtis] Justin LaMott?</i>

443
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,612
Emolia's gone.
Neighbor saw her leave with a black guy.

444
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,710
- Kavanaugh.
- You call her cell?

445
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,416
- Three times, including just now.
- You're her paycheck.

446
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,857
When's the last time she didn't
call you back in five minutes?

447
00:24:55,961 --> 00:25:00,159
<i>Hey, if Kavanaugh got to her somehow,</i>
<i>it's nothin'I can't turn around.</i>

448
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,529
He's probably got her stashed
at a safe house somewhere.

449
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,534
Come on.

450
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,341
Had to start with Pitarrio. I.A.D. Flips him.
Shithead ends up dead.

451
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,744
They've got nothing.
They go to Emolia, twist her against her will.

452
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,907
What does she know about
besides the heroin?

453
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,882
Nothin'. I've kept her clean.

454
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,387
Is there any chance Lem's
really workin' with these guys?

455
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,458
See, that's what Kavanaugh wants,
for us to doubt each other.

456
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,586
This guy's usin' every angle.
Prick talked to Corrine at our kids' school.

457
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,028
This guy's chattin' up your ex?

458
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,260
- You think you might've mentioned that?
- I just did.

459
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,338
Warn Mara. Ronnie, you tell
whatever you're bangin' this week...

460
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,463
don't talk to strangers.

461
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,407
All I need is five minutes with Emolia
to coach her on what to say-

462
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,603
let her know that
we're there to help her.

463
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,873
Trust me. We find her,
this whole thing goes away.

464
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,575
Well, how are we gonna find her?

465
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,182
Hey, we got an I.D. On our shooter-
Justin LaMott, vehicle matches.

466
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,258
Yeah, better luck than we're havin'.

467
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,759
We're gonna need to stick Leon
in a safe house until we make the arrest.

468
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,821
All right. I got a list
of available HUD houses.

469
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,663
All right, let me see.

470
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,308
<i>Uh, these are for captains</i>
<i>and above only.</i>

471
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,503
Captain, we found the baby.

472
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,541

[Woman] The bones in his chest
are essentially pulverized.

474
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,465
- Pulverized? How?
- I'd say a fist.

475
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,626
- Somebody punched a newborn?
<i>- Stepped on him, maybe.</i>

476
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:49,639
<i>There's a variety of trauma-</i>
<i>skull fracture, knife wound on the left leg.</i>

477
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,266
- I'll know more later.
- Thanks for the rush.

478
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,845

480
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,480
- Did we even have a chance?
- Crime Scene says he died hours ago.

481
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,578
<i>It's a special kind of monster.</i>

482
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,680
<i>Yeah, and that monster's</i>
<i>name's Tevares Glade.</i>

483
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,521
<i>Just got a call back</i>
<i>from a decal place on Pico.</i>

484
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,858
Two years ago,
Tevares placed a special order there.

485
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:16,161
- "R.I.P. Jevontrey."
<i>- In honor of a dead uncle. Pulled his record.</i>

486
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,406
- Tevares drives a white Monte Carlo.
<i>- And has six arrests...</i>

487
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,805
all for violent crimes,
four of'em with a Sean Deeks.

488
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,369
Why do two men cut a baby out of a woman's
stomach just to beat him to death?

489
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,541
There were more than two
of them. Look. In the blood.

490
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,679
Fingerprints.
Jesus, he's covered in them.

491
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,054
<i>The big one's Tevares Glade or Sean Deeks.</i>
<i>Maybe both.</i>

492
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,653

<i>- You shot the wrong guy.</i>

I didn't shoot the wrong guy.
I seen the prick hit the ground.

504
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,791
No, you saw his friend hit the ground,
and you just confessed to murder.

515
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,828
- I don't even think she saw me take the "H."
- Good.

He's been waiting here for hours.

Apparently, some asshole's been movin'
around the hood in a camper-trailer.

534
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,288
The guy sets up streamers, flags-
whole thing's very patriotic.

535
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:01,456
He's selling care packages and bogus
body armor to our troops in Iraq.

<i>Grandpa here paid 300 bucks</i>
<i>for a state-of-the-art vest.</i>

<i>- [Tina] Let me guess. Piece of shit.</i>
- Yep.

539
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,207
Go pull a car.

<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>

541
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,580

you weren't in class the other night.

542
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,715
Yeah, well, somethin' about almost
having to blow a van full of skin peddlers...

543
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,420
made me want to go home
and drink a bottle of wine.

544
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,928
I wasn't up for baton training that night.

545
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,192
So you missed the class
with no valid excuse.

546
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,360
I took three classes already.

547
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,437

- But he doesn't know the difference...

560
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,056
- between teaching and bitching.
- And rapists and shit.

561
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,149
Look, I can't be in here

562
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,753

We found your fingerprints on the baby,
Tevares, dried in the mother's blood.

571
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,356
Sean and Tevares killed that lady,
so you could have the baby.

572
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,521
<i>And then what?</i>
<i>He got too much for you to handle.</i>

573
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,895
He cried too much.

574
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,264
So you let them beat him to death.

575

- She's our best shot.

580

582
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,632
It's his foot.
You wanna touch it?

583
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,072
You know, I didn't even
ever really want a baby.

584
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,575
<i>But now-</i>

585
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,942
I guess you're too young to know
what I'm talking about, huh?

586
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,140
All those maternal feelings and all?

587
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,351
Which is why I'm thinking
that you did the cutting.

588
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,388
- No.
<i>- Oh, come onl</i>

589
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,754
Those idiots you're hooked up with- they
wouldn't even know how to make a baby...

590
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,884
much less cut one out of somebody.

591
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,399
You feel it?
That man lost his baby son...

592
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,877
- his girlfriend.
- Bitch brought that on herself.

593
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,948
<i>Is that why you wanted that baby?</i>

594
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,644
You didn't think
she'd be a good enough mother?

595
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,881
Shit, we didn't even know
she was pregnant.

596
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,550
<i>- When you shot her?</i>
- She almost ran us off the road.

597
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,957
My man don't stand for that.

598
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:55,396
She almost killed us,
so shooting her was like self-defense.

599
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,400
Right?

600
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:02,132
We didn't see the belly till she got
out the car and started tryin' to run.

601
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,143
They was just gonna drive off, but I said,
"No. We gotta save the baby."

602
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,805
They was thinkin'
they was gonna sell it...

603
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:14,476
but my sister, Myesha, she had
two abortions when she was my age.

604
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,053
Now she wants a baby...

605
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:21,785
but those doctors messed up
something in there and so-

606
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,088
I thought maybe, she could take him.

607
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,561
But then the baby
wasn't breathin' right.

608
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,293
<i>So we did the stuff</i>
<i>you see on doctor shows.</i>

609
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,893
We cleared out his mouth
and turned him upside down.

610
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,240
But that didn't work, did it?

611
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,539
So I made Tevares do that C.P.R. Stuff...

612
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,843
and... the minute he pressed down...

613
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,018
we heard everything crack.

614
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,680
That's enough.

615
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,484
- We was just tryin' to save him!
<i>- You know what, just-</i>

616
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,786
just stop talking.

617
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,768
They've given this Kavanaugh
carte blanche to work your case.

618
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,000
Any resources he needs.

619
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,168
What's Kavanaugh
trying to nail you for?

620
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,711
Because this isn't
about some misplaced heroin.

621
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,274
Aceveda and the department need
a poster boy for corruption...

622
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:25,185
to sell their softer, gentler force
to the voters.

623
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,348
Why pick you as a scapegoat?

624
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,517
You're a push-the-envelope
kind of lawyer.

625
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,119
- I'm a push-the-envelope kind of cop.
<i>- Which Aceveda sanctioned.</i>

626
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,900
This really does go to the top.

627
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,492
Those are some pretty
high-powered cages to rattle.

628
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,573
