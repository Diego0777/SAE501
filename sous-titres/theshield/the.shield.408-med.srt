00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,868
Nah, Gibbs wasn't no rat.

169
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:01,877
He was always trying
to keep me straight.

170
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:06,678
I'd screw up and we'd talk,
but he'd never take it to 5-O.

171
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,746
They cut him?

172
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,151
Head almost completely off.

173
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:17,016
Sheriff tells me the kid
didn't have any colors before he hitJuvie...

174
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,755
but to stay alive,
he had to claim Spookstreet.

175
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,229
- He could be covering for his crew.
- Spookstreet supplied rock...

176
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,460
to the house our victim
gave up on Rivermore.

177
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,536
- Uh-huh.
- Puts them in the middle of both killings.

178
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:30,038
- And off of Antwon's plate.
- Well, not necessarily.

179
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,404
Pull in all the unis
assigned to Spookstreet.

180
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,707
I'll do you one better.
Danny's baby-mama C.I. is a Spookstreet ho.

181
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:40,250
- She's watching cable in a safe house on our dime.
- The one with the two-year-old?

182
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,479
All her tips have been on One-niners.
She'd never give up her own.

183
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:46,112
Danny knows her pretty well.
She thinks she might have a soft spot.

184
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:49,056
It's worth a shot.
Bring her in here.

185
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,389
I have a theory...

186
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,395
about the leaks.

187
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:59,393
Isn't Aceveda's office reviewing
every one of the seizures?

188
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,403
I thought of that.

189
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,496
I see him pulling
political moves...

190
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,201
not moves that actually
get people's throats cut.

191
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,575
I'm not pointing any fingers.
It's just a notion.

192
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:15,515
You've given us some great intel
on the One-niners.

193
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,780
And you pay good money
for the things I hear.

194
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:22,621
Anyone in Spookstreet taking it upon themselves
to pay back people they think might be rats?

195
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,523
Everyone wants to know
who's been talkin'.

their houses and shit.

He already said he doesn't remember.

206

- He was black.
- I got that. Any identifying features?

207
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,629

I was unconscious.

208
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,199

my own name.

210
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,202
At this hour,
maybe 300.

211

check the receipts, tally a total.

212

So, a black guy comes in,
attacks you...

213
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:17,540
and next thing you remember
is a different guy dialing 911 for help?

214
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:19,548

writing this shit down?

- Uh, not really.

220

It wasn't till he came outside
that I got a good look at him.

221
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,822

- You should work that up into a flyer.

222

parking lot and took off without stopping.

You haven't run Mackey?

00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,286
Yeah, but it took a whole fleet
of blue to bring me in though, didn't it?

329
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:37,792
What's your reason
for killing anyone helping us?

330
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,829
/ ain't got no problem with the po-po
cleaning up the streets.

331
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,865
That's what white law
gets paid for.

332
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:45,764
[Mackey]
You just don't like anyone cooperating with us.

333
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,337
Come on, my man, some dick
buys himself a brand-new Caddy...

334
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,429
he ridin' around
like he's some kind of mack.

335
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,440
People gonna thank me
for doing him.

336
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:56,069
As a matter of fact, you make sure
the pen hears all about it before I sit down.

337
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,079
What about the teacher?

338
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,376
You looking to make your bones
for the kids in detention?

339
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,476
Nah. Nah, he was
a snitch's snitch, man.

340
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,317
Everybody knew that he the one
that gave up that One-niner's drug den.

341
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:09,483
Ah, we'll show you the books.
He wasn't our informant on anything.

342
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,824
What kind of cred's killing
some innocent dude buy you in the can, huh?

343
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:17,025
He wasn't innocent, man. He- He was a rat,
big time. Everybody knew he was rattin'.

344
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,832
You got played, man. People found out
you got all worked up about snitches...

345
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:25,237
just gave you a name
to settle some personal score.

346
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:28,140
[Monica] We'll make sure they hear
about that in the pen too.

347
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:32,477
Someone punked you like that?
You're not going to let them share the pain?

348
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,243
[Chuckling]

349
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:40,880
Some breezy-
she one of his students.

350
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,255
Tracy something.

351
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,023
She on the drill team, man.

352
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm not admittin'
to anything, so-

353
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,801
Sure, whatever. We-We're bringing in
the other clerks to identify you.

354
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,303
They're pissed.
They'll remember.

355
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,238
[Sighs]
You know, uh...

356
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:03,278
every once in a while somebody commits
a crime that we cops have to smile at.

357
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,747
Yeah. A hot cup of coffee,
no other weapon is brilliant.

358
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,977
Pour it, pay for it- bam.

359
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,747
You're back home
before the guy's washing off.

360
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,291
- [Laughing]
- Any dumb-shit criminal can use a gun, you know?

361
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,326
Where'd you think
of the idea?

362
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,657
Some broad threw coffee
in my face.

363
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:22,960
I remember thinking to myself,
l-l-I'm lucky this isn't hot.

364
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:25,193
[Laughing]

365
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:26,860
After that,
it all came together.

366
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,333
/ heard you took one
in the line of duty.

367
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,806
The Coffee Bandit
is now in custody.

368
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,504
- Dutch did a great job.
- It was a team thing.

369
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:39,343
Congratulations.

370
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:42,816
- We'll pay to have your suit dry-cleaned.
- [Chuckles] Thanks.

371
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,013
Anything on the gas station assault
that put you there in the first place?

372
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,590
Uh, suspect's
a part-time smoker.

373
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,126
He'd go into the gas station
a couple times a week for looseys.

374
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,195
I used to pay
a dime for mine.

375
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,196
Ah, the good old days.

376
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:57,766
You were both smokers, huh?

377
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,838
Uh, the suspect's sketch has been
put in every gas station in the area.

378
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,340
So if he lives nearby,
maybe he'll hit another one.

379
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,411
Good work.

380
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:16,979
A meeting got canceled.
I figured I'd take a chance.

381
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,146
- Expecting someone?
- No.

382
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,782
But, uh, you need to call first.
You know, you can't just drop by.

383
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:26,191
Right. I might
run into your sister.

384
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:28,196
How is she?

385
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:30,596
This isn't how it works.

386
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,359
Please leave now.

387
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,371
Go.

388
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:39,806
This place, your clothes,
your hair-

389
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,809
It must all add up, huh?

390
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,675
- That's why you bring the gifts.
- [Door Closes]

391
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,444
As nice as Dell Rossetti's?
Did you forget I'm a police officer?

392
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,883
Your bullshit lies
don't work on me.

393
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:53,512
- He's a friend.
- You don't have friends. You have clients.

394
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:57,955
/'m guessing Rossetti's
a generous one.

395
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:00,928
But then again,
he showed up empty-handed.

396
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,022
Maybe we're standing
in his gift.

397
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,498
He the reason you changed your hair?
He prefer blondes?

398
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,732
/ told you a lie
to keep our lie alive.

399
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,808
You want to puncture that balloon,
that's your deal.

400
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,673
Yeah? Well, what's
this guy's flavor, huh?

401
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,043
Up the ass?
Shitting on you?

402
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,948
You don't get to talk to me like that.
Not even when I'm on the clock.

403
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,180
Well, Rossetti can certainly afford
the all-access pass.

404
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:28,587
He's got condos going up
all over the city.

405
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:32,219
- We don't talk business.
- From what / can tell, he cuts corners...

406
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,627
which could land him in some
serious trouble with the authorities.

407
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:39,190
/ don't know what shit you're trying
to work through with me, but it's not working.

408
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,202
You know, he got married
a couple years ago.

409
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:45,070
If the wife has any brains,
she put a cheating clause in the prenup.

410
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:49,043
You gonna call her?
Sort of a bitch move, don't you think?

411
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:52,012
I don't think
she'd see it that way.

412
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:55,346
Or I could call my friends
in the D.A.'s office.

413
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,283
I could call
my friends in the P.D.

414
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,480
I could hit him with
a dozen different shit storms...

415
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,614
and my fingerprints
wouldn't be on any of them.

416
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,353
You've got a wife too.

417
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:07,589
Should I let her know
how to make you happy at home?

418
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,891
Oh, you wouldn't do that,
not to me.

419
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,266
'Cause you're
so powerful, right?

420
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,931
You want to see
the things I can do?

421
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:24,270
[Sighs]

422
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,905
Look, David...

423
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:30,383
I like our time together.

424
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:34,014
Let's not screw it up
over something stupid.

425
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,821
Just tell me
what you want.

426
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,158
I don't come second
to anyone.

427
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:50,901
- You're working today.
- Yeah. What-What are you doing here?

428
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:55,535
Uh, I'm just trying to catch Vic. Kid stuff.
What happened to your suit?

429
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:59,411
Uh, takedown got pretty messy.
It's no problem. We got the guy.

430
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:02,542
- Great. We'll celebrate later.
- [Chuckles] There's Vic.

431
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:06,748
Uh, listen, I've got a robbery
I'm working on, so I'll talk to you later.

432
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:09,347
/ got a pretty full plate.
What's going on?

433
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,223
/ heard back from that clinical trial
/ signed Megan up for.

434
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,694
- Uh-huh.
- She's not eligible.

435
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,596
[Sighs]
Shit. Come on.

436
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,665
- She's under three years old.
- [Door Closes]

437
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,242
Second kid in the family with autism.
Isn't that what they wanted?

438
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,607
/t's not Megan.
/t's us. Our lawsuit.

439
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:33,113
Pyren Pharmaceuticals excludes
anyone with pending legal action against them.

440
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:36,777
Wait a minute. First, these are the people
who make the vaccines that make our kids sick...

441
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,514
and then they're the goddamn gatekeepers
of the ones who get better?

442
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,113
I spoke to Mamyn.
We can drop out of the lawsuit if we want.

443
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:46,355
- It's just the money that we sunk into the tests.
- We're not eating 15 grand!

444
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,899
These clinical trials- I've seen video of kids who-
they haven't even talked.

445
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,298
And now they're playing
and they're laughing.

446
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:54,938
That'll never be Matthew...

447
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:55,905
That'll never be Matthew...

448
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,269
but Megan
still has a chance.

449
00:25:58,374 --> 00:26:00,399
Or she could end up being
the one eatin' the sugar pill.

450
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,410
She shouldn't miss out.

451
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:06,380
But this lawsuit was our one chance
for financial security for Matthew.

452
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,883
/- / don't know
what to do.

453
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,189
I'll take care of it.

454
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,092
- [Tools Whirring]
- [Chattering]

455
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,125
- There he is.
- Hey!

456
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:31,037
H-H-Hey, I been
lookin' for you all day.

457
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,870
Don't know why the "helping out kids" angle
wasn't my first stop.

458
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:35,877
Hop in.

459
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:38,675
- I have something you're gonna wanna hear.
- I'll hear it right here, man.

460
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,511
What, I ain't forget what happened
last time I conferenced with you two.

461
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:46,282
I got you and the 4-H Club a new road
to heroin. You should take this ride.

462
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:49,051
Come on.

463
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:51,626
Let's go.

464
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:55,029
- Little Pop-
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,565
Los Mag O.G. -
he owes me a favor.

466
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,897
They got a Nogales
Customs agent on payroll.

467
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:02,563
Tar slips over
the Arizona border.

468
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:06,039
- Just a Sunday drive away.
- Antwon's beefing with the wetbacks.

469
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,042
That's why
we use the El Salvadorans.

470
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:09,975
That's where
the deal gets interesting though.

471
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,604
We know you were next in line
to be the One-niner don.

472
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,583
Antwon got sprung,
decided to reclaim his crown.

473
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,555
Things change, you know?

474
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:23,683
You wanna live,
you change with 'em.

475
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:26,023
Well, it's time
for another change, brother.

476
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,929
Those Mags are willing to work
with the new One-niner's boss.

477
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:35,596
That's you.

478
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,639
Ain't a smilin' matter.

479
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,005
Antwon keeps playing his Malcolm X games,
the heat's gonna cripple you guys.

480
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,975
Already is.

481
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,979
He doesn't give a shit
about the One-niners.

482
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,948
He was just using his old set
to climb back on top.

483
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,688
And you didn't
come up with him.

484
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,088
You got no loyalty to him.

485
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,285
Say what you gotta say, man.

486
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:00,988
I've negotiated a deal
between you and the Los Mags.

487
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,997
One condition...

488
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,999
Antwon goes away.

489
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,298
Clean, simple.

490
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:11,999
Look, he's beefin' with enough people.
It's an easy pin.

491
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:16,738
You step up. You earn your crew's respect
with this new product.

492
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:20,976
With Antwon gone, our captain,
she loses her hard-on...

493
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,018
P.D. backs off...

494
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,350
injunctions go away.

495
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,016
Brothers get back
to making money.

496
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,025
Everybody wins.

497
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,652
What you win, huh?

498
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:36,493
That little girl's body.

499
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,006
Mm-mmm. Nah.

500
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,508
/ don't need to be
the head nigger in charge, man.

501
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,340
Antwon-he can have
the limelight and the heat.

502
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:52,311
- I'm gonna pass.
- Come on, man. That's thinking like a pussy.

503
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:56,511
Nah. A pussy, that's someone who's willing
to off a partner to cover his own ass.

504
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:59,087
- We're not talking about that.
- Kill what partner?

505
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:02,055
Don't worry, Pablo, it ain't you.
Not yet anyway.

506
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,557
- [Chuckling]
- It's nothing.

507
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,889
Wha-Antwon wants you
to kill Mackey?

508
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,692
No, Antwon wants a lot of things.
The question is, what does this guy want?

509
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,461
I've got a deal on the table.
It's in your best interests.

510
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,128
That's your opinion.
/'m gonna tell Antwon we chatted.

511
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:17,900
- Come on. Where you going? We're still talking.
- You stay right there.

512
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,406
You better
control your boy.

513
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,977
- That's not the way to handle this.
- How do we do this, boss?

514
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,638
He downloads to Antwon, and we're
dick deep in dead girls and bullets!

515
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:27,113
- Yo, handle this shit.
- Hey, put it away.

516
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:29,776
Put the thing away. Okay?

517
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,649
The Los Mags think that
I've been dealing in your name.

518
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:34,120
- You back out of this, man, they're not-
- [Gunshot]

519
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:36,418
- l- l- I didn't mean that.
- Jesus Christ!

520
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,120
- I didn't mean it!
- That asshole shot me, man!

521
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,992
- What the hell are you thinking?
- That asshole shot me.

522
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:44,692
What's wrong with y'all?

523
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:47,269
Holy shit.

524
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:53,274
- Why didn't you tell me about Vic?
- Now's not the time.

525
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:56,345
- [Dispatcher On Radio]
6-Paul-24. 6-Paul-24. Come in.
- [Groaning]

526
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:59,006
- What the hell have you gotten us into?
- Shut up!

527
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:01,583
- Everyone, just shut up!
- 24, 6-Paul-

528
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:04,209
[Radio Turns Off]

529
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,788
Jesus.

530
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,153
All right.
Where's that little girl's body?

531
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,557
- I ain't sayin' shit!
- I can drop you at a hospital...

532
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,755
or I can let you
bleed out in the desert.

533
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:17,094
Where did Antwon put her?

534
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:23,101
Okay, fine. Fine.
Next stop, Joshua Tree.

535
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:26,073
[Engine Starts]

536
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,770
[Monica] We heard that your teacher
failed you for cutting class.

537
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:33,713
You think I slit his throat?
I'm half his size.

538
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:38,116
Everyone knows you busted
Hook and Cutter-10 already. I ain't scared of you.

539
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,314
We need to know who else
you've been talking trash about.

540
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:44,223
/f you've been shooting your mouth,
your goddamn lynch mob might go after them.

541
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:46,227
Why you ain't out
arresting Dynamite?

542
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:48,229
That nigga running girls
on a track.

543
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:50,697
Or my mail-lady-
she's running numbers, for Christ's sakes.

544
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,768
So, the code of silence
is for everyone else?

545
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:56,430
Everybody got their own code.
That's the only law out there.

546
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,133
Hmm. You all
just something to get around.

547
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:02,769
Well, you're not getting
around us today.

548
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:05,370
We're booking you for
conspiracy to commit murder...

549
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:09,611
reckless endangerment and anything else
that we can think of.

550
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:21,128
- Bullshit charges will never fly.
- We're supposed to let her walk?

551
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,666
- There's no law against trash-talkin'.
- She knew the climate out there.

552
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,327
She used it to get
a schoolteacher killed.

553
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,870
You'll never prove intent.
It's a loser.

554
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,031
She's tuned into what's going on out there.
We're not.

555
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,440
I am s-sick
of being blindsided by it.

556
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:41,412
I'm gonna move
into that house.

557
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:44,486
You want to drop yourself in the middle
of all that crap? Good luck.

558
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:48,853
The only way to be a real catalyst
for change is to leap in the mix...

559
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,858
show them you're
right there with them.

560
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,763
They won't give a shit.

561
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:57,958
Not at first.

562
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:03,903
Good work
closing this one.

563
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,802
Zerkow, how are we
on patrols tonight?

564
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:11,971
- Short. Why?
- Captain's moving into the hood.

565
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:13,981
- You're kidding.
- I wish.

566
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,883
Point of pride with her though.
She won't order up extra patrols for herself.

567
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:20,717
But we're gonna make sure
no assholes get any cute ideas.

568
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:22,723
- I'll put it in effect tomorrow.
- Thanks.

569
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,725
I'll look in on her tonight.

570
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,318
[Clears Throat] Heard you were right in
the thick of things out there.

571
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,228
Uh, I shouldn't have
broken that damn window.

572
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,901
It's bullshit
you couldn't be with us.

573
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:32,765
It's bullshit
you couldn't be with us.

574
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,495
- Next time.
- Hey, um, Vic...

575
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,504
you wanna grab
a beer or somethin'?

576
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:39,166
- Big bust like that, I sure
could blow off some steam.
- I can't.

577
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,402
I got something with the kids,
and then a stakeout.

578
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,138
All right. Well, if you want some company
for the stakeout, give me a call.

579
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,715
I'm still a little wired.

580
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:48,716
Okay.

581
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,947
- [Shane] Wake up. Where is she?
- She's in the crapper on the right.

582
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,957
She's buried underneath,
wrapped in plastic.

583
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,324
- Jesus.
- Not only do you kill her,
you gotta shit on her too!

584
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:02,294
Methane helps hide
the death smell.

585
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,298
- [Horn Honking]
- Gotta get me some help.

586
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,369
- What time's this place shut down?
- /t don't shut down.

587
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,836
The-The shelter's
got guards 24-7, man.

588
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,533
- How we gonna get her out?
- / don't know.

589
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:15,304
- [Tires Screeching]
- / don't know.

590
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:18,905
What are you doing?

591
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,792
- [Groaning]
- I send unis to recover that body...

592
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,861
you and Antwon will be
waist deep in shit too.

593
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:36,159
- You try to move it, I'll nail it in transit. Okay?
- [Grunts]

594
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,529
We can't just
leave him here.

595
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,501
You tell Antwon /'m done with his shit-
all of it.

596
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:46,303
He tries to come after us,
my family, or Vic...

597
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,707
I'll walk up to him
and I'll put a bullet in his head.

598
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:51,837
You got that?
You got that?

599
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,376
Move. Get out of my way.

[Rossetti]
What are you talkin'about?

604
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:09,964
Tomorrow night.

605
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,200
All right.

606

- [Knocking]
- [Radio: Pop]

607
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,304
Was that like you wanted?

608
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,973

That's too hard.

[Moaning]
/t's so big.

615
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:51,164
Hey, Detective, did you talk
to that guy who was looking for you?

616
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,867
- What guy?
- He said something about a mini-mart.

617
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,570
Uh, where is he?

618
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:02,049
You looking for me?

619
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,711
- You the one handling the gas station beatings?
- Yeah.

620
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,415
Yeah, that was me.

621
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:12,426
Y-You're here
to turn yourself in?

622
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,894
After I finish this,
I'll tell you all about it.

623
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,929
Take your time.

624
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,936
All I needed was one cigarette,
and then I'm good.

625
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,269
- If I buy a pack-
- Smoke 'em all.

626
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,400
So what happened
in the store?

627
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:31,742
This new idiot was working.

628
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,372
I told him the other clerk
always busts a pack for me...

629
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,246
but he wouldn't do it.

630
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,320
I told him.
I said, "I'm trying to quit."

631
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:41,083
I'm begging him-
"Show me some love."

632
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,216
But he wanted
to be an asshole, and...

633
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:46,556
I lost it.
[Breathing Heavily]

634
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:49,324
Just-Just one cigarette.

635
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,891
And $300.

636
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,196
What?

637
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:58,830
You stole $300
from the register.

638
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,841
Maybe now you can afford
the whole pack.

639
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:04,709
No. I came here
to admit my wrong.

640
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,714
I shouldn't have
hit that man...

641
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,710
and I'll take
my punishment...

642
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,720
but I'm not a thief.

643
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:23,463
Police intel's making
its way into the street.

644
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,932
I thought those slashings
was a little girl playing witch-hunt.

645
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:30,404
Yeah, they were.
But we never did find our missing C./., Angie.

646
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:34,465
We never determined who tipped off
that warehouse raid when D.E.A. was in town.

647
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:36,568
Sounds like
plain old bad intel.

648
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,410
I thought all you guys took cynical pills.
Are you I.A.D. or not?

649
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,484
At your service.
