1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,595
- Previously on The Shield-
- Ever killed something before?

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,696
There's a look in a thing's eyes.
They're on the edge of this great big hole...

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,401
and they'll do anything
not to fall in.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,606
And at that last moment,
looking into their eyes-

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,409
You see the face of God.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,041
[Hisses, Yowls]

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,820
[Claudette's Voice] Kleavon Gardner-
questioned in four homicides.

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,223
Maybe you, uh, happened by
this crime scene too?

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,694
Yeah. I didn't kill her.

10
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,924
He didn't even blink
at those photos.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,365
Classic sociopathic
nonreaction.

12
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,232
- [Claudette] He's innocent.
- Guy's still a stone-cold killer.

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,932
Got a suspect and no victim.
That's new.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,306
You ever suck a dick
like a cell bitch, cop?

15
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,777
- Suck it!
- [Coughing]

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,075
- I worked with Rich Nelson.
- How's he doin'?

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,547
Passed three years ago.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,016
He was always talkin' about
how he was gonna piss on my grave.

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,848
[Snickering]

20
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,320
Rich Nelson and his task force
had a rough time nailing you...

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,052
- but they did.
- Took 13 years of my life.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,594
Just found a crack in
Antwon Mitchell's family seal.

23
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,562
His oldest son, Donald ///'s been
moving fake /.D. 's out ofhis van.

24
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,897
I got an idea how to get him back
for all those sad Christmas mornings.

25
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,939
I don't like the dude, but I ain't gonna help
the white occupation take him down either.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,170
They busted my son. They're comin'
to get me through my blood, man.

27
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,645
- Is this part of Antwon's operation?
- This block? Yeah, it's gotta be.

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,683
This is the little ho
that gave up my block.

29
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,083
- [Gunshots]
- Her body shows up...

30
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,783
with bullets in it
from your two gats...

31
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,587
you'll be doin' time
for a long, long time.

32
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,424
From now on,
I say, "Suck my dick,"

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,431
you say, " You want me
to lick your balls, Daddy?"

34
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,161
Pressure on the seizure program
is only gonna get more intense...

35
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,737
and when it does, that shit is gonna rise
straight to the surface.

36
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,104
- Find the leak.
- This surveillance tape's
from Shane's car last night.

37
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,406
How would you like to get that
little girl's body back? Body for a body.

38
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,072
- Who?
- Vic Mackey.

39
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,412
His body for hers.
Let me know when it's done.

40
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,679
- What's the matter with you?
- Bugged your car.

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,017
/t's you or me, right?

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,820
Antwon killed Angie right in front
of me and Army. He did it with our guns.

43
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,224
He's squeezing us.
Will you help me?

44
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,160
You had a gun to his head.
He's gonna tell you anything you want.

45
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,061
He was never comin' after me.
Trust me.

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,397
Be advised. We have two officers
unaccounted for. Requesting a tac alert.

47
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,995
- Captain- I mean, Councilman.
- It's just officer tonight.

48
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,564
- Oh, Jesus!
- Somebody's certainly making his point.

49
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,644
Antwon Mitchell's
hit the hardest.

50
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,543
Once we have the girl's body,
Antwon doesn't have any more leverage.

51
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,775
We dig her up,
extract our bullets-

52
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,684
- [Groaning]
- Pitarrio, you did something
for Mitchell. What was it?

53
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,880
- Antwon told me to move a body.
- Cops?

54
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,686
- I think it was a girl.
- Where?

55
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,350
Griffith Park, man-
by the horses.

56
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,725
Captain's arranged
a welcome wagon for Antwon.

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,957
How long you think it's gonna take him
to point a finger at me and Army?

58
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,625
I'll make sure it takes long enough
for us to get our leverage back.

59
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,569
- So what's your captain
gonna sweat me on, huh?
- I'll be in the room.

60
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,800
I'll steer the questioning
away from anything sensitive-

61
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,774
that is, if we're workin' together.

62
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,177
- We can only hold him 12 hours.
- She's buried in Griffith Park, near the horses...

63
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,977
- in three holes.
- Christ.

64
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,179
- Don't know what we're gonna throw at him yet.
- I have a couple aces.

65
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,085
Thanks for coming in, Antwon.

66
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,084
- [Footsteps Approaching]
- [Owl Hooting /n Distance]

67
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,524
[Curtis] So, how big's this rock
we're looking for anyway?

68
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,297
[Shane] /t's big, man.
/t's landmark-like.

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:31,033
- [Ronnie Grunts] Nothing.
- [Army] Me either.

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,005
Are we sure that's
the stables back there?

71
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,879
/ got the horseshit
on my shoes to prove it.

72
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,352
[Shane] Pitarrio said the girl's body's buried
200 yards south of the horses.

73
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,923
- [Army] Which way's south?
- [Ronnie] We are south.

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,458
This is supposed
to be the place.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,120
[Shane] / don't know.
This doesn't feel right.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,166
- [Curtis]Jesus Christ. This is bullshit.
- You got something to say?

77
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,365
No, I'm just looking for a dead girl's body
to keep your ass clean.

78
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,533
- You don't want to be here. Don't be.
- /'m not here for you.

79
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,168
- I'm here for her.
- [Horse Whinnies /n Distance]

80
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,880
Couldn't pass up a police escort.

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,088
I felt like the mayor of Crackertown.

82
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,125
Enjoy it now. Your next police escort
might not be a round-trip.

83
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,593
- [Door Opens]
- / thought we were being friendly.

84
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:27,291
Times like this, a community needs
to come together.

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,099
Here's the waiver. Says you agree to talk to us
without the presence of an attorney.

86
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,173
Waive my constitutional rights?

87
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:40,739
Let it be said that Antwon Mitchell
is all about the help.

88
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,912
Who killed our cops?

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,387
Way people feeling about y'all these days,
could've been anybody.

90
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,391
You've been speaking out
against the seizures.

91
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,894
Our dead cops were found
in a seized house.

92
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,897
You sure that wasn't
your idea of a protest song?

93
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,366
This may come as a big surprise
to you, but, uh...

94
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,461
there's a lot of shit that goes on
out there I ain't privy to.

95
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,770
That house is in Niner territory.
You're king of the One-niners.

96
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,845
You're telling me
you didn't order the hit.

97
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,273
Hear about it afterwards?

98
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,284
I just got off a plane.
I ain't even been back to the castle yet.

99
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,846
Yeah, that was convenient. Out of town just
long enough for two cops to get murdered.

100
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,459
You know what happens now,
don't you?

101
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,860
Investigation never ends. Ever.

102
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,834
Did you hear about Antwon's son...

103
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,905
Donald III?

104
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,839
- He's in County, isn't he?
- [Murmurs]

105
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:47,140
Turns out Don's been
a bad boy in lockup.

106
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,477
The surveillance camera caught him
in the bathroom with another inmate.

107
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,015
Guards say that he
wasn't forced.

108
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,761
Did you know that your son
was gay, Antwon?

109
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,764
Ooh, / didn't know your crew was
so friendly with the Mexicans.

110
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,324
Makes me got to wonder what would happen
if I pulled a few strings...

111
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,133
- and had him transferred to Folsom.
- Little Tijuana?

112
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,372
[Chuckles] He'd have
a line of boyfriends outside his cell.

113
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,541
/ want to know
who killed our cops.

114
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,576
When / come back,
you help me with that-

115
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,283
we'll talk about
how I can help your son.

116
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,528
I'll take care of that.

117
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,733
- I didn't know about the kid. There's cameras-
- You goddamn busted him.

118
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,140
- Check yourself.
- No.

119
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,181
You better check her.

120
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,282
Don't forget...

121
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,184
I got cards to play here too.

00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,213
If you've got any more bombs to drop,
give me a heads-up now.

127
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,510
If you've got any more bombs to drop,
give me a heads-up now.

128
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,777
- You're doing great.
- I'd do better if you'd let me in on your intel.

129
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,945
No time. We've only got him for 12 hours.
/ want to get back in there.

130
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,149
I don't think that going after
Antwon's family is the best way to-

131
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,887
Somebody killed two of ours.
He knows who.

[Door Opens]

133
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,410
[Sighs]
Who killed our cops?

134
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,708
[Scoffs]
More yearbook photos?

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,023
These are the Mexi O.G. 's...

136
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,389
who are running, uh, gen pop at Folsom.

137
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,861
They all have one thing in common.

138
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,524
They want you dead.

139
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,363
Now they've got something else.

140
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,765
[Scoffs]
You some kind of special, lady.

141
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,710
Guess he's gonna have to learn
how to watch his own ass now.

142
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,408
- He ain't my problem.
- [Monica] Oh, / don't believe that.

143
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,782
I bet you're feeling
like a real bad dad...

144
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,787
for not being there
during the wonder years.

145
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,325
I mean, just think, if you
hadn't been away doing time...

146
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,724
maybeJunior wouldn't be
in the pokey doing dick.

147
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,228
I don't want to see anything
happen to your son.

148
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,801
It's bad enough having you
for a father.

149
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,701
So tell me about my cops...

150
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,740

right where he is.

for a man's family, do you?

- I don't think much of you.
- I wasn't talking about me.

155
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,756
Way back when.

156
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,793
- This ain't about history, jerk-off.
- It's all about history.

157
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,330
Couldn't have had much respect
for his wife and kids either-

158
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,730
- you screwing him and all.
- I said, shut your face.

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,011
Say what you gotta say.

162
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,911
When I was away...

163
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,644
I heard that you and Rich had a thing.

164
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,983
But / guess it didn't work out.

165
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,684
He went back home
to his unhappy family...

166
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,852
got the cancer...

167
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,659
and you moved on to take care
of mamas and their babies.

168
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,665
Now look at you.

169
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,737
Threatening to have my son
raped and killed.

170
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,968
How'd your old boyfriend
like the new you, huh?

171
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,807
Oh, he'd like me fine.

172
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,041
He had you put away, remember?

173
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,674
Oh, yeah, but /'m back now...

174
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,915
and he's long dead gone.

175
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,362
Get me a cup of water.

176
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,431
Room temperature.

177
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,262
This ain't it. The body's not here.

178
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,499
The ground was torn up, man.
/ mean, you saw it.

179
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,734
[Army]
By a mountain lion or something.

180
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,970
We're west of the stables.
The body's supposed to be south.

181
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,945
- [Sighs] This is where the rock is.
- Know what? I'm calling Vic.

182
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,710
He's got his hands full keeping
Antwon and Monica under control.

183
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,344
Instead of locking Antwon up. That shit's on you,
like all this other stuff.

184
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,116
- Why'd you bring him into this?
- Vic did that.

185
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,715
Probably wanted someone around
wasn't thinking about killing him.

186
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,785
- I never would have done that.
- We'll never know, 'cause Vic
got the drop on you first.

187
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,865
[Shovel Clatters]

188
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,802
Screw him.

189
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,706
- We can rule this guy out.
- What's the latest?

190
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,105
We're still following up
on the stolen J.P. necklace.

191
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,838
- Pulled these from Gang Central.
- We went all the way back to '98. Slim pickings.

192
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,210
Team's cleared
over 60 people so far.

193
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,409
Tips keep comin'. Two cops dead,
everybody wants a taste of the action.

194
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,977
No one's taking the claim?
Bragging to their buddies in the street?

195
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,751
Not yet.
Your best lead's upstairs.

196
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,295
For now, uh, Billings is gonna take the lead
on, uh, Scooby and Carl.

197
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,297
- [Dutch] You can't take us off this-
- Just temporarily.

198
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,697
Kleavon Gardner...

199
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,898
your possible serial killer from San Antonio-
You know this guy.

200
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,304
- What happened?
- Young female, black...

201
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,969
was grabbed on DuPont and strangled
in the vacant lot in Houseman.

202
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,140
A couple interrupted the attack,
but she died on the way to Mission Cross.

203
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,480
- How'd we get onto my friend?
- He was seen in the area.

204
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,419
A couple gave a description close enough,
so unis are bringing them in.

205
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,013
We close Kleavon, you move us
back to Carl and Scooby?

206
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,093
Maybe I can solve that
while you solve this.

207
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,153
- Looks like we've got him this time.
- Yeah, one victim too late.

208
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,466
You've got Antwon Mitchell upstairs?

209
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,004
What's his connection with
the gun supplier you arrested?

210
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:24,008
- It's not clear yet.
- But they're both involved
in Carl and Scooby's murders?

211
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,806
Yeah, I'd rather not discuss it
till we know more.

212
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,278
Oh, so you announce
you have your guy...

213
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,906
keep the streets quiet until
you get a lead on the real thing.

214
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,210
Smart call.

215
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,052
- You look terrible.
- Thanks. So do you.

216
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,286
You should go home,
get some sleep.

217
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,521
- So should you.
- [Laughs]

218
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,655
Thanks for your help.

219
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,196
/s Antwon keeping his mouth shut?

220
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,829
[Exhales]
Captain's pushing him pretty hard.

221
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,738
Meaning he's about
to start pushing back?

222
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,335
And all we got is a rock in the middle
of a pretty damn big woods.

223
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,075
Department's got a metal detector.

224
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,210
The girl was buried with, uh,
earrings, a belt buckle-

225
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,914
- It'll pick that up.
- Or Shane's bullets?

226
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,617
I don't know.

227
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,388
Look- Maybe we should just
step away from this thing.

228
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,725
- You mean away from Shane.
- /f / gotta choose...

229
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,231
between taking down Antwon
and covering for Shane-

230
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,995
- We're not there yet.
- You and I have both been living straight...

231
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,003
and now we're in deeper than ever
because of him.

232
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,438
/f we hadn't allowed ourselves to get pulled apart,
stopped looking out for each other...

233
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,010
Shane wouldn't have been in this mess.

234
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,579
/t's time for us to turn that around.

235
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,576
Like it or not, Shane's family.

236
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,123
[Door Closes]

237
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,165
- You goin' home?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,529
Hey, nice gettin' shot at
with you today.

239
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,200
[Pills Clattering]

240
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,747
Maybe next time two cops get murdered,
we'll be paired up again.

241
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,511
Maybe.

242
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,752
Hey, could be worse. Could be Carl and Scooby
making bad jokes about us.

243
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,469
You found them, huh?

244
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,473
[Whispers]
Yeah.

245
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,543
Did they, um-

246
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,340
- You know, were they-
- I don't think they suffered much.

247
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,749
Really?

248
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,320
/ heard it was pretty bad.

249
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,489
They had each been stabbed
several times.

250
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,262
But they had been moved
from another scene...

251
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,358
so the blood was minimal.

252
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,370
You know what? On second thought,
I don't want to know.

253
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,973
Yeah.

254
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,975
Me either.

255
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,372
- [Zipper Zipping]
- Thanks for riding with me.

256
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,649
- [Locker Door Closes]
- [Sniffs] You're lucky, you know?

257
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,887
You got family at home, waiting for you
to walk through the door.

258
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,931
Take care, Danny.

259
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,826
[Door Opens, Closes]

260
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,101
- About time.
- Who killed our cops?

261
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:54,285
Donald gets transferred out to Folsom next
Tuesday. I suggest you arrange a visit...

262
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,286
to say good-bye.

263
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,147
And I suggest you come down
out of that tower, ivory.

264
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,719
We all just taking a run at something feels better,
using the power in our hands.

265
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,958
Rich Nelson-
He was using his power.

266
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,695
Screwing you wasn't his only
indiscretion, was it?

267
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,967
He planted that blow in my car
and trumped up those trafficking charges...

268
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,237
becausejust like you all,
he had shit on me.

269
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,244
You had to know it.

270
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,076
Your boyfriend-
He cheated that evidence.

271
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,412
So what does that
make him, huh?

272
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,486
- You, for knowing?
- Do you want to talk about indiscretions?

273
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,354
Secrets in the dark?

274
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,259
How about when you were
a kid- 13, 14-

275
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,332
fat, not very popular...

276
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,028
burying your head under the covers
to drown out the screams of your baby sister?

277
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,629
Your six-year-old sister
that your daddy raped...

278
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,608
night after night.

279
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,610
And you couldn't stop it,
could you?

280
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,647
Too much of a coward to confront
your old man, but not your mama.

281
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,946
She emptied two loads
of buckshot into his gut.

282
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:04,113
So Daddy's dead, baby sister's
in the psych ward, and your mama?

283
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,714
She's doing life in Chino...

284
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,385
all because you couldn't
come out from under the covers.

285
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,588
But, oh, boy, you're
making up for it now.

286
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,495
Oh, yeah, you're street tough.
You're a gangster...

287
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,228
full of cop-killing rage.

288
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,272
But you're still too much of a coward
to even save your own son.

289
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,379
Cuff him.

290
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,624
End this now, man.

291
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,956
Give us a name,
somewhere we can look.

292
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,888
Maybe you ought
to take this out there...

293
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,493
ask around your own house.

294
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,093
What the hell
does that mean?

295
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,333
Heard a lot of street chatter about
a little girl, got herself killed...

296
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,138
because she was tangled up
with a dirty cop.

297
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,451
/f / heard it, maybe the murdered cops
heard it too...

298
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,680
got dead 'cause of it.

299
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,190
[Mackey]
Bullshit.

300
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,192
For you to figure out.

301
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,063
In the meantime...

302
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,724
I want my lawyer.

303
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,200
Now.

304
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,932
[Scoffs]

305
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:34,102
Hey, Julien. Watch commander
wants us to cover the cage tonight.

306
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,943
Won't be able
to sleep anyway.

307
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,142
I'll let Vanessa know.

308
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,414
/ saw Carl's wife before.
How's she doin'?

309
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,250
She's upset.

310
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
She's thinking about
suing the department.

311
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,259
- You're kidding.
- This didn't have to happen.

312
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,728
She sees that.

313
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,856
She sees that,
or you put it in her head?

314
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,901
It wasn't like that.

315
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,632
Okay, I'll be in the cage.
Take your time gettin' there.

316
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,471
You saw a black male- 30s-
running from the scene?

317
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,172
- He was about six feet, wearing jeans.
- No. He was wearing a tracksuit.

318
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,842
- [Man] Since when's a tracksuit made of denim?
- Don't tell me what I saw.

319
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,715
Can you describe anything else?
Hair? Distinguishing marks?

320
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,619
Just your average
shifty-looking black dude.

321
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,624
- No offense.
- Thank you.

322
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,126
He was clean-cut, the kind
you would bring home to Mom.

323
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,129
- At least from a distance.
- Sounds like you want to bone the guy.

324
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,722
- I don't think she meant it that way.
- Trust me. She meant it.

325
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,961
He thinks it's funny
making me feel like shit.

326
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,003
Think you could pick the man
out of a lineup?

327
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,871
- I could. She's useless.
- He's right. / have a terrible
track record picking out men.

328
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,808
[Man] /t's too bad that psycho
didn't cross your path.

329
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,846
[Woman]
Oh, you are-

330
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,209
- [Man] Arrest her.
- Arrest me?

331
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,613
Okay. Let's just calm down.

332
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,047
- If it was me smacking her around,
you'd lock me up!
- Asshole.

333
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,886
- Bitch!
- [Dutch] Okay. Take her away.

334
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,862
This is bullshit.

335
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,090
- He's the one you should arrest.
- Watch your step.

336
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,362
- He's stealing our cable.
- [Danny] Lady, two officers were killed today.

337
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,698
All right? Boosted cable's
just not a priority.

338
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,704
Lookin'good, Trina.
Lookin'real good.

339
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,706
Sir, step away
from the cage. Come on.

340
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,776
How about the stolen car parts
in our garage?

341
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,141
- You think you could make that a priority?
- She's lying.

342
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,714
Real crime is
how small his dick is.

343
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,783
Afraid that one's
not in the penal code.

344
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,117
Then search our garage.
Get him on grand theft.

345
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,248
/'ll give you permission
to search our house.

346
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,120
Dead victim,
no physical evidence...

347
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,995
two witnesses who failed
to pick Kleavon out of a six-pack-

348
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
We got nothin'.

349
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,866
Kleavon's logged more hours
in interrogation than the two of us.

350
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,940
If he's guilty...

351
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,600
he's not gonna crack unless
he's under some serious pressure.

352
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,546
Well, the M.E. 's initial report says
that the girl was strangled face-to-face.

353
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,551
- What are you doin'?
- I only have a hundred. I'm getting change.

354
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,356
I need some cash.

355
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,117
For gas.

356
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,959
If Kleavon thinks that girl is alive...

357
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,161
he'd know she could I.D. him.

358
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,171
He might want a deal.

359
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,241
/f we offer one,
he'll smell weakness.

360
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,868
Then we gotta get him to ask for one.
Let me get a run at it.

361
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,640
- He's got a thing for us black girls.
- [Scoffs]

362
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,416
Young woman was rushed
to Mission Cross for surgery.

363
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,514
They say she's a fighter.

364
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,525
50-50 she makes it.

365
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,289
Glad to hear it.

366
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,831
Sloppy work.

367
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,230
Not by me.

368
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,428
You're jittery.

369
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,335
Afraid of what she'll say
when she comes to?

370
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,238
Why should / be?
/ was home watching the game.

371
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,243
- Ask my sister.
- I will.

372
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,870
Then do it.
Let me out of here.

373
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,714
Last time you were here,
you were so calm 'cause you were innocent.

374
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,923
- What's different about tonight?
- Out of patience.

375
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,323
Seems like every time somebody shits
around here, y'all smell my ass.

376
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,159
Witnesses put you at the scene.
You sure you didn't leave your house?

377
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,893
- I went out for soda.
- You changed your story.

378
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,239
You were watchin' the game,
or you went out-Which is it?

379
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,075
/ never been arrested.

380
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,907
Never tried, never convicted,
never on probation.

381
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,981
Come and go as I please.

382
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,217
Look, /'m sorry that girl
got her neck wrung...

383
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,287
but it ain't my problem.

384
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,719
He wasn't gone long,
not more than five, 10 minutes.

385
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,921
Barely long enough
to get the sodas.

386
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,488
We have two witnesses who saw him
attack this girl. They chased him off.

387
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,500
They're wrong.

388
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,595
He has a habit of being in the vicinity
of murdered black girls.

389
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,174
That's what
the San Antonio police said...

390
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,903
and they've convinced you
of the same thing.

391
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,809
I know it's hard to believe
this of your own brother.

392
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,973
[Woman]
Kleavon is not a killer.

393
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,712
If he was- I'm his sister.
Believe me, I'd know it.

394
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,689
We had a woman in here last year
whose husband was a serial rapist.

395
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,692
She had no idea.

396
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:20,925
He said he was at work. Even took a job
that, uh, suited his other career.

397
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,593
/ don't think she really even
believed it when he confessed.

398
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,933
Then I'll pray for her.

399
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,700
But Kleavon was home with me.

400
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,402
He left for only a few minutes.

401
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,806
/s that enough time
for him to get the sodas...

402
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,214
stalk some girl
he doesn't even know...

403
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,946
drag her to a lot
and strangle her?

404
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,991
/s it?

405
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,635
[Door Opens]

406
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,606
- [Door Closes]
- [Sara] Nice place.

407
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,242
What are we doing here?

408
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,313
I was driving by. It felt right.

409
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,983
After last time, I think we need
to go over the rules again.

410
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,814
No bruising, no ripping out hair.

411
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,725
When I say stop, stop.

412
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,071
I heard on the news
about those two cops.

413
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,379
Died in the bottom
of some sewer.

414
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,281
Assholes overpowered them.

415
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,717
[Sighs, Chuckles]

416
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,259
Let me make you feel better.

417
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,956
I don't want to feel better.

418
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,005
My client and I need
to speak in private.

419
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,472
/'m surprised your client
can afford your services.

420
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,136
From ex-con to millionaire
rec center owner-That's quite a leap.

421
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,876
Earn your 500 an hour, ass-wipe.

422
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,777
Let me know when they're done.

423
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,290
Will do.

424
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,719
They can only hold you
six more hours.

425
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,459
No reason to say
one word more.

426
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,536
I need you to do me a favor
while I'm stuck here.

427
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,629
- What?
- Cover that camera first.

428
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,301
Our conversations are privileged.
They're not allowed to watch.

429
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,746
Humor me, Tom.

430
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,384
[Antwon]
Call Bobcat.

431
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:01,823
Tell him it's time to let the police
find that girl.

432
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,054
- [Tom] / don't want to hear anymore.
- [Antwon] Fine.

433
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,029
- [People Laughing]
- Just get him the message.

434
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,737
- What? What now?
- Pitarrio- He screwed us, man.

435
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:24,474
We've been north, south, east,
west of those damn stables.

436
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,050
What?

437
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,984
Captain's been digging
into Donald III.

438
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,987
Antwon's kid?

439
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,150
Turns out the kid's a come burper,
grabbing his ankles for Mexi inmates.

440
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,251
Sent Antwon over the edge.

441
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,593
He's got his piece-of-shit mouthpiece
setting things into motion.

442
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,862
- He's dropping the body?
- Anonymous tip could come in anytime.

443
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,733
Okay, uh-

444
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,738
Okay, we gotta go back to Pitarrio.

445
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,276
Have him be real damn clear this time
where Angie's body is.

446
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,811
Split up. One to his place,
one to the recycling center.

447
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,279
Uh, recycling center-
It's on Lexington.

448
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,680
- There are four of them.
- Forget it. You take the cut house?

449
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,651
Get some collateral this time,
so we know he's telling the truth.

450
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,688
- Okay.
- Hey.

451
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,417

- Yeah, all right.

- put a gun at your head?
- Shut up.

pull the trigger.

No. She knows it was
five, 10 minutes.

your alibi in jeopardy.

You come clean,
to the captain-both of you.

690
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,168
- No. Come on, man. That's not gonna fly.
- We tell her the truth.

691
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,542
Antwon- He grabbed you up,
took your guns- He beat you.

692
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,049
Killed Angie. Used it to blackmail you
into working for him.

693
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,051
And we've got the proof on tape.

694
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,383
- There's a lot of other shit.
- Not on that video.

695
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,250
I can sell it.

696
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,227
- We've got him on tape soliciting
one cop to kill another cop.
- No.

697
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,527
No. Then it implicates you and Ronnie
for not coming clean sooner.

698
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,467
- Army gets dragged into this.
- We do this right, nobody goes down.

699
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,368
Don't underestimate
how much she wants Antwon.

700
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,011
Maybe.

701
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,013
Yeah. Look, I can't ask you to do that.

702
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,015
I'm offering.

703
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,446
But you know how this works.

704
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,923
Captain doesn't buy it, they will drag in
anybody that is close to me.

705
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,324
So we survive it together
or not at all.

00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,440
[Antwon On TV] How would you like
to get that little girl's body back-

- Shane and Army killed Angie?
- No. No.

715
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,137
Antwon did it.

716
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,503
Took their weapons,
beat the shit out of'em.

717
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,701
Then he shot Angie
with their guns.

718
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,903
He's had them
on the hook ever since.

719

How'd you get the tape?

720
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,574
You asked me to find the leak when
the drug warehouse came up empty.

721
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,517
I knew it wasn't Shane,
but I wasn't sure about Army...

722
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,214
so / bugged their
department vehicle.

723
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,223
Without my authorization.

724
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:06,092
But one word from you that I had
authorization to install that camera-

725
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,096
it's all good.

726
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,564
You told me to find the leak.

727
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,534
And when you did, you kept it from me.
For how long?

728
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,901
Couple of days. That's all.

729
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,066
- We were going-
- Gardocki too? What about Lemansky?

00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,872
- Are all you guys working things
behind my back?
- No.

731
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,880
We had to go through hours of video
before we found that.

732
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,678
/ confronted Shane.
We've been working it out.

733
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,717
I had to have time
to wrap my brain around it...

734
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,280
find a way to get Shane and Army
out from under Antwon...

735
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,828
- without them losing their careers.
- This isn't about careers.

He put a hit out on a cop.

737
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,361
You didn't come forward.
Carl and Scooby were killed.

738
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,171
I guess I wasn't thinking straight.

739
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:56,303
Not until we're minutes away from digging up
Angie's body with your guys' bullets in it.

740
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,507

the location of that girl...

You're gonna find Shane's card
in that girl's pocket.

743
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,687
Now, if this wasn't a setup, you think
that Shane would've left that behind?

744
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:11,818
- Antwon's the bad guy here.
- And you guys are supposed to be the cops.

745
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,659
Shane needed my help.
His back was against the wall.

746

What would you have done
if it were Rich Nelson?

how Antwon got to you.

got busted, we, uh-

- Tried to tip him about that?
- No.

761
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,805
But after it went down, Army and /
figured that the girl going missing...

762
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,468

of sending a message.

763
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,875

about the drug warehouse.

- Uh, they'll take a lie detector.

to you right away...

you hid it from me.

00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,215
"What made you kill?"

827
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,149
You don't know nothin' about me.

828
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,994
I know I make you feel small.

829
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,638
- [Door Opens]
- Detectives?

830
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,401
Doctors called from Mission Cross.
Your victim's awake.

831
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,086
- Was that all right?
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

832
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,655
He was responding to you.

833
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,953
- No, I lost him.
- Because you stopped pushing.

834
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:19,859
I don't see the point in burying myself deeper
in his mind. There's nothing useful there.

835
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,828
What's wrong?
You all right?

836
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:27,736
- I'm fine.
- Then go in there and close him.

837
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,873
- [Sighs]
- [Tapping]

838
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,977
Van'll be by later.

839
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,845
- Will you make him stop looking at me?
- Back up.

840
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,046
There's a rumor going around that the money
in that donation jar is for a legal fund...

841
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,452
to hire a lawyer
to sue the department.

842
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,457
It is for whatever they need.
Same as when any officer dies.

843
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,528
People are really raw around here,
you know it?

844
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,257
It's not the time to start rubbing salt
into a wound.

845
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,663
Look, I didn't choose the timing.

846
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,168
I was your T.O.
You did not learn this from me.

847
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,170
Screwing the department?
Disobeying the captain?

848
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,109
Look, I understand that you're on edge
because of what happened.

849
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,613
But maybe what's really bothering you
is knowing that if people had listened to me...

850
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,082
Carl and Scooby might be alive.

851
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,252
You may not be a cop killer,
Kleavon...

852
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,688
but you definitely tried
to kill that girl last night.

853
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,527
Lana's talking.

854
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,756
She's /.D. 'd you
as her assailant.

855
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,264
You bought a case of soda
and two packs of Kools.

856
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,396
Grocery clerk said
you were in a hurry to leave.

857
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,134
An opportunity caught your eye.

858
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,575
She got off the M.T.A. bus, walked across
wearing her headphones.

859
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,705
You put your soda in the car,
followed her...

860
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,783
waiting for your moment.

861
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,254
You came at her head-on.

862
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,052
You wore latex gloves
to avoid prints...

863
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,525
but also for a surer grip.

864
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,587
Her neck was, uh, thin, weak.

865
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,759
Her panic excited you.
That's the whole point.

866
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,769
[Scoffs]

867
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,840
All you can think about is finishing.

868
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,465
Her carotid artery pulses...

869
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,635
needs to pump oxygen to the brain.

870
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,305
Her throat pops.

871
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,111
Her urine splashes the ground.

872
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,050
She cries.

873
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,054
All the fight is gone.

874
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:32,285
Her eyes roll back in her head.

875
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,363
It's over.

876
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,401
You look into those eyes...

877
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,863
and all you can see is darkness.

878
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,172
And almost immediately,
you feel guilty...

879
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,813
- wrong.
- Shut your mouth.

880
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,586
She told us what you did.

881
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,256
You expect me to believe...

882
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,519
that girl got strangled...

883
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:07,084
then came out of a coma
pointing a finger at me?

884
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,766
Well, that's what happened.

885
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,497
Is she in a coma, or is she
in surgery? It ain't both.

886
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:20,907
She was in a coma. She went into surgery
to open an airway to fix her crushed trachea.

887
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,571
Nah. I don't think you two
got your stories straight.

888
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,149
/ think /'ll wait...

889
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,150
visit her at the hospital...

890
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,585
and see if she can point me out.
[Sniffs]

891
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,591
[Antwon On TV] How would you like
to get that little girl's body back-

892
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,756
your bullets and all?

893
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,733
- [Shane] How?
- Trade.

894
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,803
Body for a body.

895
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,440
Who?

896
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,541
[Antwon On TV] Vic Mackey.
His body for hers.

897
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,582
- This is entrapment.
- Good luck on selling that one.

898
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:04,244
- /t's an illegal recording.
- Camera was placed in
a department issue vehicle.

899
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,117
On my authorization.

900
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,589
The Supreme Court says
that we're golden.

901
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,490
Plus our two officers
are willing to testify...

902
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,428
that you shot Angie Stubbs
with their weapons.

903
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,796
That and a murder-for-hire charge.

904
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,428
Next time you arrange a cop killing,
don't do it in a cop car.

905
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,539
[Antwon Grunting]
Let go.

906
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,044
Don't move.

907
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,722
Do you want to tell us
who killed our two men now?

908
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,854
Death penalty's off the table?

909
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,932
/ go back to Lompoc, right?

910
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,000
My son comin'with me?

911
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:03,540
You think there's anything I get out here
that I don't get on the inside?

912
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,082
Girls, cold brew-

913
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,251
You saw how I was livin'.

914
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,514
Life for me won't change.

915
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,715
Well, it'll be
different enough for us.

916
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,220
Who killed our two cops?

917
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,734
I don't know.

918
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,866
Who has their guns and radios?

919
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,873
Don't know.

920
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,341
This deal is no good
unless you give us everything.

921
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,038
Look, / told you
/ killed the girl.

922
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,582
Bang, bang.
The bitch deserved it.

923
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,583
Put a hit out on Mackey.

924
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,246
But / ain't had nothing to do with two dead cops.
You barking up the wrong tree with that one.

925
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,448
And while we're
on the subject of truth...

926
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,459
you ought to know something.

927
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:56,256
Vendrell and that burrito boy
he rolls with-

928
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,994
They were dirty way before
I got anything on them.

929
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,770
So you can tell them
I'll see 'em on the inside.

930
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:09,243
[Chuckling]

931
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:20,953
It's bullshit. He's just trying to take down
as many of us as he can.

932
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,826
You gonna let him have his way?

933
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,360
If they pass the lie detector,
they'll be fine.

934
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,401
[Door Opens]

935
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,571
We're releasing your brother.
The girl's dead.

936
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,808
Deep down you know we're right.

937
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,942
There's something wrong with him.
You just don't want to see it.

938
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,511
But now that you know,
things will add up.

939
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,421
If I'm living with a killer...

940
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,159
why hasn't he killed me?

941
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,232
He feels safe with you.

942
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,767
You've never suspected him.

943
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,166
So what do I do now?

944
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,072
Just act as if everything's normal.

945
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,278
But be careful.

946
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,615
Fatima.

947
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,592
- She's scared.
- Good.

948
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,931
Her first sleepless night...

949
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,665
- we'll be her first call.
- [Door Closes]

950
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,276
Money jar's gone.
Someone took it.

951
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,179
I guess someone has a problem
with the idea of suing the department.

952
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,945
Excuse us.
We're ready to go.

953
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,146
We worked it all out.
We'd like to drop the charges.

954
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,816
Well, you can just express
your undying affection to thejudge.

955
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:06,292
- You're not lettin' us go?
- Not till the van shows up
to take you downtown.

956
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,194
- Asshole.
- Bitch.

957
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,841
Captain showed Mitchell
our little home video.

958
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:34,150
Got him to confess to soliciting my death
and for killing Angie.

959
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,919
- [Exhales]
- Barely put up a fight.

960
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,586
- Hallelujah.
- What about Carl and Scooby?

961
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,393
Didn't give us anything on that one,
but we all get to go home.

Antwon's going tojail.

963
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,636
But what about the lie detector?

[Chuckles] After what we pulled off today,
polygraph's a piece of cake.

believin'that you don'tjerk off.

- [Men Laughing]
- Rawling'll back you up.

over gettin'Antwon-

- It's over.
- Free and clear.

if we'd planned it.

Thank you.

971

Look, I know you didn't
want to, but-

972
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,831
Maybe this is just who we are.

973
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,565
- Me too.
- No, it isn't.

974
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:26,642
We had a problem.
We came together.

975

We solved it.
That's who we are.

From now on,
we got nothin'over us.

977
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,818
We got one thing to do.

978
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:40,014
Hit the streets, find the bad guys,
show 'em who's in charge.

who stabbed Scooby and Carl.

981
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,122
When the time comes, we'll be there
to see 'em get the needle.

Well, anybody
that owes me a favor-

985
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,331
I'll just be real damn clear
that it's way past due.

986
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,806
For one, there's gonna be a lot more talkin'
with Antwon gone.

This whole thing is gonna shake up the street.

And then- Bam! There we'll be.

the past six months.

You've been through

991
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,356
Sloppy paperwork,
but it all reads fine.

992
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,922

- Nothing's missing or out of order.

993
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,364
I've been asking around the street
as much as I can without attracting attention.

994
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,436
I thought this would be good news.

995
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,238
Stay on Mackey.

996
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,311
All of his guys.

997
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,573
You sure?

998
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,047
I wish I wasn't.

999
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,385
- [Car Doors Slam]
- Here he comes.

1000
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,753
[Mackey]
We got him, fellas.

1001
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,725
Guess it's time for you
to lick my balls, Daddy.

1002
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,456
Captain's not buying
your tall tales, Antwon.

1003
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,727
She bought the one about me
knowing nothing about them dead cops.

1004
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,968
You think some shit like that
goes down without my okay?

1005
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:09,042
- Who?
- Who what?

1006
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,672
- We're just whispering here.
- Those kind of whispers violate your deal.

1007
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,479
Yeah. Not unless
you got 'em on tape.

1008
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,517
You'll never find out
who offed them pigs.

1009
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:24,059
I'll go to sleep every night
smiling on that one.

1010
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,790
[Laughs] You'll go to sleep every night
in a 6-by-12, asshole.

1011
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,866
[Man] Let's go.

1012
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,205
In the van.

1013
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,508
I'll find out who killed our boys...

1014
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,341
- and I'm gonna wipe that smile
off his goddamn face.
- [Engine Starts]

1015
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,351

1016
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,855
[Men, Women Chattering]

1017
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,418
