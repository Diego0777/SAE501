1
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,287
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:16,587
yesterday, measure 16 on
the city ballot failed,

3
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,720
which means we'll have to make
do with the lack of manpower

4
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,121
here in the Barn
and on the streets.

5
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:22,354
If I hold this
up long enough,

6
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:23,720
some people
feel compelled

7
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:25,154
to take the gum.

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:26,887
It's a sign they'll
crack under pressure.

9
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:27,954
Gum?

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,321
Oh, no thanks.
Here you go.

11
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,254
Sure. Thanks.

12
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,287
Did you know that I.A.D has been
looking into detective Mackey

13
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,787
and the Strike Team he ran
while under your command?

14
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:39,987
We've got Lemansky.

15
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:41,521
He lifted a brick of tar
off the el Salvadorans.

16
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:43,488
We've been waiting for it
to spin into something more.

17
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,387
You've still got
nothing on Mackey.

18
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:47,554
We got a C.I. Next to him, and
when he jumps dirty, we'll know.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,254
These guys are tight,
and Lemansky is a soldier.

20
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,787
So you're gonna
need something

21
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,087
to drive a wedge
between him and Mackey.

22
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,620
Terry was working with justice
to bring down Mackey,

23
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,321
and I think Vic
had him killed.

24
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,487
You killed... a cop?

25
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,654
Get over it.
Don't bring it up again.

26
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:05,888
Curtis Lemansky,
I want you to come with us.

27
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,788
Why is it that the guy
with the conscience

28
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:09,721
always has to get caught
holdin' the bag?

29
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,087
What do you want?

30
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,187
We want the guy that
put him into motion.

31
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:14,154
Who do you think
I want, Curtis?

32
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:26,587
Still no Lem?

33
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,953
Left a second message.

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,487
Probably knee-deep
in a booty call.

35
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:30,721
Hope he's gettin'
a cop discount.

36
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:32,287
Yeah. I hear yours
charges by the minute.

37
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:34,421
Hey, I get mine
for free.

38
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,421
Must be seeing
a charity worker.

39
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,421
I was just about
to call you again.

40
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,154
I think it's nice of you
to finally show up.

41
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:41,287
Better be a damned
good reason

42
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:43,053
for you blowin' up
my cell phone.

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,687
Who dimed you that
crack mule last year?

44
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:47,320
It's payback time, man.
Come look at this.

45
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:48,487
Jeez.

46
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,687
Man,
look at my windshields.

47
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,187
We don't monitor
lemon laws.

48
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:55,687
Good thing
they're sold "as is."

49
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,888
Look, don't
waste my time again.

50
00:01:57,953 --> 00:02:00,053
Next time you call me,
it better be somethin' real.

51
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:05,888
Shit! The name "Vic Mackey" used
to have some juice around here.

52
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:09,254
Up to no good? Lookin' to
run and hide from Vic Mackey?

53
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,654
Oh, no, he'd find you,
and you'd get yours.

54
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,854
Now assholes like him
lean on honest people

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,587
'cause they know cops like you
can't do dick anymore.

56
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,821
Who's leanin'?

57
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,320
Wetback...
street name "Doomsday."

58
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:24,487
Squeezin' every shop on
the block for insurance.

59
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:25,587
Is that real enough
for you?

60
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,154
How long has it
been goin' on?

61
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,920
Couple months.

62
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:32,254
Now I've come in today, and I
missed on payment... one payment...

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,187
and look at
my windshields now.

64
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,487
Man, my son's right.

65
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:39,320
He's right. It's every man
for himself from now on.

66
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:41,587
Shit! I shoulda
paid that prick off!

67
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,087
You're scared.

68
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:46,821
It's understandable.

69
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,020
You made a serious mistake, and
you don't see a way out of this.

70
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,187
I didn't commit any crime.
I'm a goddamn cop.

71
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:56,587
Gotta start with denial till you
get your head around all this.

72
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,454
It's cool. I understand, really.
We got time yet.

73
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,788
I've never seen
those drugs before.

74
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:04,020
Come on, man.

75
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,120
It was taken from your
vehicle with a search warrant.

76
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,521
I got the seizure on videotape.

77
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,287
You know, I can walk
outta here right now?

78
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:13,220
Yeah, well, if you do,
I'm gonna have to arrest you,

79
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:15,120
take you downtown,
make it official.

80
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:17,621
I'm trying to save you
the embarrassment here.

81
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,053
I got nothin' to be
embarrassed about.

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,220
We've both been through
enough of these.

83
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:25,454
So I can be straight
with you, yeah?

84
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,154
Sure.

85
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,053
Every guilty suspect that
you've ever interviewed

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,154
started with denial,
right?

87
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,821
So did the innocent ones.

88
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,053
Ah, you must be Doomsday.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,821
Who are you?

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,953
I'm Armageddon.

91
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Say hello to the hounds
of hell.

92
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:55,621
Ruff.

93
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,254
You've been squeezin' some
of the local business owners.

94
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,187
Consider us
the better business bureau.

95
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:01,721
We're shuttin'
your ass down.

96
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,020
I didn't invite you in.

97
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,320
You got some paper
or somethin'?

98
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:05,754
It's an unofficial
visit.

99
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:06,854
Letting you know

100
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,953
the cops are still on
the job in Farmington.

101
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah. We're puttin'
the word out,

102
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:10,821
one asshole at a time.

103
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:13,621
Get your toy cop ass
outta here.

104
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:21,220
Are you gettin' my message,

105
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,521
or do you need
your ears cleaned?

106
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,821
What are you
laughin' at?

107
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,421
The only words I want
to hear out of your mouth

108
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,187
<i>are "Sí, señor."</i>

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,721
<i>Suck my dick, señor.</i>

110
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,087
Arrr!

111
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,920
Hey!

112
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,987
No warrant.
It's your call.

113
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,154
Hey, over here.
Come on.

114
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,953
Get up.

115
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,854
Get up!

116
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,320
Get him!

117
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,287
Here. Come on.
Hands up.

118
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,421
That'll give you
plenty of time

119
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,687
to think about your
new career direction.

120
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,888
We'll return this
to its rightful owners.

121
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,920
You're gonna take a piss,
be sure and give us a call.

122
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,020
Arrrr!

123
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:48,220
I need to get back
to my team.

124
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:49,287
Eat somethin'.

125
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:52,053
We're gonna be here
for a while.

126
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,821
The only thing outside
that door for you

127
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,053
is a prison cell,

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,020
and I haven't
been able to tell you

129
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,854
how I'm gonna keep you
out of it yet.

130
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,187
You know,
I read your package,

131
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,854
and I met with
one of your partners,

132
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,921
and he said that... he said that
you made a lot of great arrests.

133
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,574
You started off
an upright guy.

134
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:24,574
What happened to you?

135
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,607
How did you go from riding
with cops to haunting 'em?

136
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,507
"Tio osmond,

137
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:43,074
"diagur leyva,

138
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,574
connie reisler..."

139
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:47,174
they were all
Strike Team CIs?

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,507
So what?

141
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,873
Any of the people you work
with make it out alive?

142
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,507
They chose the life.

143
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,774
They chose to cooperate
with the police,

144
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,240
and now they're dead.

145
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,808
Better them than us.

146
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:02,274
Or did you forget that
from the academy?

147
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:05,674
Angie stubbs...

148
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:09,840
she was 15
when she helped you

149
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:13,407
before
she was murdered.

150
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,774
She choose the life, too?

151
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
No.

152
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,274
She was a good kid.

153
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,441
Bet she was.

154
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:34,541
What do you think
should happen to, uh...

155
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:37,840
to someone who kills
a kid like that...

156
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,541
to someone who kills a cop...

157
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,474
or a grandma?

158
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:45,840
Life in prison,

159
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,674
death penalty?

160
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:50,873
The needle's too good
for someone like that.

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,674
Finally...

162
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:55,307
we agree
on something here.

163
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,641
Detective Terry Crowley.

164
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,973
Remember him?

165
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
21/2 years ago, he was
on your Strike Team.

166
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,307
He was undercover
when he was killed,

167
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:19,140
part of a federal
investigation into your team.

168
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:26,541
You know what?
I've seen a lot of things

169
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,174
that make me think
that you're a good guy.

170
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,973
I just cannot figure out

171
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,774
how you could be involved
with this murder.

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
What are you
talking about?

173
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,274
Terry was killed
by a drug dealer.

174
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,274
I was there.

175
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,507
I know you were there.

176
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,940
But we both know that that
is not the way it went down.

177
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,341
Could you be more
full of shit right now?

178
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:53,307
Terry was killed
in the line of duty.

179
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:55,140
The one thing
I know for sure...

180
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,407
is that by the end
of the day,

181
00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:03,307
you are only gonna be
helping me with the truth,

182
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:09,407
or you are going to be
behind bars.

183
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,221
THE ENEMY OF GOOD

184
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,524
What's up, big mama?

185
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,290
You ready to announce
papa yet?

186
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,590
Yeah, well, you'll
be the last to know.

187
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,557
Listen, guys,
Lem's running late.

188
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:30,590
He call in?

189
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,457
No. A friend did,
said his car broke down.

190
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:33,991
He'll be in
as soon as he can.

191
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:35,190
OK, thanks.

192
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,590
I guess honey wasn't
nothin' to write home about.

193
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,657
Got multiple homicides
on dozier.

194
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,024
Billings
gave this to you.

195
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,524
This gang?
You tell us.

196
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,791
2 black males,
a black female.

197
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,757
You're no one till
somebody kills ya.

198
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,624
Not in this corner
of paradise.

199
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:58,624
These kids
aren't flyin' colors.

200
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,857
Any forced entry?

201
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,957
Back door's
busted in.

202
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,924
Victims had cash
on them, credit cards.

203
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,991
Whoever it was
didn't get much.

204
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,058
Whoever it was got
exactly what they came for.

205
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,290
She called it in.

206
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:27,824
Came over to study
with her friends,

207
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,158
saw the bodies
through the window.

208
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:32,290
Street's gang neutral.

209
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,424
Plus, this was a beating,
not a shooting.

210
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,924
Strictly personal.

211
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,891
Any crack houses
in this neighborhood?

212
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,524
None that register.

213
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,791
All right, let's find
out who these kids were,

214
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:42,924
what they were into.

215
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,624
Bodies are still warm.

216
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,590
Let's crack it
before they cool.

217
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,624
Shop owner found him
on the pavement.

218
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:53,924
He didn't recognize him.

219
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,323
Strong odor of alcohol.

220
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,757
Any bars nearby?

221
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,590
No. A couple of
auto body shops,

222
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,091
church up the street.

223
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,257
I checked the wallet.
He lives 10 blocks from here.

224
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,223
Good. You're starting
to get an instinct

225
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,490
for the right things
to look for.

226
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,024
Well, he didn't
walk here on his own,

227
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,290
not in that condition.

228
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:11,590
Check the houses on
this side of the alley

229
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,857
and look around
for some teeth.

230
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,757
Guillermo solis...

231
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,257
alcohol-induced coma.

232
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,323
The emt says 50/50.
Where have you been?

233
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,891
I'm here now.

234
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,724
Since when does a misdemeanor
drunk-in-public need 2 detectives?

235
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,857
I don't think this guy
got plastered and fell over.

236
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,791
He had broken teeth,
facial cuts.

237
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,257
I'm callin' it
an assault.

238
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,357
Any sign of robbery?

239
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,058
They didn't
take his money.

240
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,490
I'm thinkin'
he was dumped here.

241
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:44,323
So he got drunk.
He passed out.

242
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,524
They drug him here and let
somebody else deal with it.

243
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,824
It's not the most
neighborly thing,

244
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:50,724
but we've seen worse,
and we didn't call it assault.

245
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,490
Well... maybe.

246
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,390
Hang on a second.

247
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,791
I saw you look out.

248
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,924
Now, open up. Now!

249
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,124
Always look out your window?

250
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,791
There's cops.
I was curious.

251
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,791
Curious enough to see somethin' that
happened earlier across the street?

252
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:19,691
Uh-uh.

253
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:21,323
We're gonna keep talkin'.

254
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,290
It's only gonna take
your neighbors about 30 seconds

255
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:24,924
to figure you do
know somethin'.

256
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,857
So you might as well tell me
so I can get off your porch.

257
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:32,357
Quiet.

258
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,424
I came home
to let my dogs out,

259
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,624
and I saw somebody
leaving that house.

260
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:37,724
What did he look like?

261
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,724
You got somethin'?

262
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,691
I'm not leavin'
till I find out.

263
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:42,557
Look,
the guy was scary.

264
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:46,557
He looked right at me,
and I went cold.

265
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:49,357
He looked like evil, OK?

266
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:50,724
Go now.

267
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,957
I'm gonna take you and put you
with a sketch artist.

268
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,791
You said you'd
leave me alone.

269
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,991
A lot of people wanna know
what evil looks like.

270
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,323
Councilman,
hey, hey, hey!

271
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,058
Hey, I picked up
Lemansky last night.

272
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,724
Where is he?

273
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,791
Back at the motel.

274
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,991
Feel him out before I
make a move, you know?

275
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,557
What about the rest
of the team?

276
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,257
You were right about Lemansky.

277
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:18,457
And this Terry murder...

278
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,024
it is a soft spot.

279
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,490
But with me, you know,
it's still theoretical.

280
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:24,757
I mean, I'm trying to
get inside him,

281
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:26,091
and I will
get inside it,

282
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,524
but I need you to add that
personal element to it.

283
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,223
The department brought you
in to close this,

284
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,657
and you come
running back to me.

285
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,824
I can just see
where this is goin',

286
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:40,424
and I'm not above
askin' for help.

287
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,857
Besides, I thought
Crowley was your friend.

288
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,757
He was.

289
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,257
You suspected Mackey
all along,

290
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,891
and you just let him go.

291
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,590
I pursued it
as far as I could.

292
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:52,891
Yeah, well,
here's another chance.

293
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,857
Mackey's out the door
in 4 months,

294
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,657
forced retirement.
Out the door?

295
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:59,158
15-year pension...

296
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:02,290
that ain't a bad reward
for killin' a cop, is it?

297
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:04,891
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,691
Please. Sorry.

299
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,624
We could never prove it.

300
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,891
But you know it...

301
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:15,657
and now, we've got someone
that can prove it.

302
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:24,757
Hold on a second.

303
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,390
Witness
give you something?

304
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,323
You gotta see this.

305
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,091
Sure looks a lot like the
Salvadoran we leaned on today...

306
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:32,257
Doomsday?

307
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,590
It could be.
It's hard to tell.

308
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,490
Besides, he's tied up.

309
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:37,824
Is that Doomsday?

310
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:39,657
You put this out yet?

311
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,424
Yeah. It went out on
the wire a few minutes ago.

312
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,091
It gets worse. I.D. S came
back on victims at the house.

313
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,158
Community college geeks,
no history of trouble.

314
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,991
One of the males
last names was Hughes.

315
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,490
As in Hughes used cars?

316
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,557
It was his kid.

317
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,824
Big-d said he didn't pay
last week, remember?

318
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,290
So Doomsday
sent a message.

319
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:57,657
We don't know that yet.

320
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,957
A couple of
busted windshields.

321
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,424
Why did we push so hard?

322
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,390
'Cause there's still some
goddamn laws in Farmington,

323
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:05,357
no matter what
the voters reject.

324
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:08,024
Plus, he came at me.
He was in my face.

325
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,190
That the suspect in
the triple murder?

326
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,357
Yeah.
Do we know him?

327
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,624
Ah, it could be a Salvadoran
lowlife lives in the neighborhood.

328
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:17,124
We're trying to
get a 20 on him now.

329
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,257
You think it's
another racial incident?

330
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:20,557
I'll let you know.

331
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:24,024
Great. Grab some extra
unis if you need 'em.

332
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,590
If we can find one.

333
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,657
So we 'cause a triple murder
before breakfast,

334
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:31,724
start a race war
before dinner.

335
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,290
That's a pretty good day.

336
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,824
Get the word out
to the aztecs and zulus

337
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,390
that this wasn't retribution.

338
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,557
Some beef about business,
that's all.

339
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,058
You with me?

340
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,757
Yeah.

341
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,924
He chew through
that goddamn thing?

342
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,158
Holy shit!

343
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,557
We gotta find this guy.

344
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,424
You got a minute?
Sure.

345
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,424
Come in.

346
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,924
I need a line
on a Salvadoran,

347
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:15,924
calls himself Doomsday.
You heard of him?

348
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,091
No. Know where he lives?

349
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,390
Temple/colter area.

350
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,190
You got friends
down there?

351
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,223
I'd have to spread
a little love around.

352
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,424
Ahh... boy...

353
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,757
<i>I need to pull this guy
off the street now.</i>

354
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:35,991
This is one
of those times

355
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:37,724
you can earn yourself
some real money.

356
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,158
That's too much, Vic.

357
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,390
All I need is a couple
of dubs for my girls.

358
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,857
Keep what you save.

359
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:46,290
10 times that amount if
we can get him in custody.

360
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,691
Everything copasetic?

361
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,891
Yeah.

362
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,357
That's what I like to hear.

363
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,457
All the emperor needs is a toga
and a violin while Farmington burns.

364
00:16:58,524 --> 00:16:59,957
And they offered you
that job first,

365
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,290
and you turned it down.

366
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:03,657
And it would have been
yours, but you screwed it up.

367
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,290
Mrs. Solis,
thanks for comin' in.

368
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,791
How's your husband?

369
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:11,058
At the hospital they said the
machines are keeping him alive,

370
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,323
but his brain...

371
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,223
sorry.

372
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,624
We, uh, we just need
your signature... here,

373
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:21,058
and you can take
his personal effects.

374
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,590
Did you see your husband
last night?

375
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,824
I took him to church
for his meeting.

376
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,590
Is it
a 12-step program?

377
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,223
AA didn't work
for guillermo.

378
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,357
He just kept on
drinking.

379
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:37,991
Well, what sort
of meeting was this?

380
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,991
Señor Romero has them drink

381
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,757
until the alcohol
cures the sickness.

382
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,424
Aversion therapy?

383
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,957
You weren't concerned
when he didn't come home?

384
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,124
Señor Romero lets them
sleep at the church

385
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,124
if they're in, you know,
bad shape.

386
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,524
Who's señor Romero
again?

387
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,091
Our minister.

388
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,357
Señor Romero?

389
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,524
Yes?

390
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,024
We need to talk to you
about guillermo solis.

391
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,524
Is there a problem?

392
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,323
He's in a coma.

393
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,691
He may not live.

394
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:20,590
Too much drink.

395
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:21,757
Lord...

396
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,124
bless his soul.

397
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,891
We understand you were
treating him for substance abuse

398
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:27,257
at the church last night?

399
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,991
No. I don't treat people. I
don't have a license for that.

400
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:31,991
He attends our prayer group.

401
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:34,757
Where you feed booze
to alcoholics.

402
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,190
That's fascinating.

403
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,390
Everything they drink, they
drink of their own free will.

404
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:41,757
We fight the sickness
with sickness.

405
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:44,390
This aversion therapy... it
really works for some people?

406
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,824
It's how I conquered
my issues with alcohol,

407
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:50,058
otherwise I wouldn't have
my business and my church.

408
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:51,624
My ex-wife was a drunk.

409
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:53,724
Do you think if I'd hauled her
off to happy hour every night

410
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,857
I could've
saved the marriage?

411
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:56,624
I wouldn't
want to speculate.

412
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:57,991
Who else was there
last night?

413
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,124
Hector santiago...
he works at the church,

414
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,991
and he's going through
the therapy.

415
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:02,991
Just the 3 of you?

416
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,424
Well, the group
gets smaller

417
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,590
as more of us
are healed.

418
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:09,624
Well, uh...
keep up the good work.

419
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,357
Sure.

420
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:15,590
Told you
I had a feeling.

421
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:17,323
Preachers need to
stick to preaching.

422
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:28,190
Want me to ask Romero if
he's got that in your size?

423
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,724
OK, witness was worried
about her dogs.

424
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,357
She made me promise
to come check on 'em.

425
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,957
Living room.

426
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:48,424
This Doomsday ain't
a member of p.e.t.a.

427
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,991
What do we know
about Doomsday?

428
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,524
He's from north carolina,

429
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,891
did a stint for agg assault
in atascadero,

430
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:56,957
got out 6 months ago.

431
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,223
Took a guy's eye out
with a fork

432
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,691
for stealin'
his food

433
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:02,424
in Junior high.

434
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,991
Keep pressin'
the local sets.

435
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:06,924
Guys like this
make friends all over.

436
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:11,857
It's a good thing
you pulled Irma in.

437
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:13,158
Where are the heads?

438
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:15,390
Nowhere. Checked
the whole place.

439
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:18,557
He took
the goddamn dogs' heads?

440
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:21,924
What's he gonna do,
put 'em on a pike?

441
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:25,058
We gotta find this freak.

442
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,388
Councilman.

443
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:46,921
You two know each other
already.

444
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:48,288
Curtis.

445
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:50,520
What are you doing here?

446
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:53,954
You've got a big decision to
make, and not a lot of time.

447
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:58,720
So I thought you should get as
much information as possible.

448
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:01,487
It's time for you to step
into the sunlight, Lem.

449
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,288
Look, I didn't
do anything wrong.

450
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:04,754
You're not
my captain anymore.

451
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,854
You took some heroin.
You got caught.

452
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:10,687
Now, we're not just talkin'
about your career here, Lem.

453
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:14,254
The city referendum showed all of
us what the public thinks of cops,

454
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,720
and the department's fighting
to change that perception,

455
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:19,687
so somebody
has to pay a price,

456
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,921
and right now, that's you.

457
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:25,121
Well, you know what? I'll take my
chances with the truth in court.

458
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:29,254
Everything that lieutenant Kavanaugh
told you about Terry was true.

459
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:35,388
You know, Terry didn't have
a grudge against Vic going in.

460
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:40,021
But it only took him 2 weeks to
find out that Vic was a dirty cop.

461
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:44,054
I have his original notes
detailing his suspicions.

462
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:47,654
He was your teammate,
he was a threat,

463
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,854
so he had to die.

464
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,921
No! Never!

465
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,453
You didn't know, did you?

466
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:03,420
Vic never told you.

467
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:07,453
All this time, I thought the
four of you were in it together,

468
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,921
<i>but you really didn't know.</i>

469
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:16,887
This changes everything.

470
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,954
You're sayin'...

471
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,221
you didn't know about it
until right now.

472
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,354
It was the other guys.

473
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,553
I didn't say that!
I didn't say that.

474
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,620
But you didn't know.

475
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:31,354
I mean, I respect a guy
bein' loyal,

476
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,787
but now you're protecting
a guy for somethin'

477
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,620
that you don't
have any stake in,

478
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,587
somethin' that
you told me

479
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,820
the death penalty
was too good for.

480
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,921
This is a damn
witch hunt right now.

481
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:46,221
You cannot be a cop and
be a part of it with him.

482
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:47,254
You gotta choose.

483
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,187
Vic did not kill Terry!

484
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,754
So prove it.

485
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,687
Wear a wire.

486
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:54,921
Ask him as a friend.

487
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,820
Let's see what
he's got to say.

488
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:59,087
You want to railroad
an innocent guy,

489
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:00,420
go ahead and do it.
Do it.

490
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:02,288
But I do not
have to help.

491
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:06,254
So you'd rather
take on prison

492
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:11,487
than someone who took out
one of your own?

493
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,620
Oh, that...
that is a tough choice...

494
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:26,021
but I understand.

495
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,221
Guillermo
was a jealous man.

496
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,787
The drinking
only made it worse.

497
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,087
You give him a reason
to be jealous?

498
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,787
Why are you asking me
those questions?

499
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:38,720
Those are nice shoes.

500
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,187
You get those
from Romero?

501
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,620
Saw a pair like 'em.

502
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:44,954
<i>They were a gift
from el señor.</i>

503
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:49,654
How long have you
been sleepin' with Romero?

504
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,987
I have never done that.

505
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:55,087
But he's made advances, hasn't he?

506
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,921
I'm a married woman.

507
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:59,388
He made me feel good,

508
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:03,021
<i>but I told el señor I
would not betray my vows.</i>

509
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:08,354
You mean, uh...
"till death do us part"?

510
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,820
You know what?
You know what?

511
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:14,587
I need a decision.
I need a decision.

512
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,754
What happened to
havin' some time?

513
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,720
I can't believe
you need any.

514
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:21,254
Look, Vic is your friend
and you're loyal,

515
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:25,054
but you also gotta
be loyal to your badge.

516
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,054
You gotta be loyal
to yourself...

517
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,854
to an innocent...

518
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,620
brother cop.

519
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,321
It's decision time now.

520
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:39,687
You tell me... do I
parade you into police one,

521
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:43,288
or do I
call a technician,

522
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:45,587
wire you up?

523
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:51,587
You know, Lem, if Vic
is innocent, like you say,

524
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:55,121
you'd be
helping him out.

525
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:03,820
If I do...

526
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:08,987
what do I get out of it?

527
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:12,620
Doomsday's here?

528
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,720
According to
Emolia's friend.

529
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,154
He's not exactly
layin' low.

530
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,854
All right, let's go.

531
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,787
On the ground now!

532
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:28,288
Let's go right now!
Let's go right now!

533
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,288
On the ground!

534
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:30,687
Get down
on the ground!

535
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:35,620
You son of a bitch,
you do need your ears cleaned.

536
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,354
Where'd you put
the dogs' heads?

537
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,254
What are you talking about?

538
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:52,987
Right.

539
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,087
Where does Mackey
like to put these?

540
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,720
On the chest.

541
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:02,954
Make a case on Mackey,
the others,

542
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,487
you walk away free.

543
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:06,687
Here you go.

544
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:09,587
Just one more thing...

545
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:11,453
if you lie to me

546
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,820
or try to screw me,
or you just

547
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,121
don't live up to the deal,

548
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:18,687
I will push

549
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:22,887
for the maximum for
distribution of heroin.

550
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:26,121
Just know
that's the truth.

551
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,054
Did you get all that?

552
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,620
Perfect.
Mic's working great.

553
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,954
Let's go.

554
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,887
Hey, hey!

555
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:43,420
Where you going?

556
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh, I've got to
run an errand.

557
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:46,087
I'm sorry. I'll be back
in about an hour.

558
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,921
Can't it wait? I'm
trying to close this up.

559
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:48,921
Sorry.

560
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,254
Is everything OK?

561
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,720
Yeah. I'll hurry back.

562
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:52,987
Well, I'll start.

563
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:54,820
You jump in
when you get back?

564
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,587
The tox report
came back.

565
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:01,487
He was practically
embalmed.

566
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,654
No way he had enough
motor function to swallow,

567
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,087
much less
hold the bottle.

568
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:07,420
It even amazes me
sometimes

569
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:12,054
how much these chronic
alcoholics can put away.

570
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,154
You, uh, screwing any other
sheep in your flock, reverend,

571
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:18,121
or do you just like giving
shoes to all the pretty wives?

572
00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:20,254
I don't know what
you're talking about.

573
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:23,620
And in my faith, I am called
apostle, not reverend.

574
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,921
How did guillermo's
front teeth get broken?

575
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,254
He must have fallen down.

576
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,087
You shoved a bottle
in his mouth.

577
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:31,121
Celia solis said she
wouldn't sleep with you

578
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,354
while her husband
was alive,

579
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,754
so you tried
to kill him,

580
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,921
but only his brain died.

581
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,420
No, the devil
did that to him.

582
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,354
Alcohol was his demon.

583
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:42,321
Santiago said guillermo
had the shakes.

584
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:44,720
Did you notice
anything like that?

585
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:47,420
I left them both asleep
in the sanctuary.

586
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:49,054
I went to my office.

587
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:51,288
I wrote
this week's sermon.

588
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:53,654
When I returned,
guillermo wasn't in the church.

589
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,221
I figured he had sobered up
enough to walk home.

590
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:02,321
Santiago was too out
of it to say otherwise.

591
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:04,254
You've got all your
bases covered.

592
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,054
I'll put my hand
on the bible...

593
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:10,187
not as much fun as putting
your hand on another man's wife.

594
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,254
Get in there!

595
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:15,420
Sick prick!

596
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,687
Glad you could join us.

597
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:25,321
Hey.

598
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:28,720
Smells ripe.

599
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:29,820
Hope you put a little
boom in her womb.

600
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,221
I had to stop by
my friend's

601
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:32,354
on the way back
from chino.

602
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,388
The car broke down,

603
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:35,288
so I waited a half day
for a mechanic.

604
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:36,787
Yeah, well, good thing you
didn't call back, buddy.

605
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,187
'Cause I had a thought to haul
my ass out there and pick you up.

606
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,654
Hey, Vic.
Downtown called.

607
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,987
They want to see any records
that you have on Terry Crowley.

608
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:49,987
Did they say why?

609
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:53,087
No. Just that they want
anything you got.

610
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,654
They probably just want
to close out the file.

611
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,887
Yeah.

612
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:57,620
I gotta pull a couple
little boxes,

613
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,854
but I'll see
what I can do.

614
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:00,854
You missed
the first half.

615
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,087
We're still
in the game.

616
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:04,221
We just picked up a
suspect in a triple murder.

617
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:06,054
Put me in, coach.

618
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,687
It's not him.

619
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:15,321
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Don't do this.

620
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:17,687
I said it's not him.

621
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:21,620
This man killed
3 innocent people today.

622
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:23,121
That's not my fault.

623
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:25,321
What about the next person
he kills? That will be.

624
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,021
He already killed my dogs.

625
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:29,487
You think just 'cause
you're not I.D. Ing him

626
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:30,987
that he's not gonna try
to kill you, too?

627
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,854
You're protecting a killer.

628
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,487
It makes you no better
than he is.

629
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:37,087
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:41,553
For the record,

631
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,221
I saw someone...
but not him.

632
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,650
What happened
to your hands?

633
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:01,417
Looks like you got into
one hell of a dogfight.

634
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:03,650
Scratched 'em up
someplace.

635
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:05,618
Senior Hughes refuses
to pay you protection,

636
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:06,750
Junior winds up dead.

637
00:30:06,817 --> 00:30:08,117
Niggers die
every day.

638
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,783
You save that grin
for the lineup

639
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,783
before I smack it
off your face!

640
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,050
You need a witness
for a lineup.

641
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:15,683
Ruff ruff.

642
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,551
I'm holding you on suspicion of
vandalism, cruelty to animals.

643
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:24,950
That means we're about 8 minutes
into a 12-hour conversation.

644
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:27,351
Wanna see how cruel I can
be to animals like you?

645
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,518
A lot can happen
in 12 hours.

646
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,950
Problem for you is we
don't scare like girls,

647
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:37,551
and our bite's as good
as our bark, asshole!

648
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:44,950
We gain entry
and do what?

649
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:45,950
Separate the parties,

650
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:48,251
look for provisional
signs of injury.

651
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:50,750
You taking the son?

652
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:52,551
Yeah, you get
the father.

653
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,683
Control the scene.

654
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,251
Use force
if necessary.

655
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,317
Over there.

656
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,184
Hey!

657
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,217
Calm down!

658
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,850
Calm down!

659
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,184
He steals all my shit,
and you let him...

660
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:16,750
He gets all crazed!

661
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,618
Shit!

662
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,884
Hey! That's enough!

663
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,184
Tina!
That's enough!

664
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:45,584
Thanks.

665
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,717
He wouldn't
listen to me.

666
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:52,950
It's your job
to make him listen.

667
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,683
I was trying.
Trying gets you killed.

668
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,551
You failed to get
the father out of the room,

669
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,017
then you used
excessive force.

670
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,683
You said to use force
if necessary.

671
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,717
Controlled hits.
Behind his knees.

672
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:03,650
That's exactly
what I was doing!

673
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,317
No force would have
been necessary, none,

674
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,584
if you had followed
proper procedure.

675
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,417
That's gonna need
stitches.

676
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,650
Corrine.

677
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:19,284
Hi. Jon. Um,
you picking up your son?

678
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,917
Um, yeah.
My ex was supposed to.

679
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:22,984
She bailed out at
the last second, so...

680
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,650
I skipped out of work
and came here.

681
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:25,683
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,151
It's par for the course.

683
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:29,217
Hey, guys.

684
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,551
You know what? Why don't
you guys go play

685
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,384
over by the swings
for a little bit?

686
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,717
Watch your sister
for me, OK?

687
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:38,618
So was it a bad
divorce or...

688
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:40,783
yeah.

689
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,884
Uh, she's with this
other guy now.

690
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,284
I got primary custody.
She's, uh...

691
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:48,184
supposed to be paying
child support.

692
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:49,783
She's this big time
money manager.

693
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,317
I haven't seen a cent,
though, in, like, 3 months.

694
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,917
You're kidding? I mean, she
doesn't even help out at all?

695
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:59,618
No. I'm a little late
on the tuition here.

696
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,884
And you?

697
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,884
You're paying for your
children all by yourself?

698
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,584
Oh, no. Uh...
Vic helps out.

699
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,950
But the occupational
therapists

700
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:11,417
and the evaluations
and the...

701
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:14,484
yeah. Um, you know,
Vic always comes up

702
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:18,518
with whatever extra cash
I need for the kids, so...

703
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,717
sounds like a great guy.

704
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:22,484
Ah, well, let's not
make him a saint quite yet.

705
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,618
Yeah?
What's his bad side?

706
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:29,884
just trying to compare it
my ex's bad side, because...

707
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,451
OK. Well, he's hardheaded.

708
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:35,351
Uh, he likes
to get his way,

709
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,317
and... job comes first.

710
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,884
Same here.

711
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,884
But he loves his kids.

712
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:44,850
What's your boy's name again?

713
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,850
Andrew. Andy.

714
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:47,783
Uh, is he...

715
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,750
no. He's, um...

716
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:50,451
he's doing
some extra work

717
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,151
with one of his teachers
right now.

718
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:55,618
Maybe you can bring andy
around for a play date sometime?

719
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:59,351
That would be a huge,
huge help.

720
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,783
Billings keeps
asking what we got.

721
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,850
We got nothing.

722
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,117
We got no prints.
We got no weapons.

723
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:04,783
No goddamn witness.

724
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,850
Maybe we just cut
this guy loose

725
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:08,917
and continue this conversation
on the street.

726
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:10,850
What kind of
conversation?

727
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,584
Irma's the only
thing we had.

728
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,084
She ain't sticking
her neck out ever.

729
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,984
We could turn him onto special
cases. Let them roll with it.

730
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,451
Pass the buck?

731
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:19,451
And have the streets
still think

732
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,518
that we're stuck
behind desks

733
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,217
with our tail
between our legs?

734
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:23,518
They got the resources,
the manpower...

735
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:25,850
every minute he walks around
free, we're a bigger joke.

736
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,017
We're gonna
handle this guy

737
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:30,950
<i>so that people know
that we got him.</i>

738
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,484
Hey, what about the, uh...

739
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:36,317
the guy that we met
on the mexi sting last year?

740
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,584
What about him?
Hold on.

741
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,783
I gotta take off, man.

742
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,950
Where are you going?

743
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,217
My stomach's been
bugging me all day.

744
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:45,584
Do you mind if
I pick it back up tomorrow?

745
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,783
Sure. Are you gonna
be all right?

746
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,284
Yeah. Just some medicine
I'm back on.

747
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,683
I left it at home.

748
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,050
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

749
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,451
Is he gonna get
paid for today?

750
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,717
Keep going.

751
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:06,950
It's a great country.

752
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,351
Respecting
the human rights

753
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,950
of a blood-thirsty
piece of shit like yourself.

754
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,850
I just might have
to sue your ass.

755
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:21,217
I got a feeling your life
just took a turn for the worse.

756
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:25,217
Or it could be
just wishful thinking.

757
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:29,717
You go back to filling
out your paperwork.

758
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:32,050
Stay the hell
off my street.

759
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,417
Well, I told you
to lose the earrings.

760
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:37,084
Figured it was
no big deal,

761
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,518
but I should have
listened to you.

762
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,984
Protocol's there
for a reason.

763
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,850
Well, it won't
happen again.

764
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,717
You know what?
Do yourself a favor.

765
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:47,251
Don't turn being a cop
and a girl into a juggling act.

766
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,384
All right.
See you later.

767
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:51,984
You were Julien's
training officer, right?

768
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,251
I mean, he's a good guy
and all, reads the bible,

769
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:58,251
but maybe he has a
problem working with women.

770
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,117
We may have
the same plumbing,

771
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,284
but that doesn't mean I'm gonna
dish with you about your t.o.

772
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,351
I didn't mean it
like that.

773
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,050
You wanna succeed
around here?

774
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:11,251
Do yourself a favor. Just...
listen up and do like you're told.

775
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:14,117
What did I miss?

776
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:16,917
Uh... everything.

777
00:36:18,817 --> 00:36:21,551
I lasered the power points on
the Romero thing for the D.A.

778
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:23,050
They weren't biting.

779
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:24,750
You called the D.A.?

780
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:26,884
Yeah. I just said
I lasered them.

781
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,084
What'd you tell 'em?
What Claudette told me.

782
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:33,683
On my way out, he asked me
where we were. I filled him in.

783
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,551
Well, we're still
investigating. The guy's guilty.

784
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:39,217
Look, your hunches not
withstanding, my strong sense is

785
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:42,417
they're not gonna find the
arena sexy enough to file on.

786
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:43,750
Sexy enough?

787
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:46,151
Hey, I'm just passing along
what your partner told me

788
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:48,917
and what I found out. You got a
beef with her, you figure it out

789
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:51,650
instead of walking on me
with your anger shoes.

790
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,650
Anger shoes?

791
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,817
That's him.

792
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,484
Hello, asshole.

793
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,184
Against the wall.

794
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:11,417
Come on.

795
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,050
Somebody called
for a police escort.

796
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:14,884
Must have
been you.

797
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,783
Always happy to help out
a citizen in need.

798
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,518
Let's go.

799
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,551
You sure you want in?

800
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:44,151
Yeah.

801
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,584
We can do this
without you.

802
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,950
What's the fun in that?
We're a team.

803
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,584
OK.

804
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:58,317
What are you guys
talking about?

805
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,750
Want in on what?

806
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,217
Now take everything

807
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,284
that's a name brand
trademark violation.

808
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:11,017
You got it.

809
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,950
Take him into custody.

810
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,551
Is it worth taking
another run at the D.A.?

811
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,683
Romero skates
on attempted murder.

812
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,317
At least he won't be selling
knock-off shoes anymore.

813
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:32,151
You get lemons,
you make lemonade.

814
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:34,317
Hey, where is this,
"hey, man, it's all good,

815
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:36,817
whatever," bullshit
coming from all of a sudden?

816
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,317
Excuse me?

817
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,317
Catch the mediocrity flu
Billings has been passing around?

818
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,683
This guy tried to kill
somebody.

819
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,850
He's getting off
on a class-b felony

820
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:45,817
while you took a half
day of personal time.

821
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:48,451
I was out of the Barn for an
hour and a half today, max.

822
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:51,584
Come on.
You're coming in late,

823
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,518
when you're here, your
head's not in the game.

824
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,850
I'm sorry the case
didn't make.

825
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,184
It was never a slam-dunk.

826
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,783
Hey, Julian.

827
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,618
"Officer hamlin used
unnecessary and excessive force

828
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,850
in subduing
the second suspect."

829
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,584
You really want that
on her record?

830
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,618
That's what happened.

831
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,817
Look, Billings
hasn't seen this yet.

832
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:24,284
Why don't you
sleep on it?

833
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,217
Especially since she
was coming to the aid

834
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,717
of a fellow officer.

835
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,384
The department
is still liable

836
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,750
for her actions
against an unarmed citizen.

837
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:33,317
She's 5'4". Excessive
for you, excessive for her

838
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:35,384
are probably
2 different things.

839
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,384
It's my call.
Good night.

840
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,984
Have you requested extra
baton training for her?

841
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,384
No.

842
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,650
Well, maybe you should think
about your responsibilities

843
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,384
as a training officer.

844
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,984
I also have
a responsibility

845
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,151
to wash her out
if she can't handle it.

846
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:52,251
I could have washed you out
a couple of times.

847
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:55,984
I'd like to think that I
made the right decision.

848
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:24,251
Where are the dogs'
heads?

849
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:30,584
They're in the freezer.

850
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,384
I was gonna make them
into soup.

851
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:37,850
Make that bitch
who saw me drink it.

852
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,551
Where are we going?

853
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:50,551
Over there.

854
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,251
Come here!

855
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:14,251
Amigo.

856
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:16,384
<i>¿Y la cosita
que me perdi?</i>

857
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:18,783
<i>Para tu.</i>

858
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,184
<i>¿Zapatos para los niños,
eh?</i>

859
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:24,750
Guy spends a weekend a
month in a whorehouse in T.J.

860
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,618
Like his Mexican pussy.

861
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:29,084
Just keep him away
from the chihuahuas.

862
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:31,984
But he shoulda
left this at home.

863
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,384
<i>Es algo muy mal.</i>

864
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,584
Possession of a weapon
in my country

865
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,384
is a very serious
crime.

866
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:41,317
You can't do this shit!

867
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:44,850
You can't do this shit!
I'm a citizen!

868
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:48,017
Yeah? Phones work
in those mexi jails.

869
00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:49,783
Maybe they'll let you
call the state department.

870
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,850
Government types
aren't too helpful

871
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,317
getting murder suspects
out of foreign prisons.

872
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:58,050
Mexico makes our gun laws
look like parking violations.

873
00:41:58,117 --> 00:41:59,484
Good luck.

874
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,451
See ya
in 20 years, asshole.

875
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:12,217
I know you hate
passin' the buck.

876
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:16,251
What are ya gonna do?

877
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:37,551
Hey.

878
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,584
Hey, man.

879
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,584
Something's
bothering me.

880
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,284
We need to talk.

881
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:45,284
Sure, what's going on?

882
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,417
I was reading through
those Terry files

883
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,451
that Danny asked for.

884
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:51,518
Why?

885
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:53,417
It's ancient history.

886
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:55,417
Well, he died
on our watch.

887
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,384
Something
always seemed weird,

888
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,117
and now people are
asking for these files.

889
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:02,284
Where's this comin'
from?

890
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:05,217
What happened
that night?

891
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:07,451
You were there. You know what
happened. Two-time shot...

892
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,618
you're not tellin'
me everything.

893
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:10,251
Of course I am!

894
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:12,251
No. No, you're not.

895
00:43:12,317 --> 00:43:13,518
He was my friend.

896
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:14,950
I'm your friend.

897
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:17,017
Tell me. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

898
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:19,151
You lied to me!
Don't lie to me!

899
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:20,884
What are you doin'?
Stop!

900
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,584
What just happened?

901
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,284
Uh...
where's the sound?

902
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:27,518
I'm working.
I'm working.

903
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:32,984
I.A.D. Has me wired, all
right? I just disconnected it.

904
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,417
I.A.D. Has me wired. They're
watching us right now.

905
00:43:36,484 --> 00:43:37,817
They busted me
with some heroin,

906
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:39,950
and they're talking
prison if I don't do this.

907
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,783
What else?

908
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,783
I've been protecting you
all day.

909
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,417
They're gunning
for all of us.

910
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,351
Some I.A.D. Player
and Aceveda.

911
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:52,683
I've got to make a decision,
and I've got to make it quick.

912
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,717
Why's it even
a question?

913
00:43:57,783 --> 00:44:00,551
Because I think
you're lying to me.

914
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:01,984
I'm not.

915
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,650
Then you look me in the eye

916
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:06,184
and you tell me the truth
about Terry.

917
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,184
If I don't believe you,

918
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:10,950
I'm gonna start
lookin' out for myself.

919
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:13,683
No, listen, Lem. Don't
buy into their bullshit.

920
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,017
Tell me... the truth.

921
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:16,351
We're a team.

922
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:17,717
Yeah, that Terry
was a part of once.

923
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,650
Come on. Come on.

924
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:23,584
Now tell me.

925
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,584
How can you even
ask me that?

926
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,551
They told me Terry was working
with the feds to bring us down.

927
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:32,783
Now answer me, OK? You look me
in the eye, you tell me the truth.

928
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,850
If we're really
a team, man,

929
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:37,384
tell me the truth
already!

930
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:45,618
Oh, my God.

931
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,650
Lem, we're in this
together, right?

932
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:49,017
I need to go.

933
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:51,417
We're... we're...
everything's fine.

934
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:53,184
Where you going?
We gotta talk.

935
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,351
I need to go.

936
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:55,417
Don't!

937
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,783
Where... is... the sound?

938
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,850
It's gotta be his mic.

939
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:00,950
Lem!

940
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,417
Lem!
