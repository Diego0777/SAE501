we don't disagree on...

26

in a short stay on death row.

27

Even so, brass'll never sign off on us
undercutting a D.E.A. investigation.

28

Aceveda only visited
Antwon one time.

- Aceveda visited another inmate
before that though.

- Juan Lozano.

- You mean who was that.

then got busted by him for armed robbery.

- Took a 40-pound dumbbell

He lost his juice up in Terminal Island.

made his deal with the D.E. A...

And they're presumed innocent.

prescription meds out of that house.

Give me the name of the kid dealing,
and I'll handle it.

We're seizing the Walkers' house.

- If you won't shut it down, I will.

00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:08,222
but, uh, I can't leave my partner.

665
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,631
I'm more valuable
to you on the street.

666
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,635
Well, I'd like you upstairs.

667
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:18,572
To be honest, if you think
I'm the kind of guy you're looking for...

668
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:20,736
you've made a mistake.

669
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,280
I'm sorry.

670
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,260
What was that about?

671
00:44:37,362 --> 00:44:40,763
He asked me to be
the company yes-man jellyfish.

672
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:44,302
I told him to shove it.

673
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:47,496
Sometimes you have to take
the moral high ground.

674
00:44:47,606 --> 00:44:49,506
One day you'll understand.

675
00:44:57,816 --> 00:45:00,250
Uh, we're all heading over toJamie's...

676
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:05,187
to celebrate nailing Antwon
and closing Carl and Scooby's case.

677
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,485
Wanna join?

678
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,555
/'m sure we could all use a few.

[Chattering Continues]

688
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:48,624
- You want a beer?
- Uh, no. I'm still on pain medication.

689
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:51,964
- Anybody got a glass?
- [All Laughing]

690
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,767
Hey, hey, get 'em up.
Get 'em up! Come on!

691
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:03,072
To Carl and Scooby,
a couple of good cops.
