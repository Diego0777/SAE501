1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,168
<i>Ronnie. Ronnie. Ronnie?</i>

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,674
<i>Armadillo?</i>

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,904
<i>- Armadillo, right?
- Uh-huh.</i>

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,538
<i>No, no, no. Don't move, Ronnie.
They're comin'</i>

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,184
<i>All right,
here you go.</i>

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,354
You're gonna be okay,
Ronnie.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,013
<i>Right.</i>

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,221
<i>Don't move, buddy.</i>

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,169
- Take care of him, will ya?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,208
- We're gonna fix this, brother.
- Hang in, man.

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,515
I'm sorry
about your guy.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,951
This was Armadillo,
wasn't it?

13
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,527
<i>Are you staying
at the hotel?</i>

14
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,495
No. Vic and I were discussing
a domestic abuse case.

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,227
She's only been here a few minutes.
There's nothing she can tell you that I can't.

16
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,972
<i>- Give me a call if you need anything.
- I will.</i>

17
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,641
Jesus.

18
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,443
What is it with this guy
and burning?

19
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,984
First, traces of flesh
on the stove burners at his house.

20
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,221
Now this.

21
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,288
Armadillo
was looking for you.

22
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,153
I know.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,157
<i>Trust me.
One of ours?</i>

24
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,956
I'm gonna help you
take care of it.

25
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,700
Claudette, don't take this
the wrong way...

26
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,165
but I don't need your help.

27
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,070
We gotta find Armadillo before somebody
matches his face up to Ronnie's.

28
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,045
How you wanna
handle this?

29
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,549
The way we should've weeks ago...
flush out every shithole in the
barrio until we find this prick.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,881
- Sounds like a plan.
- Then we end it.

31
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,752
Once and for all.

32
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,260
- Vic.
- Hey, no speeches.

33
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,727
Armadillo burned my guy.
I'm gettin' him.

34
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,663
I just talked
to the hospital.

35
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,269
Looks like they're gonna
be able to graft most of Ronnie's face.

36
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,637
Thanks.

37
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,541
I'm gonna contact Justice, bring in
a surveillance team to watch your back.

38
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,247
- You wanna baby-sit us?
- No, I just wanna keep you alive.

39
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,212
We can take care
of ourselves.

40
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,114
The last thing either one of us needs
is the feds thinking that we can't.

41
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,380
Just let us do
what we do... sir.

42
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,287
Hey, you didn't see Ronnie.

43
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,792
I can imagine.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,089
<i>Okay.</i>

45
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,440
All right, pull 15, 20 grand
from the retirement fund.

46
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,376
We're gonna need to grease some greasers
to get to Armadillo.

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,712
Does this mean you're giving us back
our keys?

48
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,218
We won't let you down.

49
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,511
I went to see Ronnie.
He made a preliminary statement.

50
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,775
- It's enough to put an all-points
out for Armadillo.
- Good.

51
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,782
- Where's Mackey?
- He's trying to flush out Armadillo.

52
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,880
You turned him loose
on this guy?

53
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,356
One of his guys was maimed last night.
He wants to be involved.

54
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,791
I know he's involved.
How involved are you?

55
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,760
- Excuse me?
- With Mackey.

56
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,525
I see what's in it for him.
What's in it for you?

57
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,499
Stop looking for conspiracies
that don't exist.

58
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,434
Just investigate
Ronnie's attack.

59
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,481
<i>You're taking T& A
to a whole new level, Van Bro.</i>

60
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,279
Inner-city realism wasn't sellin'.
People like to be titillated.

61
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,515
- Ain't that the truth.
- What you need, Mackey?

62
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,246
- One of my guys got hurt last night.
- Damn. Dangerous times, man.

63
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,956
- Who did it?
- Armadillo.

64
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,186
I been hearin' some impressive things
about that Mexican.

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,092
Impressive how?

66
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,095
Word is he don't trust
L.A. talent.

67
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,532
He's shipping his own folks
from Mexico City to run the consolidation.

68
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,534
Some smart-ass C.E.O.

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,175
Here. I want you to spread this around
and spread the word.

70
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,574
I'm willing to pay for info
on Armadillo.

71
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,836
All I need's a location.

72
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,778
I'll do my thing, baby.

73
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,780
<i>You do that.</i>

74
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,687
Ready for
the big day?

75
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,485
Oh, yes. I picked up the rings this morning.
I'm glad you're coming.

76
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,855
Wouldn't miss it.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,262
<i>Julien.</i>

78
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,026
I just wanted to tell you
in front of your training officer...

79
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,701
that, based on your six-month review
and your performance lately...

80
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,967
I've put your name in
for a P-2 promotion.

81
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,436
Really?

82
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,235
<i>- Thank you.
- Good work.</i>

83
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,172
Keep it up.

84
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,808
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,746
Wow.

86
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,283
I'm just feeling
so blessed right now.

87
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,219
I got a great job,
a wonderful wife, a new son.

88
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,222
I just feel like God is
really looking out for me now.

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,952
If you ever meet someone,
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

90
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,269
- This way. Hurry.
- What is it, sir?

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,375
Oh, Christ.

92
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,138
<i>No, no, no. Don't touch him.</i>

93
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,310
One-Tango-13 requesting paramedics,
code three.

94
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,311
Copy, One-Tango-13.

95
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,610
- One-Tango-13, additional units requested.
- Copy that.

96
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,582
Hey,
what do you got?

97
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,584
<i>Little Pop, Los Mags O.G.</i>

98
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,689
<i>Just got out of Pelican Bay
last week...</i>

99
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,921
<i>and he is not happy about Armadillo's
power restructuring neither.</i>

100
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,993
You got the bone.
He's got the pick.

101
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,199
Yo!

102
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,804
Welcome home,
Little Pop.

103
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,374
<i>I hear you're having some problems
with your Torruco brothers.</i>

104
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,906
I had it good inside.

105
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,312
I was movin' drugs, smokes,
a little gambling.

106
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,978
I made enough to keep my mom
straight out here.

107
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,017
Armadillo moves
into Pelican Bay.

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,020
I take his ink,
kick him back his cut...

109
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,955
and then he promises me
a piece out here.

110
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,924
So I took my parole...

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,893
come on home.

112
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,895
Armadillo had
a change of heart.

113
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,037
<i>That choco. He brings up these real
Mexicans from M.C. to run things.</i>

114
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,835
Suddenly I'm a goddamn wetback
in my own country.

115
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,765
<i>Errand boy, getting beers
for these pendejos.</i>

116
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,842
No money, no respect.

117
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,316
I ain't got nothin'
out here...

118
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,284
and I'm too old
to start over.

119
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,524
I gotta get me
back inside.

120
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,430
It's gonna take me months to get back
the respect and the juice that I had.

121
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,932
I sympathize
with your situation.

122
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,436
What can you tell me?

123
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:26,145
<i>There's this wiry vato named Quazi,
works out of the back of his garage.</i>

124
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,909
He's Armadillo's personal paper boy
from down south.

125
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:33,077
<i>Prints his visas,
his green cards.</i>

126
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,278
You get him.
You get Armadillo.

127
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,190
Thanks.

128
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,794
Hey.

129
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,058
Jail's too good for him.

130
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,017
You fillin' out back orders
for Ellis Island, Quazi?

131
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,212
Where's Armadillo?

132
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,299
<i>- Put your hand in here.
- Que?</i>

133
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,334
Do it.

134
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,839
No, no, no!

135
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,841
No, no, no!
Aaah!

136
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,776
<i>Armadillo, ¿dónde está?</i>

137
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,741
<i>¿Dónde?</i>

138
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,218
<i>¿Dónde?</i>

139
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,655
Well?

140
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:51,092
He says he's in some house
in the Little Jewel.

141
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,596
We need an address,
amigo.

142
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,166
This was a message,
not a mugging.

143
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,601
Tell me about it. They left the wallet,
a watch, 50 bucks.

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,341
Witnesses?

145
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,139
That guy saw an Asian teenaged male
running down the alleyway...

146
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,346
into the back
parking lot.

147
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,144
Red hooded sweatshirt,
black pants, tennis shoes.

148
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,147
- What about the victim?
- His name's Lee Kusa.

149
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,847
<i>He's Thai national.
He's legal.</i>

150
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,954
Doesn't sound like
a gang thing.

151
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,024
Wasn't a robbery.
It's weird.

152
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,494
Cameras. Find out who they belong to,
whether or not they're working.

153
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,893
You'd better hurry. The cheap places
only have them on a one or two-hour loop.

154
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,883
Hey!

155
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,748
<i>¡Vámonos!</i>

156
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,254
Hey! Hey! Hey!

157
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,053
Get your ass down.
Down!

158
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,559
- It's okay.
- On the ground!

159
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,231
Aaah! Shit!
Holy shit!

160
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,774
Aaah!
Holy shit!

161
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,107
<i>- You all right, man?
- Crazy bitch!</i>

162
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,248
- Jesus, man!
- What?

163
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,820
Jesus God!

164
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,586
Forget the dog.
Let's go talk to the soldiers.

165
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,353
Let's go.

166
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,327
Caught the guy on camera
getting into his car. Ran the D.M.V.

167
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,330
Got a 19-year-old Asian.
Lives here.

168
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,163
- Great.
- Everybody be careful.

169
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,837
<i>Trust me,
it's not always this easy.</i>

170
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,619
Yes?

171
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,851
Uh, Detective Wagenbach.
We're looking for a Malcolm Rama.

172
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,361
He in shower,
cleaning up.

173
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,757
<i>- Where's Armadillo?
- No sé nada.</i>

174
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,835
<i>- ¿No sé nada? Go.
- All right.</i>

175
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,473
Aah!

176
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,578
Same thing for you, Juanita.
Get up. Get up!

177
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,546
Where's your boss?

178
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,219
<i>- No sé nada. No sé nada.
- Same wrong answer.</i>

179
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,878
<i>- All right, that's it. You ready?
- Hey, hey, hey!</i>

180
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,651
- He doesn't know anything.
- We're just trying to jar his memory.

181
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,850
Bring 'em back to the barn.

182
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,596
You're lucky.

183
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm looking for Vic.

184
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,308
Uh, Foster.
He's not here.

185
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:52,004
I tried calling him.
He's not answering his cell.

186
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,081
He's out making some arrests.
Probably turned it off.

187
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:56,878
Is there something
I can help you with?

188
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,782
- Someone broke into our house.
- When?

189
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,749
This morning.

190
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,551
I was dropping Matthew off
at the occupational therapist's...

191
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,526
and when I came home, um,
the police were there.

192
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,393
They broke the window,
and they set off the alarm.

193
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,269
Um, come on.
Let's talk in private.

194
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,601
Uh, Paula. You ever do
any baby-sitting?

195
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,631
I work here, don't I?

196
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,900
What's going on?

197
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,876
- Someone burned off half
of Ronnie Gardocki's face.
- What?

198
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,980
<i>- Ronnie?
- In your husband's motel room.</i>

199
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,914
We think
they were targeting him.

200
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,213
<i>- Why would somebody want to...
- Didn't Vic tell you?</i>

201
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,721
That Armadillo was greenlighting
his team?

202
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,121
Who's Armadillo?

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,057
Uh...

204
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,059
you know,
maybe it'd be easier...

205
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,359
if you answered
some of my questions first.

206
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,400
Okay.

207
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,038
Hey, I talked to Aceveda.

208
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,476
He said I can snag you for a few hours
to help with my case, if you're interested.

209
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,475
- Yeah.
- Great.

210
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,478
Heard about
your promotion snafu.

211
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,480
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

212
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,917
Maybe I can steer you
toward detective work.

213
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,021
You seem to have
a knack for it.

214
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,489
Where were you this morning
at 10:40, Malcolm?

215
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,425
Russell Park.
I run there.

216
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,360
<i>You happen to step into a puddle
of human blood at the park, Malcolm?</i>

217
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,333
You're making a mistake.

218
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,473
Maybe you didn't set out
to hurt the guy, but he's in a coma.

219
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,942
Did he disrespect you?
You dating his daughter? What?

220
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,772
<i>You're going to jail
for this...</i>

221
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,745
whether you confess
or not...

222
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:42,777
so for our own, uh, morbid curiosity,
you know, why'd you do it?

223
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,181
I didn't.

224
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,359
- We've got a problem.
- What?

225
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,326
- He could walk.
- Come on.

226
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,897
The bloody clothes?
The videotape?

227
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,367
You know how many hours the average juror
spends watching soap operas every week?

228
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,368
I don't know.
Four?

229
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,302
17.8.

230
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,305
Per week.

231
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,841
Jurors like simple stories
they can understand.

232
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,279
- He did it. We caught him.
Doesn't get simpler than that.
- But why did he do it?

233
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,214
Unless he confesses,
at trial we'll be expected to know.

234
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,185
The victim's blood runs straight out of
that kid's car right up to the front door.

235
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,790
Maybe the jury figures we planted it,
sets this guy free to caddy for O.J.

236
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,158
- But he did it.
- Until you know why,
a detective's job isn't done.

237
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,463
<i>- How long has Vic been in the motel?
- A few weeks.</i>

238
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,796
Uh, we're spending
some time apart.

239
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,673
<i>Oh.</i>

240
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,109
<i>I thought maybe he was trying to make it
safer for you and the kids.</i>

241
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,943
Does he have
a post office box?

242
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,945
<i>What?</i>

243
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,881
<i>A place where he might get mail
other than his home address.</i>

244
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,950
I don't think so.

245
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,886
<i>You ever seen any statements
from bank accounts...</i>

246
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,955
<i>that you never knew
existed...</i>

247
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,957
maybe in
a family member's name?

248
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,959
<i>No.</i>

249
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,961
Any big purchases
this year?

250
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,302
<i>- Cars? Jewelry?
- No.</i>

251
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:07,636
After Matthew's tuition,
it's all we can do just to scrape by.

252
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,904
<i>- Matthew?
- Our son.</i>

253
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,810
He's autistic.
We, um...

254
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,608
<i>We send him to a special needs school.</i>

255
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,944
How much does that cost?

256
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,946
A lot.

257
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,483
<i>On a cop's salary?</i>

258
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,451
Yeah, uh...

259
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,614
- Vic works a ton of overtime.
- Is that what he tells you?

260
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,633
Why are you asking me
about bank accounts...

261
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,669
<i>and P.O. boxes?</i>

262
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,671
I just want to find out...

263
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,174
why Armadillo's
targeting Vic's team...

264
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,212
and I wanna make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

265
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,245
Has Vic done something?

266
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,815
In you go.

267
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,522
- Step back, asshole.
- Hey.

268
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,432
Hey, is everything
cool with you?

269
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah.

270
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,073
You seem like
you're holdin' back a little bit.

271
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,713
We got a thousand eyes
on us right now.

272
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,581
Calling more attention
by cracking skulls doesn't help.

273
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,784
- You wanna change the page?
- Cassie?

274
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,759
What are you doing here,
honey?

275
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,466
- Mommy brought us.
- Why?

276
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,931
Someone
smashed our window.

277
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,934
Where's Mommy now?

278
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,702
Someone broke into the house?
Are you okay?

279
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,784
All right.

280
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,186
- Talk to me.
- Why don't you talk?

281
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,295
Somebody's trying to kill you.
They came to our house.

282
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,423
I had a security system
put in to protect you. It worked.

283
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,859
What if I'd been picking one of them
up from school?

284
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,763
I had a P.I. watching you
and the children.

285
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,769
<i>- What?
- To be safe.</i>

286
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,408
- Without telling me?
- I didn't want to scare you.

287
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,101
You just didn't want to admit
to what you've been doing.

288
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,076
What did Claudette
tell you?

289
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,079
Were you involved
with some drug dealer who died?

290
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,149
- Jesus Christ...
- Were you?

291
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,084
Sometimes
out on the street...

292
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,655
you gotta make deals
to make bigger arrests.

293
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,623
<i>Now, Claudette got you
all worked up over nothin'</i>

294
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,127
I got more truth from her
in ten minutes...

295
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,800
than I've gotten from you
in a year.

296
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:50,496
How are we paying
for Matthew's school?

297
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,406
You want me to go
find out from her?

298
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,642
I love my kids...

299
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,543
and I want
a future for them.

300
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:08,253
So right now I really need you to step up
and be on my side.

301
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,758
Mom,
did you see Daddy?

302
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,827
Yeah. You know what?
Dad's busy with work right now.

303
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,695
<i>Okay? Um...</i>

304
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,698
Maybe we'll see him later.
All right?

305
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,058
I've got a team member in the burn unit,
the guy who did it out on the street...

306
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,932
and you think now is a good time
to screw with my family?

307
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,628
I think Armadillo went to your house
looking for you, Vic.

308
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,805
<i>Lucky your wife and kids
didn't end up in the burn ward.</i>

309
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,798
- My family's off limits.
- You tell that to Armadillo.

310
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,573
I'm telling you!

311
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,384
I recommended,
weeks ago...

312
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,320
that the Justice Department provide protective
surveillance for the Strike Team.

313
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,755
They didn't want it.
It's a pride thing.

314
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,660
My report to the city council
is due next month.

315
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,333
And I'm sure you'll be
fair and accurate.

316
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,867
You wanted to see me?

317
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,869
<i>I contacted Justice.</i>

318
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,167
Starting tomorrow,
they're assigned to your team...

319
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,175
until Armadillo
is in custody.

320
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,110
- What?
- Why?

321
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,374
This is for your own good.
We can't see anyone else getting hurt.

322
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,283
- Who are you to dictate how I work?
- Excuse me?

323
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,285
Vic.

324
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,154
If I were you, I'd be careful about
the next thing you say.

325
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,690
I can't afford to be handcuffed
by some... part-timer...

326
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,626
who thinks she knows
what's right.

327
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,628
I am
a trained litigator...

328
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,393
with a master's
in criminal justice.

329
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,663
Then stay
in the classroom.

330
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,602
<i>The, uh, cripple called.</i>

331
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,604
I mean,
the handicapped... guy...

332
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,606
called.

333
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,313
Hey, Dutch.

334
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,220
<i>Dutch!</i>

335
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,621
City workers found this in a storm drain
a half a mile from the alley.

336
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,858
Looks like our weapon
to me.

337
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,326
- Prints?
- No, but there's a lot of hair and blood.

338
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,697
Check out these etchings.
They're Thai.

339
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,495
<i>I checked out the Thai cultural center
where he volunteers at.</i>

340
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,597
This was stolen from there a couple
of days ago. Maybe that'll help with motive.

341
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,701
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

342
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,707
Damn it!

343
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,709
What happened?

344
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,109
I guess the boss
must've got my memo.

345
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,047
Armadillo?

346
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,949
Dude that did this had Mexican prison ink.
Thick dialect.

347
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,986
<i>One of them imports.</i>

348
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,558
- Took my goddamn wheelchair.
How wrong is that?
- Did you get a name?

349
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,788
Better than that. Got the plate.
Blue Ford pickup truck.

350
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,731
God, Van Bro.

351
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,427
Nice work, Van Bro.
Sit tight.

352
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,699
<i>- Help is on the way.
- And a new set of wheels.</i>

353
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,106
Somethin' sporty.

354
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,749
- Hands on the wheel. Now.
- Don't even twitch, bitch.

355
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,080
- Out.
- On the head, Jose. Let's go. Let's go!

356
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,417
Get up there.

357
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,288
We're looking for Armadillo. Any tips?

358
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,459
Oh, I'm gettin' so tired
of playing this game.

359
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,230
<i>Here.</i>

360
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,067
- Here.
- Okay, okay, okay! I know where he is.

361
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,607
Lem, you ride with him.
We'll follow you.

362
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,575
Enjoy the wheelchair,
asshole.

363
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,543
<i>Get in.</i>

364
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,718
He was in line.

365
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:03,017
Guy behind him sprayed something
in his face with an aerosol can.

366
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,223
Looked like bug spray.

367
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:08,021
- Was there an argument?
- Well, he always takes forever to order.

368
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,024
So, uh, so aerosol guy
wanted him to hurry up.

369
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,027
When he didn't, the dude said,
"You're buggin' me."

370
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,393
Psst... right in the eyes.
Took off that way.

371
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,898
- I was just trying to order.
- Every day you hold up my goddamn line.

372
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,531
- I was reading the menu!
- Hot dogs, hamburgers. That's it, you idiot!

373
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,507
Hey!

374
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,203
- Jerk-off!
- Homo! Goddamn it!

375
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,218
- You married?
- Yeah.

376
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,754
- I'm gettin' ready
to take the plunge myself.
- Good for you.

377
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,156
<i>- You got any kids?
- Yeah, I got a boy.</i>

378
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,093
You don't want him
to see you in jail, do you?

379
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,095
- No.
- Good.

380
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,567
So, tell me about
the guy who sprayed you.

381
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,268
He's on the top floor.
Back unit.

382
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,135
He says Armadillo's got a few guys,
and they're probably packing.

383
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,743
Get the collaterals out of here.
Take the truck, cover the back.

384
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,861
¿Qué pasa?

385
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,624
You, uh, know much
about Thai culture, Malcolm?

386
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,765
I'm not really into
my roots.

387
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,569
Yet you volunteer at the Thai
cultural center two nights a week.

388
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,465
It's a good place
to meet girls.

389
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,440
<i>Yeah.</i>

390
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,637
And to, uh, pick up
antique artifacts.

391
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,083
This was stolen from there
a couple of days ago...

392
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,887
from a room
you had access to.

393
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,983
<i>You see these, uh,
ornate little symbols?</i>

394
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,027
They represent, uh...

395
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,862
"fertility, family,
bloodlines."

396
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,797
Okay.

397
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,801
<i>- How come you never asked his name?
- Who?</i>

398
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,998
The old man you beat up.
You wanna hear it?

399
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,939
<i>His last name was Kusa.</i>

400
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,910
Came over from Thailand a couple of years ago.
Kusa. Am I pronouncing that right?

401
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,912
<i>- I guess.
- How would you say it?</i>

402
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,575
- I wouldn't.
- So you won't even say his name.

403
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,780
<i>We drop smoke,
head in the front door.</i>

404
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,291
Armadillo runs out the back,
Lem's there waiting.

405
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,295
Let's go. Go...

406
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,898
Wait a minute.

407
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,794
What the hell is this?

408
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,375
- What's goin' on?
- I'm unarmed!

409
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,478
He called,
gave himself up!

410
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,481
- Is that so?
- Turn around.

411
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,086
Looks like he saw
the writin' on the wall.

412
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,592
<i>Somebody did a job
on his face.</i>

413
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,528
Well, it's an ugly world.

414
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,325
More and more.

415
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,296
I was attacked
by the bug spray guy.

416
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,305
- When?
- Three days ago.

417
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,307
I got your partner's card
from the hot dog stand.

418
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,640
About the man who was attacked
with bug spray... he got me too.

419
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,880
Serial sprayer?
That's weird.

420
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,882
It's kind of a dumb case.

421
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,884
He is hurting people,
but...

422
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,886
<i>No, same principle
as a killer.</i>

423
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,618
Driven by inadequacy
and frustration.

424
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,027
One acts out with insecticide,
the other with deadly force.

425
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,163
Why don't you run with it?

426
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,098
<i>- Me?
- We're swamped today.</i>

427
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,601
Be a while before a detective
can look into it.

428
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,832
<i>- I don't know.
- Sure you do. You've got great instincts.</i>

429
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,772
Really?

430
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,243
Calling the cultural center
about that scepter?

431
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,211
I think it's gonna be
the key to finding motive.

432
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,383
Bug spray guy's yours,
right?

433
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,382
Yeah.

434
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,885
Where would you start?

435
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,254
Both attacks took place
within a couple blocks.

436
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,927
<i>- He probably lives within the area.
- Good.</i>

437
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,863
I could call the drug stores,
hardware places...

438
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,433
<i>see if anyone matching our description
bought any bug spray lately.</i>

439
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,402
Sounds like
detective work to me.

440
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,606
<i>Come on, Claudette.
Let me go inside with you, back you up.</i>

441
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,609
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't need the help.

442
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,611
We both been
working this case.

443
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,684
- Between what you and I know,
we can trip him up.
- I'm gonna try this alone.

444
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,290
If you can't
make up your mind...

445
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,860
I'll ask Lanie
to make the call.

446
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,198
Give her
the facts of the case.

447
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,143
You've got a lot of your plate.
Where'd you find the time?

448
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,110
Drug trafficking...

449
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,647
consolidating a Mexican power base,
murder.

450
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,911
Am I leaving anything out?

451
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,419
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

452
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,682
Juvenile rape.

453
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,522
So you say.

454
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:14,095
<i>Let's hope that genius I.Q.
means you know how to help yourself.</i>

455
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,701
<i>We've got you on tape
making a death threat.</i>

456
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,498
<i>That could be anyone's voice.</i>

457
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,633
I'll challenge it in court.

458
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,299
What about the testimony of a cop
with his own grill mark?

459
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,344
You gonna challenge that too?

460
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,809
What happened to your face?

461
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,009
You used to be
so pretty.

462
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,052
I'll only
give my confession...

463
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,279
to Detective Mackey.

464
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,721
You don't make demands.
Not to me.

465
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,989
I speak to Mackey...

466
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,995
or my lawyer.

467
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,823
I want to talk alone.

468
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,737
The first few weeks
are the worst.

469
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,211
<i>Then the skin gets hard.</i>

470
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,045
The stinging goes away.

471
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,049
It's time for me to leave.

472
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,451
You should have left
when I gave you the chance.

473
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,857
My business here is done.

474
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,825
Everything's in place.

475
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,430
Now you're going to
help me get home.

476
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,999
<i>- Help you?
- You have no choice.</i>

477
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,899
The second you did this to me,
you gave me control.

478
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,471
So, unless you and your men
want a cell next to mine...

479
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,339
<i>you'll do what I say.</i>

480
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,035
<i>Get your man
to recant his statement...</i>

481
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,308
and get me out of here
long enough to cross the border...

482
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,247
we'll call it even.

483
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,511
What about
the people you burned...

484
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,451
and that little girl
you raped?

485
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,385
Sometimes...

486
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,389
life isn't fair.

487
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,841
You wanted me to hurt you.

488
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,075
Every scar is a victory.

489
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,283
This is just my biggest.

490
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,295
What'd he say?

491
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,297
He just wanted
to gloat.

492
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,299
Guess it's my turn.

493
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,369
He wants to
see his lawyer.

494
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,998
The interrogation's over.

495
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,714
Oh, there he is.

496
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,151
Excuse me.

497
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,723
- Mr. Jarvis Stanley?
- Yeah.

498
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,052
<i>- Let me see your hands.
- Why?</i>

499
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,289
I said
let me see your hands.

500
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,965
Put your hands on top of your head
and step away from the car.

501
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,350
<i>Got a pest problem.
It's illegal to carry bug spray?</i>

502
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,786
It is when you're trying
to blind people with it.

503
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,984
They were all buggin' me.

504
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,680
Ahh. It's not like
I killed anyone.

505
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,656
Actually, it's an assault
with a deadly weapon.

506
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,659
Bug spray's poison.
That's a felony.

507
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,957
<i>Now you're
startin'to bug me.</i>

508
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,568
<i>- He's got me.
- No.</i>

509
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,037
No way.
This does not end like this.

510
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,507
He's gonna play
the brutality card...

511
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,442
if I don't get Ronnie to recant
and set him loose.

512
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,512
<i>- Then that's what we gotta do.
- No.</i>

513
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,514
I couldn't look Ronnie
in the eye.

514
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,551
I did this.

515
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,363
I'll take all the heat,
make sure you guys get a pass.

516
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,096
Come on.
You could be lookin' at jail time.

517
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,533
I barely saw my kids
today.

518
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,814
I'm gonna go
give 'em a call.

519
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,256
What are we gonna do?

520
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,725
What are we gonna do,
Shane?

521
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,727
I'm thinkin'.

522
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,729
God!

523
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,799
Shit!

524
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,408
- Where we goin'?
- To make a deal.

525
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,781
<i>Your family comes from the area in northern
Thailand known as the Hilltribe region...</i>

526
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,754
known for its
tribal wars.

527
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:14,157
In fact, your family's been feuding
with another clan for over 800 years.

528
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,585
- Not me.
- Rape.

529
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,218
Torture. Genocide.

530
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,456
<i>That's a pretty gnarly
family tree.</i>

531
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,658
<i>The other family's name
is Kusa.</i>

532
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,565
And now I know why
you beat him into a coma.

533
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,865
<i>And now a jury's
gonna know it too.</i>

534
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,644
<i>My dad was pissed.</i>

535
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,946
Your dad.

536
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:44,247
Old guy comes into the center
and signed the guest book... Kusa.

537
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,091
So I told my dad,
you know, as a joke.

538
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,631
But he went crazy.

539
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:57,226
Starts talking about killing this guy,
like, really killing him.

540
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,800
So I figure...

541
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,599
I'd scare Kusa away first...

542
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,735
act like I was protecting
the family name or whatever.

543
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,944
Get him to leave
the neighborhood.

544
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,677
And the scepter was to...
drive the point home.

545
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,147
<i>I followed him outside the center,
and I told him who I was.</i>

546
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,757
Before I could say anything...

547
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,759
the old freak
spits in my face.

548
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,526
He starts whaling on me,
screaming at me in Thai.

549
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,304
I only hit him back
to protect myself.

550
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,841
He was half dead,
hanging from a pole.

551
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,173
That's a pretty tough sell
for self-defense.

552
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,305
It was, at first.

553
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,414
But something happened
to me.

554
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,879
Blood.

555
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,925
I never stood up
for my family before.

556
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,122
I know it was wrong...

557
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,535
but somehow it made sense.

558
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,411
Yo, what'd he do?

559
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,880
The guy walked right past us
smokin' weed.

560
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,284
We didn't want to haul him in,
but we asked him to put it out...
blew smoke right in our face.

561
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,550
Idiot.

562
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,295
- Now we know the "why."
- Yeah.

563
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,666
And I couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks.

564
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,606
You know, up until now I was really
focused on getting ahead on the street.

565
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,574
But after seeing
the whole detective angle...

566
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,771
I don't know, it just kinda
felt like we were partners.

567
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,440
There was a real connection there.
Good back and forth.

568
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,416
- Yeah.
- You were great.

569
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,146
Thanks.

570
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,553
What?

571
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,733
Um, K... Uh, Kim's making me dinner tonight.
I've got to, uh...

572
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,665
I have a lot of...
Oh, shit.

573
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,439
What's going on?

574
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,509
- Oh, my God.
- What?

575
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,241
I just...

576
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,213
I almost kissed Dutch.

577
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,215
Oh, my God.
Why?

578
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,686
I don't know. It was a momentary lapse.

579
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,687
Was he devastated?

580
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,690
<i>No. He's the one that
pulled away from me.</i>

581
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,193
- Oh, my God.
- I know. Shoot me.

582
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,792
Keys!
Give me the keys!

583
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,461
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
Get away from him! Hey, hey!</i>

584
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,436
<i>Hey, hey!
Get off of him!</i>

585
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,805
<i>Hands up!
Hands up, everybody!</i>

586
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,748
<i>Watch the knife!
Call a medic!</i>

587
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,543
<i>I'm calling!</i>

588
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,387
<i>On the wall.</i>

589
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,425
<i>Let's search 'em nicely.
Let's go.</i>

590
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,391
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

591
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,622
Who searched that guy?

592
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,824
- I did.
- How could you miss a knife that size?

593
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,698
<i>It wasn't on him when I frisked him
after the arrest.</i>

594
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,963
Upstairs.

595
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,644
Nope.

596
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,159
What happened?

597
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,097
Los Mag O.G.
with a grudge.

598
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,633
Stabbed him nine times.
Won't say why.

599
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,532
Jesus.

600
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,505
Come on, let's go.

601
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,307
Unbelievable, huh?

602
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,829
Armadillo Quintero.

603
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:22,128
I thought maybe you might like that
for your personal files.

604
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,729
This case is closed.
File it where it belongs.

605
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,670
You wanna know
what I think happened?

606
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,807
Vic was Tio's drug landlord,
gave him protection.

607
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,010
Tio gave him favors
and a cut of the business.

608
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,447
When Armadillo killed Tio,
Vic fried his face on the grill...

609
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,553
and that's why he didn't
want me to find him.

610
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,127
Why'd you get in my way?

611
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,999
I made a mistake.

612
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,430
You just now
realizing that?

613
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,371
Oops, sorry.

614
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,957
I heard
about your suspension.

615
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,458
I searched that guy
from head to toe.

616
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,395
<i>Call your P.B.A. rep.</i>

617
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,966
Get your side of the story
on record.

618
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,368
Is all of this a joke, Vic?

619
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,700
<i>- What?
- Everything.</i>

620
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,442
Everything that's
happening to me lately.

621
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,980
You're a good cop, Danny.

622
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,821
I miss you.

623
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,292
I know.

624
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,329
I just can't act on that
right now.

625
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,229
Right.

626
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,349
Did you get 'em
to sleep?

627
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,922
I got a guy to replace
the window tomorrow.

628
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,889
I've got things to do
tomorrow.

629
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,858
I'll have 'em call ahead,
make sure you're at home.

630
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,464
Just leave me his number.
I'll take care of it myself.

631
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,499
Okay.

632
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,402
Listen, I... I gotta have
more time with the kids.

633
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,475
Not just dinners. I... I need some mornings,
some weekends.

634
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,150
Hey, they're my kids too. If I wanna
see them more, I'm gonna see them.

635
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:57,553
You can't even spend three dinners a week,
and now you want more time?

636
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,853
Goddamn it,
don't do this.

637
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,259
I'm gonna make more time.
Okay?

638
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,828
I gotta get back to basics.

639
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,130
Start by bein'
a good dad again.

640
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,373
<i>- You can't promise them that.
- I'm serious.</i>

641
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,345
I gotta make some changes.

642
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,722
Leave the number
for the window guy.

643
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,725
Little Pop heads back
to Pelican Bay...

644
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,660
where he has more respect and business
than he ever did before.

645
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,098
We're gonna cover his mom's expenses
until after the sentencing.

646
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,837
I'll never forget
what you guys did for me.

647
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,274
Don't worry.
We won't let you.

648
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,946
Tell Ronnie
I'll see him tomorrow.

649
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,880
Enjoy the painting.

650
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,783
Not a problem.

651
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,220
Take it easy.
Night, boss.

652
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,204
We both know...

653
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,770
<i>what happened to Ronnie...</i>

654
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,845
that's on you.

655
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,948
It's all on you.

656
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,010
<i>- Yeah.
- You sure?</i>

657
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,987
That's him.
