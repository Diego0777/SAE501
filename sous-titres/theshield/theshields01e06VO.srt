1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,694
Christ, how old is this one, 13?

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,368
Man.

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,107
Hooker?
Face down like the other four?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,779
Looks that way.
I warned you about this guy.

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,280
Yes, you did.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:22,285
Couple up the hill saw a green car
cruising back and forth an hour ago.

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,653
They get a model?
Just said it was green.

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,487
And the driver?
Too dark.

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,992
Car had a busted taillight.

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,426
What side?
Didn't say.

11
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,827
Go back. Grill them.

12
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,330
Every detail.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,067
This happened on our turf.

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,767
You give me the resources, I'll get this guy.

15
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,098
What kind of resources?

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,165
Every warm body you can spare
for as long as possible.

17
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,675
- Personnel is stretched thin as it is.
- I need 48 hours.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,738
I can't do it.

19
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,876
A predator was standing right here
less than two hours ago.

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,455
How committed are we to catching him?

21
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,825
For the next 24 hours,
she's your one and only case.

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,989
Medical examiner tells us...

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,000
...the victim is approximately
12 to 14 years of age.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,797
A 12- to 14-year-old hooker.

25
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,963
Frank, you and your boys
round up every pimp and pro you can find.

26
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,472
Bring 'em here for me to talk to.

27
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,409
Neighbor saw a green car pass by
an hour before the body was found.

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,378
The right rear taillight was broken.

29
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,315
Check in with every gas station, car wash,
valet guy in the neighborhood.

30
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,682
June, put together a reward flyer.

31
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,280
Photo of the girl, description of the car,
mention the broken taillight.

32
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,553
She had keys in her purse.
Vic, you and your guys find a locksmith.

33
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,093
See if you can track the numbers.

34
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,152
- Excuse me?
- Sit down with a locksmith.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,290
You want me,
I'll be out finding the prick who did this.

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,628
Come on.

37
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,999
Either we get our unsub
in the next 24 hours...

38
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,838
...or we probably don't get another chance
until he kills again.

39
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,601
Let's go.

40
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,110
Vic!

41
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,044
Yes, Herr Wagenbach?

42
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,709
You got a problem with me running
the show, take the night off.

43
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,948
- I thought you wanted this case solved.
- I do.

44
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,718
No. You only care about
being the one who solves it.

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,626
When I do, I don't want it thrown out of
court because of your Gestapo tactics.

46
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,425
Let's get something straight, Dutch.

47
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,626
Somebody comes into my backyard
and kills a girl, I get involved.

48
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,532
I'll crack this case with or without you.

49
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,070
Looks like it'll have to be with.

50
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,003
This investigation runs through me.

51
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,268
You find something,
you report it immediately.

52
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,436
I bring the guy in,
you'll be the first to know, Dutch boy.

53
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,281
People see me as a joke around here.

54
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,916
They don't know the real me.

55
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,189
I'm not sure the squad's
ready for the real you.

56
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,595
- I'm not a joke.
- I know that.

57
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,428
Now they'll know it, too.

58
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,459
I'm gonna get this guy!

59
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,562
It's a little early in the game
to be making promises, isn't it?

60
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,608
The one thing they respect is success.

61
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,735
I guess we'd better nail this guy then.

62
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,279
What do we got?

63
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,642
Body found at midnight...

64
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,510
...green car seen in the park at 11:00.

65
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,611
The victim has no identification.

66
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:13,385
Prostitute. Age 12 to 14.
Had a sweet tooth.

67
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,594
Had birth-control pills.

68
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:19,026
They don't make 12-year-olds
like they used to.

69
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:25,531
I was wondering what was going on
with the whole Strike Team thing.

70
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:27,970
The apartment turned up empty for cocaine.

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,940
We have no hard proof of Mackey's guilt.

72
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,671
That doesn't mean Vic and his guys
didn't steal the drugs.

73
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,704
- I know, but without hard evidence...
- I saw them pocket the cocaine.

74
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,615
You can get the car thief to testify
she found the coke.

75
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,915
It's not that easy.
Why not?

76
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,881
Because I'm not gonna put you in a position
to carry that weight.

77
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,926
But you want Mackey off the streets.

78
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:51,451
More than you know, which is why I won't
let you be the one to do it.

79
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,931
- Captain, I don't understand.
- Exactly. You don't understand.

80
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,499
So take my advice and let this go.

81
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,629
Captain, I saw them...
Julien.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,766
Let this go.

83
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:11,247
- How you doing?
- Been working my ass off.

84
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,851
- Might be time to take a vacation.
- I can't afford to.

85
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,483
Had to drop my price.

86
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,693
- Why?
- Would you pay top dollar for this?

87
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,058
I guess it could be worse.

88
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,399
Found her a few hours ago.
Know who she is?

89
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,133
Looks like the girl who works kitty-corner
from Tracy.

90
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:38,335
- Where?
- Across from the burrito joint.

91
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,241
Know who pimps her out?

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,504
No.

93
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,474
But Tracy would.

94
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,812
Thanks.

95
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:55,584
This guy has a thing for working girls.
Make sure somebody's watching your back.

96
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,188
- I thought that's what you did.
- I don't want to see you get hurt again.

97
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,633
I won't let it happen twice.

98
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,863
Does anyone know who this girl is?

99
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,839
Look at it! Who knows her?

100
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,174
That's Sally.

101
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,475
Sally who?

102
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,513
Sally Struthers?

103
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:24,481
- All in the Family.
- I know who Sally Struthers is.

104
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,382
Maybe she saw one of those
"Save the Kids" ads.

105
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,518
Whatever, that's the name she went by.

106
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,723
Good news is,
our timeline's starting to come into focus.

107
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,963
Her friends said Sally usually started
her shift around 10:00...

108
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,899
...but didn't show last night.

109
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,571
Another one said she saw her
going into a drugstore on Vermont...

110
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,933
...at 7:00 p.m.

111
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,173
When you're a young girl on a Friday night,
what would you do between 7:00 and 10:00?

112
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,739
Shop. Eat. See a movie.

113
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,284
Jim Wright, FBI.

114
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,513
Someone called the Bureau
asking for assistance?

115
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:59,751
I did. Dutch Wagenbach. You got here fast.
This is my partner, Claudette Wyms.

116
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,292
Good to meet you.

117
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
So...

118
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,287
We've got an unsub killing hookers.

119
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:09,096
Been there. Done that.

120
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,659
This girl was only 12, 13.

121
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,496
You did the right thing calling us.

122
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:17,440
Most local cops are afraid we're gonna
come in, step all over their toes.

123
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,977
Not me. I can't wait to pick your brain.

124
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,740
Let me be clear.

125
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,313
This is your case.

126
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,449
I'm just here to help.

127
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,555
What are you boys chewing?
A little grilled Snoopy, side of Woodstock?

128
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,227
We're clean.

129
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,894
- Think about tryin' a rib eye?
- What do you want?

130
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,457
- You remember your friend Sally?
- Nope.

131
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,969
- Really? Never pimped her out?
- Nope.

132
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,472
- You know absolutely nothing?
- Less than nothing.

133
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,338
Really? So that apartment
over on Weston...

134
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,605
...where you keep all that
fenced electronics...

135
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,340
...you don't remember that either.

136
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,106
What do you say,
you wanna make Robbery Division's day?

137
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,651
Yeah, sounds sweet.
Very sweet.

138
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:05,520
I'll call in the warrant.
Lady, where's the phone?

139
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,520
It's over there.
Yeah, okay.

140
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,197
- Yeah, you were pimping her out?
- She came to us. We did her a favor.

141
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,032
- So you never took a cut?
- 20 percent.

142
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,733
Plus a few free pokes a week.

143
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,567
Wipe those smiles off your faces, shitheads.

144
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:29,375
You don't score points with me
bagging 12-year-olds.

145
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,475
What kind of work she do
before tricking for you?

146
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:37,386
I heard she'd worked this sex club.

147
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:38,613
She was a kid.

148
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,251
So?

149
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,725
So what kind of work could she do
for a sex club?

150
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:46,831
- You'll have to ask them.
- Don't worry. I will.

151
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:49,797
I'm impressed you were able
to pick up on this guy.

152
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:54,804
I've done a lot of research on criminology,
behavioral science unit.

153
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:56,032
It shows.

154
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,405
Dutch!

155
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:02,545
I got a gas station attendant here who says
he might have seen your green car.

156
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:08,342
Detective, I got a guy who saw our flyer.
Said he sold drugs to the victim earlier.

157
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,444
Gotta love it when a case gets warm.

158
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,849
So I'm working,
and I see this suspicious white guy.

159
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,186
Suspicious how?

160
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:16,851
He was white.

161
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,964
So I go out to get a good look at him,
and he turned away.

162
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,828
The dude didn't want me to see his face.

163
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,232
- Tell me about the car.
- It was green.

164
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:28,200
Two-door, four-door? Ford, Chevy?

165
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,141
You do work in a gas station, right?

166
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,133
I just run the register.

167
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,608
You sold Sally drugs tonight?

168
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,169
She had a thing for ecstasy.

169
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:39,148
You're admitting to a crime.

170
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:43,581
I'm a minor.
My lawyer can argue it's for personal use.

171
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,116
Was Sally for personal use, too?

172
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,652
She was a customer.

173
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,927
Did you know she was a prostitute?

174
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,859
How do you think she paid me?

175
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:59,899
- I hooked her up with five hits around 8:30.
- Five? She always buy that much?

176
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,734
Said it got her through the night. So...

177
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,931
- How much is this reward?
- Reward?

178
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,803
"For useful information."

179
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,438
You know, like the flyer said.
That's why I'm here.

180
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,614
So what's my reward?

181
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:16,015
Dealing drugs to a minor, statutory rape.

182
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,849
- How does six months to a year sound?
- What?

183
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,021
No license plate?
Better, I got evidence.

184
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:25,527
- He paid with a credit card?
- No, man, cash.

185
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,826
See, he paid with $20 at the
automatic teller. He only pumped $17.

186
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,730
He never came back for his change.

187
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,598
Who doesn't want their $3 change?

188
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:34,500
So you kept the $20?

189
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:38,371
No, that was part of my night deposit.
I saved his change, though.

190
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:41,874
- You saved $3 in change?
- Yeah, you can dust 'em for fingerprints.

191
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:45,047
- But he never touched them.
- No, but it's his $3.

192
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,313
That's gotta help somehow, right?

193
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,020
Captain, we've got a problem.
What?

194
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,650
The toilets in the women's bathroom
aren't working.

195
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:58,695
- What do you mean not working?
- They're clogged.

196
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:00,757
Don't look at me.

197
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:03,833
- So, we have no working toilets in the barn?
- Right.

198
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:06,529
- You call maintenance?
- Can't send someone 'till tomorrow.

199
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,400
- Call a plumber.
- Who's gonna pay for it?

200
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,339
Use my credit card.
Just get someone down here.

201
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,412
Buddy!

202
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,217
Imagine meeting you here.

203
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,617
Excuse me?
You remember me. Vic.

204
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,277
Your best friend from Boston?

205
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,051
I've never been to Boston.

206
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,553
Come on!

207
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:33,029
Come on, Ted.

208
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,531
You remember,
we went to high school together.

209
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:38,067
- Give me my wallet! I don't know you!
- Right.

210
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:41,764
Now you're about to tell me
you weren't about to go into that sex club.

211
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,400
- Sex club? That's a sex club?
- Yeah, Ted.

212
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,307
Members only.

213
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,474
And tonight, I'm your guest.

214
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,810
Thanks for taking me on such short notice.

215
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,877
Ted is one of our best clients.
We like to keep him happy.

216
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,317
Sounds like you do a great job of that.

217
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,217
Will you be watching
or taking part tonight, Vic?

218
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:07,195
Watching.
I like to test the waters before I jump in.

219
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,595
You'll be watching Sun-Lee tonight.

220
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,399
Excellent.

221
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,370
MRS. Afterwards,
we have tapes if you're interested.

222
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,168
I'm sure I will be.

223
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,336
I won't pull any punches. She's critical.

224
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:26,741
She? You mean the pipes?

225
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,786
You eat well? Get a physical once a year?

226
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,822
- Flush out your pipes regularly?
- I see where you're going.

227
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,688
Right, maintaining a healthy
sewage system is no different.

228
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,660
- Can you get them working or not?
- I'll see what I can do.

229
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:42,759
Why have you been making noises
about contacting IAD?

230
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,430
- Who told you that?
- You think word wouldn't get out?

231
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:47,970
It was just a question.

232
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,505
Why do you want IAD?

233
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,268
'Cause I saw something.

234
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,040
- Saw what?
- You don't want to know.

235
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:57,706
Forget about the "what," then.
Who are you talking about?

236
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,806
You know what?
I'm not talking about anyone.

237
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:02,044
The more I say,
the less people wanna listen.

238
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,144
People here prefer to cover things up...

239
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,712
...and hope I'll just shut up and go away.

240
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,287
What about my wallet?

241
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:22,562
I ever see you within five blocks of here,
your wife will get a very unpleasant call.

242
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:23,793
Screw!

243
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,537
Hello?
Yo, Billy.

244
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,607
It's Vic. I'm sorry to call you so late.

245
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:33,040
Look, I got a probable cause
for a no-knock warrant.

246
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:37,545
- What was that all about?
- I saw what I saw. I just can't let it lie.

247
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:40,174
Goddamn it.
You don't know what you're doing here.

248
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,617
- I know right from wrong, Captain.
- I told you to let this go.

249
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,281
I may answer to you,
but I also have to answer to God.

250
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:50,053
And I will never be at peace with Him
or myself if I turn my back on this.

251
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,960
You think you really want to do this?

252
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,989
Because here's what's gonna happen.
Most cops here will treat you like a traitor.

253
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,865
You're gonna take more shit
than you've ever taken before!

254
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:03,461
You're gonna be testifying
against Vic Mackey, and trust me...

255
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,804
...he doesn't care if God is on your side.

256
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:08,467
Are you ready for that kind of heat?

257
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,644
I'll have to be.

258
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:14,749
Warrant! Police!
Get against the wall, hands up!

259
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,919
Down! Get on your knees right now!

260
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,888
Get down on the ground on your knees!

261
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:26,820
On your knees! Get in line!
Come on, girls! What's wrong with you?

262
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,991
Line up on your knees!
Where are the tapes?

263
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,035
Come on, hurry up!

264
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,461
Hurry up!

265
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,205
"Cherry Popper Films"?

266
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,972
Boy, you really take the cake,
don't you, lady?

267
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:44,673
Come on, back up!

268
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,179
All right then, let's go!

269
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:49,847
Come on, now.

270
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,045
Vic!

271
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,717
What do you want to do with the girl?

272
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,656
Keep her in the clubhouse for now.

273
00:14:57,094 --> 00:15:00,757
- Where the hell are Shockley and Peters?
- Robbery-homicide call.

274
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:01,955
What? Come on!

275
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,796
They're supposed to be going over
witness statements for me.

276
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,460
It's a robbery-homicide, Dutch.

277
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:10,402
Look out!

278
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,473
For God's sake!

279
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,979
Wait, get the files.
Jesus. Get my files and the Rolodex!

280
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,383
Get what you can!
Put it on your desks.

281
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,421
Come on!
Get me that other file over there!

282
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,751
Which one? This one?

283
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,349
You got a big problem with these pipes.

284
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:38,329
Just what I need.
A goddamn flood in my workspace.

285
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:42,634
I made a quick profile of our killer.
What do you got?

286
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,372
Our unsub's late 20s, early 30s.

287
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:51,247
Sporadic employment,
feels unappreciated, worthless.

288
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,782
Why does he pose them face down?

289
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,750
Symbolizes the domination he yearns for.

290
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:59,646
He's probably impotent, though.
At least with a live girl.

291
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:01,714
Dutch, we got a hit off the flyer!

292
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:06,121
Tipster says he saw a guy with Sally
in a green vehicle.

293
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,926
We get the caller's address?
Right here.

294
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:10,524
Yes.

295
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,088
Tom Ross.

296
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:41,186
The flyer said that this would be
confidential. How'd you get my address?

297
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,494
Tip line's routed through 911.

298
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,863
If this guy's a killer,
I don't want him coming after me.

299
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,462
Your name doesn't leave this room, Tom.

300
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,274
- Just tell us what you saw.
- Okay.

301
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:55,975
Basically I was out last night driving...

302
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,571
...and I was stopped at a light
behind this green car.

303
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:02,140
There was a guy driving and it seemed
that he was having a struggle...

304
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,880
...with a girl in the passenger seat.

305
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,546
The girl from the flyer?

306
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:06,848
I think so.

307
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,550
I was behind them, but...

308
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,693
...it looked weird enough
that I wrote the license plate down.

309
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:14,628
Did you notice
if one of his taillights was broken?

310
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,130
I think so.

311
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,959
Yeah.

312
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,667
Run this plate,
cross-reference with the owner.

313
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,865
Give me a DMV photo.
Computers are down.

314
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,465
- What?
- They had to unplug them due to the flood.

315
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:27,942
Goddamn it.

316
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:31,774
Then call Central, have them run
the plate number, fax over a photo.

317
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:33,372
The fax machine's unplugged, too.

318
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,442
Then send someone over to Central,
pick up the photo personally.

319
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,544
Who should I send?

320
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,181
Could you just
take care of this thing for me, please?

321
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:43,590
MRS. Each of my workers had
documentation saying they were 18.

322
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,290
From what, a cereal box?
MRS. I said, I want to see my lawyer.

323
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,368
What do you got here?
Busted an underage sex shop.

324
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,301
Looks like a cherry popper ring, too.

325
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,599
Cherry popper?

326
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:59,335
Preteen girls losing their virginity.
The filmmaker's next on my hit list.

327
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,001
What's the connection to Sally?

328
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,840
She worked there a couple of months ago.

329
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:03,880
A couple of months ago?

330
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:07,041
- How does that help me with last night?
- It doesn't.

331
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:09,779
So you've just been doing
your own thing on your own time.

332
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:13,220
Don't chew up my ass
just because your case is coming up short.

333
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,926
You couldn't give me a little goddamn help
with tracking down the victim's keys?

334
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:20,526
I was putting a teenage sex show
out of business.

335
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,428
And I'm trying to catch a killer, asshole!

336
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,465
Jesus Christ.

337
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:33,430
We gotta watch these,
find out who's behind 'em.

338
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:37,204
- Man, you gotta be kidding me.
- I know. I can't stomach this shit.

339
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,269
Yell if you find anything.

340
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:46,915
Hi, Steve.

341
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,613
I'm Detective Wagenbach.

342
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,086
What's going on? Why am I down here?

343
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,823
Your name came up
in an investigation of ours.

344
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,728
Investigation? Of what?

345
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:04,593
- Do you drive a '97 green Saturn, Steve?
- Yeah.

346
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,201
Is that a good car?

347
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:08,668
I guess, yeah.

348
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:09,801
Reliable?

349
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,376
No problems with it?

350
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,077
I had some work done on the brakes.

351
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:15,611
What about the taillights?

352
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,174
Taillights?

353
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,584
- You got any broken taillights on your car?
- No.

354
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:22,386
You sure?

355
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:24,557
I don't think so.

356
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,327
'Cause we checked your car out.

357
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,362
You checked out my car?

358
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:31,589
Why?

359
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,967
You got a broken right taillight.

360
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:37,528
Okay.

361
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:48,742
Hi.

362
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,379
What happen me now?

363
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:57,354
You get to play blackjack with Vic.

364
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,320
Not in trouble?

365
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:03,629
Only if you take me for all my money.

366
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,073
Who made you work for Mrs. Park?

367
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,476
Mrs. Park help me.

368
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:18,744
She pay ticket. $10,000.

369
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,279
She's not helping you.

370
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:23,108
She help me star in more movies.

371
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:28,712
19.

372
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,188
You understand that what you did...

373
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,692
...that's not a real movie.

374
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,293
It start, though.

375
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:43,999
15.

376
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,902
Vic is forced to hit.

377
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,405
10. That's a bust.

378
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,608
You win.

379
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:53,139
Sun-Lee win?

380
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:55,873
Yeah.

381
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:03,015
Were you popular in high school, Steve?

382
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:05,954
I had friends.

383
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:09,559
That's not really the same thing, is it?

384
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,324
You can always
find some other dork to eat lunch with.

385
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,391
Doesn't make you popular, you know?

386
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,793
Guess not.

387
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:21,004
The reason I'm curious
about your high school years is...

388
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,275
...you've got a sealed juvie record.

389
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:26,537
You're not supposed to know about that.

390
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:30,744
We know about it. We just don't know
exactly what your crime was.

391
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,617
How about clueing me in?

392
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:34,210
No.

393
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:35,687
A little embarrassing, is it?

394
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,951
Either tell me what I'm doing here,
or I'm leaving.

395
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:44,430
- I don't have to tell you anything, Steve.
- Fine. I'm going, then.

396
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:46,394
You're not going anywhere.

397
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:55,935
Sunshine. How you doing?

398
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,274
This bathroom emergency thing's
a real nightmare.

399
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:01,213
Don't worry about it.
High tide's not for a few more hours.

400
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:06,877
Listen, there's something you should...

401
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,855
Forget it.
No.

402
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:10,982
Too late. Come on.

403
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,820
- I really shouldn't.
- You're breaking my heart.

404
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:15,988
I can get fired for telling you.

405
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,861
Not if we keep it between us, sunshine.

406
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:27,841
David just had me put a call in to IAD.

407
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:31,605
IAD? Goddamn it!

408
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,576
I can't believe he would do this to you.

409
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,346
It's not me I'm worried about.
I didn't do anything.

410
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,953
I just know that your guy's
already not fitting in.

411
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,887
He makes a mistake like this...

412
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:48,022
As his training officer, I just don't want
any of that mud sticking to you.

413
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:52,096
- I'll talk to him.
- Don't be too hard. He's a good kid.

414
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,656
He means well.

415
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:55,901
He's just confused.

416
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,831
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

417
00:22:58,072 --> 00:23:01,439
- You're going to IAD about Vic?
- It is really none of your business.

418
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,500
You're my partner. It's my business.

419
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:05,773
Can we just let this rest, please?

420
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,837
Look, Vic is a great cop.

421
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:12,180
You don't testify against a fellow officer
without looking them in the eye...

422
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:13,550
...and hearing their side.

423
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:17,387
I don't know what your deal is with him,
but it doesn't change what happened.

424
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,926
You're wrong about Vic.
Give him a chance to explain...

425
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:22,121
You can't explain stealing evidence!

426
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,058
That's right, Danny.

427
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:26,531
He stole two bricks of cocaine,
and I saw him do it.

428
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,536
And whether you realize it or not,
you helped him cover it up.

429
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,799
Now stop asking me about this.

430
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:44,781
The file says you haven't held a steady job
in more than three months, Steve.

431
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:48,078
- Economy stinks.
- You must be angry.

432
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,115
Nobody likes to feel unappreciated...

433
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,717
...worthless.

434
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,522
I don't feel that way.

435
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:59,495
No, you're a powerful guy.
Where were you last night around 11:00?

436
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,894
- At home in bed.
- Anyone to corroborate that?

437
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:06,930
That I was in bed?

438
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,299
I wish.

439
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,570
You wish what?
That there was a girl in your bed?

440
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,339
That you could get it up with a girl?

441
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,677
- What are you talking about?
- What's so private...

442
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,716
...about this sealed juvie record of yours?

443
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:18,445
It's sealed.
What's hidden?

444
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,079
You're a peeping Tom? A stalker?

445
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,180
Like to kill cats? What?

446
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,559
I broke into my high school.

447
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:32,762
- I trashed the place.
- Sure, I can see that.

448
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,568
You like to destroy things, don't you?

449
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:40,437
Dutch!

450
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:44,034
We just found Sally in one of these
goddamn Cherry Popper tapes. Come on!

451
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:48,378
While your lawyer's on the way...

452
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:52,277
...we're gonna have a little screening party.

453
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,487
We're gonna watch that tape
until one of two things happens.

454
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,182
Either you're gonna tell me
everything you know about Sally...

455
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,251
...or I'm gonna have to turn it off.

456
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,160
But if I have to turn that tape off...

457
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,025
...there are no more rules in this room.

458
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:48,937
Turn it off.

459
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:00,245
I got her from Kurt Schmidt.

460
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,521
He makes the movies.

461
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,122
And how do I find Kurt?

462
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:16,965
You okay?

463
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,096
That was Sally.

464
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,174
She's a kid.

465
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,107
She was.

466
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,810
- The asshole that made her do that...
- Don't worry.

467
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,250
He's mine.

468
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,583
Good.

469
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,651
Ramirez just called in.

470
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:44,664
A 14-year-old kid saw the flyer,
says he's Sally's boyfriend.

471
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:49,192
- Why would someone do that to her?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

472
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,534
You were Sally's boyfriend?

473
00:26:53,574 --> 00:26:54,836
Yeah.

474
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:56,806
When was the last time you saw her?

475
00:26:57,945 --> 00:27:00,607
Last night. We met at this ice-cream place.

476
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:02,605
What time was that?

477
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:06,809
She left right before 10:00.
Are you sure?

478
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:10,588
Yeah, that's when her curfew is.
She has to be home by 10:00.

479
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:11,984
Where did she live?

480
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,788
I never saw her house.

481
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:17,452
She said her parents were traditional,
didn't let her have boys over.

482
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:20,459
She was your girlfriend for how long?

483
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:21,865
A few months...

484
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,403
...but it only started
getting serious last week.

485
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,836
Serious?

486
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,168
That's when she finally kissed me.

487
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:33,809
She was young, she wanted to take it slow.

488
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:37,544
Did you have any idea
what Sally did for a living?

489
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:40,683
She was a freshman, right?

490
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,953
Hi, Vic. Play cards?

491
00:27:49,696 --> 00:27:50,788
A little later.

492
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:53,958
Right now, I need you to show me the guy
who made your movie.

493
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,329
How come?

494
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,699
To help me with my case.

495
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:00,535
I helped you out, right?

496
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,866
You think you could help me out, too?

497
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,307
- Yes.
- Good.

498
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:07,744
Vic mad at Sun-Lee?

499
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,777
No. Not at you.

500
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:13,786
You should be with your family, being a kid.

501
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:16,479
Which one is he?

502
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:19,716
SUN-He.

503
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,789
That man put me in movie.

504
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:30,932
I can't talk about it.

505
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:37,974
Look, I just haven't been
a good listener or a good training officer.

506
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,174
I was scared to believe you.

507
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:46,780
- Believe him, then.
- No.

508
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:48,946
I want to believe the truth.

509
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:53,083
If you just tell me what the truth is,
I promise I'll listen.

510
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:59,598
So she's at the ice-cream store here at 9:45.

511
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,802
She heads to work at 10:00.

512
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:05,764
The fastest way to her corner's here.

513
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:09,039
Which means she was picked up
somewhere on Cassandra Street.

514
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,475
Yeah.
Forget a full confession.

515
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:15,680
All you have to do is get him to admit
he was on Cassandra at 10:00.

516
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:17,248
You get him to say that...

517
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,911
...with all the circumstantial evidence,
you got him.

518
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,648
I'll get him to say it.

519
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:25,518
Ding Dong?

520
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,753
No, thanks.

521
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,731
I think we're almost done here, Steve.

522
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:40,571
Kurt Schmidt?
Yeah?

523
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:41,699
You're under arrest.

524
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:44,403
For what, man?
Makin' movies!

525
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:49,248
- Get off me, man! I'm an editor.
- Cherry Popper movies, you sick prick.

526
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:51,079
You can't prove that.

527
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:55,381
I got tapes and witnesses, asshole.
The only question left...

528
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:59,459
...is whether you took a header
into the concrete trying to resist arrest.

529
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,924
- You got a girlfriend, Steve?
- No!

530
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:05,159
I remember my 20s.

531
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:07,130
Rough times.

532
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:10,595
Too old for the college girls,
too young for the mature ones.

533
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:15,565
- What do you mean?
- Not being able to get a date, get laid.

534
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:17,674
Pisses you off.

535
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:21,975
Aren't I, like,
entitled to a lawyer or something?

536
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,447
Entitled?

537
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:25,678
You, entitled?

538
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:31,515
What about Kitty Weir?
What about Rosita Pedrazo?

539
00:30:31,591 --> 00:30:34,355
What about Mary Esposito?
What about Sheryl Watkins?

540
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,292
What about Sally, Steve?

541
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:40,391
What were they entitled to?

542
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:41,727
Don't show me those.

543
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:45,498
You don't like looking at your own work?
Is that why you place 'em face down?

544
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:48,233
So you don't look 'em in the eye
after you kill 'em?

545
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,899
You think I killed those girls?

546
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:53,173
- I know you killed them, Steve.
- No way!

547
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:56,005
Fine.

548
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,076
Fine!

549
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,752
You didn't kill 'em.

550
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:06,388
But at least don't lie to me
about where you were last night.

551
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,790
I'm not!

552
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,196
We have a witness...

553
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,200
...who saw you in your green car...

554
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,993
...on Cassandra Street...

555
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,406
...with the broken taillight...

556
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,239
...at 10:00.

557
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,101
So don't lie to me.

558
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,911
At least tell me the truth
about this one thing.

559
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:35,212
Witness?

560
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,949
You're not talking about Tom, are you?

561
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,752
Tom?

562
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:43,987
Yeah.

563
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:46,163
Tom Ross.

564
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:48,664
Is he the one who says he saw me?

565
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:55,466
Jesus. It's Tom, isn't it?

566
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,702
This one just raised the bar.

567
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,075
Raised the bar?

568
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:02,637
For practical jokes. It's a prank, man.

569
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:07,345
We're always trying to one-up each other,
and he probably heard about these girls...

570
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,748
Dude, man,
you scared the shit out of me with that.

571
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,685
A prank?
Shit.

572
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,091
Is Tom here now? Please tell me he's here.

573
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,686
He's here.

574
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:20,630
Great. Dude, you gotta do me a favor.

575
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,497
You gotta help me get him back.

576
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,799
When you see him,
you gotta act like you're super-pissed...

577
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,465
...and tell him he's under arrest
for something.

578
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,701
Like...

579
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,678
- Obstruction of justice?
- Perfect.

580
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,236
It was just a joke, man!

581
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:38,477
The broken light?
It was on the flyer, so I broke Steve's.

582
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,418
- Do you realize what you did?
- Have a sense of humor, dude.

583
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:45,116
A little girl's killer is still out there
because you're the class clown!

584
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:46,749
Easy!

585
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:49,021
Sally's murderer is still out there...

586
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:51,393
...and I'm standing here
with my dick in my hand...

587
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,728
...because this guy
thought it would be funny...

588
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,790
...to rake his buddy over the coals.

589
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,392
All right.

590
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,168
Screw him.

591
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:03,366
- We've still got time.
- I just wasted seven hours. Gone.

592
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:07,138
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

593
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:09,975
Dutch.

594
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:13,410
You got a job to do. Do it.

595
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:19,491
Connie?

596
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,427
Jesus Christ. What happened?

597
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,057
He's the killer maybe, right?

598
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,102
He's an insurance salesman from Fresno.

599
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:42,079
- What did you do here?
- He was acting strange.

600
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,615
So you shot him?

601
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:45,706
I didn't want him to hurt me.

602
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:48,345
- How much you been smokin'?
- No.

603
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:51,055
You gotta help me, Vic.

604
00:33:51,123 --> 00:33:53,114
Christ, Connie!

605
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,057
Can't you say that you shot him?

606
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:59,689
There's at least 10 cops who can place me
at the barn when this went down.

607
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,165
I thought that he was gonna kill me!

608
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,065
That story's not gonna cut it!

609
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:05,933
I'll lose my son.

610
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:09,368
Vic! Please!

611
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:11,705
Think of something!

612
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,381
What is it?

613
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:21,910
No. Clean yourself up. I gotta call this in.

614
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:24,922
You thought of somethin'! I know you did!

615
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:29,685
- I'm sorry, Connie. My hands are tied.
- All I have is Brian.

616
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:33,261
Don't let me lose him.

617
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,739
You'll need a better story.

618
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,402
Okay.

619
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:48,276
All right, you had sex.
You asked him to pay.

620
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:51,542
He said he didn't have to pay,
that he was gonna make you pay.

621
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:54,811
He started hitting you. He took out his gun.

622
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,720
You fought him off.
You took it and shot him.

623
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,714
Do you have that?

624
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,084
I asked him to pay.

625
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,859
He said he didn't have to, and he hit me.
That's good.

626
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,636
Your friends, they'll believe that?

627
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,640
Only if you have the bruises to prove it.

628
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:22,173
Okay.

629
00:35:39,565 --> 00:35:42,432
- I can't.
- It's okay! Come on!

630
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:45,470
- I can't! No.
- Do it!

631
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:48,098
- Hit me!
- No.

632
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:51,371
- Hit me! Come on, hit me!
- No!

633
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,074
Please?

634
00:35:56,549 --> 00:35:57,948
Vic, please.

635
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,247
Please.

636
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:10,422
Hit me.

637
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:27,768
So where does that leave us?

638
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,179
We know she disappeared
on Cassandra Street.

639
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,682
So far, no witnesses.

640
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:33,184
Anything from the park?

641
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,220
I did a full sweep. Nothin'.

642
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:37,414
Maybe forensics'll...
No.

643
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:41,588
This guy didn't leave any forensics
on the first four victims.

644
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,629
He's only gonna get better, not sloppier.

645
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:46,164
Then I'm callin' the rest of the units
off this one.

646
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:48,826
- What?
- A huge brawl started at Council Rock High.

647
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:50,869
Sixty students from rival schools.

648
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:54,633
- I need everyone I can get over there.
- You promised me 24 hours.

649
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:57,699
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I just don't have the bodies.

650
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:04,208
So a dead hooker gets 21 hours?

651
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,784
What would she get
if she was a mayor's daughter?

652
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,986
Claudette is gonna go back into rotation.

653
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,955
Now, you show me some new evidence,
clues, a viable lead...

654
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,425
...and then we'll talk.

655
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:18,088
You're assigning
the same amount of manpower...

656
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,655
...to find a serial killer
as you are to fix our pipes?

657
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:22,724
Getting mad doesn't change how life works.

658
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:24,698
She deserves better.

659
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:26,531
I know.

660
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,738
You did all you could. It's not over.

661
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,282
I need an aspirin.

662
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:55,391
Dutch, you're soakin' yourself.

663
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,337
You okay?

664
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,039
Sure.

665
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:04,770
Dutch, you think
we could find some time to study?

666
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:06,767
What?

667
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:11,112
For the sergeants exam. I feel like I'm,
you know, kind of fallin' behind.

668
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:12,709
Sure.

669
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:15,748
Why don't we do that right now?

670
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:19,348
I'll just drop my pissant serial killer thing
to help you study.

671
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:22,121
Because what you want always comes first,
doesn't it?

672
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:25,459
It comes before me,
comes before everybody else here!

673
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:28,098
Even comes before a dead 13-year-old girl...

674
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,863
...we're all supposed
to just forget about, come tomorrow.

675
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:33,166
So grab your books.

676
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:37,305
Let's find a nice, quiet spot!
We'll study for that test right now.

677
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:40,004
Yeah?

678
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,085
We had sex.

679
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,694
And then I asked, told him to pay.

680
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:59,020
He said he didn't have to.

681
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,795
That's when he started hitting me.

682
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,464
You did good.

683
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,240
I'm scared.

684
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,138
You're halfway home.

685
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:14,511
Just tell the detectives the same thing.

686
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:18,714
I'm gonna change, Vic.

687
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:21,479
I'm gonna clean up...

688
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:25,287
...be a mother to Brian.

689
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:29,654
It's gonna be okay.

690
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:40,035
Get clean...

691
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,970
...change...

692
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,869
...be a good mother.

693
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:48,103
I'm gonna do it.

694
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,281
Sun-Lee.

695
00:39:54,553 --> 00:39:55,815
I go now?

696
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,555
I called INS. I'm sending you back to Korea.

697
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,922
- But you say you help Sun-Lee!
- I am. This is the best thing for you.

698
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:09,467
- You don't know what like for me there.
- I know what it's like here.

699
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:14,302
- Parents never take me back!
- If they won't take you, the authorities will.

700
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:18,533
You'll be sent to a foster home, to school.
Someone'll look after you.

701
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:21,769
- Sun-Lee come back. I will!
- Maybe.

702
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:25,645
But even if it only buys you six months,
I can live with that.

703
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:29,645
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:36,818
Watch your step here.

705
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:39,992
Wait.

706
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,632
I'm sorry.

707
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:57,410
She looked like Sally.

708
00:40:58,284 --> 00:40:59,512
Almost was Sally.

709
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:04,152
Dutch.

710
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:06,749
You showed me somethin' today.

711
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,358
What do you mean? I failed.

712
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,020
No, you didn't.

713
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:13,860
We took down
some bad guys doin' some bad stuff.

714
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:18,629
- You did that, not me.
- We both did it. We'll get your guy, too.

715
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:20,069
Just won't be today.

716
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,939
No, it won't.

717
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:28,670
Serial cases are a marathon.
It's not sprints.

718
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:33,116
I remember workin'
the Green River case in 1984.

719
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,218
Forty-nine bodies.

720
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:39,257
I had 50 times your resources.

721
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,025
1984.

722
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:45,453
We made our first arrest last year.

723
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,192
Doesn't hurt if you don't let it.

724
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,762
Place should be clear by morning.

725
00:41:57,843 --> 00:41:59,367
Here's your bill.

726
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,150
- $800?
- Yeah. Cash only. I don't take credit.

727
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,815
- I'll have to go to an ATM.
- No problema, amigo. I'll be here all night.

728
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,323
Gracias, amigo.

729
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:23,390
Hey.

730
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:26,902
What's up?

731
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:31,738
Did you steal drugs from those Armenians?

732
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:34,972
- Not you, too.
- Look, Vic.

733
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,481
I owe you too much to ever repeat
your answer to anyone...

734
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,179
...but if I helped you get away with it,
I gotta know the truth.

735
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,050
Did you steal drugs?

736
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:47,649
You can ask me this after what happened
the other night?

737
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:49,250
The goddamn bust of the year...

738
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:51,796
...and your partner's
got you as mixed up as he is.

739
00:42:53,732 --> 00:42:57,224
Just give me some time
to get things sorted out in my head, okay?

740
00:42:57,302 --> 00:42:59,702
- Danny.
- Please.

741
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:02,536
I just want some space.

742
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,585
What I said to you...

743
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:22,084
...was inexcusable.

744
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:27,230
This case...

745
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,398
...was very important to me.

746
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,204
When I was a kid...

747
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,865
You know what?

748
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:41,274
At least I had a childhood.

749
00:43:41,613 --> 00:43:42,841
I lived.

750
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:45,640
It's just pathetic to complain about it now.

751
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:49,653
It's even more pathetic
to use it as some kind of excuse.

752
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,019
I don't have an excuse.

753
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,084
I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

754
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:00,555
Good night.

755
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:04,099
Dutch.

756
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:09,831
You hungry?

757
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:14,578
'Cause I make a mean grilled cheese.
