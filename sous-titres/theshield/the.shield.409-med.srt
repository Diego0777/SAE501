1
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:02,108
[Carl]... and the guy was just
screamin, so / looked down...

2
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,583
and I see in his hand
his nipple ring-

3
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:07,246
and his nipple.
[Laughs]

4
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:08,983
It's all true.
Fortunately, the guy was drunk.

5
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,651
[Danny] Yeah, but sooner
or later you sober up...

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,887
and you're still
missing your nipple.

7
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:16,556
How'd you guys log that
into evidence anyway?

8
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:20,396
- Oh, shit, with gloves on.
- [Laughter]

9
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:22,561
I'll be in the car.

10
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,966
[Carl]
Thought he got benched.

11
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:29,543
His P.B.A. rep appealed.
He's on the street till the hearing.

12
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,205
[Carl] He's pissing a lot of people off,
not being on board with the captain.

13
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,612
[Danny] Come on, look.
He's got a right to take a stand.

14
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,047
He's also got the right
to remain silent.

15
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,676
- Hey, you with me, Scoob?
- Damn straight.

16
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:42,814
[Radio: Dispatcher] 1-Tango-17, 242 just
occurred. 762 Whitney Avenue. Code 2.

17
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:46,588
- [Danny] Talk to you later.
- Yeah, / guess second roll call's over.

18
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,903
You had a gun to his head. He's gonna
tell you anything you want to hear.

19
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:00,463
- It wasn't like that.
- How can you know for sure
what's going on in his mind?

20
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:04,033
If Shane wasn't telling me the truth,
things would have gone down differently.

21
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,614
- He was never coming after me. I believe that.
- He's been lying for months...

22
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:10,082
- leaking all that intel to Antwon.
- He didn't get Angie killed.

23
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:12,585
Her own mother gave her up
to Antwon before she O.D. 'd.

24
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:15,316
He had to watch Antwon shoot her,
for Christ's sakes.

25
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,621
- He's sick about it.
- Yeah, so sick all he's worried
about is covering his own ass.

26
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:23,061
I told him he has to come clean with
everything that happened with Antwon.

27
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,099
Will that buy him
some trust?

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,465
- We should hear him out.
- Boys.

29
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,941
[Shane]
Once he had us on the hook for Angie...

30
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,876
he twisted us pretty hard.

31
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,609
You've already seen the highlights.
[Sighs]

32
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,413
And after that, everything else just
seemed like small potatoes, you know.

33
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,682
We tipped off the El Salvadorans
in that church raid.

34
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,020
Muled some China white
from San Pedro to L.A.

35
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:54,289
Antwon was pretty pissed off
you took down those drug dens ofhis...

36
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:59,163
and to help ease the pain, we, uh, busted
his competitors, gave him half the product.

37
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,394
And that's most of it.

38
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:04,131
Antwon have any relationships
I should know about?

39
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,139
Not many that work.

40
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,141
Beaners hate his ass.

41
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:11,337
El Salvadorans are losing faith.
R.O.C., they ignore him.

42
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,744
Asians tolerate him.

43
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,749
Outside the brothers,
he ain't too popular.

44
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:21,517
These injunctions and seizures are hitting
him harder than he wants folks to know.

45
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:25,081
- That's why he needed me.
- What about Army?

46
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,423
He follows my lead.

47
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,429
So he won't blindside us?

48
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,761
No. No, he's-
He's down.

49
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,300
Look, I'm sorry
about that little girl.

50
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:42,366
But it's not too late
to get her back...

51
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,968
to give her a proper burial.

52
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:49,873
So basically, you need our help.
Right?

53
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,078
He came clean.

54
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:56,157
Now it's time for us
to do our part.

55
00:03:57,993 --> 00:03:59,893
- [Army] What?
- [Shane] / told them everything.

56
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,826
- What everything?
- All of it.

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,761
How about bouncing that shit
off me? I don't know these guys.

58
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,890
I do, and we can't
handle this alone.

59
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,992
All right, banger spotters
are there around the clock.

60
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:11,834
Lost souls usually shuffle in after dark.
Place closes around midnight.

61
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,840
We'll find an excuse
to roust the muscle.

62
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:15,842
- We'll bring 'em back to the Barn.
- But they're all One-niners.

63
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,242
- We bust 'em on an injunction violation.
- How you getting Angie's body?

64
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,576
We wait till it's dark. / just
don't know how deep she's buried.

65
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,673
If they planned on having
the shithouse on top...

66
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:26,220
- probably not very deep.
- We dig her up, extract our bullets-

67
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,414
We find a really
good place to bury her.

68
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:31,253
Once we have the girl's body, Antwon
doesn't have any more leverage.

69
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,592
- We go in hard. Put him away for good.
- Or we shoot him for resisting.

70
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:41,294
This is bullshit, man.

71
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,268
- We can do this, just the four of us.
- He's good. Don't worry.

72
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,362
Let's go.

73
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,366
[Radio: Dispatcher]
1-Tango-13, roger.

74
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,276
Respond to 4556 Alexandria Circle,
Apartment 7.

75
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,282
1 -Tango-17 has been Code 6 on
a domestic dispute for a while now.

76
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,944
- They're not responding.
- [Julien] Roger. This is 1 -Tango-13.

77
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,181
We're on the scene.

78
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,577
Ma'am, are you the one
that made the 911 call?

79
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,741
Yeah, but I told them other cops
they missed him.

80
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,285
How long ago did
the other officers come by?

81
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:35,254
- About halfhour ago.
- Why'd you call?

82
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:39,817
Gideon Mazell, my ex's kid, he was trying
to break in. Said he was gonna rape me.

83
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:43,091
Asshole's been trying to get at me
since / dumped his old man.

84
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:45,132
Did you see where the officers
went after they left?

85
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,133
[Woman]
/ figured they went looking for Gideon.

86
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:50,204
- [Julien] Excuse me. /'ll take a look.
- 1 -Tango-17, you copy?

87
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:04,079
Carl, Scooby,
you guys on foot?

88
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:23,869
- Anything?
- Canvassed the whole area. There's nothing.

89
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:25,963
- Oh, shit.
- Half the people weren't answering their door.

90
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:29,805
- The other half were sleeping.
- Can I use your radio?

91
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:33,574
Staff 9-Tango. I'm Code 6
on Alexandria Circle.

92
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:38,142
Be advised we have two officers
unaccounted for. Requesting a tac alert.

93
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,813
- All watches will be held over.
- [Dispatcher] Copy that.

94
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,050
We should notify the families.

95
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:48,152
[Sirens /n Distance]

96
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,993
[Rock]

97
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,364
[Men, Women Chattering]

98
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:57,404
[Ends]

99
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:01,409
Carl and Scooby have been missing at least
an hour. I'm on my way there right now.

100
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:03,969
Carl and Scooby have been missing at least
an hour. I'm on my way there right now.

101
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,707
Could be the same hunt-
Antwon sending a message.

102
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,783
/f that's true,
they aren'tjust missing.

103
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,976
Retribution for not
killing the cop he wanted?

104
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,487
- We know where he likes to bury bodies.
- Jesus Christ.

105
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:17,990
All right, you, Army
and Ronnie, stick to the plan.

106
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:20,459
Find our missing cops.
We also gotta get a 20 on Antwon...

107
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,792
so we can scoop him up as soon
as we find the girl's body.

108
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:25,457
You come with me.
Let's go.

109
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,536
I want you to go to the end of the block,
keep knocking until you wake people up.

110
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,537
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Claudette] Where do you want us?

111
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,699
We're trying to track down Gideon Mazell,
the subject of the 911 call.

112
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,743
Steve Billings is on his way down,
so pass on to him what you find.

113
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:40,076
Captain, Steve's good at what he does,
but we've got officers missing.

114
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:42,081
If they're still alive,
they won't be for long...

115
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,913
and your two best detectives
are right here, right now.

116
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,420
You haven't seen our best game
because of the whole D.A. thing...

117
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:49,285
but this is too important.

118
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:54,761
Okay. You're the primaries.

119
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,263
We'll contact the sheriff, see if
they can loan us some bloodhounds.

120
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,492
Tracking Gideon Mazell.

121
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,832
Danny talked to the woman he was
threatening, so you guys get together.

122
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,768
- Vic and his people can work the gang end.
- Where is she?

123
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,932
Apartment 7,
right upstairs.

124
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,476
Julien, / want you to be department liaison,
sit with Carl's wife.

125
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:12,876
I heard what happened.
I want to help.

126
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:15,211
Tonight your reserve duty?

127
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,717
No, but I'm still
part of this family.

128
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,186
- Who can I ride with?
- I'll see who's available.

129
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,156
Captain, I knew both those guys.
I should be out there looking for them.

130
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,159
I'm more comfortable
if you're at Carl's house.

131
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,661
I don't have time to worry
about whether you follow orders.

132
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:31,197
Danny, I want you to take
Aceveda on patrol with you.

133
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,962
- /f there are any problems,
/ want to hear about them.
- Absolutely.

134
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,630
You ever consider this might be
Antwon Mitchell's work?

135
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,536
It's his hood, isn't it?

136
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,132
- I sent some unis to pick him up.
- Call 'em back.

137
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,973
- I'm all over it. He's M.I.A.
- With our two cops? That's convenient.

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,846
Give me those unis. I'll sweep up some of
his crew. Maybe find Antwon or our guys.

139
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,009
I can only spare
a couple of bodies.

140
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,087
Look, if / wasn't put in the backseat
on this task force...

141
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:56,487
maybe I could have stopped
this from happening.

142
00:08:56,591 --> 00:09:00,083
[Sighs]
You did what you had to do. I know that.

143
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:02,823
I just want
to find these guys.

144
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,990
Okay, I'll have Zerkow
call them back...

145
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,001
- and assign them to you.
- Appreciate that.

146
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:10,003
I'd like to help out.
You got any gaps here?

147
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,005
Yeah. Check with Dutch
and Claudette.

148
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,735
They're up there.

150
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,543
- We want to talk to Antwon.
- Well, he ain't here.

151
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,745
- What do you assholes know
about two missing cops?
- What the hell-

152
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:30,552
- You know there's an injunction, boys.
- That ain't no violation, man.

He ain't claiming.

my drawers too, faggot?

- [Officer] Hey, Vic.

Get them inside
and out of sight.

160
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,816
Okay, go to work.
Back in about an hour.

161
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:03,320
Gideon Mazell's address.
Captain- I mean, Councilman.

162
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,917
It's just officer tonight.
What can we do?

163
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,928
Pick Gideon up,
and take plenty of backup.

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,930
Don't worry.
We'll be careful.

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,595
[Man]
Detective.

166
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,262
I just talked to a neighbor who called 911
an hour before the other call.

167
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:21,035
- What was the complaint?
- Homeless man rooting through the trash.

168
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,804
When they tried to run him off
he seemed unstable.

169
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:27,643
- Threatened violence.
- Get a description. He's homeless. He's not far.

170
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:32,286
I'll tip it up.
You push it up and over, okay?

171
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:34,582
Okay.

172
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,783
[Grunting]

173
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:43,091
- Ugh! Goddamn it.
- That is rank.

174
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,998
You can do the digging.

175
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,229
Okay, fine.

176
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:02,310
No sign of our cops,
and the girl's body wasn't there.

177
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,750
- What do you mean?
- Shallow grave, empty. Somebody moved her.

178
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:08,755
- Halpern tipped Antwon.
- No way. We've been taking turns
watching that place...

179
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:11,519
- around the clock since he showed it to us.
- Halpern lied?

180
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:13,856
Then maybe the body
was never there.

181
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:16,021
- No, he moved it and didn't tell him about it.
- [Army] Now what?

182
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,531
Can't find the don,
you go visit Fredo.

183
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:26,136
- Yo, what're you working?
- Same as you.

184
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,937
Captain talked to Dutch and Claudette.
Put 'em onto Antwon.

185
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:31,637
- They got me tracking him down.
- You hear something, give us a heads-up.

186
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:34,306
Yeah.

187
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:37,282
Look, I'm trying.
You're not making it easy.

188
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,285
Keep trying.

189
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,322
Why you got me locked down?

190
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,416
Officers who brought you in
said you got a little... physical.

191
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:48,428
'Cause / didn't do nothin'
to deserve this.

192
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,430
Twice arrested for intent
to distribute steroids.

193
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,296
That your One-niner
connection?

194
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,801
You and a couple of them run into
two of our police officers tonight?

195
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:58,065
- Shit no.
- Maybe you went over to Lydia Quall's place...

196
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,936
- looking to get a little physical too.
- Lydia?

197
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,101
- She the one trying to get physical with me.
- With you?

198
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,111
- Yeah.
- She's dating your father.

199
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:07,738
Left him, thinking she
could have the 2005 model.

200
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,579
- / told her / was straight.
- If she's the one chasing you...

201
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:13,654
how come she's calling 911 trying
to stop you from breaking into her house?

202
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:16,918
- What you talking about?
- Officers respond, they go missing.

203
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:20,188
Take somebody pretty strong
to corral the two of them.

204
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,195
- What time we talking?
- Few hours ago.

205
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:25,733
No, no, no. I was over
at Greg Hockler's place all night...

206
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,768
- shooting up with stanozol.
- Steroids?

207
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,532
Got fresh track marks
on my ass to prove it.

208
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,608
[Scoffs]
Looks like you could use a little juice...

209
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,701
buddy.

210
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:40,610
- You lied to us, Lydia.
- We have two officers missing.

211
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,548
So we don't have time
for goddamn liars.

212
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:46,279
Gideon was nowhere near
your place when you called 911.

213
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:48,287
You lured those officers there.

214
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,949
You told them some bullshit story
about some guy harassing you...

215
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,084
and when you left your place...

216
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:55,992
- there was somebody else waiting for them.
- No!

217
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:57,792
Where are they, Lydia?

218
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,799
We are gonna lock...

219
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:03,564
that fat ass of yours in a cage
for the rest of your life...

220
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,105
- unless you tell us right now.
- / didn't lure no one.

221
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:09,040
I was just trying
to set up Gideon.

222
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,338
Figured if I got him
into some trouble with the law...

223
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,346
then he'd have
to talk with me...

224
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:18,078
and I'd drop the charges if he got
a little friendlier, you know?

225
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:22,088
I was looking to get the man in my bed,
not mess with no cops.

226
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,561
Thank you. We'll return the favor
if you ever need it. Good-bye.

227
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:32,326
Sheriff s office is sending over
six more officers.

228
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:35,425
- What'd you get upstairs?
- Bodybuilder and his paramour weren't involved.

229
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,766
- So we're back to square one.
- We've ruled some people out.

230
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:40,170
- We have to rule some people in.
- We knew whoever did this...

231
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,969
had a reason for being
on that block.

232
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,976
Mm-hmm.
Statements from neighbors?

233
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,741
Oh, yeah. Look, I've been over this.
Nothing stands out.

234
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:50,818
- / was gonna go through them again.
- [Monica] Do it in person.

235
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,887
Knock on the doors yourself.

236
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,922
We might have something.

237
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:03,894
Well, like I told the other
law enforcement agents...

238
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:07,058
uh, one was tall...

239
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:09,398
uh, African-American.

240
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:13,235
Uh, the shorter of the two
appeared white initially...

241
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:16,242
then I realized...

242
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:19,404
he was Asian.
[Laughs]

243
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:21,414
Marco Polo.

244
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:26,919
Did you see the officers
go into the apartment building?

245
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,921
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:32,618
- [Dutch] Did you see them come out?
- [Clears Throat]

247
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,389
[Claudette]
Can you answer the question, Roger?

248
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:38,761
May / see a badge number,
please?

249
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:47,034
[Claudette] Did you see the officers
come out of the building, yes or no?

250
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,405
I am going to need
one of those...

251
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,343
before I can be debriefed
in the category.

252
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:55,473
Civilians don't have badges.

253
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,784
When I get my badge...

254
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:02,720
all things will be made known...

255
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,951
peace officer to peace officer.

256
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,064
- Hey, Corrine.
- Hi.

257
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:12,724
- What's going on?
- We're looking for a black banger, 20s...

258
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,099
- came in here last night.
- This tied to those missing cops?

259
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:19,196
It might be. You got any
gunshot wounds in here?

260
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,434
- Only about 100.
- Check for a Halpern White.

261
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,976
Gimme a sec.

262
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:28,908
Gunshot wound to the shoulder.
Lost lots of blood.

263
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,416
Stabilized this morning.
Moved to the fourth floor.

264
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,578
- Talking?
- On a morphine drip.

265
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,919
He's happy. Not sure how much
talking he's doing.

266
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,357
So, any word
on those missing men?

267
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,089
Uh, no, but we could use
a favor with that.

268
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,108
That felt creepy.

269
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,111
- It's for a good cause.
- Thank you. Thank you.

270
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:02,376
Hey, I see you got
that lift to the E.R.

271
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:05,384
- What the hell you want?
- Did you say Angie's body was
under the goddamn outhouse.

272
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:07,386
- It is.
- No, it ain't. We looked.

273
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,184
Antwon must have
hauled it out.

274
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:14,591
- [Groans]
- Question is, where to?

275
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,720
Same place he's stashing
the two cops?

276
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:20,426
- What cops?
- You'd best be coming up with some answers...

277
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,800
or a copy of this C.I. contract
you just signed...

278
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,930
gets nailed to the door
of Antwon's community center.

279
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,940
- [Groans]
- Next time you sign insurance waivers...

280
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,442
you should read
the fine print.

281
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:33,742
Some paper, signed or not, ain't gonna
make my clique turn against me.

282
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:37,807
- [Groans]
- You just took a bullet. Almost died.

283
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,911
I hear you found Jesus,
saw the error of your ways.

284
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:46,790
- Started giving it up to Mr. Man
to get a fresh start.
- [Coughing]

285
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,658
You know the thug code-
"Trust no one.

286
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:52,426
Kill your buddy
before he kills you."

287
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,933
That's what separates us
from you.

288
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:01,732
Antwon wouldn't use his own crew
for that kind of shit.

289
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:05,870
He farms it out. They got a contract
with the El Salvadorans.

290
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,972
With you laid up,
who would he reach out with?

291
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,018
I doubt he went direct.

292
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,555
I don't know who
he'd use as a middleman.

293
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,784
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,123
You won't be able
to make any phone calls...

295
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:24,431
but you won't care.

296
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:36,643
Uh, would you do...

297
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,644
the honors?

298
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,785
What happened after the officers
came out of the apartment building?

299
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,760
[Clears Throat]
Uh-

300
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:58,423
The officers in question were
approached by a series of individuals.

301
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,432
[Claudette]
How many?

302
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:05,870
Three to seven.
Difficult to say with accuracy.

303
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:09,431
Low luminous environment.

304
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:12,478
- Where were you in relation to the police car?
- /'d say, uh...

305
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,810
forty meters east southwest.

306
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,680
[Claudette]
What were you doing there?

307
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:20,049
Routine surveillance.

308
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:24,056
Uh, monitoring bursts
of non-visible light...

309
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:26,058
in the 800-angstrom range.

310
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,355
High dispersion and so forth.

311
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:31,329
Roger, I need you
to be honest with me-

312
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:33,400
detective to detective.

313
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:36,732
Did you have anything
to do with this?

314
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,032
No, sir, I did not.

315
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,371
What happened
to those police officers?

316
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,467
Hmph.

317
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,910
[Dutch]
These men have families...

318
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,915
that are very worried
about them.

319
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:54,750
We all have a level three
clearance here, correct?

320
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:57,915
No. I'm still at level two.

321
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,061
Roger.

322
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,191
Level three.

323
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:14,202
Foreign operatives are
using the fault lines...

324
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,469
to destabilize
the gravity shelf.

325
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:18,704
9/11 all over again.

326
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:21,805
So these people you saw,
they were, uh...

327
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,816
foreign agents?

328
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:27,718
Uh, they, uh-
They travel along the fault lines...

329
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:30,052
to evade detection.

330
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:33,456
There are easier ways
to knock down a skyscraper...

331
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,223
than flying aircraft into it-

332
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,265
Uh, subduction,
uh, slip strike manipulation...

333
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,268
mantle failure and so forth.

334
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,270
That building is coming down.

335
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:46,602
- /t's coming down, all right.
- Got it. Got it.

336
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,606
Officer, deploy the swing shift
without roll call- everyone on the street.

337
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,408
And no petty busts. I don't want anybody
holed up with paperwork here.

338
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:57,450
- So, did he give us anything?
- Hmm.

339
00:19:57,551 --> 00:20:00,384
Alien abduction in the hood is more
plausible than anything he had to say.

340
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,479
He studied string theory
before going off the deep end.

341
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,286
Send him to County
for observation.

342
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:08,157
The one thing we do know is he saw
our cops. We should keep him here.

343
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,822
- The man's psychotic.
- He's our only witness.

344
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:19,130
- When does /.N.S. send your ass back?
- Supposed to be three days ago.

345
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,435
Behind schedule. Why?

346
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:24,943
I can keep you off that bus-
keep you in the U.S.

347
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:29,779
Two cops have gone missing.
/.N.S. is helping the police.

348
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:33,911
- What do you need me for?
- /nformation. Antwon Mitchell.

349
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,717
If he wanted to grab some cops,
who'd he use from your set?

350
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:40,492
You could really
get me out of here?

351
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,789
Free pass comes
right from the top.

352
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:45,263
Chief signed it himself.

353
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:51,803
Name's Pitarrio.
Knew Antwon in prison.

354
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:55,103
- He's his go-to on all the ugly shit.
- Where can I find him?

355
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,410
I need to look for him.

356
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:07,510
You need to stay here
in case Carl calls.

357
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:16,553
You know, he's been
coming home...

358
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,928
every night...

359
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,763
talking about how things
are more dangerous out there.

360
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,429
I mean, what did your captain
think would happen?

361
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,768
You push people long enough,
they push back.

362
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,967
Things weren't
working before.

363
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,976
She's just trying
something different.

364
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:33,273
Things were working fine
before.

365
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,439
Carl came home every night.

366
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,609
He's out there.

367
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,619
Alive.

368
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:45,752
- I can feel it.
- Then we'll find him.

369
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,068
What's up, Queenie?

370
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,468
Daddy, am I glad you here.
Ducked in the alley for a quick bowl.

371
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,472
You know,
take the edge off.

372
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:02,474
Dude grabs me from behind,
puts a knife to me...

373
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:04,806
- tell me to dime po-po and give y'all an address.
- What is it?

374
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,812
Sister need to be
about her paper.

375
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:09,610
That blade on this pretty face
scared my ass to death.

376
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,912
Here.

377
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,544
- 2711 Heliotrope.
- What am / gonna find there?

378
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:16,555
- Didn't say.
- What's the guy look like?

379
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:19,421
Told me if / turn around,
he's gonna cut out my implants.

380
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,722
- Did he sound black or white?
- Honey, / wasn't trying to know.

381
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:24,093
I just finished paying
for my new kitty cats.

382
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:27,759
Another dub buy you
some bomb-ass skully.

383
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:31,497
You know I'm gonna take care of your piece
better than any other female.

384
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:34,073
I'm gonna have to take
your word for it.

385
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,683
Go.

386
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:06,339
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!

387
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:11,308
[Flies Buzzing]

388
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:16,148
[Man Groans]

389
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:21,751
Everyone outside
until the detectives get here.

390
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,256
[Officers Murmuring]

391
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,569
Stay behind the line.

392
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:46,703
[Man] Officer, can you just
tell us the names-

393
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:26,919
They were killed somewhere else
and dumped here.

394
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,855
Yeah. Forensics'job just got harder by half.
Gotta find the murder scene.

395
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,758
- We seized this house last month.
- Somebody's certainly making his point.

396
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,228
Antwon Mitchell's
hit the hardest.

397
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:40,095
He partnered
with the Salvadorans in Lompoc.

398
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,499
Likes to use them
for the dirty stuff.

399
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:47,267
You remember that Salvadoran broker,
Spider, from the church bust?

400
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:50,104
- I had a chat with him.
- The I.N.S. hasn't sent him
back to El Salvador yet?

401
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,110
They're not the most efficient bunch.

402
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:54,942
But anyway, he put me onto a guy
who does dirty work for Antwon.

403
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,314
- Let me know.
- Yeah.

404
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,893
[Whispering]
It's a foursome.

405
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:09,986
Easy way to wash drug money.

406
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:12,691
The bottles come in the front,
the big faces come out the back.

407
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,700
- Go around.
- Yeah.

408
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:17,066
[Men Chattering,

409
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,501

Don't move!

[Mackey]
Which one of you is Pitarrio?

411
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,341
Pitarrio!

412
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,053
Pitarrio.

413
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,064
- [Groans]
- Pitarrio!

414
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:47,156
Talk!

415
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,829
- Cabrón.
- Get out. Get out.

416
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:02,709
- Who paid you to kill the cops?
- I didn't kill no cops.

417
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:05,512
- [Groans]
- Antwon Mitchell gave you the order.

418
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,747
- No, I didn't do no cops, man. [Groans]
- Spider says you did.

419
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:12,622
[Panting, Groaning]
/ was at the movies last night.

420
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:16,192

8:30 show last night.

422
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,003
Shit.

423
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:30,036
- No.
- [Groans]

424
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:32,840
You didn't kill the cops,
but you did something for Mitchell.

425
00:26:32,946 --> 00:26:35,574
What was it?

426
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,082
- What?
- The body.

427
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:41,120
- Antwon told me to move a body.
- Cops?

428
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:44,918
- No. I think it was a girl.
- Where?

429
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:48,017
- Where?
- [Groans] Griffith Park, man.

430
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,756
By the horses.

431
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:59,437
Need to interview the suspect
Billings brought in.

432

Psst.

433
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,442
Psst. Psst.

434
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:09,878
Surveillance has been
nonproductive thus far.

435

/ have been monitoring
the chatter and so forth.

436
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:17,215
Sorry to hear
about those two officers.

437
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:22,689
They deserved better than
getting dragged down like that.

438
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:27,523
Why don't you start
without me?

439
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,797
What do you mean,
"dragged down"?

440
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:33,464
Hey, I need you
to really concentrate...

441
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,667
on everything you saw
last night.

442
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:38,643
See it in your mind
like it's a movie...

443
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,645
and you're looking at it
one frame at a time.

444
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:42,647
- Can you do that for me?
- I'll try.

445
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:46,549
I've got one of those brains
that skips around a lot.

446
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:50,551
Uh, and my condolences
to the Marco Polo family.

I look after my peoples.

456
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:25,883
We had two cops murdered and dumped
in a house on your street.

457
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,553
- That had to have been outsiders.
- Really?

458
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:30,562
You and your neighbors
weren't pissed off...

459
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:33,360
- the police seized that house on your street?
- Wasn't my house.

460
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,163
Owners cooked meth.

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,568

Just keep it back.

00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:48,038

of this whole area.

Figure out how
Carl and Scooby disappeared.

465

- What are we looking for?
- I'm not sure.

466
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,148
But it may involve a geological anomaly
in the Earth's crust.

467
00:28:58,592 --> 00:29:01,584

as you do your search.

- He was proud to put on his uniform every day.
- He was-

473
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:38,462
But what you're doing here in Farmington
is what got him killed.

474

You need to know that.

475

Yeah, Southwest. That's cool. We'll pick
him up. Thanks, man. We owe you one.

483
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:44,095
Was that about Antwon?

484
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,131
- Well?
- Yeah. That was, uh, Walon Burke, Decoy-

485
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:52,137
I know Walon.
What did he give you?

486
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:55,106
An F.B./. pal ofhis in Westwood
just got a hit on Antwon's credit card.

487
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,301
He charged a plane ticket from Vegas.

00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:06,578
- Nice work.
- [Dutch] / got something.

491
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,417
Found it at the bottom of a manhole
near our original crime scene.

492
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:11,923
There's blood everywhere
down there.

493
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:14,016
How do you get two cops
in the sewer?

494
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,254
"Officer, my daughter just fell down there.
Can you help me?"

495
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:19,855
Blinged out dog tag the hip-hop kids wear.
Initials "J.P."

496
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:23,231
Found it in the blood. It's too
untarnished to have been down there long.

497
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:26,567
Get the owner, got a killer.

498
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,438
So how many guys
you think it took...

499
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:32,774
- you know, to get Carl and Scooby down there?
- A few.

500
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:35,109
There's a lot of anger
about what's going on.

501
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,843
Yeah, well, they're angry
because it's working.

502
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,851
A lot of us
are behind the captain.

503
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:40,851
That's understandable.

504
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:44,583
Sometimes street level isn't
the best vantage point to really see-

- [Brakes Screeching]
- What the hell was that?

507
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,433
Holy shit.

508
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:12,614
This look familiar
to you, Yancy?

509
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,415
- Don't think so.
- It was ripped from the neck...

510
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:18,013
of one of the people
who killed two cops last night...

511
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,025
whose bodies were found
on your block.

512
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:22,595
- You're hip-deep in this shit.
- You're the mayor on that block.

513
00:32:22,696 --> 00:32:26,962
- You either did it, or you know about it.
- Don't come near me with that.

514
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,331
So you're saying you've
never seen this jewelry before.

515
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:32,428
Name's Yancy Backus.
Remember?

516
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,439
"J.P." belongs
to somebody else.

517
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,668
So it belongs to one of your friends
you did the killing with.

518
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,870
Y'all took my cell phone
downstairs.

519
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:40,879
Check my friends and family.

520
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:44,948
Or you could check
with LeimertJewelers-

521
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,451
The people who made this.

522
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:49,818
See who
they sold it to.

[Man]
What's wrong with you?

527
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,835
- [Officer] Who wrote this?
- Man, he ain't seen nothing.

528
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,605
He was out back,
loading the truck.

529
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:14,270
- That's bullshit.
- What's bullshit-

530
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:17,316
Brothers out here dying,
none of you turning over the street.

531
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,408
- One of these cops was a brother.
- A cop ain't a brother.

532
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,511
- Maybe you saw something then, huh?
- Man, get the fuck-

533

- Hey, come here. Get your ass over here.

You okay?

536
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,646
You know, you might
want to get that x-rayed.

537
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,613
I got the wind
knocked out of me is all.

538
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:52,116
Comes with the territory.

539
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:56,053
- Along with getting shot at.
- Don't single yourself out.

540
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:59,853
- Three other officers
got their cars fired on today.
- Everybody okay?

541
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,054
Thank God.

542
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:06,599
Not that you're asking,
but I've lost cops under my command.

/t's easy to shit your pants,
but it accomplishes nothing.

544

- I wasn't going down that road.
- What /'m saying is...

545
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:18,577
a thing like this- especially if there's
no good news right away-

546
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:21,044
can paralyze you.

547
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:24,344
Those people out there
need to feel your confidence.

548
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,624
Vic. You're empty-handed.

549
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,754
Where's the guy who does
all of Antwon's dirty work?

550
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:40,332
He had an airtight alibi.

551
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:44,062
Well, it's going around. Antwon just
happened to be in Vegas last night.

552
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,764
Got his flight info. / have some unis
posted at L.A. X...

553
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:48,773
to grab him when he gets
off the plane.

554
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:52,174
- Some good news, finally.
- Yeah, well, conversations with Mitchell...

555
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,179
tend to go around
in circles.

556
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:56,909
I don't want to keep the community
waiting while I find...

557
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:59,781
a straight line.

558
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,218
Dutch and Claudette
have come up empty too.

559
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,057
Maybe it's time to, uh...

560
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,457
bring in a person
of interest.

561
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:12,563
- Lay it off on someone?
- Just a couple of days.

562
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,430
Give us a chance to try to squeeze
the truth out of Antwon.

before they take a shot at a uni.

- You have anyone in mind?
- No.

565
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:23,842
Just as long
as he fills the bill.

566
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:27,539
One unsympathetic asshole
coming right up.

567
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,179
Captain's arranged a welcome wagon for
Antwon. He's flying into L.A.X. tonight.

568
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:38,757
So I hear.
You knew?

569
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:43,056
What part of us getting information first
didn't you understand?

570
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,927
Captain was standing right there
when I got the call. I had to tell her.

571
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:47,932
- She doesn't have anything on Antwon.
- No.

572
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,002
But he's got plenty
on them.

573
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:51,934
If we haul in Antwon,
push the wrong buttons...

574
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:54,336
how long you think it's gonna take him
to point a finger at me and Army?

575
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:56,636
I'll make sure it takes long enough
for us to get our leverage back.

576
00:35:56,743 --> 00:35:59,439
Look, we gotta find a goat
to pin these murders on-

577
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:03,038
- calm the streets before another cop gets killed.
- This captain won't go for that.

578
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:05,617
It was her idea.
All we need is a face and a name.

579
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:08,210
Anyone in Antwon's circle
fit that bill?

580
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:12,223
Well, there is this young cat. Earned his cred
by supplying clean guns to the black sets.

581
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,225
Whatever he was doing
last night, it wasn't legal.

582
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:17,194
- Guppy got a name?
- Street name's Urkel.

583
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,265
- [Man Snickers]
- Swear to God.

584
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,266
[Laughs]
All right, good.

585
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,302
You and Ronnie go pick up
our cop killer.

586
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:27,396
- Now you want us to haul in an innocent guy?
- He'll have a car full of guns.

587
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:30,635
Bring him in for that.
We'll figure the rest out later.

588
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:33,711
Let's go.

589
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:49,554
- Rise and shine, big pimpin'.
- [Gasps]

590
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,425
Get ahold of our thick friend.
Give him a heads-up.

591
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:54,762
- About what?
- Our captain likes him for killing those cops.

592
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:57,098
She's sending a blue crew
to L.A.X. to pick him up.

593
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:59,694
He needs to fly into Burbank instead.
We'll surprise him there.

594
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:01,706
Tell him how to play this out
with our bosses.

595
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,708
What makes you think he's
gonna drop his black ass...

596
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,974
- into whatever jackpot you got planned?
- No more games, no more threats.

597
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:11,278
We want to stop beef and start
doing business the right way.

598
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:14,842
This guy wants you dead.
He ain't getting into a car with y'all.

599
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,388
He's not gonna have a choice.
Now make the damn call.

600
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,390
[Line Ringing]

601
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,263
- Hell yeah, that's my shit.
- So you're admitting...

602
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:29,267
- you were present at a crime scene
last night, Jamal?
- Crime scene?

603
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,599
- Those two dead cops.
- [Dutch] Friends of ours, actually.

604
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:33,604
- No, I was not there.
- But your necklace was?

605
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:35,674
- How do you explain that?
- Necklace got itself stolen.

606
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,675
[Laughing]
Right.

607
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,245
- When?
- Six, seven months ago.

608
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:42,746
- They took the TV too.
- You, uh, report it?

609
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:45,750
I spent three G's getting
this thing custom made.

610
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,752
You best believe your ass
I reported it.

611
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:51,984
- Go check your records.
- Police have any idea who took it?

612
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:54,652
I kept trying to check back
with you cops every couple weeks...

613
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:56,661
see if they heard
anything new.

614
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:58,663
No one seemed real interested.

615
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:04,130
Y'all real interested
now though, huh?

616
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:23,311
Dutch.
Need you to come up, please.

617
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:31,421
So the trail just stops?

618
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:33,829
Well, even with the necklace stolen,
we're thinking...

619
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,197
it probably ended up in the hands
of somebody with the initials "J.P."

620
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:39,999
[Monica]
That's reaching. What else do we have?

621
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,006
No witnesses,
but we're waiting for lab work.

622
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:45,544
So that's the plan? We just get lucky,
something falls in our laps?

623
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:49,137
- /t's only the first day.
- Every day will just get harder.

624
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:52,741
Meanwhile, I've had
four different squad cars shot at...

625
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,150
two brawls with civilians
and officers...

626
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:57,246
and one instance in which
my own men lost control.

627
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:59,587
It's got to stop.

628
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,224
Vic and his guys have
brought in a suspect.

629
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:08,596
Great!
What do we have on him?

630
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:10,862
Carload of stolen guns.

631
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,666
Our guys were stabbed.

632
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:19,006
He's a gang member.
We've got him on weapons charges.

633
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:22,081
- But nothing related to our murders?
- / want you to make the press...

634
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:25,879
- believe that we have a killer in custody.
- [Dutch] Oh, you're kidding.

635
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:28,613
- You want us to lie?
- Save your high and mighties for a time...

636
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:30,348
when the lives of my cops
aren't at stake.

637
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:33,016
- You've had a chance to solve this.
- It's only been one day.

638
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,959
And you've been doing your best,
but we're not far enough.

639
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:39,327
We tell the community that we
have a killer, it sends the message...

640
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,730
that there's a price to pay
for coming after us.

641
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,234
Makes whoever
really did it cocky...

642
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:47,067
gets them laughing with their friends
about what idiots we are...

643
00:39:47,173 --> 00:39:49,073
and if they tell
their friends-

644
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,838
- Their friends tell someone who tells us.
- You wanted the case...

645
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:55,141
so take the bad
with the good.

646
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,358
[Antwon]
So 5-0 was waiting for me at L.A.X.?

647
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,833
How is this an improvement?

648
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:20,167
My little gift to you,
running interference.

649
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:22,901
I didn't know
I made your Christmas list.

650
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:25,500
We want a truce.

651
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:30,640
You know, there's a much bigger upside
for you, me being alive and kicking.

652
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,648
[Antwon]
/ don't see it.

653
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:35,778
Truth is, my captain's made
a serious dent in your business.

654
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:39,949
How long before someone in your
organization decides to play King of the Hill?

655
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:42,357
Nobody's taking me down.

656
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:45,659
- Not without my backing.
- You been stepping on my game since day one.

657
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:48,734
That earns you dead.

658
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:52,293
Yeah? That didn't happen.

659
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:14,258
[Scoffs]

660
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,988
My boys saw you gaffing me
up at the airport, so-

661
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,462
Now what?

662
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:25,432
You back off of me and mine,
Shane and his family.

663
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,438
We work out fair percentages.

664
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,839
You get to do business uninterrupted.
That's the deal.

665
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:37,239
Either you smoking crack
or you think I am.

666
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,318
Our captain pulled him off lead
on the gang task force.

667
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,319
He lost his pay bump.

668
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,946
There's no up side for me
to play by their rules anymore.

669
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:46,958
I got two sick kids.
I gotta earn.

670
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,121
And I ain't got time to hear no more
of this crackerwood bullshit.

671
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,899
I know you been looking
for a new tar importer...

672
00:41:55,001 --> 00:42:00,564
ever since you lost that cul-de-sac,
the El Salvadorans.

673
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:03,233
[Mackey] / got a hookup with
a Jamaican crew out of Miami.

674
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:05,743
They call themselves
the Splash Posse.

675
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:08,245
Yeah, I heard of them niggas.

676
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:10,748
They're looking to move weight
out of the West Coast.

677
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,410
I'm their broker.

678
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,283
We need a retail outlet.

679
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,352
So you a baller
all of a sudden now.

680
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,793
Always was.

681
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:27,627
/ just took a step back
from the game for a little while.

682
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,533
So what's your captain
gonna sweat me on, huh?

683
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,665
These dead cops?

684
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:40,109
I don't kill for no reason...

685
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:42,875
and I don't know nothin'
about merkin' no police.

686
00:42:42,982 --> 00:42:45,780
[Shane]
They got nothin'on you.

687
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:47,785
They'll hold you
for a few hours...

688
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:51,414
- and then cut you loose.
- [Mackey] /'ll be in the room.

689
00:42:51,524 --> 00:42:54,618
I'll steer the questioning away
from anything sensitive.

690
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:59,027
That is...
if we're working together.

691
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:07,234
You're lucky your boy
got mad love for you.

692
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,104
Oh, yeah.

693
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:13,178
We're all about mad love.

694
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:16,579
The suspect's name
is Donzell Prince.

695
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:19,344
[Man] You've arrested him for the
murders of Officers Haimes and Miller?

696
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:21,352
Currently, he's only being
held on weapons charges...

697
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:23,354
but we're confident
we have our man.

698
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:25,424
[Man] /f you're so confident,
why don't you file on murder?

699
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:27,823
We don't want to make any mistakes.
No one wants to take chances.

700
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:30,487
[Man]
Do you believe he acted alone?

701
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:33,121
Doesn't the crime itself suggest
that there were multiple assailants?

702
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:37,396
I really can't go into our theory
of the crime at this time.

703
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,698
Has the suspect indicated
any accomplices?

704
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:42,274
I can't talk about the specifics
of what the suspect revealed.

705
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,775
All / can say is,
our investigation is bearing fruit...

706
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:47,107
and we'll have more for you
in the coming days.

707
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,943
- Thank you.
- [Reporters Shouting Questions]

708
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,188
- Danny. Bring him up to one?
- [Danny] Sure.

709
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:03,262
- We frisked him. He's clean.
- [Danny] All right.

710
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:08,565
He gave us the slip at L.A.X.
How did you find him?

711
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,636
One of his crew told us
he got a heads-up.

712
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:13,432
Figured he only had one
of two choices left, Burbank or L.B.

713
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:16,007
- We got him at Bob Hope.
- Nice.

714
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:18,008
Don't know what
we're gonna throw at him yet.

715
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,772
I've got a couple aces
up my sleeve.

716
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:26,277
- See you up there.
- [Mackey] Yeah.

717
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,285
Help yourself.

718
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:32,052
All known city gang members
with the initials...

719
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:34,058
"J" and "P."

720
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,060
Hope you got a four-leaf clover
in your pocket.

721
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:38,426
- We should start with One-niners.
- In Farmington.

722
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:41,261
- You want some dinner?
- I had dinner- four hours ago.

723
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:43,927
Yeah. I mean another dinner.

724
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:46,504
Whatever you want's
fine with me.

725
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:48,574
We have nothing
to charge Antwon with.

726
00:44:48,674 --> 00:44:51,404
Means we can only hold him
for 12 hours.

727
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:55,242
She's buried in Griffith Park, somewhere
near the horses, in three holes.

728
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:57,646
- Christ.
- [Mackey] All right, /'ll tie up Mitchell.

729
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,945
Make sure he doesn't
dime anyone to move her again.

730
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:02,520
You three have to find
the graves.

731
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:05,090
[Curtis]
/'ll do it too.

732
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:09,761
Look for fresh digging.
Let's find her.

733
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:21,705
Don't need that.

734
00:45:37,523 --> 00:45:40,117
Thanks for coming in, Antwon.

735
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,136
