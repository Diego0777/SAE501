1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,960
Here's our enforcer. Right on time.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,835
Lem's snitch wasn't bullshittin'us.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,739
- We waitin'till the money changes hands?

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,404
Or till he hits 'im. Let's go.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,315
Strike Team's
back in business, asshole.

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,350

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,020

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,566
- Where is he?
In the back! He's goin'out the back!

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,466
I got him! Get the car!

10
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,072

11
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,786
He's in the house

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,761
Let's go

13
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,310

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,778
- Hey! Hands up Hands in the air
- Hands in the air.

15
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,579
On the ground!
On the ground!

16
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,849
- I'm a cop!
- Shots!

17
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,117

18
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,785
Don't move!

19
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,957
- Shit, man Are you all right?
- Shit!

20
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,399
- Bitch
- Get up!

21
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,596
Hey, man I swear I didn't know
he was a cop He said it too late

22
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,936
- Here's so you won't forget

23
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,749
- You like takin' shots at cops, huh?

24
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,581

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,358
What do I look like now,
you prick?

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,405

27
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,341
You didn't look like no cop!

28
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,776
That's good.

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,213
That's good

30
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,250
That's good!

31
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,015

32
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,888
- Great news
- Our cuddler rapist wants to talk.

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,154
- I thought he was refusing to be interviewed
- Apparently, a week and a half

34
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,662
in solitary
made him very lonely

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,961
I sent him a note with the DNA evidence
tying him to two of the bodies

36
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,627
He knows the jig is up; he probably
wants to brag about his exploits

37
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,264
- Good. What about the wife?
- She still won't talk.

38
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,037
- We don't know what she knew
- She seems harmless

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,041
We'll find out
for sure tomorrow

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,914
We rarely talk to someone
who's taken a shot at us

41
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,021
Usually it's the next of kin

42
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,558
Look, man I swear I didn't know
you guys was cops

43
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,390
Look I see white boys bust in my house,
man, instincts kick in

44
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,988
- What's your name, shithead?
- Trick

45
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,763
We heard about someone shakin'
down store owners We catch this
guy handing out a beat-down

46
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,601
Why's he running to your house?
He workin' for you?

47
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,232
Nah It's the everyday stuff

48
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,641
Macy's open up
a drug prescription department?

49
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,612
- Check this shit out, man

50
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,251
Percocet, Oxy, Valium

51
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,949
Looks like thejackrabbit
led us to Dr. Feelgood.

52
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,221
- What you run here for, Luddy?
- So you two are on a first-name basis

53
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,389
- Vic, a car is pullin' up
- Who is it?

54
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,898
- Let's get out of here Finish it

55
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,335
Hey, hey, hey, hey! It's gotta be
my runner picking up that delivery

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,773
This just keeps
gettin' better and better

57
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,338
I'm gonna open the door

58
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,214
Play it cool You try to jet,
I'm gonna sic him on you

59
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:20,219
It's one of my mules

60
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,385
Ronnie

61
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,659
This mule may be strapped, so be careful.

62
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,963

63
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,230
Freeze!

64
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,475
Ripped by:

65
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,568
Hound

66
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,580


67
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,114
The girl next door says
you got quite the racket goin'

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,656
Dealin' illegal pharmaceuticals
on top of tryin' to kill me?

69
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,782
You can get the bends
goin' down in shit that deep

70
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,225
Look, man I'd never shoot
a cop It was an accident

71
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:01,232
- You got about 50 years coming to figure it out!
- I'll make it up to you, okay?

72
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,360
Give you everything

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,665
Look. I ain't the one distributing.

74
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,231
It's my boss, Lewis
Lewis Sperling, man He owns AGC

75
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,777
- Custom car outfit?
- Yeah, man.

76
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,280
- He runs the scrips, man
I recruit the runners for him
- From where? The PTA?

77
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,613
Hey No one ever got pulled over
for driving while being a soccer mom

78
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:24,588
So what? Dealin' to the burbs doesn't
get you time off an attempted cop killing!

79
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:29,060
Dealin' is a small thing that helps
with this big thing, man-- washin' money

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,656
- Who's got the dirty laundry?
- Bangers, gambling outfits

81
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,132
captains of industry, man--
who knows?

82
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,329
Lewis takes your dirty cash,
puts it in A.G.C....

83
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,341
calls you a solid partner
and cuts you a share of the profits

84
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,844
Yeah,yeah. Hey, look. You make sure a D.A.
don't come after me for cop shootin..

85
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,005
I'll get you in

86
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,175


87
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,483
- Sounds interesting
- This asshole tried to kill me

88
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,528
He didn't know we were cops
Meanwhile, you got him so scared

89
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,529
we're gettin' a tip
we'd never get another way

90
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,259
I won't work with him

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,030
Aren't you supposed to be
riding shotgun with Mara's mom

92
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,401
preppin' her for
the big phone call tomorrow?

93
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,942
- Yeah
- Then you focus on that

94
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,568
Make sure it goes right

95
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,014
What's the problem? Do you want me
to lose my Realtor's license?

96
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,714
I don't like this Lying to the US Government,
with the Homeland ''Securities'' and all?

97
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,790
Uh-uh

98
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,860
Ma, this is important

99
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,362
If they find out that I failed to
report this bonus, I could be in serious trouble

100
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,523
- How serious?
- Look, Stella

101
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,000
If there's one thing the government
does right, it's collect taxes.

102
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:49,973
I hate askin' you to do this-- we both do--
but it'll cost us, kill our careers

103
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,512
I mean, even if we had to split the rest
of the bonus with you--

104
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,606
- How much is that? Few grand?
- Yeah Yeah Three or four

105
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,349
I'll do it for Mara

106
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,759
- Mrs Faulks
- You're bringing in my husband, isn't that right?

107
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,858
- He's agreed to make a statement
- I need to talk to him first

108
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,267
- That's not possible
- Why not?

109
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,136
- You can make arrangements
to visit him at CountyJail
- You don't think I've tried?

110
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,709
I've already tried He won't
see me He won't talk to me

111
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,871
You have an innocent
and scared man in prison

112
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,347
- His DNA matched semen
recovered from the victims
- I've heard about DNA labs

113
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,351
in Los Angeles,
and that means nothing

114
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,581
- If you'd agree to an interview with me--
- Why? So you can frame me?

115
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,682
- So I can clear you of any involvement
- In rapes and murders?

116
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,886
- When's a good time for us to speak?
- I need to talk to him first

117
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,929
- I need to talk to you
- Well, I already said no

118
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:50,162
Then there's not much reason
for you to be here Buzz me

119
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,466

120
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,701
Gimme some money
I know you got some

121
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,778
Pasty-ass bitch-ass!

122
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,639
I'll be rulin' with an iron rod

123
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,876
as the vessels of a potter
shall be broken to shards

124
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,648
Just take it.

125
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,350
Hey! Drop the pipe!

126
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,987
- Where's the black man's justice?
- Turn around. Turn around.

127
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,260
Put your hands
behind your head Let's go

128
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,928
Verily I say unto you,
be holy, for I am holy

129
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,029
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'

130
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,041
Take a bath lately?

131
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,445
- Let's go.
- I see you been blinkin'at me.

132
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,075
Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink
This will be recorded in writing

133
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,746
and turned over to a directorate,
and then we'll see who's laughing

134
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,052
- Get in

135
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,058

136
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,061
Investors in the AGC
custom car outfit

137
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:55,190
Colón runs the Farmtown Mijos.
Del Rubio owns a piece of the racetrack

138
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,769
And AGC is the clearinghouse
for all their dirty profits?

139
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,897
Them and who knows what other bad guys
Their drug running just helps 'em clean the cash

140
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,875
Without hard evidence, we can't
target people for owning part of a business

141
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,310
If we can sting this Lewis Sperling
on a drug distribution

142
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,314
we'll get him to roll
on everybody else

143
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:16,286
You net the octopus,
follow the tentacles, get the ink

144
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,088
- What do you need?
- Well, Lewis interviews all the mules personally

145
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,323
and since we lost the Decoy Squad,
I'm gonna need a female to meet him

146
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,525
- I was thinkin' Sofer
- Danny?

147
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,661
- She's never gone under
-She can fit the bill. And if
this Trick doesn't pop up soon...

148
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,831
Lewis is gonna get suspicious

149
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,603
I don't like cutting a deal
with some prick who fired on an officer

150
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,270
Me either
But if this breaks right

151
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,609
it'll be the biggest case
you and me'll ever see

152
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,708
It'll set crime in Farmington
back 20 years

153
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,512
Okay Send her in

154
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,320
Let me tell you somethin', black
The only difference between you and me

155
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,361
is I was baptized in dirty water

156
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,330
- Yeah.
- Priors for vagrancy.
In and out of psych wards.

157
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,698
- We should turn this guy over
to MEU for evaluation
- They're blinkin' at me

158
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,102
The son of man has eyes of fire

159
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,640
- When do I see the judge?
- Be patient.

160
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:15,339
- He is A mental patient
-Just send him downtown
He's their problem, not ours

161
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,076
- Bustin' Cardboard Willies, huh?

162
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,015
- That's always fun.
- It's a job

163
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,679
This guy smells like dirty ass

164
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,747
I had something a little more sexy
in mind for ya, but, uh

165
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,657
what did you do
to piss off Aceveda?

166
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,560
- What do you mean?
- Well, I need a female undercover

167
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,190
- I thought you'd be perfect, but--
- But what?

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,829
I had to twist his arm
You'd better make me look good

169
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,999
Thanks Wait a minute
What's the gig?

170
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,873
AGC Car Company
is doing a bunch of scams

171
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,209
We need you to go after the owner
as Harriet Homemaker

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,081
All right I took home ec Let me know
when I can ditch the uniform

173
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,176
Sure will

174
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,596
Vic

175
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,467
- Hi
- Hi

176
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,263
- One of your puppies make a bust?
- Yeah Koto

177
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,862
Found five pounds of pot
in a locker at Farmington South.

178
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,875
Smokin' in the boys' room

179
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,275
How you doin'?

180
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,008
Ups and downs I've really wanted
to see you, but Hunter's

181
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,210
- You don't have to explain
- always had issues with depression

182
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,117
but lately he's been talking
about killing himself if I ever leave

183
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,454
Are you safe there?

184
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,586
Oh, yeah
He'd never-- Yeah

185
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,528
I wanna see you though

186
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:46,298
- Sooner or later, this guy's
gonna need a clean break
- I can't do that right now

187
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,340
But I don't wanna wait either

188
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,967
You name the place

189
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,644

190
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,717

191
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,309
Will?

192
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,153
Will? Will?
Why won't you talk to me?

193
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,318
Upstairs
Interrogation room two

194
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,760
Will!

195
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,267
Will! Will! Goddamn it!
Look at me!

196
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,734
Will, you didn't do this!

197
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,797
Will, let me help you.
I can help you!

198
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,440

199
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,486
- I have one condition before we start.
- You don't get conditions

200
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,388
I want a grilled cheese
on sourdough

201
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,985
a few strips ofbacon on the side,
not on the sandwich...

202
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,360
some fries and a Pepsi

203
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,434
- Okay
- Thanks.

204
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,902
I've never seen Joanna
that upset

205
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,840
She can't understand why you
won't take her phone calls or see her

206
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,309
This doesn't need
to touch her any more than it has to

207
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,279
If she's involved,
you can't protect her forever.

208
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,580
- You think she's involved?
- I don't know what to think

209
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,883
She won't talk to us
until she talks to you

210
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,826
Bring her up here I'll get her to cooperate
Then you and I don't have to worry about it

211
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,264
Matthew bit another classmate
this morning

212
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,996
- Another one? When--
- I was gonna tell you Is the other child okay?

213
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,538
He broke the skin
It required tetanus shots

214
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,336
The last couple of weeks,
Matthew's been a serious problem

215
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,309
- It's starting to influence the other students
- You know what?

216
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,781
That's about the time we lost his in-house
therapist. We're still looking for a replacement.

217
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,817
We've decided
to increase his one-on-one...

218
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,853
then reevaluate whether to
bring him back into the fold

219
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,082
- Wait You're isolating him?
- For the safety of the other children

220
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,820
How's he supposed to learn to socialize
if you won't let him near other kids?

221
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,260
- Maybe the one-on-one's gonna help
- We're payin' 'em 25 grand

222
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,457
a year so he won't get stuck
in a public school broom closet

223
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,899
We'll continue to work
with Matthew as best we can

224
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,699
But if he injures another child, we're going
to have to ask you to find another school

225
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,003
- Please don't do that
- What school is gonna take an autistic kid

226
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,704
that you've branded
as being violent?

227
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,513
- Bring back Owen
- He took a job in Phoenix

228
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,919
We had a fight I couldn't
bring him back now even if I wanted to

229
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,958
and, uh, there's a waiting list
at the service

230
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,086
for qualified therapists

231
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,188
I'll come by tonight, talk to Matt
about the biting

232
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,961
- I'll set him straight

233
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,605
- I'd like to talk to him alone
- I'm sorry I can't allow that

234
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,675
- Why not?
- It's against policy.

235
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,267
- Change the goddamn policy
- Jo, stop it. This won't take that long.

236
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,506
Did you tell them
you didn't do this?

237
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,278
- I hate that you got dragged into it
- It's all right It's a mistake

238
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,751
All we have to do now is figure out
how to get you back home

239
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,880
Any questions he asks,just answer
You're not involved, so just tell the truth

240
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,687
- Neither one of us is involved
- I did it,Jo.

241
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,261
I raped those women
I killed them

242
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:02,198
I brought you things
from their houses.

243
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,135
- They making you say that?
- Joanna, I did it.

244
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,807
- No
- Best-case scenario is I'm going to prison for life

245
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,106
so you need to move on
with yours

246
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,149
We're never gonna see each other
again after today, understand?

247
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,583
I won't ever agree to see you

248
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,020
People are staring at me like I--

249
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:32,120
The school has told me not to show up
until this is all settled

250
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,031
There's cameras
There's helicopters flying over our house

251
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,070
People are throwing trash
on our lawn What do I do, Will?

252
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,264
- What am I supposed to tell people?
- She needs to leave

253
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,070
- My mother said I was a bad wife
to you. Was I a bad wife?
- Take her away, or I won't talk

254
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:50,410
Tell me Was I supposed to know?
Was I supposed to know this, that you were--

255
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,974
All right. Let's go.

256
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,611
Look No gun No wire
We'll be out front

257
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:00,123
but basically,
you're on your own

258
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,251
- What's goin' on?
- Danny's interviewing with Lewis

259
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:08,231
- You're kiddin' me
- You and Lem back her up
We'll be with knucklehead

260
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,598
I always thought when I finally
went undercover, it'd be as a hooker

261
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,605
Don't lose that dream Ronnie,
hook up Danny with a fake ID

262
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,107
And toss Shane's buddy here
in the cage for safekeeping.

263
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,302
Get up

264
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,711
A case this big is good for us
in a hundred different ways

265
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,275
- How'd it go with Mara's mom?
- Okay, I think

266
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,821
The feds want her to stop in
when she gets back to Indio

267
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,415
What? I'm gone a couple hours, all
of a sudden we're in bed with a cop killer?

268
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,324
- Aceveda signed off.
- As long as you and Aceveda are cool with it

269
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,593
- What are you pouting for?
- He took a shot at me, and
no one seems to give a shit!

270
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,168
- He's gonna do time for that.
- Not enough!

271
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,864
Look, what are we doing to prep Mara's mom
for her face-to-face with the feds?

272
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,033
Maybe next raid, I'll catch that bullet, and
you won't have to worry about a connection

273
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,839
You can just
lay it all at my door

274
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,937

275
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,142
Man.

276
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,947
You're under arrest
for three murders and seven rapes.

277
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,421
I'm guilty of all those crimes.

278
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,119
Are there any other crimes
you'd like to confess to at this time?

279
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:13,164
No. I just did the three murders
and the seven rapes.

280
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:18,259
What about your wife? How could Joanna
not know what you were doing?

281
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,804
I was good She didn't

282
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,673
You were out all day scoping your victims,
out all night raping them

283
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,076
Did she ever wonder
where you were?

284
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,205
I told her I was working
or writing

285
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:34,615
- She never called to check up on you?
- She never had reason to

286
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,985
She didn't see that side of me

287
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,993
You were married for eight years
She didn't wanna see it

288
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,088
Being married doesn't mean
you know what's in a person's heart.

289
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,633
- You married?
- No.

290
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,397
Ever or anymore?

291
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:58,041
- Anymore
- You leave her or she leave you?

292
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,578
When you were married to her,
did you know what she wanted?

293
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:08,449
What was really in her heart then?
Or did you only find out later

294
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,182
when she was gone?

295
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,886
- We're deaf and blind here Be ready for anything

296
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,966
Yeah. Copy.

297
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,763
- Dude, what was that
back in the clubhouse?
-Just 'cause

298
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,770
we're on this team doesn't mean
we can't become a problem

299
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,807
If there's one thing Vic's good at,
it's solving problems

300
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,570
Dude, Vic's never
gonna kick you off the team.

301
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,342
If Vic ever thought me and Mara were becoming
a problem, you'd let me know, wouldn't ya?

302
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,988
A regular customer.
Strictly recreational. Got some smarts.

303
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,080
- You hit it?
- No, it's too white, man

304
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,855
It's all pink, nigga
Yo, give me your license

305
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,602
- Got any kids?
- No.

306
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,300
Buy yourself a car seat on your own dime
I don't supply start-up costs

307
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,969
Spill something on it--some crumbs,
couple of toys. Kids are messy.

308
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,741
- You take a nice picture, Danielle
- Thanks.

309
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,817
I'll hold onto this, make sure
you're the real Danielle Spencer

310
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,011
- Come back when you're fitted out.
- All right

311
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,419
What's the status of that homeless guy
that you and Danny brought in?

312
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:25,463
I tried sending him to County
on a 5 1 50 for observation. No beds.

313
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,294
- You called around?
- Call around where?

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,528
There's private facilities
There's that shelter on Bonnie Brae

315
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,765
You know if he's in the military?
He could go to Veterans

316
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,741
- Hmm I'll check
- Throwin'that guy to the gladiators...

317
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,439
in the city lockup
oughta be the last resort, don't you think?

318
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,846
I said I'd check

319
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,884
He's indicated to me
you're not involved You're cleared

320
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,260
- I'm cleared?
- You should go home

321
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,028
Oh, because I'm innocent? People think
I'm guilty of living with him

322
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,468
and of not telling them
he was a monster.

323
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,008
- You're not guilty
- How does a wife not know?

324
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,736
How does she live with somebody
and love him and not know that he's--

325
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,438
Ask him that
Ask him where my life goes now

326
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,880
and then
tell me what his answer is

327
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:29,657
You got the directions. Give the bag
to Weston. Wait on the porch.

328
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,127
- He'll give you something to bring back
- Okay

329
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,257
Five miles over the speed limit. No more,
no less. You get popped,you own the shit.

330
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,858
Gets back to me,
I'll make sure you never have kids

331
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,808


332
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,207
You guys follow,
make sure the drop goes smooth

333
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,808

334
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,023
- Hey!
- Shit Go, go, go

335
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,185
- Go, go!

336
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,131
Stay put, asshole

337
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,135
- You okay?
- Yeah God

338
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,763
- You okay?
- Goddamn it! He got the drugs!

339
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,537
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah I didn't wanna blow my cover

340
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,341
Vic

341
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:27,282
- Oh, shit!
- Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

342
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,322
Cheap piece of shit!

343
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:41,799

344
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,868
- Hey
- No sign?

345
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,869
Glad we partnered up
with this asshole

346
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,496
If I don't make the delivery, we can't
sting Lewis Aceveda's head's gonna explode

347
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,804
We gotta make this right.
You want your first undercover gig...

348
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,810
to go south before
it got off the ground?

349
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,473
I'm gonna go back in there, make it right
with Lewis, tell him what happened

350
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,574
- No, man Trick could've already phoned you in
- Lem's right. No way.

351
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,620
But the guy's only been running
for five minutes He'll be running 20 more

352
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,712
before he stops to make a phone call.

353
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:09,192
- I gotta go back in now
- Hey

354
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:14,630
Okay We're giving you three minutes
Then we'll come and get you

355
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,191
So some nigga just walks up to you
and grabs my shit, huh?

356
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:22,103
- I didn't know what to do
- What you do is not hand it over, you stupid ho

357
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:27,304
- The guy had a gun
- Like this? Huh?

358
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:32,748
- Is that what he did?

359
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,081
Huh?

360
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,687
Huh?

361
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:45,491
Whoo! You just
passed the test, bitch.

362
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:49,590
Whoo! They were my guys,
making sure you were honest

363
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,934
Whoo You're good in the fire
Came straight to me

364
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,498
- Where'd Trick find you?
- Around

365
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,013
Yeah? What? You borrow too much money
from that shark?

366
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,107
How much you into him for?

367
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,016
Enough that I need this job

368
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,981
Well, get to work

369
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,792
- What's your sex life with Joanna like?
- Good

370
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,199
Yeah? Just like
anyone else, huh?

371
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,737
She's never been big on blow jobs--
thinks they're demeaning

372
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,502
- Other than that--
- You'd say you have a normal sex life?

373
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,602
Yeah. Why?

374
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,409
You still thinking I'm impotent?
You shouldn't have gone on TV

375
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,643
and told people
I was something I wasn't.

376
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,948
It's just the profile of the kind of man
who rapes elderly women--

377
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,887
- There's usually a sexual dysfunction at work
- ''Profile''?

378
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,289
You think I'm a chapter in a book?

379
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,159
I just think you're
exaggerating your prowess

380
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,631
Yeah? Why don't you ask
my goddamned wife that? She'll tell you.

381
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,202
You're talking to me about profiles
I'm trying to tell you the truth here

382
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,533
- You raped seven elderly women...
- Nothing to do with Joanna

383
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,733
and cuddled with them for hours

384
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,471
- Why old ladies, Will?
- You think I resented my mother or something?

385
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,605
- You're digging the wrong hole
- Point me to the right one

386
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:15,414
Maybe I picked 'em because they were old,
and they couldn't fight back

387
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,420
You ever think
about that?

388
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,582
What went through your head
as you were waiting for them to come home?

389
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,525
Did you plan exactly
how you were gonna rape them?

390
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,994
I didn't go there to rape them
I went there to kill them

391
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:30,500
- The first four, you just raped
- To set the table

392
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,469
The cuddling was just
to keep them calm...

393
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,006
while I decided
whether to go through with it or not

394
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,565
- If not, I just left
- Bullshit

395
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:44,877
Killing somebody is
about the most selfish thing you can do

396
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:50,546
Taking away all the moments they've got left
just so you can feel that thing for one moment

397
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,057
The victims I chose
didn't have much life left anyway

398
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,462
It just seemed less selfish
on my part

399
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,001
- Everything on track?

400
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,198
Yeah. We'rejust
swappin'out scrips for dummy dope.

401
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,299
I'm on my way to Lancaster to make the drop,
see who's on the other side

402
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,607
I filled in the assistant chief
He's pretty excited

403
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,206
- Yeah We all are
- And no problems?

404
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,308
No

405
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,317
I talked to Ronnie
Trick hasn't been home or to his mom's

406
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,292
- That means he's gotta collect some cash
to get outta Dodge
- Yeah

407
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,661
Hey You were
Trick's shakedown muscle

408
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:38,099
- Who owed him money?
- Bunch of people

409
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,671
Yeah? What people?

410
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,400
Huh? What people?

411
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,171
- Huh?
- Dude works out of some burger joint

412
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,682
- Couple of Lithuanian taxi humps
- Who's the smallest and who owes the most?

413
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,617


414
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,915

415
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,227
Thought we had a D.B.,
but the guy's still alive.

416
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,791
Our panhandler?
I thought you found him a shelter?

417
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,235
He got into a beef with one
of the counselors, and he bailed

418
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,174
- Someone tried to suffocate him with these
- Bag that up.

419
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,906
- Hey No trespassin' No No
- We did the canvassing

420
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,541
- No one's talking
- Who called them?

421
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,644
- I did.
- You think they're gonna cooperate now?

422
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,057

423
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,162
Here he comes

424
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,028
Looks like Trick
chose the path ofleast resistance.

425
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,193
- Pussy


426
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,710

427
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,548
Over here Over here Go on

428
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,555
Let go, man! Come on, man!

429
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,455
- Hey! Come on, man
- Shut your face

430
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,393
I'll take one
with everything on it, huh?

431
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,725
Let's go back to when
you first moved to Los Angeles

432
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:21,329
- Why?
- There are a few open cases from
then I'd like to talk about

433
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,897
- I didn't do anything back then.
- Serial offenders start earlier than 39

434
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,501
- It's more book stuff
- You're just telling me the truth

435
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,604
about the crimes
I've already got you on

436
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,845
- Why would I lie?


437
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:40,050
Why would you rape?

438
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,786
Why would you kill?

439
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,886
I came here so you could tell me

440
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,833
Do you know what it's like to have
a passion--a thing that drives you...

441
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,064
that consumes your thoughts--but never
to be able to say a word about it...

442
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:00,110
to your parents, to your best friend,
to your wife?

443
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,814
I came here to talk about this thing,
to finally be able to talk about it

444
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,374
I came here to talk about this thing,
to finally be able to talk about it

445
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,749
to share it with someone--
to have you tell me why I do it

446
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,416
- Can you help me or not?
- Yes

447
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,620
Then tell me why--
why do I do it? Am I just sick?

448
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,631
No. You're an organized sociopath
with tendencies toward--

449
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,897
No. That's just labels.
Just tell me why I do it.

450
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,735
- To dominate To feel that--
- No That's not right

451
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,401
- To exert your power over--
- No.

452
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,139
- You're compelled to
- By what?

453
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:40,741
- Organized sociopaths tend to--
- Is that who you think you were
chasing this whole time?

454
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,821
A type?
Some answer on an exam?

455
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:48,052
Who would you be chasing right now if
you hadn't stumbled over my parking tickets?

456
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,128
But I did find your parking tickets

457
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,027
What happens if the next guy
reads the street signs?

458
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:06,176
Over here Here you go
Tell 'em your name

459
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,114
- Where's Shane?
- Booking a suspect. I'll have him give you a call.

460
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,675
I need to talk to him about Treasury
I can't talk about it on the phone

461
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,085
You sure as hell can't
talk about it here

462
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,987
They left another message
for my mother to meet them tomorrow

463
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,925
- What does that mean?
- Shane's coachin' her She'll be just fine

464
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,496
No Everything's not fine
We need to get to--

465
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,499
Look You've done
what you were supposed to do Now, leave

466
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,161
Not until I know
what the plan is

467
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,501
Would you stop talking
like you're a part of my goddamn team?

468
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,837
You sucked us
into this shit storm and I'll get us out

469
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,672
but not with you chirping
in my face!

470
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,078
I want you to do something, I'll have Shane
let you know You have questions

471
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:48,619
you keep 'em to yourself,
you sit at home and keep your mouth shut

472
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,522
- Look at y'all

473
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,259
- You got nothin' real
- Bitch, we got Trick downstairs

474
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:06,303
you distributing illegal pharmaceuticals,
possession and intent to sell

475
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,840
- Those scrips you moved
came from across state lines
- We're talkin' RICO

476
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,466
That's at least 1 0 years With the feds,
you won't be out in less than eight

477
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,035
Tell us who's doin'what at A.G.C.
We'll let you stay open...

478
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,707
customize cars,
with one small addition

479
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,412
- What's that?
- Bugs Cameras

480
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,387
- Bug my partners? You're crazy
- We catch 'em on tape

481
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,860
They hang themselves. End of the day,
you can play ignorant, blame your mechanics.

482
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,989
All you got's Trick Who's gonna believe
a homeboy with a rap sheet long as my dick?

483
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,731
Trust me That's long

484
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,567

485
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,904
- Meet our star witness
- Hey, boss

486
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:52,446
- Callan a friend of yours?
- He didn't have friends. He, uh--

487
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,384
- He had issues
- So who tried to suffocate him?

488
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,149
I don't know

489
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,021
This was found
in your shopping cart

490
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:06,688
This is the same kind of rope found tied
around a bag over Callan's head

491
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,700
He was always stirrin' things up,
pickin' fights, stealin' stuff

492
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,771
babblin' his blackJesus shit

493
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,036
- But I didn't put no bag on his head.
- So someone else got your rope.

494
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,804
- Must have
- Come on.

495
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:25,212
No one gets near your cart
without a fight, isn't that right?

496
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,280
I need a drink

497
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,755
I'll give you what you want,
but I'm not doin' any time

498
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,350
- Out of the question
- I'm talkin' 'bout handin' you gangstas, brokers

499
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:41,523
producers, businessmen, dealers--
even throw in a few Republicans

500
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,091
- But like I said-- no time
- Not a day under 1 0

501
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,036
- Okay Ten
- Good

502
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,165
As long as you subtract a year
for every conviction I get you

503
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,803
End of the day,
you gonna owe me time

504
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,753
Thank you

505
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,623
I need a name.

506
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,193
Crazy Eight

507
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,798
No That was just
to get you even

508
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,238
Now, let's talk...

509
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,675
about taking a shot
at pulling yourself up

510
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,475
Artie Cabravansky

511
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,851
- Who's that?
- Artie likes bringin' hardware into South Central

512
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,654
- Who else?
- Rob Kenneally

513
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,025
- Who?
- Runs the Wilshire branch, LA Savings

514
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,894
Floats off-the-book loans
to his buddies

515
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,468
What about this Alison Harden?
What's she into?

516
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,299
Moves underage girls.

517
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,966
Wanna bust some tweener slit,
she's your hookup.

518
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,077
Keep going

519
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,350
Hey You should hear the names
Lewis is spewin' up there

520
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:12,185
- What did you say to Mara?
- I told her we were taking care of it and not her

521
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,259
- She was just tryin'to help.
- We don't need her help

522
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,295
She's in this too Deep

523
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,423
In waters we know how to swim. She starts
drownin: she's gonna take us all down.

524
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:26,663
- You could show her a little more respect
- Why? She stole money from you.

525
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,935
Look, man.
You've known us for years.

526
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,135
She's gonna be gone
in a couple of months.

527
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,645
We all see itJust because
you can't doesn't mean I'm gonna let her

528
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,013
be the thing
that splits us apart.

529
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,448
Ayear from now,
you're gonna be thankin' me

530
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:02,165
- You talked about a ''thing''
- What?

531
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,901
Twice now...

532
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,445
talked about a ''thing''
at the moment when--

533
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,642
- Yeah
- Explain that to me

534
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,189
- Have you ever killed something before?
- Ants.

535
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,884
Bigger

536
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,759
When I was a kid, I found a bird
on the ground, barely moving

537
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,024
I felt bad, so I stepped on it

538
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,930
What did you feel the moment
your foot came down?

539
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,595
I was scared

540
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,434
No Listen

541
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:41,410
When I was a kid,
I brought a puppy home one day

542
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,572
My father told me never
to bring home a stray

543
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,345
so he made me go down
to the stream and drown it

544
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:52,947
He gave me a bag and some rope,
and I walked down a hill

545
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:58,518
to this stream,
got ready to drown this puppy

546
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,427
but it didn't seem right
to kill it

547
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:05,093
just because
my dad said so

548
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,237
So I took it out of the bag,
and I started petting it

549
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,502
So I took it out of the bag,
and I started petting it

550
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:14,806
Just kept on petting it
until I kind of found myself choking it.

551
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,214
There's a look
in a thing's eyes--

552
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,880
people too--
right before they die

553
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:30,325
They're on the edge of this great big hole,
and they'll do anything not to fall in

554
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:36,060
And at that last moment,
looking into their eyes--

555
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,566
You see the face of God

556
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,573
No

557
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:50,045
Well, yes, but that's not
what the ''thing'' is

558
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,911
The thing's not in their eyes

559
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,986
It's in here

560
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,086
It's feeling this--

561
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,893
- Power?
- No

562
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,192
- Intimacy?
- No

563
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,533
Compassion?

564
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,648
I'd like to go back
to my cell now

565
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,991
- What?
- You can't help me

566
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,635
I heard you were still here

567
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,679
I'm sorry I--

568
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,046
I wanted to get the names and addresses
of the victims'families...

569
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,485
because I-- I wanted to write them
to tell them how sorry I am

570
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,389
Um, that's probably
not a good idea right now Maybe later

571
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,825
Oh, because obviously
there must be something I can do

572
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,956
A charity or something
Just tell me what it is

573
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,663
Just tell me
what I should be doing

574
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,796
I can't help you

575
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,208
You know, Mara taking the money
and her mom involved--

576
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,249
- Shane feels pretty bad about it all.
- It's not his fault

577
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,876
- Will you tell him that?
- He knows

578
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,252
Hejust wants to feel like we're not
turning our backs on him.

579
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,293
- We're not
- He wants to feel safe

580
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,726
He is
He's part of this team

581
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,924
Well, Terry was part
of this team too

582
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,293
- And?
- And he got killed.

583
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:57,340
The way Shane was talkin'today, it's like he
thinks we didn't do everything we could've to--

584
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,137
And you believe that?

585
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,680
Shane bother tellin' you
about his latest mistake?

586
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,875
- Sendin' Tavon flyin'through a windshield?
- What?

587
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,885
Yeah. Tavon and Shane, they were
mixin'it up. Mara cracked him...

588
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,887
in the back of the head
with an iron

589
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,787
He got back in the van,
swerved himself into critical condition

590
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,794
Shane tell you about that,
that he came to me lookin'for help?

591
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:23,390
And I put my neck on the line,
cleanin' it up for them?

592
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,103
You need to stop questioning me
and start helping me

593
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:32,904
to put a lid
on Shane's queen bee and her mom...

594
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,036
if you wanna
keep this team together

595
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,788
- Let's get married
- We're going to.

596
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,059
I don't wanna wait anymore

597
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,033
You mean,
you just wanna go now?

598
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,865
Right now
We can be in Vegas in a few hours

599
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,496
But my mom and--

600
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,098
- Well, should we call someone--
someone to meet us?
- No.Just us.

601
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,178
Just us

602
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:13,046
Uh, I'll-- I'll pack
I just wanna look--

603
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,812
You do You do
You're beautiful

604
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,790
- Now?
- Yeah

605
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,025

606
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,332
Where's Matt?

607
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,859
What's the matter?

608
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,406
- He was fighting with Megan.
- Are they okay?

609
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,476
- Everyone's just great
- All right I'll go talk to him

610
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:43,240
He didn't start it She did
Bit him in the arm

611
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,511
- She's just copying him.
- Have you seen her artwork?

612
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,416
All right
I'll get a painter to go over it

613
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,087
She just keeps drawing lines
until I take the marker out of her hand

614
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,188
And then she keeps drawing as if
I never took it away in the first place

615
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,358
There's something wrong with her

616
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,130
- She's a baby
- She's almost two. She barely speaks.

617
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,732
She doesn't make eye contact
Just like Matthew

618
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,834
She just likes to play by herself

619
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,005
She's autistic, Vic,just like him
She's autistic

620
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,982
- We don't know
- We are going to take her to the doctor...

621
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,613
and he is gonna tell us
that it's autism

622
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,623
- Megan!


623
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,785
- Oh, God
- Matt?

624
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:35,855
- You locking him in his room?
- To stop them from fighting To keep him calm

625
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,867

626
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,494
Stop Stop Matt, stop it

627
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:46,235
Mommy's gonna give you a squeeze
I'm gonna give you a big squeeze

628
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,801
- Mommy loves you Calm down

629
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:53,077
Mommy loves you
Calm down

630
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,882
Mommy loves you.
Calm down.

631
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:01,515
Mommy loves you. Calm down.
Mommy loves you. Calm--

632
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:01,725
- Is that our would-be murderer?
- Yeah.

633
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:05,991
- Is that our would-be murderer?
- Yeah.

634
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,759
He was afraid if Callan kept smashin' up cars,
the police would crack down on the block

635
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,597
- Caused the thing he was worried about
- Yeah.

636
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,866
Have you ever thought about
joining the Black Officers Association?

637
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:22,404
- Look No disrespect, but why are you all over me?
- I wanna help

638
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,504
I wasn't aware
I needed any help

639
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,381
You're becoming one of those cops
who's content to let things slide by.

640
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,422
- I made P2 I pull my weight
- Going on blue runs with Mackey?

641
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:36,755
Excessive force charge
in that church a couple months back?

642
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,160
All I see is you taking shortcuts
You need a new mentor

643
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,028
- Anything else?
- I don't wanna bore you
with what it was like for me...

644
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,034
coming up in this department
25 years ago

645
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,229
There was only a handful of black cops,
but we pushed each other

646
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,671
We looked out for each other
We made each other better cops

647
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,470
You opened the door for a lot of us,
and we are all very grateful

648
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:58,674
Yeah Opened it wide enough so that when
a black officer flushes out, no one notices

649
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,080
I am not flushin' out

650
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,518
Well, in a couple of months,
Aceveda'll be out

651
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,352
and I'll be
makin' that decision

652
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,457

653
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,224

654
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,590

655
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,153
