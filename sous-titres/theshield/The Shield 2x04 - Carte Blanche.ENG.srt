1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,928
<i>For his selfless action off-duty
sustaining a gunshot wound...</i>

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,674
during the apprehension
of a major gun-running ring...

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,677
and for exhibiting the type
of individual awareness, initiative...

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,214
<i>and resourcefulness that serves
as an inspiration for all officers...</i>

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,420
<i>I'm proud to hereby present
Detective Vic Mackey...</i>

6
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:24,288
<i>with the department's highest honor
for valor and courage under fire.</i>

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,359
<i>Uh, everybody here deserves one of these.</i>

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,970
I was just the guy holding onto it
when the music stopped.

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,504
<i>Thank you.</i>

10
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,347
- Don't think this means you
get a free pass around here.
- Of course not.

11
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,577
- Congratulations, Vic.
- It was Lanie's idea
to recommend you for the medal.

12
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,550
Really? I didn't know that.
Thank you.

13
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,852
It's important that the public knows about
our successes as well as our failures.

14
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,985
<i>We're running your
Toys for Guns drive tomorrow.</i>

15
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,359
That's where people trade in
their guns to the cops?

16
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,797
Yeah. While, uh, Vic was
laid out in the hospital.

17
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,537
<i>- He came up with this great twist for us.
- Yeah.</i>

18
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,870
They get to fill out raffle tickets for
a big prize when they trade in their guns.

19
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,010
Which gives us their name and address.
We run the gun for ballistics.

20
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,535
If they were used in a crime,
we know where to find them.

21
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,775
You thought of that while
you were on a morphine drip?

22
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:27,078
Well, stolen guns put me there.
I had three weeks to figure out
how to get them off the street.

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,484
I'm impressed.

24
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,922
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Enjoy the toy.

25
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,400
<i>- Next.
- Have a nice day.</i>

26
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,891
- What's your name?
- Patty Ann Hinkle.

27
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,429
<i>- That's a pretty name.
- Thanks.</i>

28
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:50,737
<i>- Where'd you get the gun?
- Home. I don't like it.</i>

29
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,472
- Do I get a toy?
- You sure do.

30
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,609
- Gimme your address.
- It's, uh...

31
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,886
Starting me off with a bang, huh?

32
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,685
A robbery. Ended badly.
One dead.

33
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,763
Witnesses said the shooter gained entry
using a police badge.

34
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:15,291
Number 714. That's your number.
Where were you two hours ago?

35
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,271
- With me.
- Let me see your badge.

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,381
- This is a fake.
- I... I got mugged.

37
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,179
I lost my badge in Tijuana.
I never thought it'd end up back in L.A.

38
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,147
<i>An L.A. cop badge
sold on the black market.</i>

39
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,219
- Where the hell else would
you expect it to be used?
- Let's all calm down.

40
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,757
- Did you know about this?
- No. No, he didn't.

41
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,260
- Where'd you get this one?
- This, uh, Serbian guy in Rosehill.

42
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,999
- It's just like the real thing.
- No. No, Officer Vendrell.

43
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:49,526
It's not. The real thing got used
in an armed robbery and a killing.

44
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,337
I'm gonna clear this whole thing up.
Let me get into it.

45
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,881
I'm sorry, man.

46
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,484
- Where were you two hours ago?
- I was sleeping.

47
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,511
- Aceveda seems pissed, doesn't he?
- It's just like old times.

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,760
- Hey. Who's the dead guy?
- He worked here...

49
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,251
along with our witness,
who isn't saying much.

50
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,402
<i>- You saw this go down?
- Is the shooter white? Black?</i>

51
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,368
He had a mask.
Happened quick.

52
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,735
- What'd he take?
- Nothing.

53
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,345
<i>So he used the cop's badge
to get you to unlock the place.</i>

54
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,813
He murders a guy for no reason,
steals nothing and leaves?

55
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,360
This guy definitely
knew what he was after.

56
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,421
Whatever it was, it wasn't supposed
to be here. Am I right?

57
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,101
What if I told you my buddy and I here
have a little side business...

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,367
helps victims
get their stuff back.

59
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,138
You offered to get his stolen
merchandise back for a fee?

60
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,613
He was hiding something
he wasn't gonna tell a clean cop.

61
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,344
- You thought this would work?
- It already has. He's cooperating.

62
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,184
The store is a front for
an Armenian mob diamond chop shop.

63
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,019
- He told you this?
- He wants his diamonds back.

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,786
They fence hot ice. Recut the gems,
put 'em in different mountings

65
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,421
so they can't be ID'd...
then they resell them.

66
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,567
<i>This is what our shooter stole.</i>

67
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,107
- This is entrapment.
- Just for the jeweler... and he's a guppy.

68
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,677
We're hunting a whale here.

69
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,179
You want us to catch
this killer or not?

70
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,515
Going undercover as dirty cops.
You think you can pull that off?

71
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,917
We can try.

72
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:08,074
You know, being crooked cops when it's my ass
and badge on the line... it's not as fun.

73
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,508
Yeah, well, we're only pretending
to be crooked cops.

74
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,812
So we're not really
taking a cut of the jewelry?

75
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,474
Well, it's always an option,
but today I'm feeling good.

76
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,145
Flip that right there. Yeah.
That's got a little thing right there.

77
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,326
I got some stuff too,
in the back.

78
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:30,626
Aw, man! You havin' a sidewalk sale
and you didn't invite us, Taylor?

79
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,664
- I thought we was on your mailing list.
- This has a remote, right?

80
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,628
Okay. Listen. I gave you Fleetwood,
okay? I'm free and clear.

81
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,602
Just one more favor...
swear to God.

82
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,934
You know who might be movin'
this kinda stuff?

83
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,010
Uh, no. No. I don't usually
travel in those circles.

84
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,113
- Unh. Hey... Oh.
- Find out who does and then buzz me.

85
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,810
Look, man. You know, CIs are supposed
to be registered and paid, man.

86
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,351
Tell you what. Here's a fin.
Go buy yourself a taco.

87
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,617
That's a $50 box.

88
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,358
Thank you.

89
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,567
I can't believe this.
It was a clean shoot.

90
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:10,730
I know. I was hoping lawyers
wouldn't get involved.

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,465
Let's just hear
what they have to say.

92
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,409
Five million makes this go away.

93
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,514
Well, five million makes me laugh.

94
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,720
<i>- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Your officers improperly
entered the Al-Thani home...</i>

95
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:30,848
establishing a pattern
of racial insensitivity and abusive behavior.

96
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,785
<i>- He gave us permission to enter.
- Only after you threatened
to bring in the F.B.I.</i>

97
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,724
<i>You treated him like a criminal, which
escalated the dispute with the neighbor.</i>

98
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,659
- She felt she could attack him.
He needed to defend his life.
- This is ridiculous!

99
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,698
<i>The search was legal.
The shooting, by the book.</i>

100
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,236
We don't agree. I'll be expecting
your counteroffer by the end of the day.

101
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,705
I wouldn't hold my breath.

102
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,937
Did I mention we're also naming you
as well as Officer Sofer in the civil suit?

103
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,305
Think it over.

104
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,152
You Tike?

105
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,088
He'll be back later.
What do you want?

106
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,317
How 'bout an honest answer. A friend of mine
says you're trying to move some hot rocks.

107
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,054
Man. What the hell
you doing, man? Huh?

108
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,029
<i>We're cops.</i>

109
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,065
<i>- It's him.
- Give me the keys.</i>

110
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,004
- I'd like to see a warrant.
- I'd like to see Anna Kournikova
naked on a water bed.

111
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,542
<i>- I'm calling 911.
- Go ahead.</i>

112
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,347
We'll come back in five minutes
and take your report.

113
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,679
I'll start with possession
of stolen property.

114
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,278
It's an exact match
to our crime scene.

115
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,354
Who sold you this stuff?

116
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,084
I'll tell you what. You get the guy
who sold you these down here...

117
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,716
and I'll give you
a third of them to keep.

118
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,990
You'll let me keep a third?

119
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,429
Hell of a deal.

120
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,364
What kinda cops are you?

121
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,970
Ballistics just got a hit
on one of Vic's Toys for Guns.

122
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,836
Oh. Well, maybe they'll
give him a second medal.

123
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,069
Slug from a test-fire matches up
to an unsolved murder from last year.

124
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,505
One of yours.

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,247
Richard Cummings. Yeah.

126
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,920
<i>Who's Richard Cummings?</i>

127
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,557
This is a guy who took a loan from
a shark named Manny Sandoval.

128
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,117
Couldn't pay the money back,
ended up dead.

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,560
It's obvious Manny killed him.

130
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,655
So why does somebody else
have the murder weapon?

131
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,197
- Find out.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,236
- He's talking to his old lady.
- He's not gonna show.

133
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,831
Mmm. Coffee, cigarettes,
and too much joviality. Smells like a 12-step.

134
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,441
Excuse me.
What program is this?

135
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,944
- Gamblers Anonymous.
- Thanks.

136
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,911
It's that time of year...

137
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,118
Two days after the Super Bowl...

138
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,916
everybody finds a higher power
when they lose their shirts.

139
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,613
- I lost 100 bucks on the goddamn Raiders.
- Shh. I'll be damned.

140
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,753
<i>- What?
- That's Manny Sandoval.</i>

141
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,597
<i>- The loan shark? Where?
- In the alley.</i>

142
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,623
So your suspect is hanging
outside the meeting...

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,801
where the guy who owns
the murder weapon is?

144
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,033
- Some coincidence.
- Hell of one.

145
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,538
- You wanna take him in?
- Manny doesn't crack easy.

146
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,680
And he won't sweat unless I'm packing
a lot more info than I got now.

147
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,205
Let's wait and talk
to the gun owner first.

148
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,220
So what's so important?

149
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,518
Hope you hocked enough for bail.

150
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,928
Where's my badge,
you dumb ass? Huh?

151
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,134
Work with me here, all right?
I need a deal.

152
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,694
<i>We don't. We have you
for robbery and homicide...</i>

153
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,034
and being dumb enough to sell
the jewelry that ties you to both.

154
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,340
Look, I needed the money, all right?
But you don't have everything.

155
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,773
- Alex Eznik.
- Alex who?

156
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,939
He runs the Zeroun family
for the Armenian mob. What about him?

157
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,520
<i>- I give you Alex, you shave some years, right?
- Convince me.</i>

158
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,713
I work protection for him.

159
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,721
<i>He owns that jewelry shop I hit.</i>

160
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,452
- And you robbed your own boss?
- I was taking back something
that didn't belong to him.

161
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,722
- That's all.
- Well, why'd you kill the guy?

162
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,764
'Cause he was a thief of Alex's...

163
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,199
who stole some jewelry from
a store I provided protection over.

164
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,137
What? Wait a minute. You work for Alex.
The dead guy worked for Alex.

165
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,446
He robbed from you.
You robbed back and killed him?

166
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,040
- Doesn't sound like a very happy family.
- No. It's not.

167
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,349
Yeah. And Alex
encourages competition...

168
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,784
especially between Russian Armenians
like him and Lebanese Armenians like me.

169
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,285
That's why I didn't mind ripping Alex off.

170
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,654
- What else can you tell me about Alex?
- Everything.

171
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,262
Gambling. Hijacking.

172
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,355
You ever heard a rumor
about a money train?

173
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,427
<i>- What's a money train?
- Story goes it's like a rolling bank vault.</i>

174
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,105
Supersecret.

175
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,700
Supposedly runs out of L.A. every couple of
months to clean their dirty money overseas.

176
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,509
How much money
are we talking about here?

177
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,645
I hear it's big.

178
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,683
So who do I
make a deal with?

179
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,823
- No.
- Why not?

180
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,348
Because we've already got the killer.
This is where it ends.

181
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,229
We got a line on the biggest
Armenian mobster in L.A.

182
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,992
- I'm not running a mob task force.
- You don't have to.

183
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,955
You just have to watch.

184
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,295
Let me return the jewels to Alex...

185
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,030
see if he wants to buy a dirty cop.

186
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,435
You're having too much fun
playing this.

187
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,076
Well, inside I'm a sad clown.

188
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,746
What about the jewels?

189
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,113
You already gave a third to the pawnbroker.
You wanna give the rest to the mob boss?

190
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,414
Well, that's the deal I made.

191
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,952
If I want them to think that I'm a corrupt cop,
I at least gotta be honest about it.

192
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,614
I don't like it. And I especially
don't like you in the middle of it.

193
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,889
Hey. You know how Giuliani
became the mayor of New York?

194
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,827
He brought down the mob.

195
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,801
I wanna know
every move you make.

196
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,871
Absolutely.

197
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,941
There he is.

198
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,484
Mr. Hinkle.

199
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,119
Detectives Wyms and Wagenbach.

200
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,323
We'd like to speak with you.

201
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,662
Is everything okay?

202
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,134
- I wouldn't bet on it.
- Come on.

203
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,834
<i>That's Richard Cummings...</i>

204
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,401
<i>a man who lost a lot of money
in a restaurant.</i>

205
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,649
He's also a guy who was
into Manny Sandoval for $50,000.

206
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,415
Your gun killed him, so don't bother
wasting our time with a bullshit excuse.

207
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,616
- Where'd you get my gun from?
- Your daughter traded it in
during a toys for guns drive.

208
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,253
How much did Manny pay you to use your
weapon... or did you do it for him?

209
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,133
<i>- What?
- We also checked your phone records.</i>

210
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:50,762
You seem to call phone booths a lot.
Is that your bookie or your loan shark?

211
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,601
Certainly wasn't your sponsor.

212
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,303
Where's my daughter?

213
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,582
A complaint has been lodged against you
by a man named Abu Ibish.

214
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,579
- Who?
- Six months ago.

215
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,290
Some bar fight you broke up.

216
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,815
- I don't remember.
- At the Lakeside Tavern.

217
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,558
I get a lot of calls there.
What was the complaint?

218
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,833
This guy says that you used racial epithets
prior to arresting him...

219
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:24,633
derogatory comments
referring to his Arab ethnicity.

220
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,162
This is bullshit.

221
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,731
<i>Well, how would you know?
You don't even remember the arrest.</i>

222
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,774
- I'd remember that.
- Danny...

223
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,709
if you made any anti-Arab comments...

224
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,713
I didn't.

225
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,719
<i>Even in the heat of the moment.
I need to know now.</i>

226
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,851
I didn't.

227
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,397
My name's on that lawsuit too.

228
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,804
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know, but buy me a ticket.

229
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,471
<i>- Yeah.
- Hold it.</i>

230
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,877
He's expecting us.

231
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,884
Mr. Eznik.

232
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,887
I believe these are yours.

233
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,960
- Some are missing.
- That's right. A third.

234
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,227
That's the deal I made with your boy
over at the jewelry store.

235
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,064
You made that deal with him. You didn't make
it with me. A third is a lot of money.

236
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,641
It was a lot of work.

237
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,506
I don't like cops in my social club.

238
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,113
Fine. Then we'll leave.

239
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,010
Oh, uh, you have an auto shop
over on Waverly, right?

240
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,588
Yeah. From what we hear,
it's filled with stolen car parts.

241
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,421
Police are gonna raid it
in about three hours.

242
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,456
- Why are you telling me this?
- Shane and I here are looking to moonlight.

243
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,897
First tip's a freebie.

244
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,967
Next one will cost ya.

245
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,603
Now we're waiting for
the Armenian to call back.

246
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,014
- I said keep this simple.
- It is simple.

247
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,347
Oh, uh, I need a raiding party
at this address in two hours.

248
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,979
<i>- Not a moment sooner.
- To find what?</i>

249
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,680
<i>Nothing. It'll be cleared out
by the time they get there.</i>

250
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,292
Look. I know it's your world, but I'm the one
who lets you work in it.

251
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,129
<i>Clear this with me before
next time.</i>

252
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,154
I would have.
I just didn't have a chance.

253
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,464
- What about this money train?
- If it exists, we'll get to it.

254
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,728
- When?
- Soon.

255
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,499
I'm transferring Shane
off the Strike Team.

256
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,476
- What?
- I see you're listening to me now.

257
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,176
Shane is my partner.

258
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,612
I'm thinking Vice might be
a more appropriate assignment for him.

259
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,553
Where does this bullshit come from?

260
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,282
An all-white team knocking down doors in an
83% minority neighborhood is bad policy.

261
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,428
We had a deal.

262
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,896
I keep my nose clean
You keep your nose outta my business.

263
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,694
<i>Well, Shane didn't
keep his nose clean, did he?</i>

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,161
So we're gonna
find somebody who can...

265
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,799
either a black or a Latino.

266
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,113
- Feeling okay?
- Fine. Just a little office politics.

267
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,149
What's the issue?

268
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,290
- Actually, it's something you
might be able to help me with.
- Uh-huh?

269
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,087
Aceveda's trying to ram something
down my throat.

270
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,126
<i>- You mean adding a minority
to your Strike Team?
- Yeah. That's right.</i>

271
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,257
Mm-hmm.
That was my idea.

272
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,735
And it's a good one, in theory...

273
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,364
but I don't have another spot open
on my squad.

274
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,435
David told me
he was opening up a spot.

275
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,002
- He was mistaken.
- Look. An all-white unit...

276
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,646
smashing down doors
in a heavily minority neighborhood...

277
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,513
It's just bad policy.
You'll get used to the idea.

278
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,851
That's it exactly.

279
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,755
Appreciate your tip.

280
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,857
My men were able to clear
everything out just in time.

281
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,273
- Here you are, gentlemen.
- How did the police know about it?

282
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,073
- Seems like you pissed off
the wrong Lebanese Armenian.
- Hrach?

283
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,206
Once he killed the jewel thief,
I guess he felt compelled to open up.

284
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,509
- How do I shut him up?
- While he's in custody, you can't.

285
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,676
Shit.

286
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,455
How much to have him taken out?

287
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,022
How you doing?

288
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,989
What, killed?

289
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,719
No. It's not possible.

290
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,391
Not killed. Not killed. Just taken
out of jail. I'll deal with him myself.

291
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,468
That'll cost you more than you have.

292
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,138
<i>Yeah, but, uh, it can be done.</i>

293
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,503
<i>- It's possible.
- He's in custody for murder.</i>

294
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,203
<i>Well, I am
the arresting officer.</i>

295
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,341
I suppose if I made a technical error...

296
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,984
violated his rights somehow.

297
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:11,646
Yeah, yeah.
How much to violate his rights?

298
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,557
You want me to release a murderer
so that his mob boss can kill him?

299
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,890
It sounded better the way
Vic explained it to me.

300
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,023
We're not gonna
let Alex kill Hrach.

301
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,692
- Oh. Well, that's a relief.
- We're gonna do it ourselves...

302
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,801
or at least provide
a reasonable facsimile.

303
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,803
All we need is a body.

304
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,146
What do you want now, the keys to the
morgue? When does this stop?

305
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,115
When we take Alex down.
Look, the only way to nail him...

306
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,413
is to catch him
paying us off for the hit.

307
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,389
- I'm pulling the plug.
- Alex needs to see a body.

308
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,188
I mean, showing him a picture of some uni
in Halloween makeup isn't gonna cut it.

309
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,794
If this ends in anything
but total success...

310
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,027
you can join him on Vice.

311
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,138
- What the hell's he talking about?
- Who knows?

312
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,183
<i>- It's a little clammy in here.
- You'll get used to it, Manny.</i>

313
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,347
- I won't need to.
- You fronted Richard Cummings
money for a restaurant...

314
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,823
that closed after two weeks, right?

315
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,256
I don't lend money.
I'm not a loan shark.

316
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,022
<i>- Cummings never paid you back.
- Why would he? I never lent him a dime.</i>

317
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,964
Lance Hinkle also owed you money...
a fortune.

318
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,605
Don't know a Hinkle.

319
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,208
You clear his debt.
He helps you kill Cummings.

320
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,808
Sell it to the Grimms Brothers.

321
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,916
<i>I've got your lies on record.
Now sit there...</i>

322
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,646
while I prove them wrong.

323
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,826
Take Bob and Marcy.
They lived next door to the victim.

324
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,564
He had a prior for kidnapping,
liked young women. I should have seen it.

325
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,361
Could you concentrate
on this case, please?

326
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,364
<i>I'm using it to illuminate this case.
Excuse me.</i>

327
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,097
It was Hinkle's gun.
Hinkle doesn't have an alibi.

328
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:10,866
- It should be Hinkle.
- Hinkle's got nothing to do
with Cummings or the restaurant.

329
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,840
What about the dead guy's wife?

330
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,412
Maybe she and Hinkle, having an affair,
want the husband dead.

331
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,142
The widow's got no insurance money.
She's not involved.

332
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,343
- It's worth checking out.
- Look...

333
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,954
I've got a suspect.
His name is Manny Sandoval.

334
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,919
And I'm bringing him in.

335
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,821
I'm having a hard time explaining why
we're backing you for city council...

336
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,191
when you seem to be wholly unconcerned
with our community's needs.

337
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,859
- What are we talking about here?
- A gang member died in
a drive-by shooting this week.

338
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,038
His gang has demanded a funeral mass
at his family's church...

339
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,632
but our new reverend
refused on principle.

340
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,041
Since then, the church
has been vandalized...

341
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,876
and he has received death threats.

342
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,586
That's unacceptable.

343
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,214
A community's strength
stems from its leaders...

344
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,884
especially its spiritual ones.

345
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,517
I'll assign a protection detail
immediately.

346
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,699
Just got a suicide call.
White male, 20s, just blew his head off.

347
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,435
Perfect. I'm gonna need
your clothes and your wallet.

348
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,209
- What the hell is this?
- We found our candidate.

349
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,845
- Who?
- Some guy.

350
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,718
- What guy? Where?
- Dead guy. No face, no relatives, no problem.

351
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,755
- I'm coming with.
- Sure. We'll meet you there.

352
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,123
- What's the address?
- I think Cacuzza's got it.

353
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,998
<i>They're setting up.</i>

354
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,500
All right.
Set the camera up in here.

355
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,937
Alex is on his way.
We got 15 minutes, tops.

356
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,105
You know what? We'll, uh...
We'll take it from here.

357
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,436
Yeah. We're not done
with the investigation.

358
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,540
Time to swap out the clothes.

359
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,912
- You said he blew his face off!
- That's what I was told!

360
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,954
What did he do, miss?
He's totally recognizable!

361
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,521
Jesus Christ.
He's gonna be here any minute.

362
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,328
God.

363
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,828
All right. Go... Go to my car
and get my shotgun.

364
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,524
- What?
- Just do it!

365
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,237
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

366
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,936
- I'll walk the neighborhood.
- What should I do?

367
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,239
Stop anyone
from killing the reverend.

368
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,179
Try to keep me in sight.

369
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,231
<i>Excuse me.
What are you doing?</i>

370
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,202
<i>- Oh. Hi, Officer.
- Hi.</i>

371
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,774
- What are you doing?
- I know this looks weird...

372
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,071
but I'm a volunteer coach
for a kids' soccer team.

373
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,010
<i>- Yeah. I see that.
- Well, uh...</i>

374
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,717
one of them found a squirrel
by the side of the road.

375
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,480
It was the only way
to get him to stop crying.

376
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,978
I promised to send it
to squirrel heaven.

377
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,886
Okay. Well, that's not really legal.

378
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,888
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

379
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,425
I just wanted Jordan
to feel better.

380
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,831
Well, that's sweet.
Um, okay.

381
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,526
Bury it deep.

382
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,299
Thanks.

383
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,807
- You wanna give him the face-lift?
- I'll pass.

384
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,846
Pussy.

385
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,117
You're not here to realize it...

386
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,724
but you're doing a good thing.

387
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,764
Yeah. That's better.

388
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,994
<i>Okay. Camera's got signal.</i>

389
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,173
- Oh, God.
- Where've you been?

390
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,438
He gives you the money.
You give the signal. You get out.

391
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,378
And hear me... this is it.
Understand?

392
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,314
Sure.

393
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,927
- When he gets the money,
we go... on my mark.
- Got it.

394
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,628
<i>- We gotta go.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

395
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,600
One of them yours?

396
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,639
Hey. Um, no.
I used to play.

397
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,472
- Bye.
- No. Most of these kids don't have fathers.

398
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,705
That's very nice.

399
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,613
We have a game on Sunday.

400
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,252
Maybe if you're not working
you could stop by.

401
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,516
Um, yeah, I'm free on Sunday.

402
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,184
Great.

403
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,030
You killed him yourself.

404
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,896
Yeah. He got a little squirrelly.

405
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,503
We're gonna have to
charge you extra...

406
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,698
<i>- for saving you the trouble.
- All right. Here we go.</i>

407
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,902
- How much do you think he told them?
- We can find out.

408
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,536
He was very involved
in a lot of my businesses.

409
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,910
He knew a lot of things.

410
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,178
Perhaps you can, uh,
help with some protection.

411
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,810
Get ready.

412
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,223
- Hold! Hold! Don't do this to me.
- Holding.

413
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,994
- Like with what?
- Let's talk someplace else.

414
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,234
Son of a bitch.

415
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,445
I'd like to know if any more
of my places are going to be raided.

416
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,082
Give me the addresses.
I'll check 'em out at my station.

417
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,842
It'll take a couple hours.

418
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,681
That's delicate information to give
to a police officer that I barely know.

419
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,789
Fine.

420
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,291
If you need me some other time,
give me a call.

421
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,162
Hey. Wait.

422
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,999
Hagop.

423
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,559
Hagop knows the addresses.
He'll go with you.

424
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,334
- Works for me.
- And he'll stay here.

425
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,140
It's insurance, you know? You have
one of my men. I have one of your men.

426
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,114
Make sure he doesn't catch anything.

427
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,548
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

428
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,390
Ahh.

429
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,563
We believe one of these men
killed Richard.

430
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,995
Claudette, I didn't see his face.

431
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,465
He was running.

432
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,230
Take a look.

433
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:53,308
I'm sorry. I just...
I didn't see a face.

434
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,680
<i>- It was nine months ago.
- It's okay.</i>

435
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,080
<i>There's one thing I don't understand.</i>

436
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,148
<i>The night your husband was killed,
you were home alone with him?</i>

437
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,047
- That's right.
- You have two small children.

438
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,918
It was a Wednesday night, middle of the
school week. Why weren't they in the house?

439
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,929
Their grandmother takes them
ice-skating on Wednesday nights.

440
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,557
They sleep over,
and then she drops them at school.

441
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,132
<i>It would be interesting if the killer
knew the kids wouldn't be in the house.</i>

442
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,330
Fewer possible witnesses...
or maybe to spare them the trauma...

443
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,069
<i>which is odd
unless the killer knew them personally.</i>

444
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,940
- Are you saying that I--
- Excuse me.

445
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,542
<i>Come here.</i>

446
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,958
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,257
- Pursuing an angle of investigation.
- By attacking my witness?

448
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,799
- She's not much of a witness.
- That's right. She's the victim.
I cleared her nine months ago.

449
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,131
You cleared her of any connection
to Manny. What about Hinkle?

450
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,204
She's not in this.

451
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,468
- Maybe it's just that simple.
- Goddamn it.

452
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,738
She's not Marcy.

453
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,708
Now, you screwed up your case.
Fine. It happens.

454
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,711
But don't screw up mine.

455
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,476
- Take that back.
- Later.

456
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,950
Right now,
I'm handling this case.

457
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,919
Alone.

458
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:25,102
Cummings's wife saw you outside the house
the night you killed her husband.

459
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,868
She just positively ID'd you.

460
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,008
You're done.

461
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,426
Hinkle spilled his guts
like a cheap piñata.

462
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,429
How you'd excuse the vig on his loan
in exchange for killing Cummings.

463
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:54,660
Not the principle, though.
Tsk tsk. You're a piece of work.

464
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,929
It's his word against mine.

465
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,970
Believe me. When he's on that stand,
and his little girl's there...

466
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,641
and he's bawling like a baby...

467
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,209
they're gonna believe
every word he says.

468
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,249
I don't need a confession.

469
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,285
Take him.

470
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,952
Let's go.

471
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,587
They could still be undercover.
They could be doing God knows...

472
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,727
Never mind.

473
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,566
Nothing. I guess he didn't
squeal on that one.

474
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,570
What's the next address?

475
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,675
4103 Merrick.

476
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,573
<i>And this is?</i>

477
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,010
Cigarettes, tax-free.

478
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:49,243
<i>Well, your smokers can cough up
their lungs in peace. Next address.</i>

479
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,151
This one's not really anything...

480
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,984
but since we're here,
check it anyway.

481
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,094
- Sure. Give it to me.
- 9210 Escovida.

482
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,924
<i>And this is?</i>

483
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,364
Not sure.
Storage or something.

484
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,733
- It's clear.
- Where the hell you been?

485
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,205
I'm working on another case.
What'd you expect?

486
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,746
- You disappeared. Where's Shane?
- He's working on that hooker sting
I told you about.

487
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:18,773
Hooker sting? What do they have you
doing now, entrapping johns?

488
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,947
He's just talking with them.

489
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,620
Might bring in a few of them later.

490
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,814
Well, you're supposed to
check in every two hours.

491
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,916
Make sure you do.

492
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,391
Asshole's just trying to keep his job.
It's pathetic. Next?

493
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,435
- Hrach?
- Hagop?

494
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,468
- Oh, shit.
- You're alive.

495
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,370
<i>- What's going on?
- You need help here?</i>

496
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,047
All right. Let's go.

497
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,748
What time were you supposed
to check in with Alex?

498
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,585
What happens to Shane
if you don't?

499
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,632
I'm out. I'm out.

500
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,296
Ha. I beat him anyway.

501
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:19,500
Instead of playing poker,
we should be playing poke her.

502
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,976
- Wanna play another one?
- Yeah.

503
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:30,611
In exactly 10 seconds go to the
john. Now say, "wrong number" and hang up.

504
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,684
Wrong number.

505
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,036
Tell you what. This gypsy swill
just goes right through me.

506
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,170
Be right back.

507
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,136
Stay still, asshole.

508
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:35,343
Everybody down! Come on! Everybody!
Down! On the floor!

509
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,786
<i>- Get down on the ground!
- You get on the floor! Get down!</i>

510
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,188
- You too!
- Get your hands up!

511
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,930
<i>Lace your hands, put your palms
on top of your head. Do it!</i>

512
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,600
Alex Eznik, you're under arrest.

513
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,067
Shane! Take him. Shane!

514
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,137
- Shane!
- Yeah.

515
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,640
How 'bout next time I save your ass?

516
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,573
That's a date.

517
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,775
- Anything I need to know?
- Nothing at all.

518
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,984
Yeah.

519
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,435
What are you doing?

520
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,802
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm burying a hamster.

521
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,674
Did you just pay that kid for it?

522
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,579
No. I gave him some money
so that he could go buy a new one.

523
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,025
Okay. You know what?
I'm going to have to write you up for this.

524
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,400
- No. You don't.
- Yeah. I do.

525
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,594
- Look. It's really not...
- Shut up.

526
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,170
Jesus Christ.

527
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,935
All right, ladies.
Move it along. Come on. Let's go.

528
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,971
- Nice bust.
- Oh, it's not over yet.

529
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,209
Once these goons lawyer up,
the word'll get out...

530
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,409
and those places will be cleared out
before we can hit 'em.

531
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,886
So let's move now.
Give me the specifics. I'll send units.

532
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,226
We got a chop shop on Newman.
Cigarette stash on Merrick. A few others.

533
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,989
Uh, something mysterious
on Escovida.

534
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,964
- We'll check that out.
- Something to do with the money train?

535
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,057
It's probably just a jerk-off.
We'll let you know.

536
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,148
Do you think
that's the money train?

537
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,123
I got a pretty good feeling.

538
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,125
So it is real.

539
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,470
What do
you wanna do?

540
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:17,011
At the bar, when I didn't
answer her questions, she called me names.

541
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,809
Why didn't you report this earlier?

542
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,814
I don't know.
I didn't know my rights.

543
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,078
<i>But you do now.</i>

544
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,752
Mr. Ibish, do you remember
Officer Lowe?

545
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,765
- Yes.
- I remember you too.

546
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,257
My first week on the job.
He resisted arrest, became violent.

547
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,272
My partner exercised
great restraint.

548
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,900
- Did Danny use any racial epithets?
- No, sir.

549
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,175
But Mr. Ibish used one or two
towards me.

550
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,069
He's lying. He's covering for her.
You all do that.

551
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,739
What did Mr. Hamad offer you
to come forward with this story?

552
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,014
If he's retracting his statements now,
it's a surprise to me.

553
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:01,351
You told him that if he filed a complaint, you'd
represent him for free in his own civil suit.

554
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,121
That was predicated on his story being true.
There was no quid pro quo for him to lie.

555
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,389
Well, either way,
your case ends here.

556
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,798
Our case doesn't depend on him.
I'm here to discuss your counteroffer.

557
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,063
Well, here it is: Nothing.

558
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,402
Her own partner won't
corroborate her story.

559
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,033
<i>- He doesn't contradict it either.
- We have a wrongful entry...</i>

560
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,406
<i>an innocent man,
and a grieving widow.</i>

561
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:27,450
And I've got a decorated officer
who's fighting to keep this city
safe during very troubled times.

562
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,246
I look forward to a jury
settling this.

563
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,923
We'll be in touch.

564
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,914
Washington, Oregon,
Arizona, Nevada.

565
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,748
This isn't just L.A. money.
This is the whole goddamn West Coast.

566
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,149
Holy shit.

567
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,380
First the head of the Zeroun family,
then this.

568
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,150
Aceveda's gonna be
licking our scrotums for weeks.

569
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,125
I'll call, uh...
I'll call for backup.

570
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,197
- No.
- What?

571
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,767
- We're gonna let it go.
- Why?

572
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,802
We're gonna let it go.

573
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,914
Get over here.

574
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,219
Get over here.

575
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,661
- Tell that bitch you lied.
- What?

576
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:57,103
Tell her you made it up because
you owed me money, wanted to get even.

577
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,741
I can't lie anymore.

578
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:06,407
I got you to take out Cummings.
You don't think I can arrange
to have your daughter be next?

579
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,449
Use your head.

580
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,524
I didn't need a confession.

581
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,856
But it doesn't hurt.

582
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,083
Hey, Vic.
We hit the mother lode.

583
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,655
Credit cards, digital cameras,
phony passports.

584
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,826
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

585
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:50,623
You're the only one
who came up empty?

586
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,194
A case of frostbite,
but, uh, no money train.

587
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,529
You think he gave you
the wrong information?

588
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,570
Either that or it never existed.

589
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,367
What's the matter?
Cage not full enough for you?

590
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,532
So you won't mind
if I check it out.

591
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,111
Why would I mind?

592
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,787
Good work today.

593
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,664
- Good enough to get a chit with you?
- What kind of chit?

594
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,795
I'll take a minority onto my team,
but I get to keep Shane.

595
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,806
Hmm.

596
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,112
He's suspended for a week...

597
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,410
and I get approval
of the new team member.

598
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,711
And I get to approve your approval.

599
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,314
I can live with that.

600
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,445
Then I guess we start lookin'.

601
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,058
- I take it back.
- No need to. You were right.

602
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,333
Hey. Let me buy you a little dinner.

603
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,098
A detective can't personalize
his investigations.

604
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,640
I'm, uh...
I'm not really very hungry.

605
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,841
- Hrach says the money train moves
every couple of months.
- Where does it go?

606
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,185
Next time?
Right into our pockets.

607
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,982
Oh. There's a lot of unknowns.

608
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,389
Well, we can do it right...
be extra careful...

609
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,052
take our time.

610
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,528
You can't really be talkin'
about making off...

611
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,464
with the Armenian mob's
entire Western U.S. kitty.

612
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,868
Goddamn Eastern Euros can't
keep track of their own plutonium.

613
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,008
You think I'm gonna trust 'em
with our cold hard cash?

614
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,845
Huh?

615
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,478
<i>Mr. Hamad dropped my case.</i>

616
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,849
One big city against just me now.

617
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,356
Mrs. Al-Thani, please. I don't wanna
have to put you under arrest.

618
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,986
You! Zayed was a good man!
He would never shoot you!

619
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,133
And we sympathize
with your loss.

620
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,930
If you did, you would have
signed those papers...

621
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,036
and given me peace
and a chance for my baby.

622
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,841
Come. Come here.

623
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:19,207
He will never know his father
because of you.

624
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,509
I'll never forget what you do.

625
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,013
I didn't do anything wrong.

626
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,378
Justice will find you.

627
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,125
Now, you have a king.
She only has a four...

628
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,164
which means you can take her cards.

629
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,666
See? These cards go over here.

630
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,864
Go ahead.
Move these cards over here.

631
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,838
- Matthew?
- You just have to show him, Dad.

632
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,244
<i>Here.</i>

633
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,410
Birthday cake? Vic.

634
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,021
Well, it's somebody's
birthday... somewhere.

635
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,384
<i>It's time to get ready for bed.
Come on.</i>

636
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,119
<i>Go brush your teeth,
put on your p.j's.</i>

637
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,454
<i>- I'm not tired.
- Hey. You heard your mom.</i>

638
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,030
I'll be in in a second
to read you a story.

639
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,928
<i>Go on.</i>

640
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,396
Megan went right to sleep.
No problem.

641
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,105
- How are you feeling?
- Ah. A little stiff.

642
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,234
I'm okay, not too bad.

643
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,710
First day back at work was good.

644
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,646
It's a little early, isn't it?

645
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,287
These doctors. If they could,
they'd put you on bed rest...

646
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,014
until you got something else
they could charge you for.

647
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,954
You seemed pretty anxious
to get back.

648
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,651
<i>- I have a lot to do.
- Uh, it's just that...</i>

649
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,627
before you got hurt, you, uh...

650
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,629
you said you'd leave the house.

651
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,932
You promised.

652
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,740
I know.

653
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,037
If you're good enough
to go back to work, um...

654
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,347
Soon as you can find a place.

655
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,657
<i>What can I do for ya?</i>

656
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,427
- I need a room.
- Oh, yeah.

657
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,436
Oh. Um, you know what?
That's fine.

658
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:39,539
Here. Um, just write your name
and, uh, your police division.

659
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,719
Hey. Is this about
the people across the street?

660
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,619
Hmm?

661
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,156

- Okay. Yeah. That's...

662
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,123
I understand.

663
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,923
I tell ya. The things
he does to her... it's a sin.

664
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,535
Why don't you give me a room
with a view across the street?

665
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,705
You know,
I might be staying awhile.

666
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,438
Ahh.
