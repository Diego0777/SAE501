00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,614
- [Man] Now, / need you to tell the truth.
- Absolutely.

2
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:07,420
- [Man] /s your name Shane Vendrell?
- Yes.

3
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:12,429
- [Man] Are you currently
the mayor of New York City?
- [Chuckles] No.

4
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,329
Have you ever lied to
keep yourself out of trouble?

5
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,803
[Shane]
Yes.

6
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:26,071
[Man] Have you ever won the gold medal
in women's gymnastics?

7
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:28,840
[Chuckles]
No.

8
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:32,542
- [Man] Are you married?
- [Shane] Yeah.

9
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,211
- [Man] Do you have children?
- [Shane] Yes.

10
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,782
[Man] Have you ever been unfaithful
to your wife?

11
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,121
[Shane]
No.

12
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,094
Eatin' ain't cheatin'.

13
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:53,035
I've been fielding calls all day by people
very angry that we put away Antwon Mitchell.

14
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,038
He confessed to
murdering a teenage girl.

15
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,543
Mitchell's always claimed we were targeting
him: now he's screaming that Vendrell's dirty.

16
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:01,908
- People think we're trying to cover our ass.
- That's bullshit.

17
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:06,507
I know. I just
need you to explain it to them.

18
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:16,527
- I'd be a little nervous.
- [Mackey] Yeah.

19
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,358
- So how we supposed to beat this thing?
- Well, it's easier...

20
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:22,331
if you're a pathological liar
or a narcissist.

21
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,461
All right. So Shane's safe.
What do we do about Army?

22
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,732
I heard something
about putting a tack in your shoe.

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,104
- /t messes up the results.
- [Mackey] Along with your foot.

24
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,975
Tack in your shoe. Bar of soap
under the armpit. No proof they work.

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,139
Plus, if they catch you,
they know you're lyin'.

26
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,342
- Come on, Smitty. What do we do?
- All right.

27
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,114
You be the interrogator.
Ask me about some crime you think I did.

28
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:47,351
- You like little Asian boys?
- Let's say I did.

29
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,828
I'd do what they call a substitution.
I'd replace your question in my mind...

30
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,127
with another question
to which the truthful answer is no.

31
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:59,397
/ might ask myself,
"Do / have $ 10 million in the bank? '"

32
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:04,305
And I answer "no." The polygraph
records the response as truthful.

33
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,606
- [Army] And that really works?
- /f you do it right, yeah.

34
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:10,704
- Oh.
- [Mackey] Got no choice.

35
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,276
Captain's got a spotlight on all of us
until you two pass that lie detector test.

36
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:20,154
We got a few days to practice.
We can do it.

37
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,522
[Monica] The officer
Mitchell propositioned was undercover.

38
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:25,960
- We heard he was corrupt.
- [Monica] That was Mitchell's allegation.

39
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,157
- We're investigating.
- [Woman] / was at your first town meeting.

40
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:32,600
- [Monica] Yes. I remember.
- That councilman said
these seizures breed corruption.

41
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:35,867
/ have the officers involved
taking a polygraph test.

42
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,101
I will be happy
to make those results public.

43
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,509
We also hear you're trying to blame Antwon
for those two dead police.

44
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,844
- We're investigating all leads.
- Investigate yourself.

45
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,386
Taking people's houses is what got
those cops killed. Now you're trying to hide it.

46
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,682
How much longer
you gonna let these seizures go on?

47
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,280
[Monica] We don't know
what got those officers killed...

48
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:57,555
but attacking the seizure policy
isn't gonna help us find it.

49
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:00,495
We're reevaluating the seizures entirely.
This department is not interested...

50
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,059
in any policy that inflames the community
or leads to cops'deaths.

Nailin'Antwon's really
shakin'things up.

54
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,652
- What's the fallout on the street?
- Uh, naturally...

55
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:24,847
decapitating the One-niners
has created a power vacuum.

56
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:28,289
Now a few of his sloppy seconds
wanna try on the crown.

57
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,157
So how do we take advantage?

58
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:34,096
Hit 'em up for info on the two dead cops
before the dust settles.

59
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,431
At least until Antwon sets up shop
in prison, circles the wagons again.

60
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:41,870
You think Antwon's lying,
One-niners are responsible?

61
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,441
Don't you?

62
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:51,774
- Hit 'em hard.
- Fine. But I need Shane and Army.

63
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,010
- Not until they clear the polygraph.
- That's not till next week.

64
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,349
I need guys now.

65
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:59,855
Just let 'em work on who killed Carl
and Scooby, nothin' else.

66
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:05,329
They only work the cops' murders.

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,890
- Anything goes sideways with them, it is on you.
- Got it.

00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,565
[Shane]
Looks like Antwon Mitchell...

70
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,834
isn't the only One-niner
on his lawyer's buddy list.

71
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:22,107
- I knew that shylock was dirty.
- Officer of the court runnin' errands
for Antwon Mitchell?

72
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,410
- Gives us a good card to play with Halpern.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,145
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'?
- Lighting up.

74
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,848
No, no. No, you're not. I finally got something
nice where the A/C actually works.

75
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,118
- Toss it.
- I'll blow the smoke out the window.

76
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:38,025
Or you could blow me. I want this to smell
like Corinthian leather, not an ashtray.

00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,097
Come on.

78
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,404
/ heard what happened this morning.
Phillips really threw you to the wolves.

79
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:53,705
Yeah. He hauled me in front of
Antwon's true believers and promised them...

80
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,440
that he would
reevaluate the seizure policy.

81
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:58,914
It's a real shame you weren't there
to witness your handiwork.

82
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:03,980
He's linking it to Carl and Scooby
getting killed. Is it?

83

84
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,284
We don't know.

85
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:13,694
If you can prove the killings had nothing
to do with the seizures-

86
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:16,266
However it breaks, it breaks.

87
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,201
I'm not suggesting slanting evidence.
I'm offering you an olive branch.

88
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,272
High enough to hang myself from?

89
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:24,069
I don't like people
capitalizing on cop killings.

90
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:30,646

- /f you agree to a few modifications...

92

such as no auctioning properties
until the suspects are actually convicted.

93
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,559
That leaves money
in escrow accounts for years...

94
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:45,061
instead of in the community,
where we need it.

95
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,131
It's an olive branch.

- [Halpern] All right, guys.
- Screw.

got Antwon sittin' down.

to your accident? It's back on the table.

What is it with you guys? I look like
I got a pork chop around my neck?

104
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,734

to a meet and greet with a cat named Weed.

- Yeah.

the El Salvadorans.

114
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:55,329
No one specific. All we got to
was that street-level asshole, Pitarrio.

a cat named Gusano.

120
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:20,852
- Where do I find this maggot, Gusano?
- He deals to Pitarrio.

goes down in the polls.

to the street struggle.

- I need you to look at some mug books.

288

Nah. Later for that.
I didn't even get a good look at him.

great-great-great grandpappy...

your ancestors to the man.

You really wanna let him get away
with actin' like he's better than you?

292
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:14,501
/ heard something loud. / came over
to the window to see what it was.

293
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,048
- What did you see?
- No one's gonna know your name.

294
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,245
I only saw one car.
It was dark blue and old.

295
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:25,049
This was about a minute
after the shots.

296
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:28,683
- 1990s? '80s?
- /'m really not good with cars.

297
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,091
Older, I think, like a classic.

298
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:35,329
We're back from the car wash.
The victim was a Latino.

299
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,027
- He was killed during the carjacking.
- Girl heard the shots.

300
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,262
She didn't see the killer,
but she saw a witness.

301
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:42,498
"The shooter had Los Mag gang tats.
He drove the stolen car.

302
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:46,201
Two other Latino males
followed him in a black BMW."

303
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,746
Sounds like your witness called in. Wouldn't
give his name, but he caught a lot of detail.

304
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,247
- [Dutch] 911 get his number?
- No. He called the switchboard.

305
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,909
He knew how to keep his name
and voice out of it.

306
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:09,126
- What you got?
- Unis papered the neighborhood
for this Nigerian named Ade Achebe.

307
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,929
He lives here.
He was tryin' to clean a cop's gun.

308
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,800
- From the make, it looks like Carl's.
- Any connection to the Niners?

309
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:18,671
Haven't seen one,

313
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:34,318
- [Curtis] We got a warrant?
- Just my winning smile.

314
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:37,155
Anybody else
hear those cries for help?

315
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,864
Police.

316
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:48,800
- Here we go. Here.
- [Dog Barking Wildly]

317
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,373
[Continues Barking]

318
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:57,573
- 6-Paul-11. [Echoes]
- Whoa.

319
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:01,310
- That's another radio. Hit it again.
- [Static Echoes]

320
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,182
- Keep hittin' it.
- 6-Paul-11.

321
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:06,620
- 6-Paul-11.
- [Static]

322
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,659
Test, one, two. Test, one, two.
[Echoes]

323
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,196
Hey. Scooby's.

324
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,527
- [Ronnie] Test, one, two.
- Shit.

325
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:21,731
- So somebody executed our best lead?
- We found Scooby's radio.

326
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,103
- Any guns?
- No.

327
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,699
Well, he could've bought that radio
in a pawn shop.

328
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,869
[Mackey]
Or took it from him after he killed him.

329
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,106
This guy couldn't
subdue Carl and Scooby on his own.

330
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:34,651
The whole neighborhood knew
we were lookin' for a Nigerian.

331
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,915
Maybe his accomplices heard too
and tried to tie things up.

332
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:41,924
It feels like it's moving away from Antwon.
Might not even be seizure-related.

333
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:46,725
I wouldn't rule him out just yet. We haven't
found his Salvadoran hookup, Gusano.

334
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,425
- This reads mob to me.
- The neighbors are screaming "blue justice"...

335
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:53,435
payback for one of our own.

336
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:57,837
Let them stick their fingers up his ass.
He's been cold for hours. We just got here.

337
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:03,539
We just need to get a fix on what direction
this is going. El Salvadorans? Nigerians?

338
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,911
Just get me answers.

339
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,515
We should talk to Vic.
Maybe he could find out...

340
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,088
if our dead guy was beefing
with another gang.

341
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:15,716
- We can do anything he can do.
- Including dating his wife?

342
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:18,260
Ex-wife, and we're friends.

343
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:21,354
You wanna keep secrets,
go ahead...

344
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,231
but when it starts interfering
with our investigations, give it up.

345
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:29,136
It's just weird timing right now.
Maybe you should be the one to talk to him.

346
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,833
Where you goin'?

347
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:36,643
Blue classic car,
well-maintained?

348
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:41,410
- That's a classic?
- /t is to Billings.

349
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:44,544
- You're not serious.
- Witness knew enough to call the switchboard...

350
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,646
instead of 911.

351
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:48,748
You're just mad at him
because he took our cases.

352
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:51,157
Witness with a spot-on knowledge
of gang tattoos.

353
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:54,924
- Still not there yet.
- That's dried soap.

354
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:58,195
I thought he was supposed
to be getting you lunch.

355
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,327
So what's up?

356
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,737
[Dutch] We're stuck
on this carjacking murder...

357
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,538
thought you
might be able to help us out.

358
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:12,105
- Sure.
- Anything you wanna tell us about it?

359
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:16,084
- What do you mean?
- The anonymous caller
who witnessed the shooting...

360
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,086
provided a lot of detail-
very thorough.

361
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,157
Called the switchboard,
recognized gang tats.

362
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:25,217
Your car is streaked with dried soap,
like you rushed out without having time to rinse.

363
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:27,388
Dried soap?

364
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:31,161
We had Nicole's blood in O.J.'s bedroom,
and look at what good that did us.

365
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:35,500
- Give me a break.
- We got the bills back from the car wash.

366
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,734
Your fingerprints were
on some of them.

367
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:41,606
You guys must have broken the world record.
I can't get anything...

368
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,976
back from those lab rats
in less than a day.

369
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:47,448
So it'll take a day, but when it does
come back, are we gonna find yours?

370
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:53,654
All right. I was there.

371
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:56,692
And now I'm here, because I didn't feel
like committin' suicide today.

372
00:23:56,794 --> 00:24:00,992
Come on. / was 15 feet away from two
armed bangers who already had their guns out.

373
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:05,296
That's not bein' a coward.
That's livin' to fight another day.

374
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,338
- Why didn't you report it?
- I called in and told 'em what I saw, every detail.

375
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,638
- If I didn't care, would I have done that?
- You should've called us instead.

376
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,441
- Why? So the people here could
think I didn't do something to stop it?
- Did you?

377
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,415
I was outnumbered
and outgunned.

378
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:23,782
Come on. You know you can't
show any weakness in this house.

379
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,185
You saw how they treated Reynolds
when they caught him bawlin' his eyes out...

380
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,782
in the locker room, or Lowe
when his boyfriend threw a hissy fit.

381
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:33,556
- They still make fag jokes behind his back.
- It wouldn't be like that.

382
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:36,792
After what happened to Carl and Scooby,
everybody's looking over their shoulder.

383
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,736
They give us this badge and a gun,
and they expect us to act like Superman.

384
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,277
Like I'm not some middle-aged guy who could
use a few more hours a week on the treadmill.

385
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,040
You're both smart.
You got the facts.

386
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,710
I gotta work
with the people here.

387
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,287
Keep me out of this?

388
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,763
- What are you doin'?
- I'm practicin' for the damn polygraph.

389
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:18,366
Listen, dude.
You're gonna pass it.

390
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:24,738
And after you do,
you should get out.

391
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,443
- For real?
- Look, this team gets into a lot of shit.

392
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:33,921
- You're tellin' me now?
- We always say we're through, okay...

393
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:37,255
but if you're not in 100%,
split while the going's good.

394
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:43,498
'Cause you're either built
for it or you're not.

395
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,560
- [Door Opens]
- Hey, techies pulled a slug
out of that dead guy's wall.

396
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,663
Ballistics don't match
Carl or Scooby's guns.

397
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:52,969
I.N.S. gave us his roommate
off an expired visa.

398
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:58,070
- Idisa Okoye.
- It's "okoye" with me if it's "okoye" with you.

399
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,049
Sponsored by a family
out of Long Beach.

400
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,312
If Okoye executed his roomie, he's gonna need
a place to hide for the next few days...

401
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,856
so grab your swimsuits:
we're headed to Long Beach.

402
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,355
[Birds Squawking]

403
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:16,660
- Lem, Ronnie, go around back.
- [Curtis] You got it, man.

404
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,531
[Curtis]
Come on, Ronnie. Let's go down the side.

405
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,602
Idisa Okoye? Is he here?

406
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,975
- Is he inside?
- Speak English?

407
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,039
- [Speaking Nigerian]
- [Mackey] Idisa? Idisa?

408
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:37,314
- [Woman Screaming]
- [Mackey] Get 'em out ofhere.

409
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:42,085
- [Screaming Continues]
- Army. Army, get these kids out.

410
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:45,025
- [Mackey] Police.
- [Shane] Come on, buddy. Come here.

00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:48,256
- Come on!
- [Screaming Continues]

412
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,300
- [Man Speaking Foreign Language]
- Sounds Russian.

413
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,665
- You ready? Go!
- [Gunfire]

414
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,831
- Cover.

415
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:03,471
He's empty!

416

[Grunting]

417
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,745
- [Shane] Don't move.
- [Crying]
- You all right?

418
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,789
[Gunshot]

419
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:44,585
- [Gun Cocks]
- [Gunfire]

420
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:48,351
He's down! He's down!

421

[Groans]

422
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:55,197
Shit.

423
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,632
- Vic. Hey, thank you.
- Yeah.

424
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:00,862
[Sirens Wailing, Distant]

- You wanna shoot somebody, / volunteer this guy.

428
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:20,048
[Siren Chirping]

429
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,649
We responded to shots fired, :
we found this guy fleeing from the scene.

430
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,661
He involved in the shooting?

431
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,357
It's Idisa Okoye. Sister lives here.

432
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:32,026
Yeah, well,
we found this on him.

433
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:39,231
It's Carl's. Hey, man,
you just snagged yourself a cop killer.

434
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,815
[Chattering]

435
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,017
- Where's your partner?
- He's in the restroom.

436
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:54,318
/'ve got a murder
/ could use some help on.

437
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:57,257
/'ll be with you in a second.

438
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:07,804
I heard you're banging my ex.

439
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:11,897
- Trying to get my attention?
- No. We met-

440
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:16,070
/ hope you're
thinkin'that through.

441
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:25,551
And by the way, we just picked up one
of the guys who killed Carl and Scooby.

442
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:31,218
- That's great.
- Yeah. Weren't you primary on that?

443
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:37,099
Well, we're all here
to help each other out, right? Right?

444
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:44,873
You are in deep shit.

445
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:48,001
We know
you killed two police officers.

446
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:50,636
I didn't kill anybody.

447
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:55,616
Why were two Russians
holding your family hostage, waiting for you?

448
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,511
Let's start with the cops.

449
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,854
Did Antwon Mitchell
hire you to kill them?

450
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:07,419
- Who?
- Why were the bodies left in a seized house?

451
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:15,500
Look, I don't know how it works
back home in Lion Country, but here...

452
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,073
you get the needle for killin' cops.

453
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:21,372
Give yourself a chance,
you start talkin', namin' names.

454
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:30,478
You say I killed someone:
I say you are wrong.

455
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:34,250
They found the police radio
in your apartment.

456
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:37,087
You had one of their guns
on you when they picked you up.

457
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:40,493
Both were taken off the bodies
after they were killed.

458
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:47,130
I am tired now.
I am going to take a nap.

459
00:30:55,512 --> 00:30:57,776
Okay. Settle down.

460
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,817
Now, even cop killers
have rights.

461
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:05,752
Sleeping just
isn't one of them.

462
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:13,327
This guy doesn't even know
to ask for a lawyer.

463
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,398
You give me the night, I'll get him
to own up to stabbing our guy.

464
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,060
It just doesn't add up.
Why are the Russians involved?

465
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,002
- We'll figure it out.
- Looks like it has nothing to do with the seizures.

466
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,596
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Yes.

467
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,939
The Russian guy from the house
won't say a word...

468
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:30,012
but I tied him
to Carl and Scooby.

469
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:34,140
They pulled his boss over a few weeks back,
clocked him doing 50 in a school zone.

470
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:38,654
They got into some kind of argument,
and they tossed the guy in lockup overnight.

471
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:43,158
- What?
- Carl liked to get in people's faces.

472
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,491
They got killed
over a speeding ticket?

473
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,735
[Dutch] We need you
to /.D. the shooter on the record.

474
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,775
- [Billings] Why?
- [Claudette] Unis pulled over the stolen car.

475
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,037
- He was Los Mag, long rap sheet.
- So why do you need me?

476
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:05,308
Because he's not talking. We don't know
who his accomplices are.

477
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:08,145
- We didn't find a murder weapon.
- You guys are the best detectives here.

478
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:11,220
Tell him you got 10 witnesses.
Break this asshole and get him to confess.

479
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:14,222
We tried.
You're our only eyewitness.

480
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:17,521
- [Claudette] / know you're scared.
- [Billings] Come on.

481
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:21,427
Can you honestly say you wouldn't
have done the same thing?

482
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:25,558
/ know /'m an asshole for asking,
but, please, take another crack at this guy.

483
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:28,638
- I'm beggin'.
- Well, don't.

484
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:44,450
Ever heard of Andrei Tretiak?
He's Russian organized crime...

485
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:47,648
same as the comrades who are
holding your family hostage.

486
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:51,124
You're safe and sound here
in the police station, but what about them?

487
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:54,254
They already
killed your roommate.

488
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:57,856
We stopped them before
they raped and tortured your family.

489
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:04,772
Next time, they'll be quick.
They might let the kids live...

490
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:10,710
but only if they cut their eyes out
so they can't be identified.

491
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:15,274
[Monica] But it's over for you. /t was over
the moment you killed our two officers.

492
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:19,981
But I'm giving you a chance to save the lives
of your sister and the rest of them.

493
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:32,591
- How would you protect them?
- We'd move them out of state.

494
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:36,194
But you'd have to give us a statement
and leave nothing out.

495
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:44,772
- [Mackey] Did Tretiak hire you?
- I can't say.

496
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,907
Achebe arranged everything.

497
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:51,215
Well, while we're
gluing his brains back together...

498
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,984
you give us something
on these Russians.

499
00:33:55,091 --> 00:34:00,495
- Just did what Achebe asked.
- [Monica] And what was that?

500
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:05,292
Well, he was given names
and pictures.

501
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:10,806
We followed them, your officers.
We waited for our opportunity.

502
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:15,867
Then they went into an apartment,
so we opened a manhole cover.

503
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:21,383
When they came back,
we told them we heard a child below...

504
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:24,715
so they bent down to look.

505
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:29,417
That's when I stabbed the Asian one
in the back of the neck.

506
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:35,431
He was paralyzed,
couldn't move his arm.

507
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,628
But the other one, the black one,
he fought hard.

508
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:43,194
So / went to help Achebe.
We stabbed him-

509
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:46,639
We kept stabbing him,
but he wouldn't die.

510
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:52,112
And then we heard the Asian one.

511
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,241
He was still breathing...

512
00:34:55,352 --> 00:35:00,813
so I went, took him down
and finished him as well.

513
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:03,791
Cut him here.

514
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:09,694
And then we carried them
into the building...

515
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,768
the one you had stolen...

516
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:16,771
just as Achebe was instructed.

517
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,039
- [Mackey] We straight? Let's go.
- [Knocking]

518
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:28,174
- Yeah?
- Hey.

519
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:30,878
I just wanted to say
that it really means a lot to everyone...

520
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:34,616
that you guys nailed those assholes
who killed Carl and Scooby.

521
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,954
This old team
still has a few new moves.

522
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,325
- Yeah.
- Still gotta get the Russian string pullers.

523
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,093
Also, we got a lead on Antwon's
Salvadoran connection, a guy named Gusano.

524
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,361
You still think
Antwon's involved?

525
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:50,496
Oh, we think he might be connected
somehow. We're on the way there now.

526
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:54,634
Shane and Army have other business first.
Polygraph in 10 minutes.

527
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:57,269
- Gang Central.
- [Mackey] / thought that was next week.

528
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,474
You know the public pressure
we're getting on this.

529
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,347
/f / have to stand up for this team,
/ need assurances, and / need them now.

530
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:08,152
If you can put it off till tomorrow,
this Salvadoran might fill in some blanks for us.

531
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:11,159
These two are staying.

532
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:14,890
Anyway, good work.

533
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,370
Did you have
to get such a pretty tester, Captain?

534
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:31,038
- Try and relax.
- I'm just saying you got my heart rate up.

535
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,583
Could you take a few points off
for me, darlin'?

536
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:37,619
I'm gonna ask you a series
of questions first just to make sure...

537
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,620
the machine's working properly.

538
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:42,691
- Okay.
- Make your answers accurate and honest.

539
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:47,654
[Machine Beeps]

540
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:54,326
- Is your name Shane Vendrell?
- Yes.

541
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:56,769
- [Chattering]
- Gusano.

542
00:36:56,873 --> 00:37:01,867
- What's up, man?
- /'m here to talk about Pitarrio
and his heroin cutter...

543
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:03,912
Emolia Melendez.

544
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,208
- Cops?
- [Door Opening]

545
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:10,946
- Yo, man. /t's a friendly visit.
- [Gusano] Since when are cops bein' so friendly?

546
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:16,492
Pitarrio lost something of yours.
Emolia was worried that you might blame her too.

547
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:19,756
/ helped her to get it back.
Now /'m helping to make it right.

548
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,161
Here.

549
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,730
[Spanish]

550
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:36,503
Tell her to relax, :
don't even trip.

551
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:40,549
As soon as I tell you to stay the hell away
from her and her kid.

552
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,521
Thank you very much.
/t's very nice to meet you.

553
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:52,288
- Hey, it's not that bad.
- [Monica] Army, let's get started.

554
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,228
- I'm not taking it.
- You're what?

555
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:58,198
I talked to my P.B.A. rep,
and he said I can refuse to take it.

556
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:01,031
But we got-
we got nothing to hide.

557
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:05,767
And I can't get penalized for it either.
He said polygraphs are subjective...

558
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,470
and the results aren't worth shit,
and that's why they're not admissible in court.

559
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,709
- This isn't about covering your own ass.
- [Exhales Sharply]

560
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:15,807
We have to prove
that we didn't set up Antwon.

561
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,888
If people believe that,
they'll think we framed our cop killer.

562
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:22,321
- Everything will fall apart.
- I'm sorry. That's not my problem.

563
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:29,055
It is about everyone in here...

564
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,360
and how people think of us
out there.

565
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,700
You are screwing every single cop
in this building.

566
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:40,003
This has nothing to do with anybody else.
This is about taking care of me.

567
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,773
- The guy's just nervous-
- No! It's too late.

568
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:53,789
[Door Slams Shut]

569
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:58,959
The injunctions are keeping the gangs indoors.
/'m surprised to say it...

570
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:01,622
but Monica's policies
are really starting to take an effect.

571
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,858
The public sees us
as having our boot on their neck.

572
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,492
- When does the press get good on this?
- We're seeing a difference.

573
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,764
Somebody just has to report it.

574
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:13,205
- Don't shut it down now.
- [Aceveda] She brought down
Antwon Mitchell, for Chrissake.

575
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,437
- You've been pissing on
her policies. Why the change?
- /'m allowed to reevaluate...

576
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,639
my position,
as long as she's willing to also.

577
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:23,014
- I really think there's a middle ground
we can be happy with.
- Like what?

578
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,056
No. Compromise, retreat
is the worst thing we can do...

579
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,718
and you'd be abandoning the memory
of those two dead cops and all they fought for.

580
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,956
Christ. Don't play that card with me.
Most people in this town...

581
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:37,726
still think they were killed
because of your seizure policy.

582
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,600
Well, they weren't.
It seems it was a traffic dispute.

583
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:45,105
Do we know that for sure? Is there any proof
we can put in front of the people?

584
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:50,407
I'll find it.
As for the seizures, they stay, or I go.

585
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,711
Then you can tell the brass how you lost
one of L.A. 's two female captains...

586
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:57,980
because she was too tough
on crime.

587

00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:07,558

l- Oh.

/ took care of Gusano.
He's not gonna be a threat to you anymore.

591
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,246
You can stay here for a few more days,
but after that...

592
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:28,874
/ can only
fudge the paperwork for so long.

593
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:31,112
We'll be fine.

594
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,158
How's this little guy?

595
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:39,626
- Has he been to a doctor?
- Sure.

596
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,131
What'd they say?

597
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:49,261
I gotta make him eat,
get him into a preschool.

598
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:55,140
He used to talk more,
but some of the stuffhe's seen-

599
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,542
I'd keep my mouth shut too.

600
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:08,814
I'll go pick up a few things,
make you guys a little more comfortable.

601
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,950
Maybe that'll get him
back to talking.

602
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,028
Thanks.

603
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:28,699

- Thanks. Really.
- You're welcome.

- No, thanks.

00:41:57,874 --> 00:42:02,834
- Vic's put me through hell, but
never anything this malicious.
- He just said that to hurt us.

609
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,846
- So you're not trying to get close
to me just to get back at him?
- No.

610
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:08,007
Absolutely not.

Maybe at first a little,
but I really like you now.

612

Look, / put up with Vic's shit every day,
so is asking you out a perk?

613
00:42:22,231 --> 00:42:26,565
Sure. Vic's an asshole.

614
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:31,106
He's the father of my children.
That makes him my asshole, not yours.

615

- It's not where we started: it's where we are now.
- It started with a lie.

where we are now.

- I'm sorry.
- You think this is easy for me, dating again?

I told you it was a bad idea,
but you kept pushing it.

- What about my kids?
- I love your kids.

620
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,319
You weren't honest with me before.
How can I even trust you with them now?

- Or trust myself to you?
- Corrine.

you couldn't handle: I told you that.
