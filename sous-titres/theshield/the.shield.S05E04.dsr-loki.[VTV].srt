1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:03,917
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:04,850
I have an attorney
for you.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:05,950
I'm Becca Doyle.

4
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,351
If everything hinges
on her,

5
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:10,050
I'd be a fool to
give up that hammer.

6
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,384
Just like you were foolish for
letting me know how important she is

7
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,384
to making your case.

8
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,783
You're looking
for more business?

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,284
Right now I'd like to go home
and wash this place off.

10
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,451
Has anyone from the
department come around

11
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:20,451
asking any
questions?

12
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,850
Someone has been
asking questions.

13
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,050
He said he was a parent
of an autistic child.

14
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:26,117
That him?

15
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:27,050
Yeah.

16
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,817
Pittario,
where's your stash?

17
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:32,251
About 6 months ago,

18
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,451
we found this kilo
of pure heroin

19
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:35,618
in the glove compartment
of your car,

20
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,883
but you never logged it
into evidence.

21
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,417
Lem got picked up
by IAD.

22
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:41,050
Got him
wearing a wire.

23
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:43,551
I'm going after Mackey
and his team.

24
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,984
And I'm going to be right here
to make sure you don't blow it.

25
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,484
We got to see our next
moment. When he jumps dirty,

26
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,551
we'll know.

27
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:50,484
Here.

28
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,384
It's OK.
I'm on the clock.

29
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,584
I thought you were
Vic's CI.

30
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,184
Whoever's got the money.

31
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,883
Check 1, 2,
check 1, 2.

32
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,084
Good. It's good.

33
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,950
Hey, I need admissions
from Mackey and the others

34
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,651
on crimes they committed,
all right?

35
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:11,050
Questions make cops
suspicious.

36
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,651
You walk out of the room
every time he opens his mouth

37
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:13,651
to say more than
good morning.

38
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,017
You think I haven't
noticed this?

39
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,351
I'm just doin' my job,
all right?

40
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,551
Vic and I aren't
attached at the hip.

41
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:19,551
Well, then get attached!

42
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,251
'Cause you're
dragging this out,

43
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,883
trying to have it
both ways.

44
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,484
You're torturing yourself.

45
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,150
You made a choice.

46
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:32,317
It was the right one.

47
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,984
And now you got to start
living with it.

48
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,317
Hold on a second, OK?

49
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,584
One second.

50
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:54,117
L... I know it's your birthday.

51
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,883
You mentioned that
you're a fly Fisher

52
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,517
on one of the tapes.

53
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,284
Thanks.

54
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,050
We're going to be working
together for a while

55
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:10,284
and I just thought, you know...

56
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,618
I know this is tough.

57
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:17,917
But we're both going to make
our way through all of this.

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,384
All right?

59
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,783
Yeah.

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,883
I would've pegged you
for a corner office.

61
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,783
First time a police officer's
stepped foot in here.

62
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,050
I've got a case
that'll interest you.

63
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,718
My schedule's full

64
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,750
and I've been finding
my own cases since I was 30.

65
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:46,584
Not like this one.

66
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,384
5 minutes.

67
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,750
Everything
I'm about to say

68
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,684
falls under attorney-client privilege.

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,150
Yeah, but it doesn't
obligate me to take your case.

70
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,184
IAD's launched
an investigation

71
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,684
into one of the guys
on my Strike Team.

72
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,783
I don't represent cops.

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,950
Especially corrupt ones.

74
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:10,417
We're good cops.

75
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,451
This is about the system
turning its back

76
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,117
on 4 of its own.

77
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,451
You'd be better off
going somewhere else.

78
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:19,451
You shuffle gang bangers
in and out jail all day.

79
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:23,684
This is a chance for you to
take a shot at the big boys.

80
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,783
What do they
have on him?

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,384
Claim they found a brick of tar
in his glove compartment.

82
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,584
It's bullshit.

83
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,718
What else?

84
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:33,883
The only thing
I know for sure

85
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,351
is that they're going
after my whole team.

86
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,184
Guy named Kavanaugh
is in charge.

87
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,850
I'd dig into it myself, but it
would raise too many red flags.

88
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,684
Now there's the first
real truth I've heard.

89
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,217
You want to keep your knowledge
of the investigation secret,

90
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:47,817
and no one would suspect
I'm working for you.

91
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:50,317
So we agree that
you work for me then.

92
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,417
I've got an old boyfriend
in the city attorney's office.

93
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,384
I'll ask a couple questions.

94
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:59,150
But that's it.

95
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,551
Next thing I knew
she was laying there.

96
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:10,584
Fiji, Barbados... all those
tropical vacation places,

97
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,317
you're talking typhoon.

98
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,317
Just looking out
for you.

99
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,917
Look out
for the tape.

100
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,117
Angle looks car-to-car.

101
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,950
Bumper's got a dent.
Could be fresh.

102
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,184
Maybe there's an incident
out on the road,

103
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,417
someone in the other
car shoots,

104
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,150
victim veers off here.

105
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,584
Oh, Christ.

106
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,084
Get additional units
down here.

107
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,684
Tell Danny
I said now.

108
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,251
Umbilical cord.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,953
TAPA BOCA

110
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,617
Then get me a witness,

111
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,118
a description of the
other car. Something!

112
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:56,283
If they wanted the child,

113
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,617
why risk pumping the mother
with bullets?

114
00:04:57,684 --> 00:04:58,851
Someone wanted it
to look random.

115
00:04:58,917 --> 00:04:59,851
Maybe the boyfriend.

116
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:00,884
What do we know about him?

117
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,350
Works nights
in a machine shop.

118
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,884
Hasn't been home
since the murder.

119
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,951
I've got unis
stationed at the house.

120
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:06,951
Vultures are gathering.

121
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,717
I'll get rid of 'em.

122
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,684
Wait, wait. No, no, no.
Let's use them.

123
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,951
Somebody
knows something.

124
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,383
We just need to pull
the right heartstrings.

125
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,017
All right. Good. You
keep working. I'll do it.

126
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,017
Wilshire's not giving us
any bodies for the search team.

127
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,350
Not if we can't prove
the baby's alive.

128
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,118
That's bullshit!
Call again.

129
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:26,317
No. I'll call.

130
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:29,450
Who would do something
like this?

131
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:32,851
What'd the ex
have to say?

132
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,151
Absolutely nothing.

133
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,450
And I called a couple
adas I went to school with...

134
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:37,917
quiet on all fronts.

135
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,084
Good.

136
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:40,250
Not good.

137
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,017
None of them offered
to look into it for me,

138
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,383
which means they know
something major's in motion.

139
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,317
What haven't you told me?

140
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,784
David Aceveda's name
come up with your friends?

141
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,084
The city councilman?

142
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,184
He's assisting Kavanaugh
in this investigation.

143
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,584
Why?

144
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,584
Because he used to be
captain here.

145
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,350
He had me pushing the
legal line a couple of times

146
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:04,383
when it meant getting
a killer off the street,

147
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,517
making him look good
to the voters.

148
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:10,184
Overseeing the investigation means
he can steer it away from himself,

149
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,118
make me and my guys
play the heavies.

150
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:14,784
Starting to get your
blood running yet?

151
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:18,417
I'm interested in the true story of
this heroin they caught Lemansky with.

152
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,350
What does he say
about it?

153
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,450
I haven't been able
to ask him.

154
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:22,684
IAD's got him
all wired up,

155
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:24,017
listening to our
every word.

156
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,084
Well, they wouldn't
make that move

157
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,650
unless they had a witness
or corroborating evidence.

158
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,884
I'll find out what I can.

159
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,951
Good.

160
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,484
Me, too.

161
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:41,517
So the kid's about,
well, uh... here.

162
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,617
Right?

163
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,851
The knife goes in,
goes straight down,

164
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,051
got to be careful
about the depth.

165
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,218
I'd say it's intuitive.

166
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,383
You wouldn't need
medical training at all.

167
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,051
So tell the newshounds

168
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,784
we're not looking for einstein,

169
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,884
just a garden-variety
psychopath,

170
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,218
possibly a woman.

171
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,917
Usually it's a woman
who's recently lost a baby

172
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,650
or who's been claiming
to be pregnant.

173
00:06:58,717 --> 00:06:59,751
I'm never going
to be able to sleep

174
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,250
until I have
this kid.

175
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,517
Yeah, I'm here.

176
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,650
You're not going to get
any sleep then, either.

177
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,751
Thanks. 911 received a call
at 5:17 this morning

178
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,151
from a payphone
one block from the scene.

179
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:11,417
They hung up.

180
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,317
That could be
our line to the baby.

181
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:15,184
So how
we gonna find them?

182
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,617
You've got to convince them
to come to us.

183
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,517
Need another cup?

184
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,383
Two should do it.

185
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,650
We on that
missing baby yet?

186
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,084
No. Dutch and Claudette
are handling it.

187
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,317
Captain wants us
available to round up

188
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,051
all the other
miscellaneous sickos.

189
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:41,218
Listen, I'll
be back in a few.

190
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,350
I gotta take a dump.

191
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,584
Smells like
you already did.

192
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:52,650
All right. 5 minutes to hear
what's going on with Kavanaugh.

193
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:53,751
Every detail.

194
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,051
He suspects
I'm protecting you.

195
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,417
All right? I've been helpful,
but not too helpful.

196
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:59,017
Nothing he can check out.

197
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,283
Any chance
he's got a witness,

198
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,350
someone who saw you
take that tar?

199
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,617
Shit.

200
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,317
Pittario.

201
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,584
Or Emolia. I mean, she
was in the house, too.

202
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,184
No, no, no. I got

203
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,383
a 6-month relationship
with her. She's solid.

204
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,851
Pittario's the one
with an axe to grind.

205
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,283
Look, if they got
Pittario, man, I'm screwed.

206
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,884
We don't know that yet,
but we're gonna find out.

207
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,350
No, no, he puts
that heroin in my car,

208
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,517
makes IAD's case,
what then?

209
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,751
A first-time offender,
you do what?

210
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,084
5 years max,
probably less.

211
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,884
Shane...

212
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,851
I'm just saying
worst case scenario...

213
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,817
you refuse to wear the wire,
you let Kavanaugh arrest you.

214
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:36,283
We'll work behind the scenes
to undermine him,

215
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,784
and you'll seal us off
from this, right?

216
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,317
Look, the shit you've done
and I'm the one going to jail?

217
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,751
Nobody's going away.
Are you kidding me?

218
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,283
Hasn't been a jam yet
we haven't slipped out of.

219
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,550
There hasn't been
a witness before

220
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,650
or an IAD cop
wiring one of us.

221
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,250
Nobody jumped ship when Antwon
had your balls in a sling.

222
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,684
And I was willing to
put a bullet into Antwon

223
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,650
to keep it off the
rest of you. Remember?

224
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:54,684
Yeah, and we got you
out of that

225
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,951
before you had to
go through with it.

226
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,550
Which is exactly what
we're gonna do for Lem,

227
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,118
but if we can't...

228
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:03,184
you're gonna look out
for us, right?

229
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,784
Yeah.

230
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:11,851
OK.

231
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:12,951
OK.

232
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,517
But we're gonna get you
clear of this.

233
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,450
Now, Ronnie and I will
track down Pittario

234
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,383
and we'll squeeze
his balls.

235
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,550
I hate this.

236
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,151
Don't worry.

237
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:24,784
We got you.

238
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,250
Let's get the wire
back on.

239
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,218
What kind of a person cuts a
baby out of its mother's stomach?

240
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,617
The kind that shoulda
been an abortion.

241
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,383
There's the man.
Gimme a sec.

242
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,484
For what?

243
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,383
Aceveda's been updating me
on a few things.

244
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,051
Be right back.

245
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,517
Councilman!

246
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,584
A moment
of your time.

247
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,984
What is it?

248
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,851
Some asshole dumped
a few couches

249
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,350
over on benton.

250
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,951
I got a la-z-boy
over on Scott.

251
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,751
Bums find that out,
it's a motel 6.

252
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:04,717
You screeched up here to talk
to me about trash pickups?

253
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,917
Billings is too squirrelly to
ask the city for an extra dime.

254
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,151
Someone's gotta do it.

255
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:14,684
Hey,
we got a 187!

256
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:18,317
Anyway Farmington's garbage
is your area.

257
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,617
That's a little below
my pay grade.

258
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,250
Call someone
in waste removal.

259
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,118
OK.

260
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:27,350
But I hate to see your entire
district become a fire hazard.

261
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:32,917
Get what you need?

262
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,817
Yeah, he was very helpful.

263
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,817
The car's on this side.
Down there.

264
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,550
Hank Preminger.

265
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,550
Green Explorer
came around the corner,

266
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,084
started blasting
as he exited the diner.

267
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:45,283
Nice piece.

268
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,417
Let this be
a cautionary tale.

269
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:48,884
You find that heroin dealer?

270
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,218
Pittario cleared out
of his house.

271
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,317
He's a ghost.

272
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:52,317
Only sign of life is

273
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,984
a couple of squatter
crackheads.

274
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:57,550
Hey, telephone worker got
a bird's-eye from the pole.

275
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:58,784
He getfor the suv?

276
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,484
No, but he gave unis
a partial plate

277
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,617
on a witness who
had a better view.

278
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:02,817
Another white guy,

279
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,650
jumped in his ride after
the shooting, took off.

280
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,851
All right.

281
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,584
You guys work your angle.

282
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,484
Lem and I will figure out who's got
a problem with the hair club for men.

283
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,784
All right, man.

284
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,350
That baby is still
out there.

285
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,884
This disgusting crime occurred at
approximately 5:15 A.M. This morning.

286
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,650
E beg you,

287
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,784
while the baby
can still be saved,

288
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,017
Please call if you have
any information

289
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,650
about the altercation that
led to the heinous murder

290
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:28,650
of isabelle arrington.

291
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,218
We need you to call
our tip line.

292
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,383
I pulled the records
of every single person

293
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,984
who worked with
isabelle arrington.

294
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:38,017
So far just petty stuff.

295
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,584
Here's our grieving
boyfriend.

296
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,650
Your neighbor told us isabelle
was screwing somebody else.

297
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:45,751
That's bullshit.

298
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:46,784
Baby probably
wasn't even yours.

299
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:47,951
Don't you say that!

300
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,717
You goddamn liar!

301
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:51,851
If the baby's alive,
tell us.

302
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,984
Oh, God.

303
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:56,784
Please let him be alive.

304
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,283
It's a boy?

305
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,151
You noticed that when you cut
him out of isabelle's stomach?

306
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,450
We did one of those scans.

307
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,283
We saw his stuff.

308
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:10,218
You gotta believe me.

309
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:16,851
OK. Um... we'll get somebody
to give you a ride home.

310
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,350
Stay by the phone, OK?
We may have more questions.

311
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:22,350
You accuse me of slicin' my
baby out of my girl's stomach,

312
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,851
and now you want me to
go home and wait on you?!

313
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,151
We're sorry for your loss.

314
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:28,817
I don't want your
damn apologies!

315
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:32,517
I want you to find out
who did this to her!

316
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,051
And where my baby is!

317
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:39,250
Victim did a stint
in Lompoc 8 years ago.

318
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,084
Been clean ever since.

319
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,350
No family, but coworkers
at the pet store

320
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,383
said he's
got no enemies.

321
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,350
These matches to the
partial plate on the witness?

322
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,084
Yeah. I ruled out
50 of them.

323
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,851
Got about a half-dozen
possibles here.

324
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,717
Pittario hasn't been
arrested in 6 months.

325
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:01,151
That's the longest he's
gone since he turned 18.

326
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:02,751
He's off the grid.

327
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,383
If the him up and he made
a deal to give up Lem,

328
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,684
that arrest wouldn't
show up on his record.

329
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,617
Check this out. Leon Frankel.

330
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:15,617
Lives in the same building
as our victim.

331
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,751
Turns out they both got
the geds in Lompoc.

332
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:20,517
Oh. Let's find out why
hank's study buddy

333
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:23,151
didn't stick around
to talk to the police.

334
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,517
We lookin' at this guy
as a coward or suspect?

335
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:28,484
Well, whichever jacket fits.

336
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,218
Hold on. Hold on.

337
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:34,017
Is that Leon Frankel?

338
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,317
That's me.

339
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,118
We were just on our way out
looking for him.

340
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,218
What did he do?

341
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,484
We were canvassing
on that baby.

342
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,617
He threw a bottle
at the car,

343
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:41,650
cracked the windshield.

344
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:42,984
Then he asked if he could

345
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:44,250
smell my sweet spot.

346
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,717
Even shane stopped
using that line.

347
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,917
Pretty stupid way to get
yourself arrested, Leon.

348
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,584
I had a bad day.

349
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,917
That bad day include

350
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,051
seeing your pal hank
preminger shot dead?

351
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,684
If a friend of mine
was in trouble,

352
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,717
I'd do everything I could
to help him out.

353
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,817
Sit down.

354
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,650
I was scared.
I heard shots. I ran.

355
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:07,151
Hey, look, maybe if I
sit here for a while,

356
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,383
something will come to me.

357
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,250
You're walking down the street
with your enemy-free friend hank.

358
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:19,283
Shots go off, he's dead and you know
those bullets were meant for you.

359
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,250
Now you're not safe.

360
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:25,017
You're too damn cheap to spend
20 bucks on a fleabag motel.

361
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,984
You get yourself arrested because it's
safer in here than it is out there.

362
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,684
Only we're not your
goddamn bodyguards!

363
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,084
Who did it?

364
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:34,817
L... I don't know.

365
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:36,851
Get out.

366
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,851
What?

367
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,350
Get out!

368
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,751
Get out!

369
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,051
No, no, no.
Wait a second.

370
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,817
I remember
a green suv.

371
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,684
Great. Think of anything else,
give us a call.

372
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,317
We're releasing Leon
on his own recognizance.

373
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:54,617
Wait a minute. He's
supposed to post bail.

374
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:55,917
I'm overriding bail.

375
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,017
You're gonna get me
killed out there.

376
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,250
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

377
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:02,317
OK, OK, come on.
Please.

378
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,450
A couple days ago
I had a client,

379
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,717
fell behind on his payment.

380
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,218
Awesome pool player.

381
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,218
Now, I knew this guy,
right?

382
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,450
He did me a solid
back in the day.

383
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,917
We used to hang out
at Gary's tavern,

384
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,584
a little place on sunset.

385
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,450
Cut to the part where
someone wants to kill you.

386
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:20,851
My boss gus wanted me to take
a crowbar to his right arm,

387
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:24,584
and if I did that, his break
would never be the same.

388
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,151
So, you know, I gave him
an extra 24 hours.

389
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,650
Most loan sharks don't take too
kindly to independent thinking.

390
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:31,984
Look, gus never
would've known,

391
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:33,317
but this ungrateful prick

392
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:36,250
disappears with
the 40 large he owes.

393
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,684
Now gus thinks
we split the money

394
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,817
and he wants me dead.

395
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,817
And your friend hank takes
the hit meant for you.

396
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:46,417
Yeah. I feel like shit
about that.

397
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,684
Who shot at you?

398
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:52,383
I'll bet you anything it was that
little ass-suck works for gus.

399
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,917
He's always trying to
hone in on my business.

400
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,383
What's his name?

401
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,784
I don't know.

402
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,517
I just call him ass-suck.

403
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:03,984
Excuse me
while I get a kleenex

404
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,450
for the rest
of this sob story.

405
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:06,684
It's a protection game.

406
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:09,684
I got all these young guys
comin' up behind me.

407
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,051
It's like no one wants
Leon to get ahead.

408
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,584
Jesus, what
took so long?

409
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,283
I had to track Pittario
through ins.

410
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,617
Miguelez construction registered
his social security number

411
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,851
with payroll 2 months ago.

412
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,851
Scumbag got a real job?

413
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,317
He's working on a site
over on hillhurst.

414
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:25,484
Pittaro's breaking a sweat,
we know he's into the feds.

415
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,584
Let me wrap this up.

416
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,817
Hey! You're early.

417
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:35,884
So am I. Ha ha.

418
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:37,917
How's andy?

419
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,751
He's good actually.

420
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,917
He's inside.

421
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,250
Um, I was wondering,

422
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:46,118
how old was andy
when he was diagnosed?

423
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:48,751
Around 3.

424
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,717
There's an andy
at this school,

425
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,450
but he's not your son.

426
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:53,951
What's going on?

427
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,751
When were you planning on
telling me you're a cop?

428
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:57,350
Who told you that?

429
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,417
Nobody.

430
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,684
I was married to one.

431
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,350
I see them everyday
in the e.r.

432
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,317
You all walk the same.

433
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:06,450
Ha. Yeah, we do.

434
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,484
I'm a lieutenant,
IAD.

435
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,084
You'd make a good
detective, Corrine.

436
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,350
I don't know what you want or
why you've been lying to me,

437
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,350
but stay away.

438
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,717
Ms. Mackey.

439
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,383
I need you to know that
your husband and his team

440
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,317
are under investigation.

441
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,784
So what? I was his wife,
not his partner.

442
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,283
I don't know what your
involvement is yet,

443
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,017
but you and are going to
do a lot more talking.

444
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,984
And you mention
anything to him about me

445
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,817
or this investigation,
it is obstruction of justice,

446
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,784
so I find out that you told him

447
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:38,784
anything about this case,
that's on you,

448
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,951
and that's prison.

449
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,118
We'll talk later!

450
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,218
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't a baby,

451
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,317
just so you know.

452
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,151
It's very generous
of you to come in.

453
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,717
Could you tell us
what you saw?

454
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,784
That pregnant lady decided she
had to turn all of a sudden,

455
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:00,884
almost drove
into that other car.

456
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:03,118
Other car,
think it was white,

457
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:06,984
goes honking, gets crazy,
starts shootin'.

458
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,317
911 put me on hold.

459
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,851
5:30 in the morning.
So I hung up.

460
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:14,051
You said you saw
something on the car,

461
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:15,617
something that could help?

462
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,151
The white car had one of those
decals on the back window.

463
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,450
What did the decal say?

464
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:20,617
Jevontrey.

465
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,051
<i>I have a nephew named
Devontrey.</i>

466
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,517
So I remembered
the decal.

467
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:27,017
It was one of those
R.I.P. ones.

468
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,617
The kind that
shoulda been an abortion.

469
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,450
There's the man.

470
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:34,784
Gimme a sec.

471
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:36,517
For what?

472
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:39,851
Aceveda's been updating me
on a few things.

473
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:40,951
Be right back.

474
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,017
Councilman!
A moment of your time.

475
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,817
What is it?

476
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:50,250
Come in.

477
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:55,017
You said you have
an update.

478
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,684
Lemansky's
birthday's today.

479
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,383
His pals, they
either don't know

480
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,517
or they just
don't care.

481
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:04,118
That's the update?

482
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,383
My best friend
forgot my birthday,

483
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,383
I'd be pissed.

484
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,717
This could be
a way in.

485
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,151
Anything interesting
happen with you today?

486
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,784
Like what?

487
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,817
Like visitors?

488
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:25,884
Mackey?

489
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,218
He came by the office.

490
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,283
What about?

491
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,817
Some bullshit
sanitation complaint.

492
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:33,917
I think he just wants
to shove it in my face

493
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:37,051
that he's de facto
running the Barn.

494
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,751
You didn't call him?

495
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,584
Don't have regular sit-down
meetings with him or anything?

496
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,584
Just trying to figure out
which uniform you're wearing,

497
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,383
councilman.

498
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,450
Well, it sure as hell
isn't Mackey's.

499
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,084
Sorry for getting you
down here.

500
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,218
Next time I have
a birthday alert,

501
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:58,584
I'll just call you
on the phone.

502
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,350
You're not safe here
anymore.

503
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,951
I'm taking you. We
got to go, got to move.

504
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,350
Why? What happened?

505
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,184
We got a couple
of possible leaks.

506
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,617
Get your stuff.
Whatever Sebastio needs, OK?

507
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,617
You said Vic
wouldn't find out.

508
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,984
I'm not saying
that he has.

509
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,051
Either way, he calls,
you don't answer.

510
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:32,118
He comes by, you're not
going to even be here.

511
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:35,484
The volume on this thing
just got turned way up.

512
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,151
Let's go.

513
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,107
Pittario!

514
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:51,040
<i>Sí.</i>

515
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:53,307
Yes, I'm Pittario.

516
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:55,541
Nice try, dickwad.
We know the guy.

517
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,974
Where

518
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,940
give me your papers.

519
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,974
Let's see 'em.

520
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,640
Let's see 'em.

521
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:03,907
You got a job off this.

522
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,974
What'd Pittario get
for his papers?

523
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,207
He got dead.

524
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:09,141
Dead?

525
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,640
What? You sure
he's not laying low,

526
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,608
taking a cut off of your
hard-earned money?

527
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,807
Huh?

528
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,638
No. 3 months ago,

529
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,307
we were down
in el sa

530
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:19,241
doing a heroin deal.

531
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:20,907
The sombra negra...

532
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,341
he got to him.

533
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,773
And he sliced
his neck in half.

534
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,141
You got to consider
Emolia.

535
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:32,341
They might have some other kind of
corroborating evidence against Lem.

536
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:38,407
Man, she's got a messed
up kid, she's got no job.

537
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:39,673
If the IAD offered
her a deal,

538
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,441
she could've
jumped at it.

539
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,807
I've spent time
with this girl.

540
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,241
And the boy.

541
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,608
She's not going
to turn on me.

542
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:48,174
Why don't you
call her then?

543
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,174
Check in.

544
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:53,341
Emolia!

545
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:56,508
Emolia!

546
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:05,141
Sir? Have you seen
the woman who lives here?

547
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,141
<i>¿Que?</i>

548
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:07,707
<i>Niño, mujer.</i>

549
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:09,508
<i>Ya se fue.</i>

550
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,608
<i>Hace como dos horas.</i>

551
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:17,040
<i>Se metio en un carro
con un negro.</i>

552
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,141
<i>Gracias.</i>

553
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,541
Thanks.

554
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:22,040
I got every decal place in
town checking special orders.

555
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,673
Meantime I need
an extra pair of eyes.

556
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,707
3 years of death
in L.A. County.

557
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,874
Holler if you see
a Jevontrey.

558
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,874
Wagenbach.

559
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,007
Dutch, it's Corrine.

560
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:36,374
Are you there?

561
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:37,940
Hey! What's...

562
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,874
I need to ask you
some questions.

563
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,907
Oh
I can't right now.

564
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:44,608
Please. I'm pulling up now.
It's important.

565
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,907
Sorry, I didn't know
who else to call.

566
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,107
I can't stay long.
What's going on?

567
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:50,608
Promise this stays
between us, OK?

568
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:53,341
Promise that you're gonna
give me straight answers,

569
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,207
no matter what
you think of Vic.

570
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,840
Of course.
Well, what is it?

571
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,608
Some IAD guy's been coming
to the kids' school,

572
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:00,673
trying to get me
to say things about him.

573
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,374
IAD's into Vic?

574
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,574
I wonder what
they've got on him.

575
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,508
I mean, probably
take your pick.

576
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:08,673
Listen, I don't know, but he's
threatened to send me to jail

577
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,107
if I said anything
or if I don't cooperate.

578
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,374
I need to know if
he's bullshitting me.

579
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,307
I mean, can he
send me to jail?

580
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,307
Well, a lot of times
a person who goes down

581
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,007
didn't have anything to do
with the original crime.

582
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:21,907
They found out about it
afterwards, lied, covered it up.

583
00:23:21,974 --> 00:23:23,707
Well, what about
spousal privilege?

584
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:26,707
They can't force you to talk,
but if they can prove

585
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,274
you knew about
any of Vic's actions,

586
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,874
it makes you
a coconspirator.

587
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,407
What's going to happen to your
kids if something happens to you?

588
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:33,474
You see?

589
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,541
You're their best leverage
against him.

590
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:38,441
But I don't know anything.

591
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,640
Well, then,
take away their leverage.

592
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,707
Be completely up front
and honest.

593
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,307
L-l-I'm sorry.
I've really got to go.

594
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,141
Hey, um...

595
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:53,574
why would someone
take prednisone?

596
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,974
I don't know.
A lot of reasons.

597
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,074
Arthritis, lupus,

598
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,274
asthma,
crohn's disease.

599
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,673
It's a common
antl-inflammatory.

600
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,640
Thanks.

601
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,341
I'm sorry.

602
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:09,740
You don't have to
memorize every picture.

603
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,740
Just flip.
Flip it, man.

604
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:13,241
You want me
to make a mistake?

605
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,274
Cut the guy some slack,
all right?

606
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:17,541
He's got a target
on his back.

607
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:19,508
Emolia, it's me again.

608
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:22,307
I got a Salvadoran
thing going on.

609
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:24,374
It's time-sensitive,
so call me back.

610
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,441
I need some air.

611
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:31,407
I'll come with.

612
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:33,574
That's the guy
that works for gus.

613
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,407
That's ass-suck.

614
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,673
Right there.

615
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Justin Lamott?

616
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:38,840
Emolia's gone.

617
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:41,107
Neighbor saw her leave
with a black guy.

618
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:42,541
Kavanaugh.
You call her cell?

619
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,574
3 times,
including just now.

620
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,107
You're her paycheck.

621
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:49,874
When is the last time she didn't
call you back in 5 minutes?

622
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,207
If Kavanaugh
got to her somehow,

623
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:53,141
it's nothing
I can't turn around.

624
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:56,374
He's probably got her stashed
in a safe house somewhere.

625
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,107
Come over here.

626
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,707
Had to start
with Pittario.

627
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,874
IAD flips, some shithead ends up dead.

628
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,907
They got nothing...
they go to Emolia,

629
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,407
twist her against her will.

630
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,274
What does she know
besides the heroin?

631
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:14,341
Nothin'.
I've kept her clean.

632
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:17,241
Is there any chance Lem's
really working with these guys?

633
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,307
See, that's what
Kavanaugh wants...

634
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:20,807
for us to doubt
each other.

635
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,407
This guy's using
every angle.

636
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,707
Prick talked to Corrine
at our kids' school!

637
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,874
This guy's chattin' up
your ex?

638
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,107
You think you might
have mentioned that?

639
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,508
I just did. Warn Mara.

640
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:33,807
Ronnie, you tell whatever
you're bangin' this week,

641
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,574
don't talk to strangers.

642
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,807
All I need is 5 minutes with
Emolia to coach her on what to say,

643
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:40,907
let her know that
we're there to help her.

644
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,407
Trust me, we find her,
this whole thing goes away.

645
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,307
Well, how are we
gonna find her?

646
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,541
Hey, we got an I.D.
On our shooter.

647
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:51,441
Justin Lamott.
Vehicle matches.

648
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,508
Yeah. Better luck
than we're havin'.

649
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:55,574
We're gonna need to
stick Leon in a safe house

650
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,407
until we make
the arrest.

651
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:01,207
All right. I've got a list
of available hud houses.

652
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:04,407
Let me see.

653
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:10,940
These are for captains
and above only.

654
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:14,241
Captain.
They found the baby.

655
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:20,174
Won't leave your office.

656
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:32,508
The bones in his chest
are essentially pulverized.

657
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,141
Pulverized? How?

658
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:35,807
I'd say a fist.

659
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,074
Somebody punched
a newborn?

660
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:40,407
Stepped on him, maybe.
There's a variety of trauma,

661
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,407
skull fracture,
knife wound on the left leg.

662
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,074
I'll know more later.

663
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,608
Thanks for the rush.

664
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,407
On this one,
anything you need.

665
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,707
A typhoon in fiji's looking
pretty good right now.

666
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,773
Did he even have
a chance?

667
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,174
Crime scene says
he died hours ago.

668
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,874
It's a special
kind of monster.

669
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,074
Yeah, and that monster's
name's tevares glade.

670
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,707
Just got a call back
from a decal place on pico.

671
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:05,407
2 years ago, tevares
placed a special ord

672
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:07,007
R.I.P. Jevontrey.

673
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:09,907
In honor of a dead
uncle. Pulled his record.

674
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:14,174
Tevares drives
a white monte carlo.

675
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,940
And has 6 arrests,

676
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:19,241
all for violent crimes. 4
of them with a Sean deeks.

677
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,341
Why did 2 men cut a baby
out of a woman's stomach

678
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,907
just to beat him
to death?

679
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,640
There were more than
2 of them. Look.

680
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:26,274
In the blood.

681
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:31,207
Fingerprints. Jesus,
he's covered in them.

682
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,907
The big ones tevares glade,
or Sean deeks... maybe both?

683
00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:36,508
But the little ones...

684
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:39,341
you think maybe
there was a girl here, too?

685
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:48,141
Ass suck, 12:00.

686
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,907
Out of 6 rounds, this dude
manages to get 4 in the wall,

687
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:52,508
2 in the wrong guy.

688
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,341
Loan shark
hired a professional.

689
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:57,274
That's some shit to be
dealing with on my birthday.

690
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,307
It's your birthday?
We should get wasted, man.

691
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:00,940
Yeah.

692
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,441
Hey, buddy,
you Justin?

693
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:04,874
Why?
Why?

694
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,341
Gus sent us.

695
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:08,773
Little pissed off about the way
things went down this morning.

696
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,307
What are you talking about?
You shot the wrong guy.

697
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:12,474
I didn't shoot the wrong guy. I
seen that prick hit the ground.

698
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,107
But you saw his friend hit the
ground. You just confessed to murder.

699
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:18,074
You want to spare yourself the
needle, tell us where to find gus.

700
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:19,640
Gus!
All right, all right!

701
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:25,608
Justin ided the loan shark,
got 'em both.

702
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,241
You tell Leon
he's in the clear?

703
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:28,907
Yeah. Freak tried
to hug me.

704
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,673
But you insisted
on the blow job.

705
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,541
I musta ate somethin'
this morning.

706
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,407
Third time
I gotta shit today.

707
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:39,074
Be sure to inform us
of number 4.

708
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,640
Look, Pittario's
a dead end... literally.

709
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,907
We think Kavanaugh's gonna try
to get Emolia to give you up.

710
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:51,940
I don't even think
she saw me take the h.

711
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:54,673
Good. Meantime, Vic's
convinced a little t-l-c

712
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,907
puts her on our side.

713
00:28:55,974 --> 00:28:58,074
If Kavanaugh finds out we
got to her, this blows up.

714
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:59,640
We even know where
she is?

715
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:02,574
Ronnie and I checked out the
safe houses, came up empty.

716
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,508
But her son has occupational
therapy twice a week.

717
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:08,807
Emolia won't let Sebastio
miss those.

718
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,874
I chased down this
therapist's unfaithful wife

719
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,141
in exchange for a couple of
sessions for Emolia's kid.

720
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,940
What do you want me
to do?

721
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,974
Just put on your wire,
head home,

722
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,773
kick back your feet,
have a beer.

723
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,773
Kavanaugh's
turning up the heat.

724
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,107
We think, uh...

725
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:26,574
we think he might be planning
to formally arrest you.

726
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,574
If that happens, we'll
be ready to bail you out.

727
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:32,907
Hey.

728
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,541
Hey, I need you two guys.

729
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:43,040
This old man here, he's
been waiting here for hours.

730
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:47,740
Apparently, some assho moving around
in a camper trailer.

731
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:50,508
The guy sets up streamers, flags...
whole thing's very patriotic.

732
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:54,807
He's selling care packages and bogus
body armor to our troops in iraq.

733
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:57,640
Grandpa here paid 300 bucks
of-the-art vest.

734
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:00,107
His grandson called from
iraq when he got the mail...

735
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,474
let me guess...
piece of shit.

736
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,541
Yep.

737
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:04,840
Go pull a car.

738
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,907
Glad to see you two kids
are workin' it out.

739
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:14,574
yeah.

740
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,707
Your p.r. Instructor said you
weren't in class the other night.

741
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:19,141
Yeah, well,
something about

742
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,040
almost having to blow
a van full of skin peddlers

743
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:23,007
made me wanna go home
and drink a bottle of wine.

744
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:25,807
I wasn't up for baton training
that night.

745
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,541
So you missed a class
with no valid excuse.

746
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,107
I took 3 classes
already.

747
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,807
And when exactly
do you lay off?

748
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,940
When I feel safe
riding with you.

749
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,107
There's our patriot.

750
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,074
Put him in the cage.

751
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,707
Night, officer.

752
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,807
What's a little bit like
you doin' being a cop?

753
00:30:57,874 --> 00:30:59,740
Put your hands
on top of your head.

754
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:05,407
What'd he do?

755
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,341
He a murderer?

756
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:17,107
Hey, listen, I know we're
shorthanded and everything,

757
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,574
but do you think
I can get reassigned?

758
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,807
You want
a different t.o.?

759
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:22,707
I've tried with Julien.
I really have.

760
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,874
If there's murderers here...
it seems like he doesn't know

761
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,307
the difference between
teaching and bitching.

762
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:29,441
I can't be in here
with murderers!

763
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,907
I've taken
3 baton classes.

764
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,040
My instructor thinks
I'm doing great.

765
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:34,840
It's Julien...
he just keeps on...

766
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:36,341
gotta have a room
or something!

767
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:39,107
Look, we don't have a room.
This isn't an inn.

768
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:41,508
This guy's in here
for resisting arrest.

769
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,007
And this guy's in here
for scamming grandpas

770
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:47,608
into buying bogus body armor
for their grandkids over in iraq.

771
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,807
No murderers. So don't get
your panties up in a bunch.

772
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,673
Same goes for you.

773
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,040
We found your fingerprints
on the baby, tevares,

774
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:00,374
dried in the mother's blood.

775
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,907
Sean and tevares
killed that lady

776
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:03,673
so you could have
the baby.

777
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,907
And then what? He got too
much for you to handle.

778
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:09,274
He cried too much.

779
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,541
So you let them
beat him to death.

780
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:14,840
<i>We also have your friends.
We've got their finger prints.</i>

781
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:17,907
Pretty soon, one of them's
gonna start to talk.

782
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,673
Good defense attorney'll just says
they found the baby in the dumpster.

783
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,673
Fingerprints mean
they tried to revive it.

784
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,608
Think the girl's
the way to go?

785
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:30,907
She's our best shot.

786
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:33,441
Want me to give it a run?

787
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:35,207
I've got someone else
in mind.

788
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:37,874
OK. Let me feel him...

789
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,474
like right here.
It's his foot.

790
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,174
You wanna touch it?

791
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:50,840
You know, I didn't even...
ever really want a baby.

792
00:32:50,907 --> 00:32:52,773
But now I've...

793
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,974
I guess you're too young to
know what I'm talking about, huh,

794
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,508
all those maternal
feelings and all?

795
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,474
Which is why I'm thinking
that you did the cutting.

796
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,474
No.

797
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,673
Oh, come on.

798
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,374
Those idiots you're
hooked up with,

799
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,141
they wouldn't even
know how to make a baby,

800
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:10,441
much less cut one
out of somebody.

801
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:23,474
You feel it? That man
lost his baby son,

802
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,407
his girlfriend.

803
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:28,407
Bitch brought that
on herself.

804
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,940
Is that why
you wanted that baby?

805
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:35,007
You didn't think
she'd be a good enough mother?

806
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:38,207
Shit, we didn't even
know she was pregnant.

807
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:39,874
When you shot her?

808
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,773
She almost ran us
off the road.

809
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,007
My man don't stand
for that.

810
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:45,807
She almost killed us,

811
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:49,040
so... shooting her
was like self-defense.

812
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,673
Right?

813
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,673
We didn't see the belly
till she got out of the car

814
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,707
and started
trying to run.

815
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,707
They was just gonna
drive off,

816
00:33:57,773 --> 00:34:00,508
but I said, "no.
We gotta save the baby."

817
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:03,141
They was thinking
they was gonna sell it.

818
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,840
But my sister myesha, she had
2 abortions when she was my age.

819
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:09,707
Now she wants a baby.

820
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:13,441
But... those doctors messed
up something in there, so...

821
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:17,341
I thought maybe
she could take him.

822
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:19,907
But the baby
wasn't breathing right,

823
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,574
so we did the stuff
you see on doctor shows.

824
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,174
We... cleared out his mouth
and turned him upside down.

825
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:30,608
But that didn't work,
did it?

826
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:35,508
So I made tevares do
that cpr stuff and...

827
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,207
the minute
he pressed down...

828
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:41,541
we heard everything
crack.

829
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,040
That's enough.

830
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:46,807
We was just trying
to save...

831
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:49,074
you know what? Just...
just stop talking.

832
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,444
They've given this
Kavanaugh carte blanche

833
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:04,177
to work your case,
any resources he needs.

834
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:06,643
What's Kavanaugh
trying to nail you for?

835
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,578
Because this isn't about
some misplaced heroin.

836
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,777
Aceveda and the department
need a poster boy for corruption

837
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:18,377
to sell their softer,
gentler force to the voters.

838
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:20,777
Why pick you
as a scapegoat?

839
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:23,144
You're a push-the-envelope
kinda lawyer.

840
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,077
I'm a push-the-envelope
kinda cop.

841
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:27,211
Which Aceveda
sanctioned.

842
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,511
This really does
go to the top.

843
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:33,077
There's some pretty
high-powered cages to rattle.

844
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:35,743
So you'll
represent us?

845
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,610
Just you.

846
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,511
No.

847
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:40,944
We're a team.

848
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,877
The four of us
come as a package.

849
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,277
I've seen these things
go down.

850
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,478
Everyone eventually needs
to look out for themselves.

851
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,411
You don't understand.

852
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:52,177
We're not the typical
lowlifes that you represent.

853
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:54,077
We're a family.

854
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:57,444
We're surviving this together,
or we go down together.

855
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,311
Hey, hey!

856
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:08,344
I need some officers
in here... quick!

857
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,377
Stand back!

858
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,277
What the hell are you doing? What?!

859
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:29,377
You took your gun
into the cage?

860
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:31,743
Someone could have
grabbed your weapon!

861
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,710
Do you see all these
people around you, huh?!

862
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,077
Look at me.

863
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,411
You trying to kill
one of them...

864
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,377
or you trying to kill
one of us?

865
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:42,710
Hopefully
one of you!

866
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:09,044
You know why
you're dangerous?

867
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:12,544
'Cause this isn't real
for you yet.

868
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,311
So you're gonna
get on me, too?

869
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:19,743
If you wanna be a cop, you
gotta recognize your mistakes,

870
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,444
learn from 'em.

871
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:26,478
All I've done is try to be
nice to you... to everyone.

872
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:30,177
You got a problem with me,
it's because of your own shit!

873
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,977
You're used to being
the queen bee around here,

874
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:36,144
but you don't get so much attention
now with those stretch marks.

875
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,211
So you're gonna make
my life miserable.

876
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:42,743
Every cop here has made
mistakes... including you.

877
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:47,944
And I bet you anything all of
you got cut more slack than me.

878
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,910
If you go out of this room with
that sniffly nose and those red eyes,

879
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:55,910
those guys will never,
ever respect you.

880
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,478
So you pull your shit
together.

881
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:03,277
Jesus, it's bitches like you that
make the job hard for the rest of us.

882
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,010
Hey, man,
where is she?

883
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:15,144
She hasn't
come out yet.

884
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,111
She should have been
outta there 10 minutes ago.

885
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:18,944
You sure you saw her
go in?

886
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,211
Yeah, man, unless
she went out the back.

887
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:27,478
OK. Here we go.

888
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,244
Get in.

889
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:40,344
Is she getting
an IAD escort?

890
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,710
Hey, hang loose.
They might be watching.

891
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:06,444
You're not going
on vacation, are you?

892
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,677
I haven't decided
where yet.

893
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,677
No, um...

894
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,144
you're sick.

895
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,177
How sick?

896
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,710
Dutch, I was here
yesterday.

897
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:21,643
I'm here today.
I'll be here tomorrow.

898
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,311
I don't know what that means.

899
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:27,810
I'm your partner.

900
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,444
Look, all that stuff
I said

901
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:36,144
about you not being
committed, checked out,

902
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:38,610
I'm...
Dutch.

903
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,111
It's OK.

904
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,211
I got to take
these pills.

905
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:24,010
If anybody shows up,
you call me.

906
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,677
Vic. What the hell?

907
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:07,077
You didn't return
any of my calls.

908
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:08,643
I got worried.

909
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,444
This dealer
was giving me a hard time.

910
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,211
I had to get away.

911
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:15,277
Sebastio asleep?

912
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:17,944
Those sessions
take it outta him.

913
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:30,544
What's up with you?

914
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,244
When did IAD approach you? What?

915
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:38,277
Kavanaugh. What's he
trying to get you to...

916
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:40,743
no. I don't know
a Kavanaugh.

917
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,710
Why are you lying
to me?

918
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,677
I'm sorry, Vic.

919
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:53,377
What happened?

920
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,977
Did he come to you

921
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:58,211
and threaten to put you in
jail if you didn't cooperate?

922
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:02,910
Huh? Because... there's a
way out of this, you know.

923
00:42:03,977 --> 00:42:05,544
What did you tell him?

924
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,277
That I saw your guy
take the heroin.

925
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:18,277
That's it.

926
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,910
All right. It's OK.

927
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,777
Soon as we get you
outta town,

928
00:42:24,844 --> 00:42:26,643
your statement
won't mean anything.

929
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,244
No, l... I can't leave.

930
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,010
Whatever Kavanaugh's squeezing
you with, I can make it go away.

931
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:32,211
Now pack your shit...

932
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:33,411
but Sebastio.

933
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:35,144
I'm gonna take him
to your mother's.

934
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:37,677
I'll make sure he gets back
with you once you get settled.

935
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:38,910
Vic!

936
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:42,578
I didn't know you then.

937
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,478
What?

938
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:53,610
You've been behind this
all along?

939
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:57,743
You tipped the IAD
about the heroin?

940
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,478
If I had to do it over
again, I'd have said no.

941
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,211
You've been good
to me and Sebastio.

942
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:07,077
You didn't...
you didn't say anything?

943
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:09,144
You never warned me...

944
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,877
all this goddamn time?!

945
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:13,111
I told them that...
shut up!

946
00:43:26,977 --> 00:43:28,511
He checks in on me,
Vic.

947
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:30,144
He'll be here.

948
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:32,144
What else
did you tell him?

949
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,877
Nothing, I swear!

950
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:36,944
6 months!

951
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,444
6 months,
you coulda warned me!

952
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:41,743
God...

953
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:47,144
one of men... maybe all of us
are going to jail because of you!

954
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,211
I was scared.

955
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:49,844
I helped your son!

956
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,311
I tried to get you
out of this life!

957
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:06,743
I'll leave... tonight.

958
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,144
And go where? To a phone
booth to call Kavanaugh?

959
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,010
No.

960
00:44:11,077 --> 00:44:14,610
Without you,
IAD's case goes away.

961
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:21,411
You knew what I was, and
you started running with me.

962
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:25,478
I report on people for
money, Vic! That's what I do!

963
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:27,344
Ohh... ha.

964
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:31,144
Aah!

965
00:44:57,743 --> 00:45:00,743
I found you once.
I can do it again.

966
00:45:09,578 --> 00:45:11,511
Who'd you call today?
What?

967
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:13,511
On your cell phone.
Who did you call?

968
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:16,444
L... only my cousin,
a few hours ago.

969
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,344
You called her
to get a message to her

970
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,377
to tell me
how to find you.

971
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:21,743
Got it?

972
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:27,710
Oh, Jesus. It's you.

973
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,111
Detective Mackey...

974
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:37,610
what are you doing here?

975
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:43,010
Ha. It's my CI. What the
hell are you doing here?

976
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,743
Emolia's helping us

977
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,010
with a Salvadoran
drug ring.

978
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:56,311
IAD, vice...

979
00:45:56,377 --> 00:45:58,710
you're a Jack
of all trades.

980
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:02,411
I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?

981
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:05,544
Why is it that you're here?

982
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,677
I got spooked.

983
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,010
Called my cousin.

984
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:13,411
She called Vic for me.

985
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:17,777
Next time you hide
one of my CIs...

986
00:46:17,844 --> 00:46:20,377
will you put
a car out front?

987
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:24,777
This isn't safe.
