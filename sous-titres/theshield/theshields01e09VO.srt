1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:07,117
Come on, homes!

2
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:09,162
Shut up!

3
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:17,828
Get up!

4
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:19,871
Want me to fuck you?

5
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:25,943
I said stay down!

6
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:32,383
I said shut up!

7
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,487
Stop!
Shut up!

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,323
Please.
Shut up!

9
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,993
Don't look so bad to me?
You gonna follow us?

10
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:49,093
No!

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,866
Gonna follow us? Didn't think so!
No!

12
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:57,039
Too late.
I see you're losin' air, homes.

13
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:03,614
Have a pack on me.

14
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,649
So, how many were there?
Three.

15
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:12,324
Yeah, they wore bandannas and masks.

16
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:15,055
I could tell they were beaners.
How?

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,665
By the way they talked. Spanish tattoos.

18
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,791
Describe one.

19
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:23,732
I saw a serpent with wings.

20
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,865
The other one was just "L.M."

21
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,968
It's Los Mags. We'd better call Vic.

22
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,043
Matthew, what's this?

23
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,309
A girl.

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,511
How does she feel?

25
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,478
Can't you tell?

26
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:43,951
Hungry?

27
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,249
Maybe Daddy can help.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,884
Daddy's hungry, too.

29
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:51,594
Maybe she's hungry. What else is she?

30
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,293
Happy?

31
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,727
Yes.

32
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,426
She's happy.

33
00:01:58,372 --> 00:01:59,862
And this girl?

34
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:01,701
How does she feel?

35
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,332
Happy.

36
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:11,615
It's work.

37
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,143
Today's your day off.

38
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,861
Yeah.

39
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:24,358
All right, I'll come in.

40
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,665
Been another truck-jacking.

41
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,469
I need a break. I'm sick.
I haven't slept more than two hours...

42
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,734
...all week long.
I know.

43
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,040
Shane gets three days off
to go play in Vegas.

44
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:40,342
Shane's not in charge. I am.

45
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:45,182
The new baby-sitter starts tomorrow.
Things'll get a lot easier for you then.

46
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:49,051
When will you be home?

47
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,047
As soon as I can.

48
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,179
Cesar, tear yourself away, will ya?

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,780
One sec.
Yeah.

50
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:24,051
Newlyweds.

51
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,992
Giving each other matching genital rings
as wedding gifts.

52
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:29,928
-lt's a beautiful thing.
-I'll take your word for it.

53
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,721
Check this out.

54
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,734
Any idea who that tattoo belongs to?
Not my work. Lacks the detail.

55
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:38,135
Belongs to a Los Mag. Gotta be a local.

56
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,538
I'll make a couple of calls.
See what I can dig up for ya.

57
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,410
Cholo rising.

58
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:54,284
Latino. 20s.

59
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:59,525
And there's the girlfriend.
Thank you, Cesar.

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,484
Hector Estanza.

61
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,356
-Let's rock.
-Let's do it.

62
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,337
Why you gotta be so stupid?
Leave me alone.

63
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:21,711
Remember, this guy likes
to hurt people, so be ready.

64
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,943
Go! Freeze! Police!

65
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,509
What are you doing?
On the floor!

66
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:27,645
On the floor, now!

67
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:29,947
Stop!

68
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,918
Freeze!

69
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,887
Okay!
Gun!

70
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,053
Lem!

71
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,926
He's got a gun!

72
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:38,657
My God.

73
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:43,366
Shit! I thought it was a gun.
Check and see if he's got one.

74
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,769
Vic?
We got him!

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,966
Stay inside the house!

76
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,601
I don't see nothing!
Damn.

77
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:51,645
What do we do?
We just got clear.

78
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:55,011
I shot an unarmed guy.
All right. He's the jacker.

79
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,606
We're gonna figure out what to say.

80
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:59,619
What, he threatened us
with cigarettes, so I shot him?

81
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,211
Just let me think!

82
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,986
6-Paul-11. Shots fired.
2728 Verbano Avenue.

83
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:10,494
Suspect is down.
Requesting backup and an ambulance.

84
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,311
Man, Vic.
I know.

85
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,247
I don't like it any more than you do...

86
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,842
...but we can't afford
to take another hit right now.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,979
You saw what he did to that truck driver.

88
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,852
Yeah. I know.

89
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:38,285
All right. Come on.

90
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,391
Vic?

91
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,386
Want to tell me what happened?

92
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,697
We got a sketch off the jacking victim.

93
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:50,169
It was a Los Mag banger.
My CI turned me on to Hector Estanza.

94
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:54,003
We sit on the girl he lives with--
He shows up, we go in, he runs.

95
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:57,805
The guy turns on me. He had me
dead to rights. Lem saved my ass.

96
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,144
As righteous as a shoot gets.

97
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,575
Chaco?

98
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,141
What did you do?

99
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,853
Chaco?
Don't worry.

100
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:08,285
Your boyfriend's gonna make it.

101
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:11,552
Boyfriend? That's my brother Chaco.

102
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,257
You shot the wrong guy?

103
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,360
We shot Hector's girlfriend's brother.

104
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,897
He had a carton
of stolen cancer sticks on him...

105
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:36,829
...and a gun pointed right at me.

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,664
-He's still the right guy.
-He and Hector are both Los Mags.

107
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:42,227
Probably part of the same crew.
We'll get Hector next.

108
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:44,432
-Is the girl involved?
-Not that I know of.

109
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,874
Lem's at the hospital getting her statement.
Boyfriend beat her up bad.

110
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:50,378
-Maybe she'll roll on him.
-Here's hoping.

111
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,242
Officer Lowe.

112
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,781
Taking back your IAD statement hurt me.

113
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,384
It hurt me bad.

114
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,014
It let Mackey off the hook.

115
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,759
There's clearly misconduct here.

116
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,762
Give me one good reason
why I should let you off the hook.

117
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,993
All my life, I wanted to be a cop.

118
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:14,461
I grew up in this neighborhood.
I want to make a difference here.

119
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,233
You could've made that difference
by taking down Vic.

120
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,080
I knew I got in over my head
when I first made those charges.

121
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:26,741
I'm worried you've made a pact
with Mackey.

122
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,250
No, sir.
I've got nothing to do with him.

123
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,380
I just want a fresh start, to be a good cop.
I'll prove it to you.

124
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,453
You'll receive an official reprimand.

125
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,257
I'm docking a week's pay
and putting you on probation.

126
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,890
I'll decide in a month
whether or not to keep you on.

127
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,298
Thank you.

128
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:51,071
Captain....

129
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,405
A new training officer might help me
with that fresh start.

130
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,741
You don't get to choose
who you partner with.

131
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,576
Neither does Officer Sofer.

132
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:04,217
Ms. Orozco?

133
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,419
Tigre.

134
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,922
-I'm Curtis.
-What do you want?

135
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:13,926
Can we talk about the Los Mags
and your brother?

136
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:17,023
My brother jumped Los Mags
three years ago. He's out.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,829
He didn't look "out" last night.

138
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:22,668
He was protecting me from the same guy
Hector.

139
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,496
So Hector beat you up.

140
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:26,899
He didn't like me breaking up with him.

141
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,438
You ever think about pressing charges?

142
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,306
Yeah, like you guys can protect me.

143
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:35,442
Chaco was taking care of me until your guy
shot him and he don't even bang no more.

144
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,248
-You're sure about that?
-You don't want to believe me?

145
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:39,652
Ask around.

146
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,149
We decided
we'd better cut him loose.

147
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:45,821
Coyotes?

148
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:49,496
This time of year,
the rabbits have gone underground.

149
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,626
Coyotes get hungry, can't find food,
they come down to forage.

150
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:54,226
Thank you, Ranger Rick.

151
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,267
My grandpa had a farm.

152
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,105
Over here.

153
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,980
It's about time.
I'm moving as fast as I can.

154
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,515
His name is Maynard Hawkins.

155
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,481
Maynard....

156
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:17,390
I'm Detective Wyms.
This is Detective Wagenbach.

157
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,055
-Were you chained up outside all night?
-I don't want to be no trouble.

158
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,155
You're not the one
who's in trouble.

159
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,202
He's got some pretty serious bites.
Where are the paramedics?

160
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,930
I'll go call 'em this time.

161
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,603
For God's sakes,
cut him loose.

162
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,306
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

163
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:40,244
He's blind.

164
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,677
-What's goin' on?
-Who are you?

165
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:48,413
I'm Lloyd. That's my dad.

166
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,483
Lloyd, your father's been attacked
by coyotes.

167
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,719
No.

168
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,188
I'm sorry, Pop.

169
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,593
I can explain.

170
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,562
Save it for the station.

171
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,841
Daddy.

172
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,148
What are you doing here?

173
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:14,978
Came to see you.

174
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:16,479
What's wrong?

175
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,520
I just needed a good place to read.

176
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,181
I can't talk right now.
I've got a case and....

177
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,352
Dutch, my father, Bryce.

178
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:27,521
Professor Wyms, glad to finally meet you.

179
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,189
It's my pleasure.

180
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,458
Go ahead. I'll wait.

181
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:35,994
-lt could be hours.
-I'm only on page 23...

182
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,168
...and I imagine this is a fascinating place.

183
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,642
-lt is.
-Actually, it's not.

184
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:45,209
-Why don't you be the judge?
-All right.

185
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:48,913
I don't understand why I'm here.
You're in trouble.

186
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,180
Shouldn't you be in there
for point-counterpoint?

187
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,747
There is no counterpoint.

188
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,121
He's guilty. It's down to a matter of degree.

189
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,592
Elderly abuse. That's a felony.

190
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:03,564
So it's the subtle fractions of culpability
that conspire to determine that man's fate?

191
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,649
I like the way you talk.

192
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:11,038
You had your father tied up
outside like an animal without shelter.

193
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,899
-I can explain that.
-I'm listening.

194
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,409
I'm divorced.

195
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,610
Surprise me some more.

196
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:24,044
I pay alimony and child support,
and I fell behind.

197
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,054
State garnishes my wages, and....

198
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:30,554
I miss some payments to the nursing home
and they kicked my pop out.

199
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,752
Did you try to place him in another home?

200
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,492
It costs too much.
I'm barely scraping by as it is.

201
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,090
What about his benefits?

202
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:44,100
After food and $50 a month
to keep him in Depends...

203
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,434
...there ain't nothin' left.

204
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:47,737
So you leave him outside, chained up.

205
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,443
-He's blind. He wanders.
-Where's your mother?

206
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,647
Ran off,
left me to care for him.

207
00:11:56,718 --> 00:12:00,381
I'm telling you,
it is the system that is screwing him over...

208
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:01,649
...not me.

209
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,451
That's so you don't wander.

210
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,364
Brian, thanks for the drop-by.

211
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,830
Travis, what a shock
to see you back here again.

212
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,833
It's like going to a family reunion.

213
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,039
I want to ask
about one of your parolees.

214
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:24,169
-Which one? I've only got about 300.
-He's a Los Mag.

215
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:28,114
That narrows it down to about 30.
His name's Chaco Orozco.

216
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:29,548
Yeah, Chaco.

217
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:30,911
That was quick.

218
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:33,216
That's because
I remember the good ones by name.

219
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:37,723
-So he's a good guy?
-I wish they were all like him.

220
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:40,827
He's not in any kind of trouble, is he?

221
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:44,861
I think we made a mistake.
Why?

222
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:48,096
I just talked to his parole officer
and his Clean Slate counselor.

223
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,037
"Clean Slate"?
Program for bangers who want out.

224
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,232
What did his counselor say?

225
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,605
He's been in three years,
never missed a meeting.

226
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,076
He counsels bangers
on how to get out of the life.

227
00:12:57,145 --> 00:13:00,581
That doesn't mean he didn't
get back in. Let's not forget, he ran.

228
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,413
He didn't want to get caught
with Hector's stolen smokes.

229
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,077
So if his sister says he's clean....

230
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:06,854
What about his gang tatts?

231
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:11,355
-Tigre says he's getting them lasered off.
-Wait a minute. His sister has a name now?

232
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,262
Can we just talk to Chaco,
hear his side of things?

233
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,462
I hope to hell you're wrong, man.

234
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,500
You want me to pass it on to the DA?

235
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:29,010
Not yet. I'm going
to get more answers from the father.

236
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:30,374
Come on. I'll walk you out.

237
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:33,638
-Rebecca wants you to meet Warner.
-I don't want to meet Warner.

238
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:36,183
-He's her fiancé.
-She has a husband.

239
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:39,885
They come 3,000 miles from Boston,
and you won't see your own daughter?

240
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:43,618
I'm dying to see her, but it's not fair
I have to meet this new boyfriend...

241
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,252
...when we should be trying
to save her marriage.

242
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,853
She's not going to leave Warner
alone in a hotel room.

243
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,194
-There you go.
-Don't be so hard, Peaches.

244
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,290
I'm not.

245
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:56,133
Rebecca's been married to Gordon
11 months and she's giving up?

246
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,002
-Do you think she really tried?
-She's a big girl now.

247
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,764
Where'd you park?

248
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,641
Rebecca and Warner dropped me off
on their way to the Getty.

249
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,577
-I'll give you a ride back.
-Actually, I'm staying awhile.

250
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,511
Dutch has offered to show me around.

251
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,411
I'm only guilty
for trying to protect Tigre.

252
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,649
-Why'd you run?
-Stolen cigs.

253
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,615
Los Mag tatts.

254
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,584
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

255
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:22,120
You were right.

256
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,529
Not to mention the setup,
planting that gun.

257
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:25,858
That's my third strike.

258
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,767
They planted the gun on you?
No way.

259
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,766
Next time, check your
pockets before leaving the house.

260
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,909
-Why don't we get to what matters here?
-What's that?

261
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,877
What are you gonna do to protect her?

262
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,239
Hector finds out the cops got
his cigarettes, he'll think she called it in.

263
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:45,543
Hector's gonna want to do a lot worse
than beat her.

264
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:50,657
Where does Hector keep
his stolen merch? Who's in your crew?

265
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,989
I don't live that life anymore.

266
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,162
She needs protection.
She'll get it.

267
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,398
That must have hurt like a mother...

268
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,629
...getting that thing lasered off.

269
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:05,695
Yeah.

270
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,041
Worse than getting shot.

271
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:13,510
This isn't good. I believe him.
Me, too.

272
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,048
Christ, man, I knew it.

273
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,284
Third strike,
and all he cares about is his sister.

274
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,980
We set up the wrong guy.

275
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,818
-What if I'd killed him?
-You didn't.

276
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,721
-Yeah, but I could've.
-Man.

277
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,624
What did I do?

278
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,225
Okay, what do we do now?

279
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,927
I don't know.

280
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,725
We gotta clear this guy.

281
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,828
Nobody's arguing.
How do we lift the gun charge?

282
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,906
We'll make the gun disappear...

283
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,541
...sneak into the evidence room.

284
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,976
That place
is like Grand Central Station.

285
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,239
During the day.

286
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,240
We'll hit it tonight.

287
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,415
But now we put the right guy behind bars.

288
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,716
We'll find Hector, sit on him,
be there when he moves on his next job.

289
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,450
What if his next job's Tigre?

290
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,960
Lem, you baby-sit Tigre.
Ronnie, you're on Hector patrol with me.

291
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,291
We made this mess,
we're gonna clean it up.

292
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
Hang on a second.

293
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:11,726
Hello?

294
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,295
Where are you?
You've been gone since yesterday.

295
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,671
Yeah, I'm still working on this.

296
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,473
Matthew has been calling for you
since this morning.

297
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,309
-He needs you here.
-I know.

298
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,780
-I thought you made an arrest.
-There's more.

299
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,408
I need a prescription from Rite Aid.

300
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,278
Is the baby-sitter there?

301
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,513
Yes.
Well, go.

302
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,722
I'd have to leave her with the kids.

303
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,591
We hired a baby-sitter
you don't trust with the kids?

304
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,689
When are you coming home?

305
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,062
Daddy!

306
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,371
How will the Dodgers do this year?

307
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,806
I don't follow baseball.

308
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,902
Would it be profiling if I said,
"I bet you follow basketball"?

309
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,012
Actually, I heard you were a Clippers fan.

310
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,439
Yeah.

311
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,984
Two tickets.

312
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,448
Floor seats. I can't make it.

313
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,255
We gotta roll.
I'm putting together a softball team...

314
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,852
...to take on those beach cops
over in Venice.

315
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm penciling you in.

316
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,088
Center fielder.

317
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,061
Talk to you later.

318
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,105
-You're here.
-As promised.

319
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,640
Nice bike.
Thanks.

320
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,015
Hope you chained it.

321
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,917
-You ride?
-'Cause I'm a gang chick?

322
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,513
I just wanted to know if you rode.

323
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,251
-So how does this work?
-I keep you safe until we arrest Hector.

324
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,738
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,042
I think I got it covered.

326
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,311
You think?

327
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,977
Yeah.

328
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:10,245
Ain't nobody gettin' past me.

329
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,525
They've got you
in the Ambassador Suite.

330
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,928
Who's that?
Detective Wyms.

331
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:24,025
Social Services already told me
they're taking me away.

332
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,599
I just wanted to know
what happened to your wife.

333
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,699
Mona...

334
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,208
...ran away.

335
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,006
How long ago?

336
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,743
Five....

337
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,507
Six years, maybe.

338
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,746
No note? No message? No good-bye?

339
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,111
No.

340
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,820
How do you know she ran away?

341
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,560
Lloyd told me.

342
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,396
What else did Lloyd tell you?

343
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,997
-So what kind of work do you do?
-I'm a stylist.

344
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,331
Hair?

345
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,530
Yeah.

346
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,310
-So you could do my hair?
-Yeah.

347
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,844
Cut it off and start over.

348
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,615
It's not that bad, is it?

349
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,681
Could do some things.
Maybe after we get Hector.

350
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,986
Maybe.

351
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:22,058
You know, you could help.
Tell me where Hector's next job's gonna be.

352
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,919
I don't know.
I believe your brother.

353
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,989
-You, I'm not so sure.
-Why?

354
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,399
He's not afraid of Hector, you are.
Hector's scary.

355
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,406
I deal with shit like Hector every day.
Trust me, he's not as scary as you think.

356
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,007
He says I'm his.

357
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
Man, this is fresh.

358
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,812
When did he do that?
Last night.

359
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,052
When I didn't want to let him in
with his stolen smokes.

360
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,688
Looks like they're scoping out
their next job.

361
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,266
You know, Lem's feeling pretty down.

362
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,168
Better than lettin' some asshole shoot me.

363
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,575
What the hell is this?

364
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,587
Lem!

365
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,729
-Yo. You Hector?
-Who are you?

366
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,093
Check out this vato here!

367
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,731
Why don't you shut up?
Come on!

368
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,741
You like that?

369
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,647
Police!

370
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,583
Give me some pavement!

371
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,220
That's for Tigre, asshole!
Now you stay away from her!

372
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:03,397
-Lem!
-No, man, he branded her!

373
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,202
You mess with me and Tigre,
and you're dead, too!

374
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,436
You think I'm scared of you, pussy?

375
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:12,005
Goddamn it! Back off!

376
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,342
That's right, bitch ass!

377
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,516
Goddamn it, man!
Bitch!

378
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,021
You should've seen what he did to her.
He needed a lesson.

379
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:26,221
They were getting ready for a job.
15 to 20 would've been a great lesson.

380
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,928
Sure was a nice ass-whoopin'.
That's not the point.

381
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,425
Our mission was
to catch Hector red-handed...

382
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,470
...bring him in, break him,
lock him up, and stop the jackings.

383
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:38,665
What about getting Chaco off?.
When are we gettin' that gun?

384
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,765
I said tonight.

385
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:44,708
Now are you protecting the sister
or just getting in my way?

386
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,579
You're back.

387
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,756
I learned some interesting things.

388
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,420
So did I.

389
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,885
You were a classical dancer
when you were a teenager?

390
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:05,228
Okay. My father is now off-limits to you.
Where is he?

391
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,768
-How could you not share that?
-I studied nine months.

392
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:11,237
-In Paris.
-Do your thing and stop stalking me.

393
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:15,468
It's only stalking if you work at it.
Your father just opened right up.

394
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:19,003
-What exactly is my thing?
-Dig.

395
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,081
On the elderly abuse case?
Elderly murder?

396
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,711
The son's cashing
the mother's Social Security checks.

397
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:26,687
Guess what? She's nowhere to be found.

398
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:30,384
If he's treating his father like this,
who knows what he did to the mother.

399
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:31,483
Interesting.

400
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,051
He's got five other kids.
I'm gonna make some calls.

401
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:35,960
One must know something
about the mother.

402
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,727
I'll search the databases,
see if I can sniff a trail.

403
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:42,366
And your daughter and her fiancé
will be here in a half an hour.

404
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:43,627
What?

405
00:22:44,873 --> 00:22:46,272
Come in.

406
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,601
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

407
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:53,177
-Julien talked to you about reassignment?
-I want to talk about a different matter.

408
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,781
What's that?

409
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,143
I have a friend in administration.

410
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,881
I asked to see
the early results of the sergeant's exam.

411
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:02,849
Yeah?

412
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:06,352
You missed the cutoff, Danny,
by three points.

413
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:11,264
-You mean, I failed?
-Three points is nothing.

414
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,306
God.

415
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:19,167
Damn it, I worked hard. I studied
with Dutch. I even got a good night's sleep.

416
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,703
-If I didn't pass this time--
-You'll pass next time.

417
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,371
You expect me to take it again?

418
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:26,906
Yeah...

419
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,179
...and I expect you to pass it.

420
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,004
Goddamn it.

421
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:57,545
I used to heal Chaco
when he was still bangin'.

422
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:58,807
It feels good.

423
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:01,005
-Does it?
-Yeah.

424
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,947
Wish I could've been there.
Wish I could've done more.

425
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,650
You know, Hector needs
to be locked up, not Chaco.

426
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,454
And what are you doing about that?

427
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:13,725
You gotta have faith in me.

428
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:17,596
We'll see.

429
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:22,897
Tigre.

430
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,937
There's something that I have to tell you.

431
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,439
Yeah, what's that?

432
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:31,450
What?

433
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,710
I shot your brother.

434
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:39,477
Not the other guy?
I thought he would kill my boss.

435
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:42,752
Did you plant the gun on him?
Nobody planted a gun.

436
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:45,816
-I don't want you here!
-You need someone. Hector'll kill you.

437
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:47,691
I don't want to see your face!

438
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,694
You shot Chaco.
What's to stop me from shootin' you?

439
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:51,630
Nothing.

440
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,567
You shoot my brother,
then you try to get in my pants?

441
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:57,230
That's not.... Look, I made a mistake.

442
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:00,070
We're gonna get Chaco off. I promise you.

443
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:09,576
Come on!

444
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,247
I'm right here, assholes!

445
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:15,417
Punk-ass!

446
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:24,592
Cacuzza. I was lookin' for you.
I need some help.

447
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,690
What's up?

448
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:30,763
You live in the Valley?
You thinkin' of moving?

449
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:31,838
Yeah.

450
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:35,172
You want to be nearer to me?
Who wouldn't?

451
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:36,838
Any suggestions?

452
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:38,472
Yeah....

453
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:40,644
West Hills, where I live, is nice.

454
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,749
There's a West Hills
for rent on the bulletin board.

455
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:45,753
Can you take a look?
Yeah.

456
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:47,812
Thanks.
I'll lock up quick.

457
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:52,653
-Hey, Cacuzza. Sleepin' on the job again?
-I'm right here.

458
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:57,457
I know Ronnie was lookin' for you.
I see you found him.

459
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,437
Are you pulling a prank on me?
No. I really want to move.

460
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,097
Right, and a man's just as good
as a vibrator.

461
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,603
What are you guys up to?

462
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:11,206
Nothin'.

463
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,932
Okay. But I'm watching you two.

464
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:31,418
Excuse me.
This is your father we're talking about.

465
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:34,946
Thank you very much for your time then.

466
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:38,493
Every one of Maynard's kids
hopes he rots in hell.

467
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,153
Have no clue where the mother is.

468
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:41,787
I ran the wife's maiden name...

469
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:43,656
...got some hits in Virginia.

470
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,530
It's East Coast time. Call in the morning.

471
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,901
-Mom?
-Sweetheart.

472
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:52,133
Hello.

473
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:57,574
Mom, this is Warner.
How do you do, Warner?

474
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:00,012
I've waited a long time
to meet you, Claudette.

475
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:03,683
-Couldn't have been that long.
-I'm starving. Can we dine?

476
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:07,879
There's a diner on the corner.
Claudette loves it there.

477
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:18,095
Come on.

478
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:24,368
Warner,
how do you like Los Angeles?

479
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:26,074
It's big.

480
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,100
How did you meet Rebecca?

481
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:31,005
Parent-teacher conference.

482
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,347
She taught my nine-year-old.

483
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,948
She's a great teacher.

484
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:36,584
Both my boys love her.

485
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,079
I see.

486
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:40,787
You see what?

487
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:42,221
-Peaches.
-Don't call me that.

488
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,727
I'm just trying to figure out
whether he wants a wife or a baby-sitter.

489
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:49,628
I should go back to the hotel.
No, baby, I'm sorry. Just....

490
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:53,062
How can you say that?
Don't throw away your future.

491
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:54,966
-Gordon loved you.
-We had problems.

492
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:57,709
-You never gave him a chance.
-You're not giving Warner one.

493
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,014
You knew how I felt.

494
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,976
You think forcing him on me
would make a difference?

495
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:05,377
Maybe I was crazy to think you'd
want to get to know him.

496
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:08,974
I thought
you'd try to save your marriage.

497
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:12,049
At least everyone is finally talking.

498
00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:17,683
Come on. Let's go to dinner.

499
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,004
Did you get it?
No.

500
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:33,598
Goddamn it.

501
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,070
Where is his sister?

502
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:39,474
Roadside Inn. It's safe.
I had to chase off two of Hector's boys.

503
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,612
What are we gonna do about the gun?

504
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,914
I doubt she'll give us
another chance.

505
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:47,251
Once it hits central storage,
that place is like Fort Knox.

506
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:49,154
How bad do you want
to make this right?

507
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,351
Why?

508
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:53,753
You ever wonder how
evidence gets from here to central storage?

509
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:03,137
You're gonna think I'm helpless.
No.

510
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,439
I was planning on making you
a surprise dinner.

511
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:09,272
I had the blender, the microwave,
the TV going...

512
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,710
...and the lights went black.

513
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,041
You overloaded the circuit.

514
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:16,548
-How do I unload it?
-Easy. There's a switch in the breaker box.

515
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:21,481
You have no idea
how to do any of this, do you?

516
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,893
Maybe you trip my switch?

517
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,073
Who's that?

518
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,117
Danny, hi.

519
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:56,616
-You seeing her?
-Kim? Yeah.

520
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:59,991
It's new,
but it seems to be going fairly well.

521
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:02,087
-That's great.
-Yeah, so far.

522
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:03,825
Dutch?
Excuse me.

523
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:05,526
Good for you.

524
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:09,797
What've you got?

525
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,940
You must feel
good right about now.

526
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:17,035
I don't know why.

527
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:19,681
Hasn't it been a little dry lately?

528
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:23,484
Only in a Death Valley kind of way.

529
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:28,147
It's good you're dating someone.
Even better, she doesn't work here.

530
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,781
So, there you are.

531
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,157
What are you doing here?

532
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:34,320
He wanted to see
how we matched fingerprints.

533
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:37,925
Shouldn't you be
trying to track down our missing mom?

534
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:41,497
I found someone
with her maiden name in Virginia Beach.

535
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,368
All I have to do
is check the Social Security number.

536
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,506
-And I'll do that now.
-Thank you.

537
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:52,646
Rebecca's leaving
tomorrow morning.

538
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:55,112
Have dinner with us tonight.

539
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:58,845
-And repeat last night's scene?
-I'll referee this time.

540
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:02,974
There's no fight if I'm not there.

541
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,975
I remember a brilliant scholar who chose to
go into police work against my advice.

542
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:10,409
I wasn't brilliant.
Yes, you were.

543
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,605
I was mortified.

544
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:13,812
You still are.
No.

545
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,114
I've come to understand your decision.

546
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:18,949
When I'm your age,
maybe I'll come to understand hers.

547
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:20,112
Peaches...

548
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:24,922
-...I'm 30 years older and smarter than you.
-You're not that much smarter.

549
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,489
Maybe a year or two.

550
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:31,497
Lowe.
Yeah.

551
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,967
Johnson's having
a little retirement bash next week.

552
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:37,130
He's keeping it small, but there's room
for one more. Want to go?

553
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:40,266
-No, thanks.
-You'll meet some of the top brass.

554
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,170
-I'm sorry.
-All right, fine.

555
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:45,236
But if something else comes up,
I'm gonna keep you in the loop.

556
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:46,839
What do you want?

557
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:51,781
You looked out for me.
I'm just trying to return the favor.

558
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:54,322
I've seen the kind of favors you do.

559
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:58,588
Let's start out on a new page.

560
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,386
You're not my friend...

561
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,932
...so stop pretending.

562
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:13,031
Hello?

563
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:15,770
Is this Mona Gaines?
Yeah.

564
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:19,776
This is Det. Claudette Wyms.
I'm a detective in Los Angeles.

565
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:21,243
What's this about?

566
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,581
Were you formerly Mona Hawkins?

567
00:32:24,787 --> 00:32:26,015
What do you want?

568
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:30,080
Are you aware that your son is receiving
and cashing your Social Security checks?

569
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,595
I don't care one bit about that,
so long as they don't contact me.

570
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:37,962
Lloyd's guilty of abusing
Maynard and defrauding the government.

571
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,357
That's not my problem.

572
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:42,127
Don't call me back.

573
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:47,135
Guess she wasn't murdered.

574
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,240
One hell of a family.

575
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:06,861
What do you want, puerco?
Tell Hector Tigre's mine now.

576
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:10,725
He's got a problem with that, he can
meet me at 11:00, L.A. River at Whipple.

577
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,293
I'll kick all three of your asses, all right?
No cops, just us.

578
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:17,999
-Andale, it's on then, homes.
-All right, bitch.

579
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,183
-Don't tell me you're puttin' one there.
-I am. What do you need?

580
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:36,781
Temporary body art,
just like the one I showed you.

581
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:39,951
You're all done.

582
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:41,695
Let's do it.

583
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,527
Wash your hands first.

584
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:43,920
Shit!

585
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,756
God, please don't hurt me!

586
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,622
I said the green car.
You said the blue.

587
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:38,320
Now I'm saying run the tape
to the green car.

588
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:39,486
Fine.

589
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:43,897
What the hell happened here?

590
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,193
The police evidence van
was robbed.

591
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:47,593
Robbed?

592
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:49,667
You gotta be kiddin' me.

593
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:54,201
What'd they take?
A gun.

594
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:57,039
That's it?
Yeah, that's it.

595
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,040
"L.M." stands for "Los Magnificos."

596
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:02,309
Guess what? It was Chaco's gun.

597
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,781
Goddamn it.
He just bailed out his senorita's brother.

598
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,345
What are you talkin' about?

599
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,687
Hector Estanza, Los Mags.

600
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:14,191
The guy Lem shot, Chaco,
who's in the hospital on a weapons charge.

601
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:16,128
Without the gun, he's gonna walk.

602
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,067
-Did you get a good look at them?
-Just a weird tattoo on the ringleader.

603
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,902
What'd it look like?
A snake with wings on it.

604
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,737
That's Hector.
You give us the word, we'll go pick him up.

605
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,274
Go get him.

606
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:36,613
Hi.

607
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:40,053
Grandpa said you couldn't have dinner
with us and I wanted to say 'bye.

608
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:41,647
Still love you.

609
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:45,058
Let's just agree to disagree.
Fine.

610
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,793
-Where's the ladies' room?
-lt's right over there.

611
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:49,354
I'll show you.

612
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,533
This is not your typical police station.

613
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:55,636
Bryce was telling me
a little bit about its history.

614
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,503
Care for a tour?

615
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,201
And this
is an interrogation room.

616
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,268
Man.

617
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:07,741
So....

618
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,008
This is where you break 'em.

619
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,246
Suspected rapists,
murderers, child molesters.

620
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,856
We sit 'em all down right there.

621
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:19,994
Want to see how it feels?

622
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:23,155
Okay.

623
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:36,034
-Where's Mom and Warner?
-I don't know.

624
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:38,613
Are you aware of just how smart
my daughter is?

625
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:42,947
-Yeah. She's smart as a whip.
-She's smarter than a whip.

626
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:45,449
That's just an expression.

627
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:50,959
-I do love her, you know.
-So, it's not just your kids who love her?

628
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:54,458
If my kids hated her,
I'd have trouble deciding who to keep.

629
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,055
Don't make jokes
about giving up your kids.

630
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,632
No, ma'am, I didn't mean it like that.

631
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:01,761
She's a public schoolteacher now...

632
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:04,496
...but she's got the potential
to go much further.

633
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,033
She plans on getting her doctorate.
She talked about writing a book.

634
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,805
I want Rebecca to achieve
everything she wants.

635
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:15,282
You've got all the right answers today.

636
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:19,812
But marriage is about having
the right answers every day.

637
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:24,083
-I'm watching you, Warner.
-Like a hawk....

638
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:25,987
Ma'am.

639
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:50,114
What's up?
Go ahead!

640
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:54,654
Get on the ground, scumbag! Freeze!

641
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:59,059
Hands up! Turn around!

642
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:00,795
Get on your knees!

643
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:08,328
I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

644
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,100
He doesn't put up a fight
unless you wear a dress.

645
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,471
You're the vatos
that are gonna be disappointed.

646
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:17,343
Yeah? How so?
They'll let me go for no evidence.

647
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:19,107
Haven't you heard?

648
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:21,209
Heard what, esé?

649
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:26,846
You robbed a police vehicle today.
Chalé, keep dreaming.

650
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:29,391
I was at the L.A. River
waiting for that punk-ass.

651
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,449
Man, you must be high.

652
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,460
Look what we got here.

653
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,563
Recently fired.

654
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:41,069
Better hope it doesn't match the bullets
found in the police van that got robbed.

655
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:42,399
Yo, it's not mine, homes.

656
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,666
The van had your gang's tag on it.

657
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,301
The cop identified your tattoo.
Ballistics is gonna come back a match.

658
00:39:48,382 --> 00:39:49,696
You vatos set me up!

659
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,360
Like a jury's never heard that one before.

660
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:54,885
On your knees.

661
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:58,561
On your knees.
Get down.

662
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:00,933
Have a seat.

663
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,968
I saw you two bickering
over police tape this afternoon.

664
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,565
Anything to say?
He didn't follow orders.

665
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,373
I'm not a mind reader.
If she'd said it, I'd have done it.

666
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:13,775
If I separate you, you'll just carry
your baggage somewhere else.

667
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:18,216
I believe in solving problems, not shuffling
them around, so let's identify the problem.

668
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:19,345
Julien?

669
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:20,953
Communication.

670
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:22,180
Trust.

671
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,350
Trust comes from communication.

672
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:28,292
So, how are we gonna fix this?
Department workshop?

673
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:32,426
Maybe I should set you up with
the city shrink. Any of that sound like fun?

674
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:34,233
Not really.

675
00:40:34,636 --> 00:40:35,728
Nope.

676
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,437
Prove to me that
you can watch each other's backs...

677
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,700
...and then I'll trust
that you can watch another partner's back.

678
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:44,875
And don't bother me with this anymore.

679
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:48,215
So, Dutch, join us.

680
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:51,582
-I think he's got his own date tonight.
-Actually, I do.

681
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:55,054
-Thanks for showing me around.
-Thanks for telling me about Peaches.

682
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,249
Come on.

683
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:01,928
-So, how did it go with Warner?
-I didn't have enough to make an arrest.

684
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,655
Hey.

685
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:09,096
Honey?

686
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,735
How's Matthew today?

687
00:41:13,008 --> 00:41:16,136
He kept asking where you were,
and I didn't know what to tell him.

688
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:18,476
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:22,582
-How'd it go with the baby-sitter?
-I fired her.

690
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,043
Why?

691
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:28,552
She created more work.
I had to explain everything to her...

692
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:31,524
...and she had no idea
how to handle Matthew.

693
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:34,325
He needs you. We need you.

694
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:36,364
What am I supposed to do,
quit my job?

695
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:39,491
Wanting us
to be a family doesn't make me a shrew.

696
00:41:39,568 --> 00:41:42,594
Something important came up.
Something always does.

697
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,607
This isn't working.

698
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:52,603
-What are you talking about?
-Something has to change.

699
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,151
You'll receive good care
at this place, Maynard.

700
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:01,820
Where's Lloyd?

701
00:42:01,957 --> 00:42:04,482
He's with us. You'll be better off.

702
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,327
Maynard, why do your kids
hate you so much?

703
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,425
I was a bastard.

704
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:38,689
-Too late to change my mind about dinner?
-Actually, I made reservations for four.

705
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:42,961
He just lost it.

706
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:46,125
You want me to believe
that Hector made that gun disappear?

707
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:48,101
The evidence points to that.

708
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,798
-Hector Estanza?
-Yeah.

709
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,065
So, Chaco goes free?
Yeah.

710
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,275
I have you to thank, don't I?

711
00:42:57,646 --> 00:43:02,140
I'm the one who hurt your brother.
I would do anything to take that back.

712
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:07,146
Yeah, I think I could do something
with this hair.

713
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,864
Look....

714
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,131
Tigre, there's something....

715
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:26,299
We put the gun in Chaco's hands.
We thought it was Hector.

716
00:43:26,374 --> 00:43:29,639
-When I found out who--
-I know.

717
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:32,673
You made it right.
