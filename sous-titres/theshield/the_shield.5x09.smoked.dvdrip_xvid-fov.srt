- In order to do that...

160
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,525
I have to create a pattern
of distancing myself from you.

161
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,499
Listen, it's only temporary until
you sort these legal matters out.

162
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,469
- Hey, sweetheart. Hi.
- You should go.

163
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,974
Please. Mom's been
crying all morning.

164
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,772
- Look, at least let me give you some cash. Here.
- No, Vic.

165
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,472
Vic, Vic, Vic, I can't. I'm sorry.
Look, we're gonna sort this all out.

166
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,345
We will. We'll figure
something else out.

167
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,385
<i>Okay?</i>

168
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,454
If you need me,
I'll be at work.

169
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,580
[Indistinct]

170
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,119
<i>Hey, Captain? Captain,</i>
<i>this is Detective Hoffman.</i>

171
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,960
He had an incident with
Officer Hanlon last night.

172
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,500
You got an office somewhere
where I can bitch in private?

173
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,503
I like hanging with my cops.
We can talk here.

174
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,130
Tina failed to identify Hoffman
as an undercover officer.

175
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,209
<i>First, she nearly blew</i>
<i>my head off...</i>

176
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,972
<i>- then allowed the perp to escape.</i>
- He was clearly wearing the color of the day.

177
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,775
Julien put a report
on your desk this morning.

178
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,214
We'll take all necessary steps
to ensure this doesn't happen again.

179
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,878
<i>You know, I live with lowlifes,</i>
<i>smelling like piss and shit...</i>

180
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,751
so guys like you don't have
to get your suits dirty.

181
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,655
<i>I get enough guns to my head</i>
<i>without Barbie adding to the action.</i>

182
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,696
- You expect me to fire her?
<i>- Look, I've tried with Tina, sir. So has Julien.</i>

183
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,288
She doesn't get it. She never will
until it's too late.

184
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,892
She's a woman, Latina besides. There's, like,
three hoops to jump through to can her.

185
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,063
Well, you know what? She's gonna land
herself or someone else in a body bag.

186
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,267
<i>Look, your girl saw this color,</i>
<i>not the color on my arm.</i>

187
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,936
All right, you handle it
any way you like.

188
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,107
<i>Look, being captain's about tough choices.</i>
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

189
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how you doin'?

190
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,082
- Any asshole sightings today?
- Not yet.

191
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,091
- Guess even rats have to sleep.
- [Laughs]

192
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,458
- Isn't it your day off?
- My kids got sick.

193
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,930
Wanted to see if you had anything
juicy I could sink my teeth into.

194
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,866
There's some new chicken potpies
in the Quick-Mealer.

195
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,132
What about that loan shark over on Clinton?
Newman and his team still set up on him?

196
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,139
He cut a deal.
We got two to six.

197
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,300
- Shit.
<i>- Uh, Vic, there's a girl...</i>

198
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,776
- who's been waiting to meet
you or one of your guys.
<i>- All right. Give me a second.</i>

199
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,177
What about that dealer on the Decks?
Uh, what's his name-

200
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,718
- Felonious T?
- Intel says he's hanging up his dealer hat-

201
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,255
Been busy making a documentary
of the streets, or some shit.

202
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,381
- Can't wait to see that.
- Yeah.

203
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,257
<i>- You looking for me?</i>
- You Mackey?

204
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,993
- Antwon Mitchell needs a sit-down with you.
- That dickhead sent you?

205
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,833
- Gave me a message.
- Stand up and put your hands against the wall.

206
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,499
[Scoffs]
Go to hell.

207
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,484
Your incarcerated old man
wants to fly a kite? Let 'er rip.

208
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,485
Told me to ask what you're
willing to put on the table.

209
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,987
- For what?
- To keep your boy, Curtis, alive.

210
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,150
Stop playing games or you're gonna
get matching his and her cells.

211
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,353
Your cop buddy's headed
for Lompoc.

212
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,761
- Gonna be in the same cellblock
with Antwon real soon.
- Horseshit.

213
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,959
<i>Ask the other cop,</i>
<i>the big brother.</i>

214
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,468
- He made the deal with Antwon.
- Kavanaugh?

215
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,734
Even a douche bag like Kavanaugh wouldn't
jump into bed with Antwon Mitchell.

216
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,207
God knows what kind
of diseases you'd get.

217
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,211
Ask him- But do it quick.
Antwon don't like waiting.

218
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,805
<i>Said make sure you know, offer</i>
<i>of protection ain't out there for long.</i>

219
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,648
You tell Antwon I'll put a bullet
in that fat head of his myself...

220
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,723
- before I'll let him kill another cop.
- Tell him yourself.

221
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,282
Sounds like it's just a matter of time
before you follow your boy inside.

222
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,362
- Get the hell out of here!
- Get your hands off!

223
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,490
You just giving Antwon more reason
to make it worse on your boy.

224
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,625
[Chuckles]

225
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,227
- Open it!
- [Door Buzzes]

226
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,398
<i>- What do you got?</i>
- Nothing. Huh?

227
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,435
- Your face is red.
- You're back.

228
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:02,132
- [Sighs] And what a pleasure it is.
- Doc said another two weeks.

229
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,507
<i>I can recuperate better at</i>
<i>my desk than I can in my bed.</i>

230
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,103
- What are we working?
- Your knee?

231
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,844
<i>Knee, ankle-</i>
<i>The whole shebang.</i>

232
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,420
I fell pretty hard.
What have we got?

233
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,480
Uh, dump job.
Artemis Cooke, 43, black male.

234
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,288
- Shot in the face, stuffed in a Dumpster.
- And no next of kin?

235
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,362
Uh, mother.
I've got her upstairs.

236
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,261
Oh.

237
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,062
Come on. Pick up the pace.

238
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,803
Artemis was always
hardworking.

239
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,806
All sorts of jobs.

240
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,934
- Where was he working now?
- Ambulance company.

241
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,944
Drove body organs to Canada.

242
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,482
<i>Company paid him to paint his van up.</i>
<i>Very professional.</i>

243
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,314
- Uh, body organs?
<i>- You know, they take 'em...</i>

244
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,911
<i>just before you die, give 'em</i>
<i>to people who need 'em.</i>

245
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,959
- You mean donor organs?
<i>- I guess they have a big need up north.</i>

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,621
You can ask his buddy, DeKnight.
He helps him load up sometimes.

247
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,870
Your attempts to drive a wedge between me
and my guys include planning a murder?

248
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,104
I'm just looking for my salad.
Somebody took it.

249
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,681
Why don't you just
find out who did it...

250
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,081
send 'em to prison to be
killed by Antwon Mitchell?

251
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,554
What's that make you, serving Lem
up to some cop killer?

252
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,852
Just like you served Terry up?

253
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,417
- Terry was a snake, just like you.
- Oh.

254
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,090
- So you did know that Terry
was working forJustice.
<i>- You told me about it yourself.</i>

255
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,101
<i>I'm done with crying about him</i>
<i>getting killed by Two-Time...</i>

256
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,331
no matter how many weepy
relatives you bring by.

257
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,340
[Sighs]

258
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,342
Had a conversation
with Antwon Mitchell.

259
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:50,211
Very illuminating, especially
as it relates to Shane Vendrell.

260
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,341
Is your neck a little sore?

261
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,385
Excuse me?

262
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:59,219
From the noose tightening?

263
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,853
You send Lem to Lompoc,
it's you that's the real murderer.

264
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,694
<i>The four of you come completely clean,</i>
<i>I will let you pick the prison.</i>

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,564
<i>No deal?</i>

266
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,161
Well, I guess you're not as concerned
for his safety as you claim.

267
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:19,404
Anyway, there's nothing on paper
as to where Lemansky will end up...

268
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,605
<i>but I'm sure I'll have a recommendation</i>
<i>when the time comes.</i>

269
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,742
<i>That being said, any correctional facility</i>
<i>is dangerous for a cop.</i>

270
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:32,256
<i>Best thing to do is play by</i>
<i>the rules, stay out of jail.</i>

271
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:37,421
Streets can be
real dangerous too.

272
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,762
Are we leveling threats,
Detective?

273
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,029
Just making
random observations.

274
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,435
Same as you.

275
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,202
Here's another one-
You're bluffing.

276
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,403
<i>Trying to split us up.</i>

277
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,174
You're Mr. Straight Arrow,
right?

278
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,909
Couldn't even cut your poor,
sick-in-the-head, defenseless...

279
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:04,718
<i>ex-wife a break</i>
<i>from the rules, could ya?</i>

280
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,122
You don't have the stomach
to serve Lem up to Antwon.

281
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,091
I didn't use to.

282
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,258
<i>Excuse me.</i>

283
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,262
<i>I worked with Artemis</i>
<i>at the plant.</i>

284
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,809
That donor thing was something he got
on his own. Don't know much about it.

285
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,744
<i>Seems weird. Usually organs have</i>
<i>to be transplanted within hours.</i>

286
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,611
<i>Takes a hell of a lot longer</i>
<i>to drive to Canada.</i>

287
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,651
Wouldn't you think
they'd fly 'em?

288
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,119
Maybe it's low-priority organs,
like fingers or tongues.

289
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,557
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here.

290
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:47,360
Artemis was not running fingers and tongues
back and forth to Vancouver, was he?

291
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,798
<i>Whatever he was running got him</i>
<i>shot in the face.</i>

292
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,837
- Shit. He's dead?
<i>- Found him in a Dumpster, like common trash.</i>

293
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,172
He was running some cush,
some sort of super weed.

294
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,147
<i>You get anywhere near the shit, the contact</i>
<i>high would knock you out for a week.</i>

295
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,740
- He made eight grand a run.
<i>- That makes him invaluable.</i>

296
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,843
- He have any beefs with anyone?
<i>- Hell no.</i>

297
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:13,357
<i>Everybody loved Art. He drove that</i>
<i>van into L.A. Full of the good tree...</i>

298
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,654
it was like Santa Claus
was comin' to town.

299
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,560
We got a guy upstairs,
needs a ride home.

300
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,636
No problem.
She okay?

301
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,102
<i>Says she's a hundred percent.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna argue the point.</i>

302
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,040
<i>When I get my six weeks,</i>
<i>I'm gonna forget this place exists.</i>

303
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,111
<i>Yeah.</i>

304
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
- Hi there.
<i>- Oh, let me guess.</i>

305
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,783
You're here to give me shit
about something.

306
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,792
What? No.
I, uh-

307
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,192
Th-These've been
floating around.

308
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,026
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

309
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,667
Jesus Christ.

310
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,302
- The door was locked. How'd they-
<i>- I barely glanced.</i>

311
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,400
Just-Just enough
to identify you.

312
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,209
<i>Apparently some asshole put</i>
<i>a camera in the locker room.</i>

313
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,876
So every jerk-off in the Barn's
been staring at my tits?

314
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,547
Hey, you can't let their
high school mentality get to you.

315
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,216
They'll get their kicks,
then move on to somebody else.

316
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,419
Shit. I think
I'm gonna get fired.

317
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,690
I screwed up at a call last night.
That's why I'm stuck in here.

318
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,394
We all make mistakes.

319
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,028
Even I've been known to make one or two-
Occasionally.

320
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:39,373
I wore those bra
and panties two days ago.

321
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,242
- The red ones the day before.
<i>- That's something to go on.</i>

322
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm gonna find out who took these.
I'm gonna see that every picture's destroyed.

323
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,553
Okay. Thanks for being
such a gentleman.

324
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,089
We're not all Neanderthals.

325
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:01,763
I should probably keep those,
stick 'em in a drawer for evidence.

326
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,714
Oh. We don't have
anything planned.

327
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm resigning my position
as a reserve officer.

328
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,782
So now you no longer can compel my
cooperation by threatening to take my badge.

329
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,257
It's all yours.

330
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,487
That's not necessary.

331
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,759
You should also know that
as vice-chair of the police committee...

332
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,992
I'm launching an investigation
into your investigation.

333
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,298
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

334
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,667
And why, after tens
of thousands of dollars...

335
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,505
- you have nothing more now
than you had seven months ago.
- I got Lemansky in custody.

336
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,274
<i>Yeah, on seven-month-old</i>
<i>charges.</i>

337
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,511
I got 65,000 unaccounted for dollars,
courtesy of Mackey's wife.

338
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,678
<i>I got Mackey's assets frozen...</i>

339
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,587
along with every member
of the Strike Team.

340
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,252
<i>And I've got Antwon Mitchell</i>
<i>talking.</i>

341
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,354
You're getting
Mackey panicked...

342
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,094
- hoping he'll overplay his hand.
<i>- Something I hope you could help me with.</i>

343
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,432
<i>Nicely done, by the way, stomping</i>
<i>in here like that. That was good.</i>

344
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,303
- I like that.
- You're trying to get Mackey running to me?

345
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:20,242
<i>What, the enemy of my enemy</i>
<i>is my friend?</i>

346
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,542
<i>Well, forget it.</i>
<i>It won't happen.</i>

347
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:28,279
He and his boys, they were in
business with Antwon Mitchell.

348
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,823
These guys, they're desperate.
They're gonna need a friend...

349
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,551
in a high place, like you.

350
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,623
All right, I'll hold off
on my investigation-

351
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,700
For now.

352
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,129
Walk out angry.

353
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,571
Mackey's watching.

354
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,209
- Vic, you got a sec?
- Barely.

355
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,411
You ever hear of a Canadian
super pot?

356
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,182
What, you lookin' to buy
a dime bag?

357
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,383
Dump job this morning was driving vans
full of the stuff down from Vancouver.

358
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,858
You know any locals
plugged into that route?

359
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,929
Probably.
You guys have the van?

360
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,023
Still looking. Might be a robbery.
I'm just looking for a few names.

361
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:20,036
<i>[Door Slams]</i>

362
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,040
Well, seeing as you and Claudette's Wonder
Twin powers aren't fully activated yet...

363
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,372
I'll do you a favor,
pick up the slack on this one.

364
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,312
- Okay. Thanks.
- All right, let me shake the One-niner tree...

365
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,009
<i>see if any five-pointed</i>
<i>leaves fall out.</i>

366
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,084
That prick cut a deal
with Antwon Mitchell.

367
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,628
- Wants to send Lem to Lompoc
if he gets a conviction.
- What?

368
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,062
That's why Kavanaugh knows
so much about you and Antwon.

369
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,395
He's hoping the threat
will get Lem talking.

370
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,368
- That's not exactly playing by the rules.
- Means we don't either.

371
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,701
- If he puts Lem in with Mitchell-
- I know.

372
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,746
- Yo, coz.
- Shit. Let's go.

373
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,942
- This 5-0 is Hitler.
- You miss us?

374
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,383
Not especially.

375
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,546
[Laughs]
Hear Antwon's cutting deals...

376
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,453
over in Lompoc, shoring up
the power structure.

377
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,856
If it don't involve the street,
it don't involve me.

378
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,122
<i>Maybe you're part</i>
<i>of Antwon's restructuring.</i>

379
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,290
Nice try, but me
and the big guy's tight.

380
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,664
You really expect me to believe
he's lettin' you call the shots out here?

381
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,102
He can't do it.
Somebody's got to, right?

382
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,264
Antwon know you're recruiting
out of middle school?

383
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,104
<i>Most of the old guard hung</i>
<i>it up after Antwon left.</i>

384
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,146
- This is the new regime.
- Any of your students running
chronic down from Canada?

385
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,310
- Let's take a ride.
- What? Shooting me wasn't enough?

386
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,822
Tell me what we want to know or we're
gonna be back in your life again full-time.

387
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,551
All right.

388
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,255
Dude with a fancy French name who runs
most of the bud to the crews.

389
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,822
- Best shit in years.
- What's Frenchy's name?

390
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,528
Dijon.

391
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,071
Get back to class.

392
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,476
Pork Chop's stuck
on street duty.

393
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,546
He knows where
the pot comes from...

394
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,514
<i>but Antwon's cut him out of the inner circle,</i>
<i>the decision-making.</i>

395
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:16,019
- You thinking regime change?
- Something to keep an eye on.

396
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,725
- Dude, sweet pictures.
- What pictures?

397
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,389
It's okay.
I'm cool.

398
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,466
You think Tina's panties
are regulation?

399
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,559
[Chuckles]

400
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,537
- Just wish we could've seen her badge.
- [Laughs]

401
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,039
Hey, between you and me,
how'd you pull it off?

402
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,771
Shit, I'm no perv.
Found 'em on Billings's desk.

403
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,541
Anyone make copies?

404
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,809
What do you think?

405
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,044
Anyway, thanks
for sharing them with me.

406
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,385
<i>The way you stare at that chick,</i>
<i>would've been cruel not to.</i>

407
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,560
You had the I.R.S.
Freeze my money.

408
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,328
- I'm sorry. That isn't-
<i>- Sorry?</i>

409
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,428
- You did it.
<i>- Yes.</i>

410
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,702
I did everything that you asked.
I told you about the money.

411
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,837
<i>- Now I can't feed my children.</i>
- You told me about $65,000.

412
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,006
Now I'm hearing there may be more-
A lot more.

413
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:23,019
<i>Please. You think I would default</i>
<i>on my children's tuitions if there was more?</i>

414
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,316
I hate that this
is hurting you...

415
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,620
but I'm building walls
around Vic...

416
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,890
to stop him from slithering away and you,
you're one of those walls.

417
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,397
I'm not a wall,
I'm a mother.

418
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,265
And I'm disconnecting Vic
from my life and from the kids.

419
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,964
So leave me out of this.

420
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,132
Are you aware that I arrested
Curtis Lemansky two days ago?

421
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:48,235
<i>He's in County, waiting for Vic</i>
<i>and his friends to bail him out.</i>

422
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,407
If they don't have the money,
they can't do it.

423
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:57,819
And every minute that Lem spends inside, I'm
just a minute closer to getting at the truth.

424
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,381
That has nothing
to do with me.

425
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,029
My advice is to go
to Vic yourself...

426
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,499
ask him to confess.

427
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,629
You want your life back,
ask him, not me.

428
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,666
What did I do to deserve this?

429
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,180
You married the wrong man,
Corrine.

430
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,179
- Now I'm not doing this because
that cowboy called me out.
<i>- Of course not.</i>

431
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,585
<i>I got two of my finest officers</i>
<i>telling me that Tina's gotta go.</i>

432
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,818
Look, every day that she's out there,
she's putting people at risk.

433
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,089
- She's just so damn popular.
- I can call her P.B.A. Rep.

434
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,164
<i>Okay. Get him</i>
<i>down here, ASAP.</i>

435
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,166
Julien, I want a full report of her conduct.
You're going on the record.

436
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,260
- Got it.
- Thanks, guys.

437
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,308
<i>What's up?</i>

438
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,545
Shit! Where'd you get these?

439
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:58,810
- They're circulating.
- They were on my desk. Is nothing sacred?

440
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,011
- You're asking me?
- Come here.

441
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,125
<i>I put a nanny cam</i>
<i>in the locker room.</i>

442
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,217
People have been ripping off
the vending machines.

443
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,296
I was just trying to catch
whoever was doing it.

444
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,365
You could've put a camera
in the hallway-

445
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,934
- Over the machines.
- Not where it could be hidden.

446
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,062
And I think whoever's stealing this grub
is stashing it in their locker.

447
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,834
I pulled these photos and some others so
that they wouldn't get into the wrong hands.

448
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,708
You know, this only happened because I don't
have a goddamn private office anymore.

449
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,246
Do you have any idea what kind
of shitstorm you're looking at...

450
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,612
when she finds out
you're behind these photos?

451
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,880
She saw them?
You told her?

452
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,981
- She had a right to know.
- I just promised to wash her out. [Sighs]

453
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,390
You think he's gonna take
care of that baby? He's not.

454
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,400
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

455
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,595
<i>You think he's gonna</i>
<i>be a father?</i>

456
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
Who the father is
is none of your business.

457
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,570
Really? It's none of my business that my kids
are gonna get a new brother or sister?

458
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,045
I'm at work right now, okay?
This isn't the place.

459
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,048
Right.
Come find me later.

460
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,380
You managed to find someone to screw
at work. Why not talk about it here?

461
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,352
I'm gonna walk away from you because
you're obviously not being rational.

462
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,357
Really? Were you being rational when
you slept with a married man?

463
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,088
- He made that vow, not me.
- Which makes him a cheat...

464
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,893
but that makes you a whore and the baby
you're both having a bastard.

465
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,609
You Dijon?

466
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,113
- I ain't do nothing, if that's what you mean.
<i>- Nice threads.</i>

467
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,582
We hear you've got the best B.C.
Bud in Farmington.

468
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,518
- Hey.
- What?

469
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,249
- White guys can't get the good stuff?
<i>- You only sell to bangers?</i>

470
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,884
- That's discrimination.
- I got nothing. Look around.

471
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,258
Okay.

472
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,459
- You took a hit today.
- We're offering you a chance to get it back.

473
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,128
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>Run that by me again.</i>

474
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,933
Your Canadian organ express
got taken down.

475
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,804
<i>Your driver got killed,</i>
<i>supply ripped off.</i>

476
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,003
We can get it back for you,
for a finder's fee.

477
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,013
- Why?
- Don't worry about that.

478
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,913
Hundred grand,
no questions asked.

479
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,453
- [Scoffs]
- Oh, yeah. That's right.

480
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,923
Only a matter of time before the detectives
on the murder case follow the phone records...

481
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,552
back to you and your
monthly pot runs.

482
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:29,827
But you work with us, we see to it
that the trail ends with Artemis.

483
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,802
- And I keep the rest?
<i>- It's a hell of a lot better than nothing, isn't it?</i>

484
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,074
All right.

485
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,543
The only thing is, it wasn't my shipment
that got jacked, it was my cash.

486
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,013
- Artemis was on his way up <i>to</i> Canada.
- How much did you lose?

487
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,380
- A quarter of a million.
- [Sighs]

488
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,046
<i>- Get it back, I'll cut you the hundred G's then.</i>
<i>- Uh-uh.</i>

489
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,784
- We don't trust you.
<i>- No, man. We'll take our fee</i>
<i>up front as a down payment.</i>

490
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,860
<i>Man, you crazy?</i>
<i>I'm out of pocket on this.</i>

491
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,521
- Everything I got was invested in that run.
<i>- Jesus Christ, man.</i>

492
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,792
- This is just a waste of time.
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

493
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,835
A deal's a deal. Put together
a list of every customer...

494
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,734
anybody who would've
known about Artemis's run.

495
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,706
<i>Dirty yourself up. We need you</i>
<i>to play the ignorant friend...</i>

496
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,300
for some colleagues of ours.

497
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,471
<i>Yo, Asher, upstairs.</i>

498
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,379
America's favorite couple wants
to have a little chat with him.

499
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,544
- Sure thing.
<i>- I'm telling ya, my intel's good.</i>

500
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,851
<i>Artemis was flying solo. His buddy's</i>
<i>got some details about his criminal dealings.</i>

501
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,358
- Let's see what's up between these two.
<i>- [Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

502
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,691
I'll be right up.

503
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,890
- Lem?
- I finally got some phone time, man.

504
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,559
So what's going on?
Am I getting out of here today?

505
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,001
I'm working on it.
Hang on.

506
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,073
[Beeping]

507
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,870
<i>- [Ringing]</i>
- Hello?

508
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,275
Hey, it's Vic. I'm gonna put you
on with Lem. Hold on.

509
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,279
- [Beeps]
- All right. You guys both on?

510
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,077
- I'm here.
- Yeah.
- All right, Lem...

511
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,210
you're talking to your lawyer, Becca Doyle,
in case there are other ears on this call.

512
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,381
Whoa, you can't use me as cover
for anything illegal.

513
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,722
- What I'm about to tell Lem, you need to hear too.
- What is it?

514
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,058
The good news first.
We got a lead on some bail money.

515
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,724
- How?
- Calling in a few favors.

516
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,926
All right. Look, man,
I know you got my back.

517
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:15,335
- What's the bad news?
- Kavanaugh has been sitting
down with Antwon Mitchell.

518
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,536
Made some sort of deal to send you
to Lompoc in case there's a conviction.

519
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,544
- No goddamn way.
- [Becca] That's insane.

520
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,877
- He doesn't make those calls.
- Look, it's never gonna get that far.

521
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,111
Gonna get you out of there, then we're
gonna get you out from under this prick.

522
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,449
Do you know this?
Kavanaugh said those words?

523
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,115
He'd never admit it,
but it's real.

524
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,284
All it means is Kavanaugh knows he's got
jack shit on us and he's getting desperate.

525
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,294
All right. I hear you.
I hear you.

526
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,229
<i>- Vic, you coming or not?</i>
<i>- Yeah, hang on.</i>

527
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,300
<i>All right. Listen, I gotta go.</i>
<i>You stay safe, all right?</i>

528
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,835
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

529
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,741
<i>- Dutchman.</i>
- I'm in the middle of something.

530
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,374
I got it, Dutch-boy.

531
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,421
You know I was on the up-and-up
taking those photos.

532
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,497
[Scoffs]
Tell the chief.

533
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,692
LfTina makes a stink about this,
maybe she'll get a huge pile of cash...

534
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,769
but her career will be kaput.

535
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,895
You know how these
things wash out.

536
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,098
- I don't know what you expect me to do about it.
- I have a plan.

537
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,199
If this thing goes away,
everybody wins, including you.

538
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,472
No, thanks.

539
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,878
You can either be a hero in Tina's eyes,
or you can watch her...

540
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,181
and her red bra and panties march out
that Barn door forever.

541
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,448
[Scoffs]

542
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,419
He's full of it.

543
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,659
He probably is a member of the weed ring,
but why kill your own driver?

544
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,826
- I really don't think he was involved-
- If this guy's funding...

545
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,370
Artemis's run,
he'll never cooperate.

546
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,736
- He'll want to recover the money himself.
- Or Artemis is working solo.

547
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,173
Your intel hasn't been
what it used to be.

548
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,077
Fine. I'll see what else
I can squeeze out of him.

549
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,874
- What did I miss?
- What the hell'd you bring him into this for?

550
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,285
- I thought we could use a little muscle.
- Brains over brawn, Dutch.

551
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,357
How many times I gotta
tell you that?

552
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,722
Move it, asshole!

553
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,022
You don't need to keep sellin'
it so hard, do you?

554
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,154
Your list of customers
got us nowhere.

555
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:24,166
The only thing those bangers want more than
ass and cash is your top grade Canadian bud.

556
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,429
They know a good thing
when they smoke it.

557
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,937
Yeah, well, if I don't find the guy
who knocked over your van...

558
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,600
you'll be hanging up
a "closed" sign.

559
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,507
Who else besides your customers
knows about the runs?

560
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,603
Just my wife
and my dumb-ass stepson.

561
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,841
- How old is he?
- He's 20.

562
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,214
- What's his name?
- Jaden Reid.

563
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,652
He drove the route for me couple times
till I noticed the load kept comin' back light.

564
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,589
- Punk don't know the meaning of"high enough."
- Where is he now?

565
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,093
Who knows? He gonna send
his mama to an early grave.

566
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,596
- Does your wife know whereJaden is?
- She's got no clue.

567
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,100
You never know. Blood is
thicker than bong water.

568
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,330
<i>Kid's name is Jaden Reid.</i>
<i>Think he's our shooter.</i>

569
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,272
- Let's payJaden a little visit.
- Well, first we gotta find him.

570
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,038
<i>Kid's a burnout. Now he's got enough</i>
<i>cash to keep him stoned for a long time.</i>

571
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,081
- Got enough cash for us to spring Lem.
- So where do we start?

572
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,310
Our unis found the abandoned van
in a parking lot in Silver Lake...

573
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,387
lots of blood, no cash.

574
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,047
<i>If I had a bagful of money, I wouldn't</i>
<i>want to walk too far with it.</i>

575
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,183
<i>Check out the local weed dealers.</i>
<i>Lfhe had the cash, he'd wanna score.</i>

576
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,093
- What about Claudette?
- We're still a step ahead,
and she seems two steps slow.

577
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,657
- Let's find this kid before
she figures out anything else.
<i>- Okay.</i>

578
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,532
Yeah. Got it.

579
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,597
Got a hit on the fingerprints in the van.
Belongs to a Jaden Reid.

580
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,835
- Address?
<i>- Last known, his mother's.</i>

581
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,606
- Tasha Reynolds.
<i>- What's up?</i>

582
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,581
Got a suspect.
Jaden Reid.

583
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,914
According to the file,
he's your friend Dijon's stepson.

584
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,920
- Nice work.
- Gonna check out an address.

585
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:55,083
- Why don't we let some unis pick him up?
- They can join us.

586
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,095
<i>Dutch is right. Why don't you let me</i>
<i>and my guys handle sweepup duty?</i>

587
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,522
You can join us too
if you want.

588
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,364
<i>Mrs. Reynolds, when was</i>
<i>the last time you saw Jaden?</i>

589
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,441
<i>- Couple months.</i>
- Look, he's a good kid.

590
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,839
There's no way he'd be involved
in anything like this.

591
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:18,280
Dutch, why don't you have Dijon show you
whereJaden stays when he's here?

592
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,350
Sure.

593
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,352
Um, lead the way.

594
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,085
Mrs. Reynolds.

595
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:33,357
I know you're worried about your son, but
he could be in trouble and not just from us.

596
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,455
He wouldn't kill no one.

597
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,969
Then help us find him so we can clear this
mess up and keepJaden from being hurt.

598
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,006
<i>He has a girl.</i>
<i>I don't like her.</i>

599
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,975
<i>- She lives by that old theater on Sunset.</i>
<i>- Got an address?</i>

600
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,980
2409 Cole Street, by the Vista Theatre.
Jaden's there.

601
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,550
Uh, 2409 Cole.
Yeah, we got it.

602
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,348
- How far out are you?
- Uh, traffic, 15 minutes maybe. Why?

603
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,446
Because Dutch and Claudette
are on the way over there too.

604
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,152
Just get inside the house, find the money,
and get out of there fast.

605
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,355
- Well, how far are they?
- Same as you.

606
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,364
Jesus!
What if they catch us?

607
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,366
I mean, we've got
the day off, remember?

608
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,561
Just get there.
I'll make it work.

609
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,366
- Okay, park it, let's go.
- Yeah, where? Claudette knows this truck.

610
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,172
Check around back.

611
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,043
Come on, man.
Move.

612
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,388
It's locked, man.

613
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,790
- I'll get the front.
- Two minutes, that's it. Then we're gone.

614
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,025
No arguments here.

615
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,144
Goddamn it.

616
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,277
- Let's forget it. We're out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

617
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:08,324
- Oh, shit.
- Hold on. Hold on.

618
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,732
- Shit, is he dead?
<i>- No.</i>

619
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,064
<i>- [Snoring]</i>
<i>- No. It's just a damn good buzz.</i>

620
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,731
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
He's sleeping on the money.

621
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,832
<i>[Cars Approaching]</i>

622
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:30,107
- Oh, shit.
- Grab it. Grab it.

623
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:34,412
Oh, yeah. We're good.
We're good.

624
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,919
Let's go! Go, go, go.

625
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,720
Hey! You take him.
I'll clear the back.

626
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,597
[Mouthing Words]

627
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,802
- Clear!
- Looks like we got our shooter.

628
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,305
<i>- Come on, buddy, wake up. Party's over.</i>
- [Sighs]

629
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:02,139
- Somebody took my money.
- You won't need any where you're going.

630
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,943
<i>- He cut me out. He didn't have to do that.</i>
<i>- [Man] There you go.</i>

631
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,611
- I didn't want to hurt nobody.
- You shot him in the face three times.

632
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,780
We should probably wait
until he sobers up.

633
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,381
- Can't use anything he says right
now anyway, his state.
<i>- All that money was his.</i>

634
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:20,396
All that bud, his. I don't know why
you ain't going after him.

635
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,127
<i>Artemis? You killed him and took</i>
<i>the money belonging to Artemis?</i>

636
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,693
Artemis?
I was drivin' for Dijon.

637
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,740
<i>It was his shit.</i>
<i>He fired me.</i>

638
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,401
I'm his stepson.
What kinda shit is that?

639
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,276
You really dialed the wrong
number on your street intel.

640
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,351
Still don't have any evidence
against Dijon...

641
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,886
and his hazy memory ain't
gonna get you far either.

642
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,218
Jaden says somebody broke into his
girlfriend's apartment, took the money.

643
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,417
- What's our next move?
<i>- It's my day off.</i>

644
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,893
I helped you catch the killer.
Finding the money's your problem.

645
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,334
- Hey, Smitty.
- Haven't seen you guys in a while.

646
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,495
It's been nice.

647
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,301
- It's about to get a lot nicer.
- How'd you like to make a hundred grand?

648
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,376
[Scoffs]
Pass.

649
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,935
- Hear us out.
<i>- The shit I've done for you guys for peanuts...</i>

650
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,515
I don't even want to know
what a hundred grand looks like.

651
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,516
Looks a lot easier
than you think.

652
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:18,452
Lem's in jail. You're gonna put up
a hundred G's for his bail.

653
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,185
- You expect me to just give you a hundred "K"?
- We're gonna give it to you.

654
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,729
And when Lem shows up in court,
you're gonna keep it.

655
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,731
And the catch is?

656
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:33,964
I.A.D.'s gonna ask you about it.
Might wanna look at your books.

657
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:39,099
Your business is profitable
lately, right?

658
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,441
- Very.
<i>- How'd those leads we</i>
<i>gave you last year work out?</i>

659
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,640
<i>Great. Could always</i>
<i>use a few more.</i>

660
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,208
How many jobs does it take you
to clear a hundred grand?

661
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,222
Why are you guys always coming
to me with this shit?

662
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:01,128
'Cause you're the last
honest guy we know.

663
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,566
<i>Hey. Found someone</i>
<i>willing to post bail.</i>

664
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,866
An old friend came through.

665
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,238
Kavanaugh will be looking
into that old friend.

666
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,176
Nothing to find.
He likes Lem.

667
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,611
I'll see if I can wake up a clerk,
get things fast-tracked.

668
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,275
Thanks.

669
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:24,878
<i>What? What is it?</i>

670
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,623
I'm stuck here.

671
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,993
I don't wanna convince
you all to turn on Lem...

672
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,328
and I don't want to convince
him to turn on you...

673
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,131
<i>but that's what a good lawyer would be</i>
<i>advising all of you to do right now.</i>

674
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,003
L-I don't want to see any
of you going to prison.

675
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,508
That's nice to know.

676
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,281
Right now...

677
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:55,284
<i>I think I'd make a better</i>
<i>friend than a lawyer.</i>

678
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,913
Lem-

679
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,048
Lem needs you
right now-

680
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,457
And we sure can't afford
to hire someone else.

681
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,228
<i>If you have to make a choice,</i>
<i>you go with Lem.</i>

682
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,495
And advise him to hurt you?

683
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:16,835
If you can make a deal that has me
switching places with Lem, then you do it.

684
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:21,503
Just me.
None of my guys.

685
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:25,480
I wanna see you get
your second chance.

686
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,817
I already have.

687
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,923
On behalf of the entire department,
I'd like to apologize...

688
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,021
<i>for the wrong done to you.</i>

689
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,033
The captain learned about the photos
earlier this afternoon, came to me.

690
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,035
- Did you find the dickwad, or what?
- Unfortunately, no.

691
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,867
<i>- The identity of the culprit's a mystery.</i>
- Great.

692
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,501
- So where does that leave me?
- During the course of our conversation...

693
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,205
I mentioned to the captain that you
have really great instincts...

694
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,077
and he agreed that
you have a lot of potential.

695
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,584
<i>- And potential needs to be nourished.</i>
<i>- I've asked permission...</i>

696
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,850
to take you under my wing, show you
the detective ropes in your spare time.

697
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,517
<i>Unless these photos have you too upset</i>
<i>to focus on career advancement?</i>

698
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,427
I see.

699
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,058
So, I keep my mouth shut,
I climb the ladder.

700
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,432
<i>Dutch is just offering</i>
<i>an opportunity.</i>

701
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,142
- Did you get rid of the rest of them?
- Every last one.

702
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,977
I look forward to working
with you, Detective.

703
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,892
Thanks, Captain.

704
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:49,159
<i>[Man On P.A.]</i>
<i>Security guards to cells "A"and "B."</i>

705
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,292
Prisoner all clear for release.

706
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,598
Hey!
Told you we'd get you out.

707
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,642
<i>Hey. Looks like</i>
<i>your hymen's still intact.</i>

708
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,303
Gonna have to get your own pussy
tonight, though, buddy. [Groans]

709
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,404
- Where's Vic at, man?
- He's, uh-

710
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,983
He had someplace he's gotta be.
He'll meet us later.

711
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,018
- Come on, man. Let's go grab a beer.
- Come on. Smitty's buying.

712
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,314
<i>- I am?</i>
<i>- Yesl</i>

713
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,119
- One round.
<i>- You're riding with me.</i>

714
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:23,330
What are you doing here?

715
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,459
Kavanaugh.

716
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,094
He's out of control.

717
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:34,007
He's unbalanced. He's breaking the rules.
He's threatening Lem's life.

718
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,875
I.A.D.'s your problem,
not mine.

719
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,850
The look on your face walking out
of his office today says otherwise.

720
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,851
He's got screws
in you too, yeah?

721
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,497
I, uh-

722
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,127
I'm an element in Kavanaugh's
investigation-

723
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,296
Price I pay for
having been your boss-

724
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:07,207
<i>But I'm hardly in the same</i>
<i>category as you and your guys.</i>

725
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,310
Really?

726
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,680
You think if Kavanaugh's successful
I'm gonna go down quietly?

727
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,052
[Laughs]

728
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:25,891
I will scorch the earth covering
this whole department, starting with you.

729
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,659
<i>I can tie you to every bullshit thing</i>
<i>Kavanaugh's accusing me of, and then some.</i>

730
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:34,397
Your stink will smell up every
voting booth in this city.

731
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,479
On the other hand...

732
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,673
you want that little nameplate
on your desk to read "Mayor" someday?

733
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,517
<i>We work together.</i>

734
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,490
<i>Make sure that you,</i>
<i>me, my team...</i>

735
00:44:55,592 --> 00:45:00,393
are the last men standing long
enough to go our separate ways.

736
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,100
