1
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,894
<i>Sangre nuevo, homes.</i>

2
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,110
<i>Police. Hold it right there.</i>

3
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,446
- Hands up. Against the car.
- Turn around.

4
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,817
<i>- I didn't do nothing, man.
- Buenos noches, muchachas.</i>

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,554
<i>- Nice boa.
- Sí.</i>

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,322
New tags, new ink.

7
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,831
What's up with that, Chapa?

8
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,494
<i>We're just changing brands.
Torrucos now.</i>

9
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,799
<i>- Torrucos now?
- Simón.</i>

10
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,966
Armadillo's calling you guys?

11
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,846
Armadillo's bro looks good
behind bars, huh?

12
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,328
You tell him I called.

13
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,557
Someone torched
Tio's drug crib.

14
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,821
- What if our blow was in there?
- Then it's gone.

15
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,392
Hey, we got a lot of
bread tied up in that shipment.

16
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,826
You're so worried about your
goddamn money you don't get it.

17
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,567
This could open up
an investigation into Tio's business.

18
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:18,025
If we're not careful,
all roads are gonna lead back to us.

19
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,198
<i>Go find Tio.
I'll take care of this.</i>

20
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,603
<i>- Let's just call Lem. I'll stay here and help.
- Did I ask for your help?</i>

21
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,008
- Hey.
- Morning, gentlemen.

22
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,249
- Guess I missed the weenie roast.
- What happened?

23
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,843
Arson. Started on the first floor.
Then the whole place went up.

24
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,477
<i>They were able
to determine that already?</i>

25
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,647
Whoever set the fire didn't try to
hide it. Gas can out back.

26
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,919
- What brings you here?
- My case.

27
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,097
We found the same graffiti
as the necklace tire executions.

28
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:47,726
- Do we have a motive yet?
- That's not all we have.

29
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,562
- Huh? Is that a kid?
- Not exactly.

30
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,102
<i>I'm shaking down
the new king cholo.</i>

31
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,911
Armadillo. I gave my card to
a few of his recruits.

32
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,915
I guess they weren't kosher.

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,955
Armadillo's my case. He raped a 12-year-old
girl last night to cover the tire murders.

34
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,993
- He raped a kid?
Why isn't he in Central by now?
- Her brother's uncooperative.

35
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,424
I think he took her
back to Mexico.

36
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,829
No victim, no arrest.

37
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,698
<i>- Why would he burn this building?
- I spoke to some of the locals.</i>

38
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,408
It appears the owner
is a Theodore Osmond.

39
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,535
He's selling more than
comic books. Drug dealer.

40
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,744
Armadillo burns out his competition
and sends me a message.

41
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,748
<i>- Me and my boys'll handle this.
- Hey, I'm just giving you
information. This is my case.</i>

42
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,786
You see that little piggy
with my card spiked to its head?

43
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,513
This is gangland...
my domain.

44
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,991
<i>- I'm already on it.
- Detective,
let me show you something.</i>

45
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,098
Any reason why the two of you
shouldn't pair up together?

46
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,464
I just think it would make more sense
if I handled this on my own.

47
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,528
<i>You're gonna see some kind of kicking
and screaming you didn't know existed...</i>

48
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,105
- you try pulling me off this.
- You both want it.

49
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,039
It's big enough for the two of you.
Work it together.

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,147
- Fine.
- Great.

51
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,728
Whoa, hold.

52
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,702
Maybe the doorbell works.

53
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,443
- Armadillo.
- What's this about?

54
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,513
<i>It's all about love, ese.</i>

55
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,016
Come on, boys. Let's go for a walk.

56
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,214
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

57
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,790
- Where were you...
- I was with some friends when the fire was set.

58
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,195
I'll give you their names.

59
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,899
You and your brother
are into a lot of things.

60
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,268
- Pimping drugs, consolidating chulitos.
- No, I'm not like my brother.

61
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,346
Navaro enjoys parties,
late nights.

62
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,838
I'm much more comfortable in bed
with a good book to read.

63
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,942
And a little girl to rape.

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,625
I have no outstanding warrants.
My visas are in perfect order.

65
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,321
There are no drugs, guns
or money in the house.

66
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,493
If you're such a good boy
then you do as I say.

67
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,327
Pack up your shit and get on the next
donkey back to home.

68
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,404
No.
I just got here.

69
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,441
I want to be
staying for a while, hmm?

70
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,147
Fine.

71
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,548
- Maybe you can stay at my house
for a little while.
- What's the charge?

72
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,819
I'll think of something on the way.

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,285
<i>Anyone of you guys
not named Martinez?</i>

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,323
This guy Perez, his license expired
eight months ago. I'm calling it in.

75
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,656
What's up with that, Xavier?
Lines too long at the D.M.V.?

76
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,299
<i>Yeah, okay. This guy Xavier, man.</i>

77
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,529
<i>He's got an outstanding warrant
for aggravated assault.</i>

78
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,929
Oh. Now we got you
for harboring a felon.

79
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,208
- For my wall, right next to your brother.
- Can I get a copy?

80
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,183
This guy's got a notorious reputation,
but his rap sheet's squeaky clean.

81
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,617
Unlike his brother, he's smart.
No mistakes so far.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,688
- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

83
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,987
Have you met our civilian auditor?
Claudette Wyms. Lanie Kellis.

84
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,389
- Hello.
- Hi. Another one?

85
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,257
<i>Yeah. The brother of that Mexican
national. If anything, he's worse.</i>

86
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,068
<i>Wow. Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.</i>

87
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,332
Oh, well, not at all.
I was just saying that...

88
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,006
unless we get this guy on something else,
the harboring charges won't hold him.

89
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,341
<i>I know. So does he.</i>

90
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,874
We have to find the guy who set
the fire, connect it to Armadillo...

91
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,776
then get him for the arson.

92
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,450
I want him
for more than that.

93
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:02,046
We'll start with the shop owner.
You know where I can find him?

94
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,458
- No.
- Really?

95
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:11,021
'Cause it says Theodore Osmond is registered
as one of your confidential informants.

96
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,536
Oh, Tio.
I haven't seen him in months.

97
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:20,666
Theodore Osmond? That's his real name?

98
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll get the word out.

99
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,379
- Meantime, I'll have my guys
hunt down the firebug.
- Good.

100
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,143
I'd like to observe
Detective Mackey on this.

101
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,977
- Sure. Give us a chance to talk.
- Actually, I was just coming to get you.

102
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,888
- A city official has just been shot.
- Who?

103
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,085
I don't have all the details, but I'm sure
your people will want you down there.

104
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,396
- Dutch, you've met Lanie Kellis?
- Of course.

105
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,830
We've got a city official
shot at Benton and Hollis.

106
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,299
I need you
down there right away.

107
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,527
<i>- Lanie's gonna ride along.
- Great.</i>

108
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,265
About you,
not the city official.

109
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,465
<i>- Do we know who the victim is?
- Uh, not yet.</i>

110
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,077
- Okay. You ready? Let's go.
- Uh, I--

111
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,042
<i>I guess so.</i>

112
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,386
You have a connection with the drug
dealer whose place just got burnt down?

113
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,114
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.

114
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,994
I asked you if there was any reason
not to bring Claudette into this.

115
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,656
Hey, you're the politician. Learn
to read between the goddamn lines.

116
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,925
I told you I wanted
to handle this thing myself.

117
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,264
What does this mean for us?

118
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,336
It just means
I'll have to be careful.

119
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,104
Tio's laying low at his kid's
mom's place. He's spooked.

120
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,974
- How long you freezing us out?
- Until I can trust the three of you again.

121
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,386
- Look, I'm really sorry, boss.
- Me too.

122
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,981
<i>- We made a mistake.
- Yeah, you did.</i>

123
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,724
I need one of you to come with me.
I don't give a damn which one.

124
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,434
<i>- You wanna go higher?
- No. No higher.</i>

125
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,036
Okay.

126
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,038
<i>All right. Come on.</i>

127
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,539
Go inside
with your mom, baby.

128
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,077
<i>Beautiful kid.</i>

129
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,271
Hi. You okay?

130
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,417
No.

131
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:14,875
<i>- A Mexican psycho torched
my goddamn building.
- Yeah, we saw.</i>

132
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,422
What'd you lose?

133
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:18,822
I got lucky. Most of the product
was cut, bagged, and out.

134
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,917
I had some cash and
my records in the safe.

135
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,390
- What safe?
- What records?

136
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,828
- Accounts ledger...
income, expenses, you know.
- No, I don't know.

137
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,990
I'm running a business. I gotta know
what's coming in and going out.

138
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,037
Going out? Like payments to me?
My name is in that goddamn ledger?

139
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,605
It's in code, man.
I call you "Landlord."

140
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,471
Hey, you and your boys didn't have
a problem with the way I do business...

141
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,203
- when I damn near doubled your cut.
- Where's the safe?

142
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,383
Back room of the shop.
One of those corporate espionage deals.

143
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,146
You try to force it open,
it destroys the contents.

144
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,446
- All right, all right. I'll get the safe.
- And I'll get Armadillo.

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,624
- I want you to stay here and lay low.
- This can't go unanswered.

146
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,823
It won't. I need a couple
of your guys, names and numbers.

147
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,555
Guys that know
how to use a Zippo.

148
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,536
<i>- Find out where the Torrucos are hanging.
- Want us to roust them?</i>

149
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,302
No. Give them this address.
Tell them to burn it on my signal.

150
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,540
And just the building. No bodies.
I wanna send a message, not start a war.

151
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,878
You think you can handle that?

152
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,613
- It's locked.
- Have Lem pick you up.

153
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,620
Need to use my phone?

154
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,003
<i>It's pretty quiet
for the shooting of a city official.</i>

155
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,707
I figured there'd be some news crews,
at least one of the independents.

156
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,571
Ray, what do we know?

157
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,237
<i>The victim was Helen Zamorski.
Shot three times in the back.</i>

158
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,313
No witnesses. No weapon.

159
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,449
- Took her to Mission Cross.
- Helen Zamorski.

160
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,451
<i>- Who is she?
- P.E.O.</i>

161
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,921
- P.E.O.?
- Parking enforcement officer.

162
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,357
- A meter maid? You gotta be shitting me.
- This is her machine right here.

163
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,227
This is our city official?

164
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,233
Will you get your captain
on the phone for me, please?

165
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,380
Hey. Got a call from
the fire inspector.

166
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,851
The safe was in
the back of the shop.

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,190
Cocaine residue and scales
were found upstairs.

168
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:35,593
- That will give us probable cause
for the search and seizure.
- Nice work.

169
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,589
- Can't wait to see what's inside.
- That makes two of us.

170
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,198
<i>- What do we have?
- The building's owner was definitely peddling.</i>

171
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,471
He's M.I.A.,
but we found his safe.

172
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:48,133
Maybe there's something inside
to tie Armadillo to him.

173
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,199
Tio's no saint,
but he's the victim here.

174
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,647
We have to go after Armadillo.
Get whoever set that fire to roll on him.

175
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:58,549
I know Tio's your C.I.,
but Armadillo hit him for a reason.

176
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,781
Motive's a pretty good
starting point.

177
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,783
I'll get a warrant
to open the safe.

178
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,979
<i>- I got a guy who can crack that.
- Great.</i>

179
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,991
- Any luck finding Tio?
- We got a couple of leads.

180
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,437
- What do you got?
- An address in Colorado Springs.

181
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:23,875
- Where?
- She's staying with a Camille Briskin.

182
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,470
- Some chick she went to college with.
- My kids with her?

183
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,175
- I'm on the next flight.
- Uh...

184
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,716
I just talked to my guy there.

185
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,685
- She's packing up to go someplace.
- Packing?

186
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,024
- Did this guy spook her?
- No, look. I trust him.

187
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,151
Let him stay on her.
Look, you go there now...

188
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,688
she's liable to be someplace
else by the time you land.

189
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,889
Let's just see how it plays out.

190
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,964
All right.

191
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,395
- My mom's the one that called.
- Yeah? Is your mom around?

192
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,076
<i>- Yeah.
- Ma'am, are you the one that called us?</i>

193
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,067
- About apartment two.
- What's the problem?

194
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,471
<i>- There's a terrorist in there.
- Terrorist?</i>

195
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,449
- Tell them about the smells.
- Chemicals, like he's makin'
dirty bombs or something.

196
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,019
<i>My babies sleep
on the other side of that wall.</i>

197
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,818
Look. I'm trying to raise
two boys by myself.

198
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,120
<i>- Now I gotta deal with these people?
- Okay. Fine. We'll check it out.</i>

199
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,060
I should come with you.

200
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,392
No, ma'am.
You should stay right here.

201
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,742
- Mr. Al-Thani?
- Zayed, yes.

202
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,643
Zayed, I'm Officer Sofer.
This is Officer Lowe.

203
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,546
<i>- Yes?
- We've received a complaint.</i>

204
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,855
A complaint?
About me?

205
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,985
It's her. She told you I was
a terrorist, didn't she?

206
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,986
<i>- Sir, if we could just come in...
- I did nothing wrong. You people
pick on me for no reason.</i>

207
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,292
<i>- Okay. Just let us come in,
take a quick look around.
- So.</i>

208
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,699
I am a suspect
just because I am Arab?

209
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,001
No, sir. You're a suspect because 19 guys
who look like your twin brother...

210
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,405
killed 3,000 Americans.

211
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,680
Look, the easiest way for us to handle this is
just let us come in, take a look around.

212
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,719
<i>Or we can file a report with the federal
government and let them check you out.</i>

213
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,419
<i>- God bless America.
- After you, sir.</i>

214
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,061
My brother sends it
to me from home.

215
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,663
<i>- I cannot control what they print.
- Where's home?</i>

216
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,936
- Damascus.
- How long have you been in this country?

217
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,513
Five years.
I have a job.

218
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,081
I pay taxes.

219
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,084
My wife.

220
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,787
<i>- What you making?
- Pickled fish.</i>

221
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,626
Mmm.

222
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,405
Well, thank you.
We appreciate your cooperation.

223
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,999
So you will tell the black one
that I am no terrorist?

224
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,212
We'll tell her.

225
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,151
<i>I found out where
Armadillo's boys are working from.</i>

226
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:22,951
The old Sugar Cube Lounge on Juniper.
Salsa by night, distribution by day.

227
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,925
I doubt they have permits.

228
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,725
Go in. Tell them you're
with Alcohol Control. Close it down.

229
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,727
Have Tio's boys light it up
once it's all clear.

230
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,035
Hey, Vic. We got a positive I.D.
on Armadillo's fire starter.

231
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,095
- Ripley Verdugo. He's, uh, flame retarded.
- Bring him in.

232
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,306
Hey, Vic. Shane told me
about your family splittin'.

233
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,539
I'm really sorry, man.

234
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,711
Are you an idiot?

235
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,454
<i>- Smith, you old drunk.
- Mackey, you bald bastard.</i>

236
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,093
- What are you doing?
- Same old. You look good, man.

237
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,551
- How's the brood?
- They're good. So Shane
brought you up to speed?

238
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,895
Yeah. You need me
to open some safe?

239
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,829
Right. Only I need you
to go through the front lock.

240
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,400
The boys said it's a smart safe.
By going through the lock...

241
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,596
it'll trigger the acid
and destroy whatever's inside.

242
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,439
Oh. I get it.

243
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,011
Oh, Smith.
This is Detective Wyms.

244
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,446
- Smith the locksmith? That's convenient.
- Yeah, I get that.

245
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,250
<i>- Looks like the Omni 600 series.
- Actually, it's the 700 series.</i>

246
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,423
Right.

247
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:47,697
Hold on. The manufacturer said
you gotta go through the back to
disarm the destruct mechanism.

248
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,009
What the hell's going on, man? I thought
you'd worked on these things before.

249
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,746
Yeah, sorry.

250
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,317
<i>I'll go through the back.</i>

251
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,284
- Good catch.
- Yeah.

252
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,724
It would take more than a few bullets
to bring down Officer Zamorski.

253
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,293
Officer Zamorski?
She's a meter maid.

254
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,988
We're all officers here.

255
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,929
<i>You know how much revenue
we bring in for this city?</i>

256
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,434
If it wasn't for people like Helen
Zamorski risking her life every day...

257
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,199
you guys would be making
less than schoolteachers.

258
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,274
And we appreciate it.

259
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,478
This is awful.

260
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,675
Helen writes 30% above
her quota every month.

261
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,710
- Helen's electronic ticket book
was smashed to pieces.
- Animals.

262
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,820
- Restroom?
- Yeah, it's in the back.

263
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,255
<i>I'd like to see who she
wrote tickets for today...</i>

264
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,550
specifically the last ticket
she wrote before she was shot.

265
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,960
I'd also like names of people she's written large
numbers of tickets to over the last year.

266
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,826
I'll print them out.

267
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,831
Hey, uh...

268
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,870
<i>who can I talk to
about a parking snafu?</i>

269
00:17:55,107 --> 00:18:00,545
- I got this $63 ticket.
- Ah, "No Parking 4:00 to 7:00."

270
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,204
Right. Yeah.
In front of the courthouse.

271
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,079
See, I was on the job.
I was testifying in a kiddie porn case.

272
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,189
We got the sick bastard, thank God.
But anyway, I got this ticket.

273
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,019
Aren't the police provided
parking off of Grand Avenue?

274
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,525
Yeah, but that's like
six blocks away.

275
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:21,324
I was running late for this, uh,
child pornography case.

276
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,991
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to challenge it in court.

277
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,631
Come on, a little help maybe.
One officer to another.

278
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,770
I don't fix parking tickets, sir.

279
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,308
And being a police officer
doesn't place you above the law.

280
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,684
- All set?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,351
<i>- This guy was quite the bookkeeper.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

282
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,326
What's he got in there?

283
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,026
Nothing about Armadillo,
but look at this.

284
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,099
He was making monthly payments
to a landlord when he owns the building.

285
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,343
Well, maybe Armadillo's the landlord.
Tio got tired of shelling out.

286
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:07,779
- Fire was the payback.
- Black dealer, Latino boss man?

287
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,608
I doubt it. Besides, he was making payments
weeks before Armadillo crossed the border.

288
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,151
Oh.

289
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,950
Maybe this is the guy
Armadillo's trying to squeeze out.

290
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,993
- Your boys find Tio?
- Yeah.

291
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:23,689
- Well, good. Let's bring him in.
- It's not that easy.

292
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,028
Sure it is. Come on.

293
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,002
- I'll bring him out.
- I'll come with.

294
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:39,211
Uh... He's my C.I. I just bring
a stranger in there, it'll blow the trust.

295
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,612
You said you hadn't seen him in months. You
don't know how squirrelly this guy might be.

296
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,973
- You're not going in there without backup.
- Look.

297
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,547
Tio's still valuable
to me, all right?

298
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,586
Now wait here.

299
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,456
I'll handle this.

300
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,981
Something I should know
about you and this guy?

301
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,053
No. I'll be right out.

302
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,835
If you come in voluntarily, it'll look
like you've got nothing to hide.

303
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:10,873
- You gonna watch my back, right?
- Yeah. And you're gonna watch
mine. She wants Armadillo.

304
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,375
<i>- Thinks grillin'you about the
landlord will lead to him.
- What do I tell her?</i>

305
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,774
<i>You're just another local shop owner
forced to pay protection money.</i>

306
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,783
Choose your favorite
band of brothers.

307
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,445
- One-niners, The Monks, Jack-uzis, got it?
- Yeah, I'm good.

308
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,750
Yeah, so is Wyms.
You be careful.

309
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,794
<i>I'm trying to lead her
down a different path.</i>

310
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,796
Here's the guy you're gonna I.D.

311
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,666
<i>I'm pretty sure
he's the firebug.</i>

312
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,831
<i>Now, you tell us that you saw him casing
the building last night before you left.</i>

313
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,777
No problem. What are we doing
about hitting Armadillo?

314
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,836
<i>We found out
where the Torrucos hang.</i>

315
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,478
Your little friends are gonna rip
a three-alarmer through it tonight.

316
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,245
<i>Vic.</i>

317
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,048
<i>- You get the plan?
- Yeah, I'm good.</i>

318
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,294
Everything okay in here?

319
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,260
Sure. Everything's fine.

320
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,499
<i>This is a list of your property.
I want you to take a look at it.</i>

321
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,009
That the bitch
that burned my place up?

322
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,045
You're here to tell us
what you know.

323
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,140
- Hey, Vic.
- I'm in the middle of something.

324
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,986
- It's important.
- Give me a minute.

325
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,951
I'll start without you.

326
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,291
- What's up?
- My guy. Followed Corrine
to the Colorado Springs airport.

327
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,624
Airport? Where's she going?

328
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,531
Come on.

329
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,533
Where the hell
is she going?

330
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,436
- Who does she know in Phoenix?
- Phoenix?

331
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,371
- Mm-hmm.
- No clue. That's what
I'm paying you to find out.

332
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,841
- And I'm trying, Vic.
- Are the kids with her?

333
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,010
Just the baby. Cassidy and Matthew
are still with the friend.

334
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,842
And I got another guy
waiting for her on that end.

335
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,849
Phoenix?

336
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,717
- Look, I gotta go. Call me
as soon as you know something.
- All right. I will.

337
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,416
- What did I miss?
- Tio found our guy.

338
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,789
This is the dude. Couldn't
miss that inked baldhead.

339
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,795
Saw him hangin' out
in the back lot when I was leavin'.

340
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,696
- Ripley Verdugo. Seven priors, three for arson.
- Consider him picked up.

341
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,674
- You coming with?
- No, you go ahead and pick up the suspect.

342
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,871
I'm gonna have
a little talk with Tio.

343
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,521
<i>Juice? Soda? A new distribution crib?</i>

344
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,323
- I'm here to help, lady.
- Good.

345
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,088
Let's talk about
your record keeping.

346
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:49,429
There are some pretty
interesting things in this ledger.

347
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,999
I'll tell you what.
I've never seen Vic this pissed.

348
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,740
He's pissed about his kids.
It's classic displacement, man.

349
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:57,231
- It's classic replacement I'm worried about.
- Think he'll boot us?

350
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,706
<i>Gimme a break.</i>

351
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,641
- What would Vic be without us?
- Maybe we'll find out.

352
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,710
I'm not going back to Traffic.

353
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,951
Let's just do our jobs,
and do it well.

354
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:07,976
Oh, so now that plan
makes sense to you?

355
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,978
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.
- Damn!

356
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,321
Put on a shirt, bitch.

357
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,263
Racked up quite
the parking portfolio, Barney.

358
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,735
- Thirteen hundred
and eighty-six dollars. Wow.
- Uh, yeah.

359
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,440
I get a lot on the job.
I lose track.

360
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,983
- What is your job?
- I'm a messenger.

361
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,646
- I gotta pay for any tickets I get.
- You got another one today.

362
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,259
Oh, yeah. So?

363
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,328
So the woman who wrote that ticket
was shot three times this morning.

364
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,896
She's gonna live,
but not like she used to.

365
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:58,468
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- She wrote you 34 tickets
in the last seven months.

366
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,936
- Maybe you're a little upset about that.
- Uh, yeah.

367
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,168
Yeah, I'm upset.
I don't have 1,300 bucks.

368
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,873
And I could lose my job.

369
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,878
But I didn't shoot her.

370
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,483
<i>Where were you at 9:30?</i>

371
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,520
I was, uh, in traffic
on my way to L.A.X.

372
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,160
- You fired a gun today, Barney?
- Of course not.

373
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,128
- You willing to take a G.S.R.?
- What is that?

374
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,635
Gunshot Residue Test.
Standard government test.

375
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,933
It detects whether you've
fired a gun recently.

376
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,433
Oh, yeah, sure.
If it'll help.

377
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:42,139
How does a novice comic book
merchant buy two buildings, cash?

378
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,508
Man, I can barely
cover my mortgage.

379
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,948
I'm smart with money.

380
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,987
If you're smart, how come you're
making payments to a landlord
when you don't have one?

381
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,921
<i>Being a C.I.
isn't a "get out of jail free" card.</i>

382
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,220
<i>We found scales
and drug residue above your shop.</i>

383
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,892
- I know you're dealing.
- Reality check.

384
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,595
My building getting smoked
makes me a victim.

385
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,710
<i>I can get that stack of cash in the safe
and the dollar amounts in this ledger...</i>

386
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:15,077
and have search warrants
for your home and other building.

387
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,843
What we find there
gonna make you a victim too?

388
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,383
Can I help you somehow?

389
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,785
<i>Help me get
Armadillo, and I ignore this ledger.</i>

390
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,125
That's Tio? He's the guy the Long Beach
sheriffs pulled over with your team.

391
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,597
Right.

392
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,735
- What else haven't you told me?
- Be quiet. I'm trying to listen.

393
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,532
How deep is your
relationship with this guy?

394
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,174
Deep enough.

395
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,243
- Can he hurt us?
- He won't.

396
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,612
<i>- He can't or he won't?
- He won't.</i>

397
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,949
We had a deal. You said
you were gonna clean up your act.

398
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,352
I'm in control.

399
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,493
I've got a watchdog in my house,
and now one of my best detectives...

400
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,552
is grilling the guy who can
blow the whistle on you.

401
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,462
Hey, how's she doing?

402
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,398
Aren't you working a case?

403
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,606
I got half an hour before
my next evil parking suspect shows up.

404
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,772
- We gotta stop this.
- Yeah, and we gotta be careful
the way we play Claudette.

405
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,580
<i>Come on, greaseball.
Let's go.</i>

406
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,450
Beauty.

407
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,729
- Firebug's here. Wanted to
give you the first crack at him.
- Thanks.

408
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,131
Let Tio stew.

409
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,463
I haven't finished with him yet.

410
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,597
Sure.

411
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,209
Look at my prayer mat.

412
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,971
I hang it here to dry.
And she had her dog rip it to pieces.

413
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,411
<i>Anyone could have done that. If it's
so sacred, you shouldn't leave it out.</i>

414
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,814
Somebody needs to put
that animal to sleep.

415
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,682
<i>Is that what you're doing in there?
Cookin'up gas to put us all to sleep?</i>

416
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,220
That's enough!

417
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,661
<i>Look, you had us search his place,
and we did. He's not a terrorist.</i>

418
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,119
Go back inside and restrain that dog
before I call animal control.

419
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,600
And you, stop egging her on.
Stop threatening her dog.

420
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,865
<i>And stop acting
like such a victim.</i>

421
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,096
<i>Both of you go inside
and stay inside your own apartments.</i>

422
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,471
<i>You do not want us
coming back here again.</i>

423
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,552
- You're learning.
- Good teacher.

424
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,859
Wanna tell me where you were
last night, Ripley?

425
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,825
I was home.

426
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,729
Jerkin' off into a sock.
You wanna see the evidence?

427
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,231
Have some manners
when you talk to me.

428
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,902
How long since you
looked like that?

429
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,102
<i>The shaved head thing went out
like six months ago. Why?</i>

430
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,648
- Jesus, I can't catch a goddamn break.
- What now?

431
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,153
- Tio I.D.'d a bald guy.
- Vic!

432
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,951
- Yeah?
- You care to tell me how our eyewitness Tio...

433
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,487
identified a thug from a year-old
police mug shot that only you and I had?

434
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,522
No clue, but I'm gonna
help you find out.

435
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,958
It's okay. You've done enough.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

436
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,623
You identified the right guy,
but the wrong hair.

437
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,402
Wrong hair? That's weird.

438
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:31,634
Now, you're gonna tell me why you lied
and who you're protecting, right now!

439
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,247
Tio will hold up.
He knows the drill.

440
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,374
You wanna put both our careers
in this guy's hands?

441
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,426
Why'd she do that?

442
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,664
Who are you paying
protection money to?

443
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,396
I saw who I saw.

444
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,810
What's your
connection to Mackey?

445
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm just a C.I.

446
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:15,147
<i>I tie that payout to a cop,
and I'll get you for racketeering.</i>

447
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,418
You hitch that to the intent
to distribute charge...

448
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,558
and you won't see your
baby girl until she's 35.

449
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,891
- Now talk to me!
- Claudette, you got a second?

450
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,060
- Now?
- Yes.

451
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,632
A club on Juniper
just went up in flames.

452
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,863
F.D. says it looks like the same
arson M.O. as the comic book store.

453
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,941
- I want you down there.
- I'm in the middle of this.

454
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:41,469
- Questioning a witness can wait.
- He could be the key to getting Armadillo.

455
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,509
An hour ago it was your mandate.
Now you've got me chasing fire engines?

456
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,681
I have a civilian auditor
evaluating my every move.

457
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,324
You're the primary detective on
this case. I need you on scene.

458
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,790
- This isn't a discussion.
- What is it exactly?

459
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,697
The cop said this was about
that parking lady that was shot today?

460
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,498
That's right, Izzy. And the last ticket
she wrote before that happened was to you.

461
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,900
Which means you're either
a witness or a suspect.

462
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,844
- Take a seat.
- Well, I didn't see anything.

463
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,176
- I guess that makes you a suspect.
- A suspect?

464
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,546
Look, I take the tickets
'cause it's cheaper than the garage.

465
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,517
- Cheaper?
- The parking structure is 22 bucks for the day.

466
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:27,692
I usually get two,
maybe three $30 tickets a week.

467
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:30,957
110 versus 90.
I'm saving 20 taking the fines.

468
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,354
So you knew you were
gonna get the ticket?

469
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,093
- It's part of doing business.
- Are you willing to take
a Gunshot Residue Test?

470
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,965
- Will it cost me anything?
- Only if you're lying.

471
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,847
- Burn this. No more bookkeeping.
- Understood.

472
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:52,442
<i>You're out of here. Lay low.</i>

473
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,945
- Yeah?
- Corrine caught a connecting flight
in Phoenix.

474
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,152
She's due in Burbank
in 40 minutes.

475
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,086
- She's coming here? I should go...
- Let me tail her.

476
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,954
See what she's planning.
Be ready for my call.

477
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,494
Okay.

478
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,665
<i>A high-level city official.</i>

479
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,639
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't have a chance
to return your call.

480
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:23,008
<i>Is there some reason you didn't want me
following Detective Mackey today?</i>

481
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,740
<i>- Of course not.
- Excuse me.</i>

482
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,585
<i>It was arson.
But it was Torruco base.</i>

483
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,748
- Someone trying to pay back Armadillo.
- That was fast.

484
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,690
I'll see if Tio knows anything.

485
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,193
- We cut him loose.
- What?

486
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,026
Didn't have enough to hold him.
We had to release him and his property.

487
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,031
<i>- The ledger?
- Yes.</i>

488
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,136
What ledger?

489
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,308
Nothing important.

490
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,577
<i>Three shots. The victim's book
was smashed to pieces.</i>

491
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,290
- This was a rage crime. Try this.
- Nope.

492
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:08,453
- Mr. Thrifty knew he was getting the ticket.
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,723
- Mmm, it's homemade. Try it.
- Yeah?

494
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,659
Barney's just way too passive.

495
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,733
- Plus, they both willingly agreed to a G.S.R.
- So what are you gonna do now?

496
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,405
I'll take a look at other
crimes in the area this morning.

497
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,863
Make sure somebody wasn't trying
to avoid being put at the wrong
place at the right time.

498
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,905
- G.S.R. results came back
on Barney Plotkin. Positive.
- What?

499
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,208
Oh, the "way too passive" guy?

500
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,147
Let me see that.

501
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,421
Look out.

502
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,858
You failed the G.S.R., Barney.

503
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,528
Oh, really?
Can I take it again?

504
00:32:54,672 --> 00:33:00,178
No. In ten minutes, I'll have
a search warrant for your car and home.

505
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:03,909
I'm gonna find the gun you used
to shoot Helen Zamorski.

506
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,715
- It's three inches.
- Excuse me?

507
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,189
My tire was in the red
three inches...

508
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,191
and she gave me a ticket.

509
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,128
She finds me every time.

510
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,262
I asked her nicely.
She just laughed.

511
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,019
Barney.

512
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:45,285
If you knew you shot her,
why did you agree to the residue test?

513
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,117
Well, if I didn't take it,
I'd look guilty.

514
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,558
And... And you said
it was a government test...

515
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,657
so I figured,
how reliable could it be?

516
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,540
I just got off the phone with the D.A.
They cut a deal with Ripley.

517
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:05,065
He confessed to the arson
and turned in two accomplices...

518
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,171
with the understanding that
the three of them will do time
together at Terminal Island.

519
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,373
This guy's taking over the
goddamn prisons, consolidating
his guys into one place.

520
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,075
The D.A. never
should've signed that.

521
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,550
And we can never charge
Armadillo with this crime.

522
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,485
And since we've got
nothing on the rape, he walks.

523
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,516
I'm afraid so.

524
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,527
You send me on a bogus run.
You cut loose the only lead I have.

525
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,462
<i>And then you let this guy cut a deal that
buries my case. What the hell is going on?</i>

526
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,728
- We want this as much as you do.
- We got three arsonists off the streets.

527
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,772
<i>- That's a pretty good day.
- Save the statistic crowing
for your civilian auditor.</i>

528
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,536
What happened here today
was bullshit!

529
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:43,648
<i>I don't know exactly
what the puzzle looks like yet...</i>

530
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,446
but the pieces I see
are pretty goddamn ugly.

531
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,188
I have never interfered
with how you run your team...

532
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,990
<i>or how you run for office.</i>

533
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:01,699
I get assigned a case.
I'm gonna find the truth.

534
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:05,396
And if I have to go
through both of you... I'll get it.

535
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:17,879
Dutch just got the meter maid shooter.
Is there a problem?

536
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:22,748
Just a little misunderstanding.
A difference of opinion. Keeps us all honest.

537
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,298
<i>"Harboring a felon"?</i>

538
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,563
Come on.
That's a stretch, even for this precinct.

539
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,902
- I'll be in touch.
- I know.

540
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,767
<i>I'd rather it didn't
cover my window.</i>

541
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,378
It wouldn't hurt you to look out and be
reminded of what country you're living in.

542
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,073
<i>- I am reminded every time
I look at your ugly face.
- Hey, hey!</i>

543
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,084
- This is my window, my property.
- Move back to your cave, Osama.

544
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,587
Why don't you go back to the jungle?
No job, raising fat, stupid children.

545
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,317
That's it!

546
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,620
<i>- Sir, get back in the house.
- Back inside.</i>

547
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,465
Talk about my boys like that,
and I'll cut your tongue out!

548
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,299
- Drop it!
- Don't you talk about my boys!

549
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,795
- You don't protect me. Allah protect me.
- Put down the gun!

550
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,804
- Drop the gun!
- I do nothing wrong.

551
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,774
- Drop the gun right now!
- I just don't want to be bothered
by her, him, or you.

552
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,852
Zayed. Zayed!

553
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,882
Zayed!

554
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,053
Where's your Allah now?

555
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,668
- Sounds like a clean shoot.
- I didn't have a choice.

556
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,313
C.I.I.D. will be here
to do follow up.

557
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:58,840
Fatality involved. Mandatory
downtime for the next two days.

558
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,317
Just take it easy, okay?

559
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,419
Call if you need anything.

560
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,418
Okay.

561
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,434
Everything seems
exceptionally calm.

562
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,801
No one seems too concerned
about a dead Arab, I guess.

563
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:26,544
How bad would this scene be for you if
the other neighbor were laying there dead?

564
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,876
<i>People are still looking
for a reason to riot.</i>

565
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,510
It would be very bad.

566
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,122
<i>Is there someone I can call
for you? No one at all?</i>

567
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,235
<i>- What do you mean disappeared?
- I mean they're bone gone.
Three of my best dealers.</i>

568
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,997
<i>- You called?
- Callin', pagin', two-wayin'
They ain't answerin', man.</i>

569
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,698
It's Armadillo. He's probably already
got tires around their goddamn necks.

570
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,276
All right, relax. Round up the rest
of your guys. Get them to lay low.

571
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,743
He's completely punking us, man.

572
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:08,147
- It's time to send his "cholo-ing" ass south.
- Yeah, like six feet south.

573
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:13,747
Hey, you relax too. Jesus Christ,
am I the only one thinking around here?

574
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,703
How did the arson go?

575
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,808
All smoke and mirrors.

576
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,205
Why so vague?

577
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,412
- You don't wanna know.
- Sure, I do.

578
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,081
You mean,
you don't wanna tell me.

579
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,553
And you think
you can't read women.

580
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,232
<i>- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, fine. Thanks. Why?</i>

581
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,297
Just... Nothing.

582
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,668
It was great spending time with you.
I hope I didn't make too many mistakes.

583
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,035
Not at all.
Thank you for all your time.

584
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,142
If you wanna talk some more,
maybe we could grab a meal sometime.

585
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,214
Dutch, hitting on me...
that is a mistake.

586
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:17,718
N-No. I meant if you wanted
to ask some more questions...

587
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,685
I've got a girlfriend.

588
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,289
Christ.

589
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,326
She made a stop
at the county courthouse.

590
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,694
Made copies of the kids'
birth certificates, came here.

591
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,436
- What, a P.I.?
- Yeah. A big one.

592
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,633
He played one season for the Rams.
Thinks he's Dick Butkus.

593
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,871
<i>Jesus.</i>

594
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,841
<i>- Oh, God.
- Liman.</i>

595
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,484
<i>- Morgal.
- This is a confidential matter.</i>

596
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,712
Yeah, a matter of betrayal.
She took his children away from him.

597
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,553
<i>He's been looking for them
for over a month.</i>

598
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,090
- Where are Cassidy and Matt?
- I'm not gonna do this.
- You don't have to answer him.

599
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,528
- Who the hell is this ape?
- Your children are where you can't hurt them.

600
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,224
Hur... What is he talking about?
Corrine.

601
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,199
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

602
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,396
- Let me do the talking, Corrine.
- Shut your mouth, you big, fat-necked prick.

603
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,974
<i>- One more step and she
signs a restraining order.
- Stop it.</i>

604
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,838
- Corrine!
- I'm scared for our kids.

605
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,444
'Cause of what happened with Gilroy?
That was a one-time thing.

606
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,116
- Let's go.
- Don't do this, Corrine.

607
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,607
- Sorry.
- Corrine, you're not gonna
at least talk to me?

608
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,853
It's not just Gilroy. It's all of it.

609
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,387
- Get out of my way!
- This is exactly the kind
of behavior I'm talking about.

610
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,550
- That's my daughter!
- No!
- Hey, no!

611
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,457
<i>- That's enough, Morgal.
- The I.A.D. investigations.</i>

612
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,830
<i>The civil suits. The money
that mysteriously appears.</i>

613
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,800
You got a lot to answer for.

614
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,406
You're investigating me?
Corrine. Corrine!

615
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,669
- I don't know what else to do.
- Corrine!
- Don't.

616
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,042
We'll get them back. Vic!

617
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,484
<i>We'll get them back.</i>

618
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,890
- What?
- Mackey! Mackey!

619
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,359
Tio?

620
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,646
- I asked you to leave.
- This is my house.

621
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,984
Unless you have a warrant,
you're breaking the law.

622
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,896
One of these laws?

623
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,602
I told you to leave.

624
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,542
Vic!

625
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,179
<i>Vic!</i>

626
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,410
You ready to go now, huh?

627
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,187
Vic, Jesus!

628
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,766
I don't have to leave.

629
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,678
You planning to leave?

630
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,251
You'll just have to kill me.

631
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,515
Tell me you're leaving. Say it!

632
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,894
<i>Vic!</i>

633
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,332
I wanna hear you say it.
Say it!

634
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,768
Vic! Vic, that's it!

635
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,568
<i>Come on.
