1
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:05,625
Damn, girl! That's what I'm
talking about.

2
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:21,854
Don't shake that in my man's face.

3
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,754
- Who are all these white folk?
- They're from the record label.

4
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,854
Oh, yeah. Give me that, girl. Yeah.

5
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:37,054
- How does she move like that?
- That's what the guys like.

6
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:39,454
Sir...

7
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:42,854
You've had too much to drink.

8
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:45,154
Who are you?

9
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:48,354
- I'm a cop.
- You undercover?

10
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:51,354
Security. So behave yourself.

11
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:55,954
Everybody put your hands together
for all the ladies shaking it up in here.

12
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:57,154
Word up!

13
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:03,854
Word up, y'all.

14
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:07,754
I wanna thank everybody for coming
out to my album release party.

15
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:10,754
"Back From the Ashes,"
you know what I'm saying?

16
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,954
- Feels good to be back behind the mike.
- Hey, Kern!

17
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:17,854
- Do that duet with Tyesha.
- Rondell in the house.

18
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:21,154
Where Tyesha at? Where Tyesha at?
Come here.

19
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:25,654
This is Kern's party, y'all.

20
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:29,054
My release party ain't gonna be
for another month.

21
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,454
- Trouble.
- You can hear me sing then.

22
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,754
- Tonight's Kern's night.
- Where my money, Kern?

23
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,054
Yo, there go the thief right there.

24
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,254
I want my money, homey.
Where my money, Kern?

25
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,554
- Hey, yo. Hey, hey, hey.
- I want my money.

26
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:43,454
- My beef ain't with you, playboy.
- What?

27
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:46,254
- If it's with Kern, it's with me.
- Hey, back up.

28
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:48,354
This is a private party.

29
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:49,854
You can't get into trouble.

30
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,754
Do I have to call in the cavalry?
Step back.

31
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,254
Police can't protect you forever, Kern.
Remember that.

32
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:58,954
- Get out of here. Go.
- It's T-Bonz, homey.

33
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:02,754
- Punk ass out of here, man.
- You heard me. Go.

34
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,954
- Get lost, bitch.
- Who you calling a bitch?

35
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,554
Stay down! Shit!

36
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:20,854
Danny, you all right?

37
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,854
Hey, man, those fools were shooting
up in here.

38
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:26,654
- Lemon!
- Somebody call 911!

39
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,854
Rumble in the jungle.

40
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:35,354
- What happened?
- Two dead, six wounded.

41
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,954
T-Bonz and his crew
were looking for a fight...

42
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:40,654
...and Rondell and some of Kern's guys
gave it to him.

43
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,854
- Don't tell me.
- Rondell was the shooter.

44
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:45,654
It's just what we needed.

45
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,754
Hey. Hey, Vic.
You're missing all the fun.

46
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:53,454
Dutch, how many times I got to tell you,
you can't feel up the witnesses.

47
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:58,354
- Took one in the ass. Bet it's not...
- It's not the first time. Good one.

48
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:02,154
Uh-oh. Look who's the last one
to a "shots fired" call.

49
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,854
All safe and secure, captain.
Shooting stopped.

50
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:08,154
Nothing to worry about here.

51
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,354
You two were moonlighting?

52
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:14,454
Our shift commander signed off on it.

53
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,354
Any suspects in custody?

54
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:20,054
Well, the night is young.
Let me do my thing.

55
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:23,054
Do you mind if I include others
in this investigation?

56
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:25,754
You sign the checks.

57
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,954
Pete and Dutch team up.
Strike Team will assist as they see fit.

58
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:31,954
Any problems with that?

59
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:34,254
Just that time's a-wasting.

60
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,954
I won't put up with shooting galleries
in Farmington.

61
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:40,454
Find out who pulled the triggers
and bring them in.

62
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,754
Knute Rockne, he ain't.

63
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,354
I may have to put up with you
working under my roof...

64
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,554
...but it's still my roof.

65
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:55,854
So just do your job...

66
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:58,254
...and stay out of my way.

67
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:03,754
Sounds like good advice for both of us.

68
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,754
Let's get to work.

69
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,297
- The guy throwing the party...
- Kern Little.

70
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:29,097
And this T-Bonz,
they weren't the shooters?

71
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:33,297
- Not that I saw. Just their pals.
- Can you ID any of them?

72
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:36,897
- I can look through the books.
- This will spill into the street quick.

73
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,297
Let's talk to both generals,
get them to stand down their armies.

74
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,797
- Starting where?
- Kern Little.

75
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,697
- Who's Kern Little?
- Listen, Dutchboy...

76
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:49,597
...don't get your clogs all dirty.
We'll deal with Kern Little.

77
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:54,497
- Who is it?
- Open up, Rondell.

78
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:58,297
- What's up, Vic?
- Why'd you shoot up the Chez Club?

79
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:03,597
Hey, man, T-Bonz and Kern
got this war going on, man.

80
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:06,397
- I'm just backing up my boy.
- Who's that? Kern?

81
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,997
- Hey, this thing high-def?
- Yeah. Don't get your prints on it, man.

82
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,197
Sweet.

83
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:16,397
Look, me and Kern, we been hanging
since we was kids. We're still tight.

84
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,597
Don't you mean Kern financed
your entry into the drug business?

85
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:22,497
Yeah. No comment.
But that's the rumour.

86
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,197
What's the beef between
Kern and T-Bonz?

87
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:29,597
T-Bonz was on Kern's record label.
Then he started selling a lot of discs.

88
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:33,697
T-Bonz split, start his own outfit.
Hey, bad blood ever since.

89
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:37,497
- Hey, what's with all the vinyl here?
- Hey, hey, hey, it sounds better.

90
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,997
Would you put those back
the way you found them.

91
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:43,197
That's my Blue Note collection.
I got them chronological from...

92
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:46,497
- Did you hit anybody last night?
- Look, if somebody got smoked...

93
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:49,497
...it wasn't me. I was just shooting
to be shooting.

94
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,497
Give me your piece.

95
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:55,097
Come on, come on, just give it to me.

96
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,197
Keep your dealers inside
until I give the all clear.

97
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:02,297
- I don't want more targets on the street.
- Vic, man, come on.

98
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:04,297
Business is going to take a big hit.

99
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,697
Then take it.
You get to deliver product...

100
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:11,297
...only so long as this neighbourhood
doesn't resemble the Gaza Strip.

101
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,397
Now, that was our deal. You remember?

102
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,497
Yeah, I remember.

103
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:18,797
Set up a meet. Me and Kern Little.

104
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:21,997
- Man, why you need me to do that?
- You two are buds.

105
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:25,097
- I want it to be on friendly terms.
- Anything else, man?

106
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:28,597
Yeah. I need two shooters
from your side.

107
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:33,297
Oh, come on, man, you kidding.
Come on, man. No.

108
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,397
Is it gonna be you?

109
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:38,197
And I run your gun through ballistics?
Huh?

110
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,897
Or you got some names for me?

111
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:44,797
- Welcome to the Barn.
- Make yourselves at home.

112
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:51,497
Just doing my job.
And staying out of your way.

113
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,997
- You look great.
- Stay focused.

114
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,597
Now, he owns three different
car dealerships.

115
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:06,997
Him, a chain of grocery stores.

116
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:10,197
There's more money here
than in Mexico City.

117
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,897
- Which one's Machado?
- Right there.

118
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:16,497
This whole thing is his baby.
You better say hi before he disappears.

119
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,697
- Okay.
- Remember how we talked about it.

120
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,697
- I'll wing it.
- David...

121
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:25,497
- I'm joking.
- This could be your one chance.

122
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,297
- You ready?
- As I'll ever be.

123
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,497
Señor Machado. I'm David Aceveda.

124
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,497
Our young police captain. Welcome.

125
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:36,797
It's an honour to meet you.
This is my wife, Aurora.

126
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,197
What a wonderful
housing development.

127
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:43,197
It's a step forward in improving
our neighbourhood.

128
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,197
- I'm glad you both could come.
- Thank you for including us.

129
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,297
I'm in your debt.

130
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:50,697
Don't think me overly generous, David.

131
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:53,597
As you'll discover,
I often have ulterior motives.

132
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:56,797
You see, you're actually in a position
to help me.

133
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,097
How so?

134
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:03,097
My nanny hasn't seen her husband
since he left the house a few days ago.

135
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,397
He's a day-worker.

136
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:09,097
Waits for jobs by the home
improvement centre in your district.

137
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:13,897
- Well, is this absence unusual for him?
- Not exactly.

138
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:16,597
They are an emotional couple.

139
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,497
They fight, he leaves, he comes back.
But he has never been gone this long.

140
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:25,697
My nanny's quite upset, which means
my wife is upset, which means...

141
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:29,197
I don't have to tell you
what that means.

142
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:33,397
Just give me the pertinent information.

143
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,297
I'd be glad to help.

144
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,597
Looks as if I am now in your debt.

145
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,997
- You listening to this?
- It's sweet.

146
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,697
Sing me a song about last night.

147
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:51,997
Man, that'd be a short-ass song.

148
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,697
As soon as I seen them dudes coming
with them big guns...

149
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,897
...I just got Tyesha the hell up
out of there.

150
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:00,597
Nice place.

151
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:03,897
I told everybody my first studio
gonna be in Farmington.

152
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:07,497
You can't record a hardcore
hip-hop song working in Bel Air.

153
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:11,268
- You got to keep it in the 'hood, baby.
- How am I sounding, baby?

154
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,868
What?

155
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:16,668
Like 2 million CDs, double platinum.

156
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:20,368
- Tyesha, this is officer...
- I'm Vic. Just call him Lemonhead.

157
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,468
- Hey
- Hey. This is Rocco.

158
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:28,068
It's a madhouse out there. How'd you
get past all the photographers?

159
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,668
We called ahead. Kern let us use
the security entrance.

160
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,668
Kern's not under arrest, is he?

161
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:37,968
Unfortunately for those
tabloid hacks, no.

162
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:41,068
- We just needed a statement.
- Which I gave.

163
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,268
- And his help with this war.
- Well, it's not Kern.

164
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:47,068
It's his boys trying to protect him.

165
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:50,868
T-Bonz is just plain crazy.
Everybody knows that.

166
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:54,568
Don't worry about T-Bonz,
we'll deal with him.

167
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:59,268
I need you to give the word
to your crew. The war is over.

168
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,668
Right after T-Bonz gives his word.

169
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,368
I mean, T-Bonz's the one that
spilled blood on my turf.

170
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:08,168
I'm nothing if not a man of peace.

171
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,068
Dutch?

172
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:17,468
I'm running known associates
on the shooters Mackey brought in.

173
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,568
We ever getting DSL around here?

174
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:23,068
This is Ellie Ruiz.
I need you to help her out.

175
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:26,668
- I'm working the Chez Club.
- Shockley can handle it.

176
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:29,868
I need you to help find Ellie's husband,
Manuel.

177
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,368
I can't believe we're doing this
for some fat cat's nanny.

178
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,968
- You'd be happier if it was a mistress?
- It's abuse of power.

179
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,968
Oh, you're upset
you got pulled off a big case.

180
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,768
We're Aceveda's errand boys.

181
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,368
Meanwhile, watch him cash in
on our hard work.

182
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:53,268
So looking for a missing
migrant worker isn't important?

183
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:55,468
- You do all the talking.
- Why me?

184
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:56,868
You speak Spanish.

185
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,568
How can you be a cop in L.A.
For 12 years...

186
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,968
...and not speak any Spanish?
- All my partners spoke Spanish.

187
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:05,268
- Besides, I know a phrase or two.
- Right.

188
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,568
Yo no sé means: I don't know.

189
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,468
You hear it enough, it sinks in.
Missing hombre?

190
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,668
Yeah.

191
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,468
Manuel Ruiz?

192
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,868
- There.
- Hey, hey!

193
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:30,068
Hey, hey. You, amigo. Amigo.

194
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,368
What's your name?

195
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:36,668
Come on. You wouldn't be
sneaking away if you yo no sé'd.

196
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,968
Now, you know Manuel, don't you?

197
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,168
Yes.

198
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:47,268
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- What?

199
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,568
Back up!

200
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,568
Let's roll, man!

201
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:56,168
Don't you make me break a sweat
trying to catch you!

202
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,968
What the hell are you doing out?

203
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,668
- Business.
- Rondell ordered you off the street.

204
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,568
- No, not us.
- Run on home.

205
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:11,168
What I'm gonna tell the boss?

206
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:12,668
I am the boss.

207
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:17,468
- What I'm gonna tell Rondell?
- Don't worry. I'll tell him for you.

208
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:21,968
- What's up, man?
- I saw two of your guys on the street.

209
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,468
- Man, it's a free country.
- Nothing's free.

210
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:26,468
I'm your landlord, Rondell.

211
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:29,168
I let you use space that I own.

212
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:33,268
Now, you can't follow by my rules,
then I'll find someone who can.

213
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,968
- You got me?
- I got you.

214
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:42,368
Now, smart-ass, who else
you got dealing and where?

215
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:46,068
Manuel got picked for a job
on Tuesday, along with another man.

216
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:49,068
- Eduardo Salcido.
- Salcido.

217
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,468
Any connection between this Manuel
and Eduardo?

218
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:55,368
- They were best friends in Mexico.
- Even snuck into the country together.

219
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,368
Something happened
on that truck ride.

220
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:00,668
Ever since, Eduardo's been
telling people he's gonna kill Manuel.

221
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,868
We know who hired the two of them?

222
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:06,668
- Truck logo said Jamison Contracting.
- Well, track it down.

223
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,768
Find out if they ever
showed up for work.

224
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:14,268
All units, code 213,
intersection of Alvarado and Pine.

225
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,568
That's our corner.

226
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:19,468
Goddamn it! He had to leave his guys
on the street!

227
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,568
Punch it!

228
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,724
Police!

229
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,724
Down there.

230
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,824
Call EMT!

231
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:10,624
Oh, man.

232
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:24,526
The mayor knows the little boy, Vic.

233
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:25,826
You're shitting me.

234
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:29,426
Belongs to his golf buddy's
second cousin or some such thing.

235
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,326
Whatever. He's invested.

236
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:37,226
Any word on the kid's condition?

237
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,526
He's busted up pretty bad.

238
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:44,926
So I got nothing good to tell the chief.

239
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,626
How do I explain
these four dead thugs?

240
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:52,726
A war. Two rappers.
I know who they are.

241
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,726
Look, I'm handling it.

242
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:58,526
I told the chief the Strike Team
would make a difference.

243
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:01,826
That these things will stop.
I'm not seeing the difference.

244
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,826
Temporary setback.

245
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:07,526
The chief allows me to appropriate
funds for you based on results.

246
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:10,426
If I can't defend you,
I can't afford you.

247
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,626
Vic.

248
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,426
- Thought you should know.
- Know what?

249
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,926
Kid was DOA.

250
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,726
I'm handling it.

251
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,526
Knock, knock.

252
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:41,526
Have a seat.

253
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,126
- All right.
- Tough guy.

254
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,326
This war ends right here
with a handshake.

255
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,426
This fool stole my money
and my woman...

256
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,426
...and you expect me
to be a gentleman?

257
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:55,326
- What, Tyesha was your woman?
- Hell, yeah.

258
00:15:56,126 --> 00:16:00,426
- We're not signing autographs, ladies.
- Okay.

259
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,526
So basically, this is a dick wagging
contest over a piece of ass?

260
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:07,526
This ain't about no piece of ass.

261
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,526
- It's about $2 million that fool owe me.
- Two million dollars?

262
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,326
- What 2 mil?
- Tyesha's money from the last CD.

263
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:17,326
I broke her. Where my cut?

264
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:19,526
First up, calm down, money.

265
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,926
I'm a businessman.
I can be fair.

266
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:25,326
But $2 million,
you must be smoking crack.

267
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,126
I'll give you a finder's fee.
Straighten you out.

268
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:31,026
I'm doing your punk-ass a favour.
You owe me at least 10.

269
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:34,126
You know what, T?
I'm gonna keep it real with you.

270
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,226
Tyesha wasn't even selling records
till I hooked her up. And that's real.

271
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,526
- Oh, is that real?
- Hey, look, look, look.

272
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:45,926
Your 10 lawyers can do battle with his
10 lawyers or we can settle this here.

273
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:48,426
- I'm gonna get my money, bitch.
- Over my dead body.

274
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,726
- Damn, that sound like a good idea.
- Shut up!

275
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:53,826
Here's the deal.

276
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,426
Kern, you take tonight,
come up with a number.

277
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:02,326
You revise yours down a bit.
You bring me the numbers...

278
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,726
...I'll decide what's fair.

279
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,526
And who you supposed to be?
Judge Judy?

280
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:14,526
I'm an impartial arbitrator with the
power to throw your asses in the can.

281
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:19,226
Now, I'm calling a 24-hour cease-fire.

282
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:22,226
Your boys break it, I break you.

283
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,326
Same goes for you.

284
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,126
This war ends here.

285
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,026
They come here of their own accord.
Nobody's coercing them.

286
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,926
Family of five moving to another
country just to eat isn't coercion?

287
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:43,826
You know why they come here?
Five words: Free market's rule of law.

288
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:48,626
Those things create prosperity,
which creates jobs people want.

289
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:51,626
Forty dollars for a full day's work
isn't prosperity.

290
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:54,426
It's exploitation and you wouldn't do it.

291
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,926
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

292
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,626
Yeah. We're looking for a worker
named Eduardo?

293
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,726
Throw a rock, you're bound to hit one.

294
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,926
Have you seen this guy?

295
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,726
- Yeah. Jose.
- Manuel.

296
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:14,026
Yeah. He showed up a few days ago,
worked for one day, got paid...

297
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,926
...never saw him again.
What did he do?

298
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,226
Have any idea what happened
after he left?

299
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:21,026
Don't know, don't care.

300
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:23,626
Mind if we ask around for Eduardo?

301
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:26,826
- Ask away.
- Thanks.

302
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,426
Eduardo?

303
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:35,426
- Eduardo?
- Eduardo?

304
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,326
Eduardo?!

305
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:44,226
It's not me. I think he's working
down over there.

306
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,626
Hey! Stop!

307
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,426
I said, stop! Hold it right there!

308
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:53,426
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

309
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,726
Hey, San Salvador is that way!

310
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,026
These the triggermen at the Chez Club?

311
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,326
Some of them, I think. Happened fast.

312
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:18,926
Rondell Robinson.
You saw him firing the gun in the club?

313
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,826
Yeah.

314
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,826
- Beautiful.
- You know who he is?

315
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,826
Yes, I do.

316
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,726
Let's make this short and sweet.

317
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,526
Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.

318
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,826
- Whatever you think I did, I didn't.
- That's your story?

319
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,826
- Cover to cover.
- I wouldn't plan on selling movie rights.

320
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:43,426
Guess I'll just have to settle
for starring in it.

321
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,826
You're a murder suspect, Rondell.

322
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:49,426
I've got a witness saw you
pull the trigger at the Chez Club.

323
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,826
Yeah, right. What witness?

324
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,626
A cop. And a jury's gonna love her.

325
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:04,826
- I got a phone call coming, right?
- You've only got one thing left to deal.

326
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:08,226
- That's who's giving you protection.
- I don't need no protection.

327
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,226
Even if we can't tie you
to one of the dead bodies...

328
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,726
...discharging a firearm
in a crowded club...

329
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,126
Bye-bye, Rondell.

330
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:21,726
So about that phone call.

331
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:24,326
If you think that you can sell drugs...

332
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,926
...and commit murder in my district
because a cop's protecting you...

333
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,526
...you're dead wrong!

334
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:33,826
- I thought I told you to lay low.
- I was listening to Miles Davis...

335
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,826
...when this captain shows up.
- He get anything?

336
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:40,326
No. I always keep my crib clean.

337
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:44,526
But he's got a serious bug up his ass
about some cop protecting me.

338
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,726
Just keep your mouth shut.
I'll handle Aceveda.

339
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:52,226
We have indications Manuel's
disappearance may involve foul play.

340
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:56,426
- Really? You don't know for sure?
- We have a suspect.

341
00:20:56,626 --> 00:21:01,026
He won't be able to elude us for long.
Once we capture him, we'll know more.

342
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,426
Thank you for making this a priority.
You keep me apprised?

343
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:08,026
Of any developments.

344
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:13,326
Is there something else?

345
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,826
At the risk of having
an ulterior motive myself...

346
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,826
Yes.

347
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:23,926
I know police officers aren't accorded
the same respect in this community...

348
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:27,426
...as they were a decade ago.
- An unfortunate development.

349
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:32,526
However, Latinos are a plurality
in Los Angeles...

350
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,826
...and in this district.

351
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:38,326
There is going to be a seat opening up
on the City Council next year.

352
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:43,226
It's traditionally been filled
with a black candidate.

353
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,326
I think it's our time.

354
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:48,826
I agree.

355
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:52,126
With your backing...

356
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:54,626
...I could win that seat.

357
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:57,826
I could be of great use to you.

358
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:04,726
I like you, David, quite a bit...

359
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,726
...but I don't think I can sell a cop
to these voters.

360
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,026
Not here, not now.

361
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:13,826
Who knows? Maybe in time,
things will become much different.

362
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:16,226
Until then, I'm sorry.

363
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:19,126
What would you think of a man
who exposed corruption?

364
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:22,126
Brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

365
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:25,826
I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.

366
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:29,226
But couldn't you sell him to the voters?

367
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,326
Absolutely.

368
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:38,426
- We got a call about a kidnapping.
- They took my boy, Thurman.

369
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,126
When did you find out
he was kidnapped?

370
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,326
Today.

371
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:46,626
I got a ransom call asking
for $10,000. I don't have it!

372
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:49,826
- When did you last see Thurman?
- Three weeks.

373
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:53,426
- How long has he been missing?
- Since last night.

374
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:55,326
- The last time you spoke?
- A month ago.

375
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:58,626
Then how do you know he's only
been missing since last night?

376
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:01,726
Cemetery called.
Somebody dug up his body.

377
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,726
- Thurman's dead?
- Going on three weeks.

378
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:11,526
- Code four, cancel that backup, please.
- Roger that. Ten- four.

379
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:16,526
Ma'am, if the kidnapper calls back,
call us.

380
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:18,926
You're not gonna help me?

381
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:22,326
To be honest,
they'll push it to the bottom.

382
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:26,526
Detectives, they have more important
things to do.

383
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:30,926
But it's a crime, isn't it? Digging up
my son, holding it for ransom?

384
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:36,726
- Yes, ma'am.
- So you two will help me, then, right?

385
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:41,926
Julien, you stay with her. I'll ride solo.

386
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:44,126
- Ma'am.
- Good.

387
00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:51,726
Hey.

388
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,026
- I got a little problem.
- What's that?

389
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,126
The guy you ID'd today,
he's a C.I. Of mine.

390
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,426
- Really?
- Yeah.

391
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:01,626
He's the guy who gave me
the shooters.

392
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:05,126
He was firing in self-defence.
None of his shots killed anybody.

393
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:10,826
I was hoping maybe your memory
could get a little fuzzy on this one.

394
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,426
I don't know, Vic.
Aceveda's all over this one.

395
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:16,426
But if it ever goes to trial?

396
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:19,926
I don't know.

397
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,026
Let me think about it.

398
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,326
That's all I ask.

399
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:40,526
- That's Thurman right there.
- I went to high school with him.

400
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:44,526
- Did you know him?
- He and his friends used to beat me up.

401
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:47,226
It's okay.
He made me a better student.

402
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:51,626
I hid out in the library until I grew
9 inches my junior year.

403
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:55,026
He was killed robbing a liquor store.

404
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,926
Thurman?

405
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:03,626
He was a thief. He did drugs.
I was afraid to tell you.

406
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,726
I would've helped you anyway.

407
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:10,026
I mean, maybe he didn't find
his path here on earth...

408
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,826
...but he's with Jesus now.
- You believe that?

409
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:15,826
I know that.

410
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:25,026
- Hello?
- You got the money ready?

411
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,226
Yes. Where's my son's body?

412
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,426
- Bring the money to the cemetery at 10.
- What?

413
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:33,526
Bring the money to the cemetery
at 10:00 sharp.

414
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:36,526
- I can't understand you.
- Bring the money to the cemetery...

415
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,726
... at 10:00 sharp or Thurman's body
will be chopped to pieces...

416
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:44,126
...and you'll never see him again.
- Henry! Is that you?

417
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:45,826
Face front.

418
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:52,526
- Did you hate her that much?
- No.

419
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,726
She's all right.

420
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:59,326
We dated for a while, you know?

421
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:02,126
- Then why did you do it?
- Why did I do it?

422
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,826
Why did I do it?

423
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:09,126
Knew she had
life insurance on her boy.

424
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:12,326
I wanted to take my new lady
on one of them cruises.

425
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,826
Dottie spent all the insurance money
on Thurman's funeral.

426
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,426
Can you make it Thursday?

427
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,626
How many problems
can a 5-year-old have?

428
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:28,926
Enough that he's got an appointment
with a developmental paediatrician.

429
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:33,526
- Matthew thinks he's a dog now.
- A German shepherd. So what?

430
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,826
You're not here.
You don't see everything.

431
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,026
See what?

432
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:40,126
The problems.
Why do you have to fight me on this?

433
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:41,526
I'm not.

434
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,826
Okay, I'll try.
I'll try, okay?

435
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:50,926
I'm really losing it.

436
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:55,126
Why don't you go take a bath.
I'll put the kids to bed.

437
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:58,826
Okay.

438
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:07,126
Good night. Thanks.

439
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,426
- Get down.
- Hey. I'm a cop.

440
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,826
Get down. Don't scream.

441
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:14,826
I said, I'm a cop!

442
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:18,426
And I'm a cop killer.
But not tonight.

443
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:21,026
Tonight's to show you
how we're gonna do it.

444
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:22,226
What do you want?

445
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:26,126
Forget what you saw at the Chez Club.
Understand?

446
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:30,126
Yeah. I understand.

447
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,426
Come on.

448
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,426
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You piece of shit!

449
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:48,926
- Something wrong, officer?
- You think you can get to me?

450
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:52,426
Girl, you better take some kind of pill.
Damn.

451
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,126
You listen to me. I'm a cop.
You don't scare me.

452
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:58,026
I don't know what you're talking about.

453
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,726
You do look scared, though.

454
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:10,326
Hey.

455
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:14,026
- I'll catch you outside, okay?
- Meet you out there.

456
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,026
What was all that between you
and my C.I.?

457
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:29,026
Did you tell him I was the one
that ID'd him?

458
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:31,726
Of course not.
What the hell is going on?

459
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,726
He sent guys after me.
They put a gun to my head...

460
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:38,226
...and told me to forget what I saw
at the Chez Club.

461
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,526
- You should take the day off.
- No, maybe I should go after them.

462
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:46,326
- Let me take care of this.
- Know what, I can take care of myself.

463
00:28:56,973 --> 00:29:01,473
- You went after a cop?
- Vic, I just scared her, man.

464
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,173
Cops are off-limits.

465
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:11,573
- Shooting at somebody shooting at me.
- I was taking care of it.

466
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:15,873
I didn't know.
I had to do something, man.

467
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:19,473
Take your drug money
and bail yourself out.

468
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:20,973
And then what?

469
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:24,973
In the year and a half it'll take
to go to trial, I'll make it go away.

470
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,173
Look, I can't take no chances, Vic.

471
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:30,373
The biggest chance you could've taken
was to piss me off.

472
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:33,173
And that's exactly what you did.

473
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:44,873
- You see him?
- No.

474
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:48,673
But I got you a Spanish-English
phrase book. My gift to you.

475
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:53,573
Third day in a row you're checking
the Real Estate section.

476
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:55,673
- What's the deal?
- None your.

477
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,473
What's that, Spanish?

478
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,273
English for "none of your business."

479
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:04,873
- We're partners. Share.
- Wanna share? Here's the Sports page.

480
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:08,273
I'll find out. I'm a detective.

481
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,973
There he is.

482
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:12,473
Bingo, gringo.

483
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:18,973
Eduardo Salcido?

484
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:40,273
You and Manuel hopped on the same
truck. You went to work together?

485
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:46,173
- Did you kill him after work ended?
- No.

486
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:49,473
- So you killed him on the way to work?
- No.

487
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:54,173
Where is he? How come his wife
hasn't heard from him?

488
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:56,973
Spare me the Yo no sés. We know.

489
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:00,073
- Know?
- About the grudge.

490
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:03,173
You hated Manuel.
You told people you wanted to kill him.

491
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,273
He my friend.

492
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:09,873
- Used to be. Till the trip.
- What happened on that truck?

493
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:11,573
What truck?

494
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:15,173
The one that snuck you and Manuel
across the border.

495
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,573
- What made you wanna kill him?
- Nothing.

496
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,573
- You fight? He steal? What?
- Nothing.

497
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,873
He did something.

498
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:24,573
- Nothing happened.
- Was it personal? Did he hurt you?

499
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:27,573
I'm not the one who killed Manuel.

500
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:30,673
So Manuel is dead.

501
00:31:34,473 --> 00:31:37,673
Stay here, Eduardo.

502
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,673
- You ask me, he was raped.
- What?

503
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:53,573
I know I sound like Dutch
with one of his theories.

504
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:56,573
But my first few years on the job...

505
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,373
...I practically lived in hospitals,
taking statements from rape victims.

506
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:03,073
- He's got that look.
- The look?

507
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:05,173
Nervousness, isolation.

508
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,173
But it's mostly in the eyes.

509
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:11,873
Raped in a truck sneaking
into the country? How is that possible?

510
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:14,773
It's possible.

511
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:17,373
What do you mean,
sounds like one of my theories?

512
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,873
What's with the getups?

513
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:27,373
Avoiding cameras.

514
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,773
- So, what's the problem?
- This is the goddamn problem.

515
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:36,573
- He poisoned my baby.
- Threw some meat over the fence...

516
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,773
...next thing, he's choking to death.

517
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,673
- T-Bonz?
- Of course, it's T-Bonz.

518
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:43,873
- He's got to pay.
- She supposed to be in the studio...

519
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:48,073
...finishing her album right now.
- How can I work after this? Look.

520
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:51,673
It's game-over time for T-Bonz.
Be a man.

521
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:53,573
I know.

522
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,773
You know how much
this setback is costing me?

523
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,973
- Get that off my table.
- The goddamn bastard has to pay.

524
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:01,773
- That's T-Bonz breaking his truce.
- You gonna be a man...

525
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:04,473
...or do I have to find someone
to do the job?

526
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:05,873
Look.

527
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:10,073
I told you, this is why we here.
I know what I got to do, all right?

528
00:33:10,273 --> 00:33:12,373
All right?

529
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,773
- I just need you to help me do it.
- Do what?

530
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,073
Do the deed.

531
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:23,473
T-Bonz. I know where he's holed up at.
But I can't get to him.

532
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:28,273
- A man with a badge could, though.
- Why would I do something like that?

533
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,773
Money. I'll make that rent Rondell
paying you look like chump change.

534
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:37,173
Pay you double if I get to watch.

535
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:46,473
You want this war to end, right?

536
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:53,473
Then help me end it,
or more blood is gonna get spilled.

537
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:57,273
Give me the address.

538
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,373
- Was Manuel the one who raped you?
- No rape.

539
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,373
- He hold you down?
- It not happen.

540
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,273
- Catch you sleeping, you wake up...
- No.

541
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:08,773
Somebody did that to me,
I'd smash their head in.

542
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,673
I'd stab them, shoot them,
push him off a roof.

543
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:16,673
- He raped you in that truck, didn't he?
- We'd understand if you killed him.

544
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:25,273
I murder Manuel.

545
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,473
You killed Manuel?

546
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,973
I murder Manuel.

547
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,173
Good.

548
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,173
Where?

549
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:38,573
Working con el Señor Jamison.

550
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:41,973
- We were on the roof and he fall.
- You pushed him?

551
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:45,273
No. He...

552
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:47,873
We were carrying...

553
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,273
Air conditioning unit.

554
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:57,373
Look out, Manuel,
but he didn't hear him.

555
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,273
He slipped and he fell.

556
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,973
- He slipped and he fell.
- I murder him.

557
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:05,573
That's not murder, Eduardo.

558
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:08,173
That's not what Mr. Jamison say.

559
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,973
What else did Señor Jamison say?

560
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,773
This is private property!

561
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,773
This is private property.

562
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:29,673
- It was an accident.
- A man was accidentally buried here?

563
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,273
I asked about Manuel's wife...

564
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:38,073
...his family, and no one seemed
to know.

565
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:42,773
- He had no papers, he was illegal.
- Burying a man on your site is illegal.

566
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:46,273
- I wanted to alert the authorities.
- Too much of a hassle?

567
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:50,473
It would have shut down business
for weeks, put these guys out of work.

568
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,273
- What would they have done then?
- Please.

569
00:35:53,473 --> 00:35:57,073
You told Eduardo
he was guilty of murder.

570
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:01,773
This is what you call
planting rice and beans.

571
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,873
Told you not to talk, asshole!

572
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:11,673
You have the right to remain silent.

573
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:14,673
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

574
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,673
You have the right to have...

575
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:19,273
This ain't no police station.
What's going on?

576
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:22,973
Man, please, dog. Whatever you
thinking about doing, don't do it.

577
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:26,373
T, what happened to that trash talker
I fell in love with?

578
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,673
Come on, man, I'm begging you.
Come on, man.

579
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,473
Come on, you dog killer, let's go.

580
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:34,073
- Come on, man.
- You broke the truce. Time to pay.

581
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:37,473
I'll give you money, dude.
I'll hook you up, Mackey. I got money.

582
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:41,073
I just need one phone call.
I'll give you whatever you need.

583
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:44,673
- Let's end this, dude. It's over.
- Why you crying, T-Bonz?

584
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:47,773
- What's he doing here?
- I paid for front row seats.

585
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,373
Mackey, man, please, dog.

586
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,473
Please.

587
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,173
- Come on, Mackey, man.
- Get in.

588
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,073
- You too, Kern.
- What?

589
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:03,373
- The two of you guys are shacking up.
- Are you crazy?

590
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,673
- He's definitely crazy.
- You two are so keen...

591
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:08,973
...on killing each other, fine.
I'm cutting out the middle man.

592
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:11,773
- We had a deal, Vic.
- Hey, I'm never for sale.

593
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,573
Now you know.

594
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,373
- I can respect that, but I'm saying...
- Shut up! Get inside!

595
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,473
You two can't make peace,
I'll see one of you in the morning.

596
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:23,473
- This how you gonna do it, man?
- Close it.

597
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:33,873
- I should've thought of this yesterday.
- Yeah.

598
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,489
- Hey, why you got to be such a bitch?
- Because of pricks like you, Freddie.

599
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:48,189
- I got rights, you goddamn dyke.
- Hey. Save it for your new roommate.

600
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:52,089
- Yeah, I got a VIN number for you.
- Rondell Robinson just made bail.

601
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:55,989
- Yeah? Well, that's his right.
- Hundred grand in cash.

602
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:59,189
- Wow.
- Lot of money for a kid from the ghetto.

603
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:03,089
Maybe he's got a rich uncle.

604
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:07,789
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

605
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,689
- You just been a little jacked-up today.
- Well, I'm fine.

606
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,089
If you don't wanna talk about it,
that's cool.

607
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:17,789
But I'm gonna say a prayer
for you tonight, though.

608
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:21,989
Thanks.

609
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:26,089
Heard you made bail.

610
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:29,589
Hey. Your peaches are about
to go bad in there.

611
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:33,989
Where's my stuff?
Where's my TV, man?

612
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,889
Donated to the Lynwild Boys' Club.

613
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:41,189
You should've seen the looks on these
kids' faces. Man, it was like Christmas.

614
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:44,789
My goddamn records, man?!

615
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:50,789
You went after a cop, Rondell.

616
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:57,289
You should thank me, dude. I talked
him out of doing a hell of a lot worse.

617
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,589
The district attorney is content
that Manuel's death was accidental.

618
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:08,489
I see.

619
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,089
This Mr. Jamison,
what is his punishment?

620
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:15,289
He'll plead guilty to tampering with
evidence, be fined and released.

621
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:18,889
Señora Ruiz, I am truly sorry
about your husband.

622
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:26,489
This man, Jamison, worked for
a large company, no?

623
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,489
Yes.

624
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:31,889
Then I can sue them for much money?

625
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:39,289
Thanks again, David.

626
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,589
I'm glad I could help.

627
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:44,789
I have given some thought
to your proposal.

628
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:47,589
- And?
- I'm intrigued.

629
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:52,389
I have a few months before I decide
who I'm going to back.

630
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:55,289
Show me what you can do.

631
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:02,489
- They no think I murder Manuel?
- No.

632
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:05,089
Muchas gracias, Detective Dutch.

633
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:08,189
Tell me something. You hated Manuel.

634
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:12,389
You made threats against his life. Why
go on the same job with him that day?

635
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:16,189
When the truck come,
they pick Manuel, they pick me.

636
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:18,989
I have to work.

637
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:21,789
So, what's next, Eduardo?

638
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,689
I don't know.

639
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:31,289
The reason I ask is, I've got
this retaining wall that's crumbling...

640
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:39,889
Looking for me?

641
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:42,089
Heard you were
kicking some ass today.

642
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:46,089
No more than usual.

643
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,589
Do you trust me?

644
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:55,089
- What?
- With your life. Do you trust me?

645
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,489
Yeah.

646
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:02,589
Well, then you believe me
when I tell you...

647
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:05,389
...you don't have to look over your
shoulder no more.

648
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:07,889
I took care of it.

649
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:10,989
- You took care of it?
- You got no more problems.

650
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,789
Christ. I don't know what...

651
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,689
Hello?

652
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,189
What?

653
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,589
Where?

654
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,189
All right, I'll be right there.
I gotta run.

655
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:48,689
Doctor Shapiro to Cardiology.

656
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:52,989
Nurse. Hi. I'm look...
I got it.

657
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:55,289
Okay. Where's Megan?

658
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,589
She's getting x-rays.
Mom's with her.

659
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:58,789
He didn't mean it.

660
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:02,989
A 5-year-old does not bite his
18-month-old sister on the face...

661
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,089
...and make her fall on her head.

662
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,389
All right, go be with Megan.

663
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:17,189
Hey.

664
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:22,789
It's gonna be okay.

665
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,189
Your sister's gonna be all right.

666
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:42,089
I don't hear nothing.

667
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:44,789
Assholes like these don't
wake up before noon.

668
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:54,489
T-Bonz!

669
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:57,689
Nobody else coming out of there.

670
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:01,889
Told you he was a bitch.

671
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:06,489
I'll have my cleanup crew
come clean that mess, man.

672
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,189
Oh, shit.

673
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,189
- Give me that.
- Fine.

674
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:22,089
I'll take care of this.

675
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:41,289
You hungry?

676
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:44,689
Goddamn starved.

677
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:31,289
