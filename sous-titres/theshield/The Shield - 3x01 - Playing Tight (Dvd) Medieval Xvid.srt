1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,564
Open up!

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,037
She saw you, asshole! Peeping Tom!

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,473
- Put down the bat
- That prick saw my mom naked!

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,704
- Peeping into our bedroom window
- He saw me!

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:16,270
- Drop the goddamn bats!
- What about him?
- Hands behind your head

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:20,285
- There he is!
- I want them both locked up

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,947
You werejerkin'off in the window.

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,149
How am I gonna get off
on those big, saggy tits?

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,557
She shouldn't leave
her blinds up, huh?

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,497
- Lock 'em up.
- Shut him down
- Step inside, sir

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,569
- Close the door, sir. Hands behind your head.
- There's nothing to look at.

12
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,298
Julien!
Am I working alone here?

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,205

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,480

15
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,624
Dinky's having a slow morning.

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,684
We're killing our morning
babysitting a third-string dime-bagger

17
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,096
- Can't get much lower than this
- Every bust's a good bust

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,169
And one step closer to
cashing in on a small fortune.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,398
Playing by the rules keeps IA from
sniffing around our retirement fund

20
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,599
Fills the chiefs arrest quotas,
keeps our noses clean.

21
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,608
Yeah, in your case brown

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,178
- Shut up
- What's up, man?

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,078
Plus I get you two assholes
to keep me entertained

24
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,674
- I got you, man

25
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,088
- Packing already?
-Just tidying up

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,983
You and Claudette
wanna take a run at this?

27
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,994
I'm already working
two open cases

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,361
- I'm sorry we're so shorthanded
- I had some budget ideas about that

29
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,866
If you could give me early access
to those personnel files

30
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,868
You're still on detective duty
for a few more days

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,303
So why don't you
stick to that for now

32
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,274
Better get down there It's a double
homicide with special circumstances

33
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,641
What special circumstances?

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,042
Someone forgot their fins

35
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,049
Armenian immigrants,
both had multiple arrests

36
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,282
And both did prison time

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,517
Postmortem cuts

38
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,958
One foot's a trophy.
Four's just plain weird.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,729
They were dumped here
Killing zone's somewhere else

40
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,461
Given any thought to who you're
gonna bring on as my new partner?

41
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,560
Like the captain said,
I'm still a detective

42
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,299
Three more days

43
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,376
I hear there's a Detective Ruiz
in Hollywood that's good

44
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,573
Gabrielle Ruiz.
Uh, Gabrielle's quite a looker.

45
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,615
Is she?

46
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,280
- No?

47
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,293
Oh Wait, ah, ah

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:48,123
Okay, run this. ''4UOP2 1 1. ''

49
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,134
Hey, Ronnie, Tavon,
you seeing this?

50
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,704
Yeah, we got 'em. Looks likejuveniles.

51
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,672
- R Mark Lindman, MD
- Oh

52
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:00,542
- I hope the doctor's kids
know some lawyer friends

53
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,773
Bust it out!

54
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,115
-Shit
-Hey, you Give me your keys Right here

55
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,121
Hey, don't do it!

56
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,681
Don't you-- No!
Goddamn it!

57
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,626
- Stay right here!
- Son of a bitch!

58
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,495
Get the kid!

59
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,035
All right,
get your hands on the wheel

60
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,905
- You're gonna lose him.
- Go, get out of the way. Goddamn it!

61
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,470
6-Paul-1 1 in pursuit
of a mid-'80s Monte Carlo

62
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,072
headed south on Water
towards Palm Heights

63
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,311
- We're losing him

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,820
Chopper's got him
He's not going anywhere

65
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,517
Besides, we're staying out of trouble.
Let some other unit wreck their car.

66
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,958
6-Paul-11,
your suspectjust ran a stop sign...

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,522
is now traveling southbound at high
rate of speed along Cesar Chavez.

68
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,897
Gray Monte Carlo is turning
onto Chicago Street.

69
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,462
Uh-oh, look out. Oh! We got
a C.A. involving multiple vehicles.

70
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,542
This is Air-9 requesting R.A.
for the intersection of Cesar Chavez--

71
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,135

72
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,675
Stop!
Lem, handle this!

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,225
You all right?
Are you all right?

74
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,102

75
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,370
Cut him off

76
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,079
Stay down

77
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,223

78
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,924

79
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,929
I got him

80
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,799

81
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,439
Gracias.

82
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,033

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,283
Yo, I need a knife
His seat belt's jammed

84
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,318
- Shit!

85
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,248

86
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,018
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know The van?

87
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,655
- Lem, get out of there!
- I almost got him

88
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,732

89
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,393
- Lem!

90
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,697
There's no one inside!

91
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,747
Ripped by:

92
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,619
Hound

94
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,400

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,028
Sir, take it easy

96
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,402
He's got a few burns, mild shock.

97
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,407
Well, he's in for a bigger one

98
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,206
- What the hell happened here?
- The car we were chasing caused a smash-up

99
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,715
The van swerved to avoid it,
caught fire

100
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,911
- The back was full of ammo
- A hell of a fireworks show

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,511
And your chase
caused this accident?

102
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:35,083
Felony pursuit Under control
We followed regulations to a ''T''

103
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,094
Well, give me
that report right away

104
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,893
- I want all my ducks in a row for downtown
- Quack, quack

105
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,062
Hey, Dutch-boy
I got a case for you

106
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,401
Actually, I'm working
a double homicide

107
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:51,807
Yeah, well, I need a detective to hand this off to
so I can get back to dealer duty

108
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,345
Rodriguez might be back in tonight
How important is it?

109
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,883
I don't know yet
All right, thanks anyway

110
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,818
Hey, uh, you know of any
internal Armenian mob beefs?

111
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,618
- Not offhand
- How about ''off-foot''?

112
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,716
Found these two guys
this morning

113
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,523
Harbor found two more
last week, same shape

114
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,467
Don't know them Looks like
old-country retribution though

115
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,231
Don't know them Looks like
old-country retribution though

116
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,796
Somebody sure pissed off
the bosses back in, uh--

117
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,399
- Yerevan
- Right

118
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,570
Let me show these to my guys,
see if they recognize the stumps

119
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,841
Great Thanks

120
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,918
They killed these Armenians
looking for our money train cash

121
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,249
Which means they still
think it was an inside job

122
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,982
What happens when they run out of feet
and realize it was an outside job?

123
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,183
There's only four people
who know we took that money.

124
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,659
And they're all sitting right here
We stick to the plan

125
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,356
Low profile,
business as usual

126
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:57,571
- You pull that driver's sheet?
- Ain't got one He's an out-of-work cement mixer

127
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,179
A van full of ammo,Jesse?

128
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,715
It is not against the law
to have bullets

129
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,251
Well, it is if you drive them
across state lines

130
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,050
You wanna tell me why you took
a Greyhound to Yuma, Arizona

131
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,251
picked up a van, filled it with a half
a ton of nine-millimeter shells...

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,524
- and drove it all the way back here to L.A.?
- Told not against the law

133
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,761
Who told you that?
Your son, Diagur?

134
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,861
See, he's a player
with the Byz Lats

135
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,497
Is that who you're
running ammo for?

136
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,043
He float his out-of-work pop
a day job?

137
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,112
Diagur is not in this

138
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,343
- There's no sign of a struggle
in either victim's apartment

139
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,249
But both their cars
were parked in their spots

140
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,686
It suggests they went along
willingly with whoever killed them

141
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,689
Someone they were
comfortable with

142
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,316
Other Armenian mobsters
Anything more specific?

143
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,396
You remember Margos Dezirian,
theJesus look-alike?

144
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,727
The Armenian drug guy who
killed a man in our cage?

145
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,597
- Then escaped the paddy wagon
- You think he's involved?

146
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,569
It would explain the severed feet
Margos is a big foot-fetish guy

147
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,735
How do you know that?

148
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,903
When he was in custody, the only words
he said were ''delicious feet'' to Danny

149
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,814
I gave her a call She said he was constantly
staring at her feet like he was obsessed

150
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,249
Well, it's not the only
lead we're chasing

151
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,484
If I'm right, Dezirian's back in town
I want to bring in the feds

152
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,756
- Based on a possible foot fetish?
- If Dezirian's here, everybody wants him.

153
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,990
Us, Washington, Interpol.

154
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,926
Fine

155
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,766
Hey, uh, when I was
talking to Danny...

156
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,808
she mentioned her final appeal
with the police commission is tomorrow

157
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,936
A good word from her boss, future
city councilman, might go a long way

158
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,174
I'm aware of the situation

159
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,824
- You almost all packed up?
- What can I do for you?

160
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,793
- One last favor before you ride out of Dodge.
- What's that?

161
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,024
Well, it looks like one of the Latin
gangs is arming up for Armageddon...

162
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,501
- and I can't find a free detective to look into it
- We're understaffed

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,869
I got a van-load of ammo
driven by a Byz Lat dad

164
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,307
- Where there's bullets, there's guns
- Did the driver confess to guns?

165
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,436
- No It's gonna take some
legwork to prove I'm right
- And in the meantime

166
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,947
I've got actual murders, actual
armed robberies that take priority

167
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,882
You're not interested in preventing
murders before they happen?

168
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,783
- Why don't you look into it yourself?.
- Fine.

169
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,516
Talk to the chief Get him to back off
this arrest quota I can't do both

170
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,526
And I can't get in the middle of
whatever arrangement the chief has

171
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,392
- Can't?
- Won't

172
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,466
What, more important things to worry
about now than a few guns on the street?

173
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,195
I'll assign a detective
when one frees up

174
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,204
Hey, did you finish up the paperwork
on this morning's car accident?

175
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,274
Yeah

176
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,477
- Lem, you finish that accident report?

- You buying a car?
- Yes. Yes, we are.

184
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,108

185
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,371
- to show homes

Bye-bye

Go with Lem and Ronnie,

195
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,542
- I hear you.
- Let's go.

196
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,771
Come on, lover You and me
are ditching school today

197
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,914
Interpol's dossier
on Margos Dezirian.

198
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,815
He's suspected ofkilling
three coca farmers in Chile.

199
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,380
- All found with their feet chopped off
- Let me see.

200
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:10,292
I need to run his known aliases against
international flight manifests for the past month

201
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,126
- He's in town.
- Detectives, you have visitors

202
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,797
The two men
you find dead this morning.

203
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,271
I know who did it

204
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,537
I see him waiting
at my home to kill me next

205
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,944
My mother, my sister,
her children

206
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,780
If you protect us,
I tell everything

207
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,898
I know you, yes?

208
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,058
I don't think so

209
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,329
Yes, you and your friend

210
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,337
Cletus.

211
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,634
The accident that day.

212
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,743
The guy paid up
I never had to call

213
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,144
- All right, yeah That's good
- Cletus?

214
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,015
- I did not know you worked for the police
- Yeah, I was off duty

215
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,088
I'm on duty now
I gotta get back to work

216
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,255
You've known this girl for two months.
You buying her a new car?

217
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,828
It's pre-owned I'm just
covering the down payment

218
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,397
She'll take over the monthly
when she makes her first sale

219
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,331
What happened to keeping
a low profile, business as usual?

220
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,459
I'm using my own money
I'm putting it on my Visa

221
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,970
Yeah, but it looks like you're
buying your girlfriend a new Lexus

222
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:31,099
It's pre-owned And being up to my eyeballs
in debt is business as usual for me

223
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,110
Nice try

224
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,772
No sale, you got it?

225
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,610
- Vic
- What?

226
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,150
Dutch is interviewing the guy
that saw us the day of the money train

227
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,085
- What guy?
- Armin, the advance man.

228
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,817
- So what's he doing here?
- I don't know, but he recognized me

229
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,827
- And he remembered your name, Cletus
- Cletus Van Damme?

230
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,888
You gave this guy the same alias you used to
rent the storage unit where we hid the money?

231
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,899
Well, it makes Lem laugh

232
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,266
Hey, Lem. You gonna ride
with the A-Team today or what?

233
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,498
You were following this guy
the day we stole the money

234
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,404
Ifhe starts stringin'
together the facts--

235
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,568
Yeah, if Dutch does
He heard the guy

236
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,307
That's it
We move the money tonight

237
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,383
New location
New name

238
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,819
That is not the man doing the killing.

239
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,154
Are you sure?
His name's Margos Dezirian.

240
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,160
That is Margos?

241
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,390
Yeah, I've heard
of the name, but

242
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,126
it is Lyor Slavok you want

243
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,865
- Lyor Slavok?
- He is a soldier

244
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,602
Who gives him orders--
Margos, someone else--

245
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,610
I do not know

246
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,646
It's all because of
this damn money train

247
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,855
I heard a rumor a while ago about
a money train Somebody ripped it off?

248
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,519
Yeah, and the Armenians are gonna keep
dropping bodies until they find out who

249
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,530
Shit

250
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,793
Our latest quarterly
crime statistics...

251
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,359
jumped up double digits
in all areas

252
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,998
Well, the best thing
you can do for us in city council...

253
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,338
is to find the money
to fully staff this place again

254
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,241
I don't take office
for another six months

255
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,338
I'm worried about right now

256
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,249
You said you had a few ideas
about adding personnel?

257
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,847
Oh, the undercover Decoy Squad,
uh, working Wilshire?

258
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,519
- Yeah?
- Their original mandate was to
rotate among all districts.

259
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,927
Well, Captain Griggs has used his
Miracle Mile clout to hold onto them

260
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,627
Well, that's why their numbers
at Wilshire look a lot rosier than ours.

261
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,364
- The unit's had great success
- Well, Griggs will never give them up.

262
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,543
I was thinking of appealing
higher up the ladder.

263
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,942
To the chief?

264
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,244
You don't have anything to offer him
It will make you look naive

265
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,787
What other ideas do you have?

266
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:06,025
Hey, strike a pose, boys

267
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,031
You-- get out of here, man

268
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,033
Get out of here

269
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,697
I'm gonna go out
on a limb-- Diagur.

270
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,935
What, are you psychic?

271
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:22,207
Yeah I predicted your old man
would crash a van-load of live ammo

272
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,647
He's fine.
It's you he's worried about.

273
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,845
- Me too
- Vic.

274
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,654
Those nine-millimeter shells
aren't for these little cap guns

275
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,458
You guys expecting
a new shipment of hardware?

276
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,465
Who's running
this boys' club now?

277
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,660
Yeah,
we missed the last election

278
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,227
You guys looking to shoot your way
back into business and territory?

279
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,637
Well, you know,
we do what we gotta do

280
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,869
Really?

281
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,242
I find out you're arming yourselves
with anything more serious than this

282
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,248
I will turn the Byz Lats
into my personal piñata

283
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,081
Which means we shove candy
up your ass and beat you with a bat.

284
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,716
You pass it up the daisy chain

285
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,697
Vic Mackey, my nigga

286
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,131
Ain't seen you boys
around here in a while

287
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah, we've been enjoying the sun
New stuff?

288
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,034
Religious erotica

289
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,371
Where in the Bible does St Schlong
visit Our Lady of the D-cup?

290
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,809
Hey, man. I'm giving the believers
what they want right there.

291
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,076
So what's the news? You find out if
anyone's selling guns to the Byz Lats?

292
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,414
Nope. But I found out
who's buying.

293
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,115
- Yeah? Who?
- You know the cat

294
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,123
- Lovely.

295
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,685
Let me see you,
uh, spin around.

296
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,163
- Nice

297
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,064
- Hey
- Oh, drama.

298
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,797
Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies
Could y'all bounce for a minute?

299
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,840
Everybody, come on

300
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,780
Sweet setup.
I thought you were broke, Kern.

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Slap, easy, man Easy, easy, baby

302
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,086
This is my boy, Slap.
He got my back.

303
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,748
Whatever makes Slap happy

304
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,382
So who's financing
this hot spot?

305
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,621
- You know, found some investors
- Really?

306
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,890
- One-niners buy a share?
- Let's just say...

307
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,762
- sometimes you can go home again
- Come on, Kern

308
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,599
What's a gangsta rapper
like you investing in heavy metal for?

309
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,141
- We know you're making a gun buy for your boys
- Well, you know wrong

310
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,472
Really?

311
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,546
You know what?

312
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,774
I'll bet we could make half our narc quota
by emptying the pockets in this room

313
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,783
-Let's go Everybody, hands on your head
-All right.

314
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,787
Calm down, Hee-Haw. All right, man.

315
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,518
Yeah, I'm buyin', okay? But not
because I want to, 'cause I got to

316
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,925
The Byz Lats armin' themselves
to the mother tit with MP5's

317
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,657
-Jesus Christ Fully auto SMG's?
- Three dozen.

318
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,165
My boys just looking for
a balance of power

319
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,361
- The Byz Lats already have 'em?
- I don't know.

320
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,530
Same guy that's sellin' to me
is sellin' to them too

321
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,269
- Who's runnin' this arms race?
- He's regular army

322
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,778
- When's your buy?
- What about the Byz Lats?

323
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,978
They got it in their greasy little heads
that south of Vermont belong to them

324
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,520
- I'll disarm the Mexicans

325
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,683
And I'm supposed
to believe that?

326
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,522
You forget last time we did business?
How you just shit all over me?

327
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,087
That was a one-time war crime,
and I apologized

328
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,099
Now what time's the buy
and where?

329
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,163
You make me find out on my own,
you'll be facing a charge too.

330
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,810
- Detective Holland Wagenbach?
- Yeah?

331
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,883
Agent Quigley, US Treasury

332
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,942
- I asked for FBI
- You got me

333
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,921
I understand you have an Armenian
wiseguy who wants to come clean

334
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,222
- Already has
- Who's the boss around here?

335
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:01,163
We've been concerned with
the Armenian mob's propensity
for shipping US currency overseas

336
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,791
About four months ago,
my office instituted a sting operation

337
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,961
What kind of sting operation?

338
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,199
In San Jose, the Armenians were
extorting a local businessman

339
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:14,245
He allowed us to insert $50,000 of marked,
traceable bills into his payment to the Armenians

340
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,940
so we could track the loot and see
what banks were washing the money.

341
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,610
- And?
- Not a single bill has popped up in three months

342
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:25,679
It's mystified us. But then today I was notified
by my counterpart in the F.B.I....

343
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,487
that you were investigating
a possible robbery of the Armenian mob

344
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,154
And four related murders

345
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,499
We may have blown
our laundering case

346
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,500
but if any of these
marked bills show up

347
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,695
they might lead you
to your killers

348
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,312
- Someone inside?

349
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,314
Hey, I thought
I heard you guys in here

350
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,620
Oh, I'm Albert, Albert Kreeg
I'm the manager

351
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,219
Uh, looks like you guys
got everything in okay

352
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,959
- Yeah, we're all set, Al
- Ah, Albert Like the prince

353
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,400
- Yeah We're good, Al bert
- Okay

354
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,472
Okay, uh

355
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,201
Did you just
move out of a place?

356
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,302
- Yeah, I'm getting divorced
- Oh,yeah. I had a feeling.

357
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,372
Uh, oh. Which one of the two
of you is Mr. London?

358
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,113
- Oh, that's me.
- Oh, okay I got those spare keys you asked for

359
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,121
Thank you

360
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,857
All right then Night

361
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,261
- Night
- Night.

362
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,831
Get new padlocks I don't want Prince
Curious having a key to this place

363
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,402
- Yeah

364
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,846
- Yeah?
- Vic, we need you down here

365
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,559

366
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,441
Someone slapped Slappy.

367
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,342
Byz Lats got their guns

368
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,816
So much for passing this case off

369
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,438
- An hour late This guy ain't showin'
- Where is he?

370
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,306
I guess he got spooked

371
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,783
That's bullshit

372
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,650
Your homies are chillin' like it's happy
hour You thought I'd buy this pony show?

373
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,723
Look, man You best just
back up off me, all right?

374
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,814
You're pissed off
about losin' your boy Slap

375
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,722
How would you feel
if it was one of your boys?

376
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,886
That still doesn't give you
licence to bend me over

377
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,896
Look He didn't show, okay?

378
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,466
Ain't my fault he--

379
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,092
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Don't even think about it

380
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,501

00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,666

00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,873
I'm tellin' you the truth, man

Why don't you just
calm down, man?

390
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,296
He's lying

391
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,376
Why did you say you would help me if
you couldn't? This is so embarrassing

392
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,776
I'm sorry, all right I wanna help you I do
It's just that I've talked to some friends

393
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,849
and this is the kind of thing that
can add stress to a new relationship

394
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,010
- What friends? Vic?
- Come on It's not like that

395
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,089
- I worked my ass off to get this Realtor's licence
- Yeah, I know that

396
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,159
I need to make a living Would you
buy a half a million dollar home

397
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,387
- from somebody driving a '97 Neon?
- From you? Sure

398
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,396

399
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,434
Because your mother doesn't want you
bouncing off the walls all night That's why

400
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,006
- Mommy, can I have some ice cream
- Shh Come on

401
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,940
Go Put on your PJ's And come on,

00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,671

404
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,117

405
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,153
Daddy and me

406
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,051
That's great.

407
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,624

408
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,285
This is your favorite
part, right, Matt?

409
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,692
Here you go, princess
Go play with your sister

410
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,788
Okay, this is where
the song ends, right?

411
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,799
- Bye, song.

412
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,801
Wow

413
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,803
See you next time
Okay, champ?

414
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,841
Bye Bye, Daddy

415
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,842
I love you, Matt

416
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,742
He's got a great energy

417
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,680
Uh, that classical music
you were playing there

418
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,683
It's the Tomatis Method

419
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,447
Matt's learning to use his ears
as his primary source of hearing

420
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,546
so his other senses
don't get overwhelmed

421
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,490
- And he's responding really well
- Yeah

422
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,187
- Remember to do his drills with him
- I will

423
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,561
Mr Mackey,
it was nice to meet you

424
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,933
- I'll just let myself out
- Okay

425
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,707
So I'll see you next time.

426
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,244
I told you he was amazing

427
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,647
Matthew's actually talking

428
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,687
We could have Owen two more nights
a week He has another job offer

429
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,417
but he wants to work
with Matthew full time.

430
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,550
Ah, things are
kind of tight right now

431
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,222
- How much is it gonna cost?
- An extra 300 a week

432
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,960
Okay Look, I gotta
get back to the job

433
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,968
Book him I'll figure out
how I'm gonna cover it

434
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,062
Actually, you know what?
I only need for you to pay for half

435
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,300
I'm gonna take care of the rest.

436
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,071
I'm going back to work

437
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:23,705
There's a nursing shortage,
and the pay is good.

438
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,410
- Full time?
- Thirty hours a week

439
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,319
- to start.
- How's that gonna work with the kids?

440
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,721
I don't know, but, uh, we're
gonna have to figure it out

441
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,726
because it's something
I wanna do

442
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,359

443
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,198
Danny, hi.

444
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,430
Sir

445
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,439
I'm temping here
till my appeal

446
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,136
- And how's that looking?
- My lawyer says not to get my hopes up

447
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,974
I'm thinking of adding
a few more bodies to the Barn

448
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,143
I'd be filling the slots with people
who can get with my program

449
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,087
What program's that?

450
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,157
I need officers who I can trust

451
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,725
play tough but fair, keep me
aware of anyone who isn't

452
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,319
- You're looking for rats
- No.

453
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,830
No, I don't want what happened
to you to happen to anyone else

454
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:21,534
-Just tell the truth if any big lines get crossed
- You mean by Vic?

455
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,575
By anyone
You interested?

456
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,911
- You saying I can get my job back?

457
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:34,179
Think about it Give me your answer
when school gets out

458
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,728
What?

459
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,060
Word is you're a little
unsure of yourself out there

460
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,365
- Is that what my partner's saying?
- What do you say?

461
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,406
- I'm doing just fine
- Look,Julien

462
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm not the one
riding you here

463
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,337
But you got a little problem
with respect in this house

464
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,508
People are wondering what you're
doing about the beating you took

465
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,250
Look, detectives
haven't made much progress

466
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,291
They still can't
prove who did it

467
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,020
Everybody here knows who did it

468
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,688
And they're watching you

469
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,630
Where do we stand
with our Armenian triggerman?

470
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,068
Judge Molina's clerk says we should
have the warrant within an hour

471
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,197
- Good
- Somebody say ''warrant''?

472
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,434
Need me to knock any doors down?

473
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,913
Damn, I was gonna
ask her to the prom

474
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,809
This warrant
for that Armenian double hit?

475
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,789
Turns out the mob's pissed off about a shitload
of stolen money ticketed for the homeland

476
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,950
Now they're whackin'all
the players trying to find it.

477
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,927
- Armin was scared he was
gonna be the next stumpy
- Where's Armin now?

478
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,498
Feds took him.
Witness protection.

479
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,228
The good news is, finally got a break
on two unsolved murders

480
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,736
that have been screwing up
my perfect record

481
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,808
- How's that?
- When this robbery went down...

482
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,240
two mob soldiers got killed

483
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:10,508
Three, four guys in masks came roarin'
in, took the cash, left the bodies

484
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,606
Hey, man
What's up?

485
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,550
Armin told Dutch that the guys
who robbed the money train

486
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,553
killed those two
Armenians that night

487
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,284
- We didn't kill no one
- Why in the hell would he tell him that?

488
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,088
My guess is Armin knew those
two guys were stealing from him.

489
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,565
Armin's the one who called
the shooter down there that night

490
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,657
He's scared enough
to admit to money laundering

491
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,033
but not scared enough
to admit to his part in a 1 87

492
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,333
So if the robbery
leads back to us

493
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,433
we're on the hook
for a double murder.

494
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,274
- Jesus.
- Right

495
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,314
Here are the keys
to the new space

496
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,349
With this new heat,
we should wait

497
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,752
another six, nine months before giving
our cash over to the real estate guy.

498
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,825
- Nine months?
- We've already been sitting on this--

499
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,663
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt
your secret Klan meeting

500
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,201
- We left our hoods at the dry cleaners
- Come on, Tavon.

501
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,703
Why is it that every time I enter
the room, y'all stop talking?

502
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,673
Maybe it's because we're
captivated by your winning smile

503
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,905
- Or blinded by yours
- Hey,you two done pissing?

504
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,610
Sit down I'll tell you
what's going on

505
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,253
The Byz Lats just
opened fire on our turf

506
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,485
Aceveda doesn't have the manpower to
attack this and Kern's not playing nice.

507
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,426
So we gotta do it ourselves
and do it fast.

508
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,329
We're gonna tap Kern's phone,
find out when this gun buy's going down.

509
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,333
What, you gonna set a tap
without a warrant?

510
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,335
- No time.
- Not enough hard evidence.

511
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,962
You got a problem with that,
speak up now

512
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,710
Two weeks ago, 1 2 cases of MP5's
were stolen from Fort Irwin

513
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,654
And that's 7 2 guns on the streets
in the open market.

514
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,850
I already picked up one body

515
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
I don't want any more

516
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,090
Set up the tap on Kern

517
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,534
- Hey, look It's the Village People

518
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,511
Stand by, Vic We're tapping

519
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,514
I don't believe you.

520
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,949
Jamir said all the skanks you hired
are light-skinned with fine bodies.

521
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,646
Come on, baby.Jamir's half
white. What's he know about fine bodies?

522
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,383
I know you, Kern.
Don't play me with this innocent--

523
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,153
Sounds like Kern's not too big
to be a little whipped

524
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,230
Next thing you know,
he'll be buying her a new car

525
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,663
- Don't cut me off
- Let me know when the call comes in

526
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:47,204
- Where you going?
- Corrine asked me to pick up
Cassidy at school

527
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,934
- How long we staying here?
- Until the call comes in

528
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,670
The conversation
will probably be in code

529
00:31:56,047 --> 00:32:00,211
Shit I told Mara
I'd take her to lunch

530
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,345

531
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,790
Four different guns so far
We'll run them all through ballistics

532
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,523
Look what the Dutchman found

533
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,429
He mailed an international overnight
package to Greece this morning

534
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:20,402
- Look at the name of the recipient
- ''Marcus Dreliozis''?

535
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,997
Sound like a Greek alias of Margos Dezirian
to you? Check out the comments section

536
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,236
Contents contain dry ice

537
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,836
I think we found
our missing feet

538
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,247
I'm sorry

539
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,421
Yeah, I'll try

540
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,423
All right, me too
Yeah, I love you too

541
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,425
Okay, bye-bye

542
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,628
Oh, blow me

543
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,699

544
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,371
Dude, we're rich

545
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,933
- At least we're gonna be
- Yeah

546
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,276
-Just gotta ride things out
- Yeah

547
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,751
- Yo,yo. Let me talk to Kern.
- You got him.

548
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,822
It's Lex. Guns are ready.
Get all the cash yet?

549
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,823
Yeah, man.
I'm sittin'on it.

550
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,190
- Be there in half an hour.
- Right here.

551
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,128
I think I just broke the code

552
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,636
The gun boyjust went inside.

553
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,002
With six crates and four army pals.

554
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,405
- Four?
- Yeah

555
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:36,105
- We need backup
- Backup? Vic, we're here on an illegal wiretap

556
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:40,742
- 6-Paul-1 1 requesting additional units
- What are you doing?

557
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,151
- I'm getting these guns back
- Vic, we don't have a warrant

558
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:48,385
He's right, you know Maybe we should
just keep a low profile on this thing

559
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,121
Roger, 6-Paul-1 1. What's your location?

560
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,563
Hey, it's five-on-five

561
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,634
You guys wanna go bullet to bullet
with 3,000 SMG's?

562
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,436
I know what I'm doing
6-Paul-1 1

563
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,602
- We're at the corner of Fletcher and Riverside.
- Roger that.

564
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,547
My client denies
any involvement in these killings.

565
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,107
We've got an informant
in the organization that implicates him.

566
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,053

567
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,660

568
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,219
This informant may have heard some stories,
but he saw nothing with his own eyes.

569
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,837
What did he mail
to Athens this morning?

570
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,930

571
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,875
- Books

572
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,275
In dry ice?

573
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,746
This isn't even
his name on this

574
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,821
- He just said he sent it
- And the receipt was found in his place

575
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,382
The only question is why were you
stupid enough to keep the receipt?

576
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,462
- I'm not gonna ask him that.
- Okay.

577
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:03,023
Why is he whispering? We don't
understand what he's saying anyway

578
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:08,595
Margos Dezirian is gonna be at this
address in Greece tomorrow, isn't he?

579
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:14,271

580
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,784
We're having the package
rerouted to us

581
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,012
We'll see for ourselves

582
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,122

583
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,727
Four of them That way

584
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,965
Go in the back Take your cue
from those guys Don't get in the way

585
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,485
- Hands on your head!
- Hands on your head now!

586
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:01,285

587
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,088
- Get down!
- Get on the ground!
- Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit!

588
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,963
He ducked into a back room

589
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,034

590
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,468
- Kern, where's that lead to?
- Nowhere The window's barred

591
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,804
Hook these people up
Hook them up and get them out

592
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,746
- Turn that off
- Everybody grab a gun

593
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,409

594
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,421
Load 'em

595
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,459
You inside

596
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:41,191
It's your 800 rounds a minute
versus our 4,000

597
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,235
I'm gonna give you three seconds to toss
that weapon, or we're gonna open fire

598
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,565
One, two--

599
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,509
Come on out

600
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,409
These are the serial numbers
of the marked bills

601
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:00,314
If they get spent, make their way through the
banking system, they'll eventually get flagged.

602
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:04,252
- Maybe we can flag them earlier
- The money was stolen here,;
it'll probably be spent here.

603
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,155
We should do cursory checks
on all big money busts

604
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,228
- Any luck siccing the Greek
authorities on Margos?
- Not yet.

605
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,765
I talked to the American embassy in Athens
The Greek authorities aren't gonna move

606
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,800
unless they hear from somebody
higher up than an LA detective

607
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,565
- You have any connections in Washington?
- I've been to a few parties

608
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,936

609
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:37,280
Taking guns from our soldiers,
selling them to gangbangers?

610
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,856
You must be very proud, asshole

611
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,585
God bless America

612
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,662
- Come here Come here
- We got it, man

613
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,790
Hey, Vic

614
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:54,638
You tell me
Who bought the guns for the Byz Lats?

615
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:58,675
Yeah, like I'm just gonna admit
I sold guns to another crew?

616
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,014
Uncuff him

617
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,016
What are you doing?

618
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,682
Instant court-martial

619
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,493
A trained soldier
grabbed my spare gun

620
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,563
and tried to run for it

621
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:24,033
- Yo, guys.
- Evidence Around there

622
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,036
Now you either tell me
who bought the guns for the Byz Lats

623
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,197
or you and me are gonna
play some run and gun

624
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,266
- Yeah
- Then run

625
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:38,144
- You're out of your goddamn mind.
- Run

626
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,348
It's an OG named Garza

627
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,825
He's king of the Lats

628
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,918
That's a good
little soldier boy

629
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:55,430
You want Treasury's list of marked bills,
or you want me to hang onto it?

630
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,297
I'll keep it

631
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,769
I saw you talking to Vic
Has he been asking about this case?

632
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,069
I was asking him some questions, 'cause I know
he has experience with Armenian organized crime

633
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,644
Well, from here on,
keep him out of the loop

634
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,248
- Okay Why?
- Because that's the way I'd like it

635
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,649
Detective,
you've got a package.

636
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,430

637
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,503
- Size 1 0 1 /2

638
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:42,836
Hold on. Kern and his guys
were in on the sting. They set it up.

639
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,711
- That's why we didn't need a warrant
- That's right

640
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,716
Little always ready
to help his brothers in blue

641
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,878
Give him to me,Julien Come on

642
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,456
What the hell was that?

643
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,192
I thought you'd be a little
bit more appreciative

644
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,269
since I just saved you
from a felony arms arrest

645
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,964
- Call us even
- Nothing's even

646
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,938
One of your guys ain't dead.

647
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,272
Look, we're just gonna get different
gats Go see the Mexicans It's on

648
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:19,315
It's off My next stop is the Mexicans
You have my word

649
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,477
- Yeah, well I used to trust that
- You still can

650
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,521
You just give me
tonight to prove it

651
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,523
You got tonight

652
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,059
- What?
- I thought we were playin' it tight

653
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,965
- We are
- You put us all at risk
without lettin' us have a say

654
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,968
over guns that we've
got nothing to do with

655
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,164
- And I'd do it again
- Well, I wouldn't

656
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,674
I wouldn't

657
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,684
I talked to my boss in D.C.

658
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,685
Here's the problem.

659
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,778
The Greeks don't wanna help us

660
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,686
- They're a little pissed off at the moment
- Why?

661
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,750
'Cause we make up reasons for going to war
and then act like the world's policeman?

662
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,057
That and the missiles
we sold to Turkey

663
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,132
We're not the only ones
who want Margos

664
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,498
- Paraguay, Chile, Belgium.
- It's not Brussels who's asking
them to conduct this raid.

665
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,594
Maybe in a couple of days
we can go through back channels

666
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,605
- and figure out a way we can--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa

667
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,835
We know where Margos
is gonna be tomorrow

668
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:24,142
It's already tomorrow in Athens I just
need a few police officers to pick him up

669
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,714
He's wanted for murder
in four countries.

670
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,279
- Can you get Leo to tell you
where Margos is going next?
- No.

671
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,722
He's not talking

672
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,284
Even in prison you need feet

673
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,523
Sorry, I've done
everything I can.

674
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,200
Assistant Chief Phillips.
Claudette Wyms.

675
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,931
- I remember, Detective
- What's going on?

676
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,405
I think you should talk
to Captain Aceveda

677
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,500
Why?

678
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,612
He's not stepping down yet, is he?

679
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,012
You should go talk to him

680
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,187
I'm supposed to be
captain in two days.

681
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,189
I still have some unfinished business

682
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,555
- How long?
- Until I take office.

683
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,060
- In six months?
- It's a volatile time in Farmington right now

684
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,062
I can't leave the Barn
underfunded, understaffed

685
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,632
- You're gonna bring in more personnel
- Yes

686
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,760
- The undercover Decoy Squad?
- Yes

687
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,169
- You're stealing my ideas
- I'm implementing them,
along with some of my own

688
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,674
You are stealing my ideas,
and you're taking my job

689
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,109
I've got the power to make those ideas happen
I can still make a difference here

690
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,616
- I can make a difference
- Not like me

691
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,356
- This is my job
- Not yet

692
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,255
You're the reason for half
the problems in the first place

693
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,063
Well, that's your opinion
I'd keep any others to myself

694
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,799
I will not let you
do this to me

695
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,510
There's a bigger picture, Claudette,
and you're smart enough to see it

696
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,639
The chiefs not gonna help you.

697
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,182
He's gonna need me

698
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:21,424
The army scab who sold the Byz Lats their
guns says the buyer's name was Garza

699
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,796
Garza?
I thought he retired

700
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,802
Well, maybe his pension ran out
'Cause he's back

701
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,066
I need you to get
in touch with him

702
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,802
Tell him that
you found a buyer

703
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,038
offering to pay
double what he paid

704
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,047
That's all I got
I'll cover you on the back end

705
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,449
Hey, man Top's down pretty tight
on the Byzantine Quarter these days

706
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,022
That's at least
a couple days' work

707
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,023
You got two hours

708
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,370
- Danny?
- No, no I'll hold

709
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,772
- You got the guns, huh?
- Uh, half of them.

710
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,776
Byz Lats already
have the other half

711
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,108
Trying to put together a buy
while they're all in the same hands

712
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,842
- I need some cash
- How much?

713
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,850
- A hundred grand
- Right

714
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,251
Just to show them that we're real
I just need it for a couple hours

715
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,153
- Then put in a request through central
- I need it now, tonight

716
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,158
I'm not bending
the rules for you.

717
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,060
- Hey, look I didn't even want
this case in the first place
- Then why did you take it on?

718
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,098
Because, obviously,
I'm the only one who gives a shit

719
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,895
- about the damage these guns are gonna do
- You're not

720
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,902
I've spent all day calling
in favors to make sure

721
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,064
things change in Farmington
in the next six months

722
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,234
- What's that mean?
- It means that you have to
file the proper paperwork

723
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,040
and wait a couple of days
for the hundred grand

724
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,741
Or you can stop by an ATM

725
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,287
The guy's wanted by Interpol
I'm giving you the address

726
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,295
All you have to do
is pick him up

727
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,855
What's so goddamn
hard about that?

728
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:08,597
If my tone sounds superior, it's because
I'm American and you're Greek.

729
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:14,641
- Trouble in Armenia?
- Athens actually

730
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,373
What's going on?

731
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:22,646
Nothing
It's just the usual bullshit

732
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,625
Whom shall I fear?

733
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:35,222
You are the stronghold
of my life

734
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,829
- Whom should I--

735
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:45,005
Jesus Christ
What are you doing here?

736
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,909
Confess
To what you did to me

737
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:53,642
- What?
- I just need to know

738
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,211
Look, I just--
I just need to know

739
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,453
What the hell
is your problem, man?

740
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,691
The truth
Just tell me the truth

741
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,425
I didn't do anything to you

742
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,500

743
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,200
Oh, shit!

744
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,539
Though an army besiege me,
my heart will not fear

745
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,443
Even though war
breaks out against me, even then--

746
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,176
-Julien, please! 

747
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,551

748
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,888
Oh, God
