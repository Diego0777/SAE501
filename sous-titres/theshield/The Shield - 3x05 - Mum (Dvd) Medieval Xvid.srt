2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,708
Here she is

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,370
What's going on? Jesus.
No one's telling us anything.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,678
I talked to Dr Thiel,
and Tavon's condition is grave

5
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,811
Traumatic brain damage
He's got a tough road

6
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:25,379
- Can we see him?
- He's in I.C.U. It's family only.

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:31,124
- He's on my team
- Ifhe takes a turn either way, I'll let you know.

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,572
- Yeah
- Did you get my messages?

11
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,651
No What, uh--
What's going on?

12
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,653
Tavon got into an accident, man

13
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,189
Hit a parked car at full speed

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,158
- He might not make it
- Oh, man

15
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,422
Listen, we're at Mission Cross
You gotta get down here

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,522
Yeah I, uh--

17
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,727
I kinda had a rough night myself

18
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,100
I mixed it up with this guy
at the Three of Clubs

19
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,504
- I gotta take this other call

20
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,667
- If you can make it, you should come
- Okay

21
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,944
We gotta clean this up

22
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,384
- Hello
- I called you.

23
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,395
What's the problem, ma'am?

24
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,160
I think my ex-boyfriend's in the house

25
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,725
Lyle Dockman
He's been harassing me

26
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,671
My bedroom light was off
when I went to work.

27
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,174
Did you get a restraining order
out on him?

28
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,575
Yes It just made him madder

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,580
All right We'll check it out

30
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,707
Police!

31
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,352
Anyone in the house?

32
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,522
I'll check the upstairs

33
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,558
Ma'am, stay back, please.

34
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,027
- Bedroom's clear.

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,572
- Oh, my God!
- Danny!

36
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,305
Halt! Police! Halt!

37
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,642

38
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,214
- You okay?
- Yeah

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,652
Is he gone?

40
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,656
Yeah

41
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,365
I'm here. What?

42
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,367
Oh Sorry about Tavon

43
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,200
- What do you want?
- I need you to sweep the Alvarado corridor

44
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,570
- Looking for--
- Cruisers, loiterers

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,939
There've been complaints
from business owners and citizens

46
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,444
You--

47
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,038
You want me for something real,
I'll be at the hospital

48
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,414
Well, the doctors said they won't know
anything for a couple of days

49
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,784
I'm sorry it happened,
but there's still work to do

50
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,380
I'm a detective, not a janitor

51
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,790
- Get your unis to do your sweeping
- I'm giving you the broom.

52
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,158
The Strike Team's a special unit.

53
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,596
All you've done since your promotion
is jam us up with bullshit gigs

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,464
Maybe with Gilroy
you could pick your special cases...

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,630
but now it goes Chief Bankston
to Aceveda to me to you.

56
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,799
You don't like that pecking order,
take it up the ladder...

57
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,877
see who's out of a job

58
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,009
- Alvarado corridor, huh?
- Till I tell you otherwise

59
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,175
- You all right?
- Bulb blew out

60
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,008
Ripped by:

61
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,379
Hound

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,450

64
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,088
- Shane!
- I got it. Hang on!

65
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,666
- Comin'!

66
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,998
Okay

67
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,202
- Sorry I was on my way
- Forget it Wyms has us on a shit sweep

68
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,608
Alvarado.Jesus!

69
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,203
- Someone clocked you
- Dude, who kicked your ass?

70
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,112
It was this guy

71
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,117
This drunk asshole
was pawing me in the bar...

72
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,346
and Shane told him to get lost

73
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,150
and him and his friends
jumped him in the bathroom

74
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,522
- There was more than one guy?
- No It was mainly one guy

75
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,960
I mean, the other guys
just stood there and watched

76
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,032
How's Tavon doing?

77
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,000
Hey, did he come by here tonight?

78
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,002
Tavon? No. Why would he?

79
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,095
He said he was gonna mend fences

80
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,142
It's just us. Laundry night.

81
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,806
- Everything else all right?
- Yeah I'm good

82
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,578
- I'm taking care ofhim.
- Stay home

83
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,553
I don't want you showing up at work
looking like you got bitch-slapped

84
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,092

85
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,332
Fiesta siesta!

86
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,528
Anybody still here in a minute
gets run in!

87
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,367
You heard the man
Let's pack it up, party people!

88
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,409
- You don't gotta sweat me, man!
- Thought this was a free country

89
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,344
- Got a curfew in this part of town, homes
- Not for me I'm over 21

90
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,416
What do you think?

91
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,212
- About 1 4 coats of high-end enamel?
- Let's see.

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,954
Yo, man, I'm gone, man

93
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,258
- Where were you tonight around 1 0:00?
-Jogging

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,263
I do three miles every night after work

95
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,698
Sure you weren't doing the 1 00-yard dash
through your ex-girlfriend's backyard?

96
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,702
Elena?
I can't go within 1 ,000 feet of her

97
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,034
Right, or call her But you've been
leaving messages on her machine

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,040
Before the restraining order.

99
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,042
It's a crime to want another chance?

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,839
She's not giving you another chance

101
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,846
- Not yet
- Not ever

102
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,848
Look, someone was
in her house tonight.

103
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,815
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

104
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,012
Can anyone verify
you were jogging tonight?

105
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,620
You'd have to ask around

106
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,626
Okay, well, we're watching over Elena

107
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,023
And now we're watching you

108
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,328
Problemo, amigo

109
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,233
This is your 1 0th citation
for cruising in the last four months

110
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,238
I juice up cars

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,366
Hummin' out here with my baby's
the only advertisement I got

112
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,912
Try the Yellow Pages
'cause we're bringing the car in

113
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,243
- When do I get it back?
- About a month or two

114
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,249
After you see a judge, pay a fine

115
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,717
We'll take care of her till then, all right?

116
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,051
Every cent I made the last five years
I got wrapped up on her

117
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:09,254
Really? I would've pegged you
as more of a mutual fund guy

118
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,728
What do I got to do
to keep my wheels?

119
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,130
Flip me someone juicier than you

120
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,571
Oh, here's her ride

121
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,335
Wait, wait This vato, Aramis

122
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,809
I call her twice a month
I always remember her birthday

123
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,904
- Her own son.
- So you're taking her side.

124
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,008
- Seen Claudette?
- She and Dutch just caught one

125
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,349
Another possible elderly rape victim

126
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,322
What do you need?

127
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,324
She's got me working
the Alvarado corridor

128
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,758
- for the next few days
- Right Sweeping duty

129
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,490
Last night I'm tagging this guy

130
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,498
we're about to tow away
his Hot Wheels

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,659
he spills about this guy
sneaking contraband

132
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,703
into Chino Prison for his gang buddies

133
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,534
- What kind of contraband?
- Drugs, cigs

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,108
cock rings, weapons of mass destruction,
who knows what

135
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,678
- You checking into it?
- I was looking for Claudette

136
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,009
to see if I should stick
with cruiser duty

137
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,982
- Follow up on this for the time being
- Wherever you want me

138
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,285
- Gentlemen, what do we got?
- B-and-E robbery

139
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,223
Fits your rapist profile though

140
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,660
- Elderly woman living alone
- You read my memos?

141
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,323
- Watch CO makes us
- Did the victim call it in?

142
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,664
- No, I didn't.
- I did.

143
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,760
Detective Wyms and Wagenbach.

144
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,170
Patty Klopp. My mother, Luann.

145
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,606
They broke in last night

146
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,736
I stopped by this morning
I noticed some of her Hummels were gone

147
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,973
Couple of tchotchkes So what?

148
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,243
Someone broke into your home, Ma.

149
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,581
- You have to report that.
- And now you have

150
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,345
She's supposed to be watching
her sugar levels

151
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,856
Anything taken from the bedroom?

152
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,560
- Not that I know of
- When did the robbery occur?

153
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,335
Last night I came home around 9:00
from the movies

154
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,036
- You see anybody?
-Just saw my things missing

155
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,045
And you weren't afraid

156
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,241
Honey, I've lived in this neighborhood
for 40 years.

157
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,682
Your daughter says she's trying
to get you to move to Encino.

158
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,346
You'll have to kill me
before I'll retire to the valley

159
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,094
Ooh, you got something special in mind
for the ride back?

160
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,223
Funny The compulsive eating,
the odd, distracted behavior--

161
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,325
I think Luann was raped

162
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:36,700
Well, yeah, she's a tough old broad,
but I saw it too

163
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,903
- You're agreeing with me?
- I'm agreeing that she loses her dignity...

164
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,106
if she admits she was attacked--
her dignity and her independence

165
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,013
Speaking oflosing your dignity--

166
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,087
The bed was stripped
There was nothing in the clothes hamper

167
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,284
Whatever you find in there's gonna be
too contaminated to test.

168
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,826
That's too bad

169
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,955
Why do you throw out
a perfectly good set of sheets?

170
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,296
To bury the truth

171
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,427
God, I wonder how many other
buried sheets there are out there.

172
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,540
Oh, here's Aramis.

173
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,875
Byz Lats are showing initiative.

174
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,881
Diagur's running them
better than I thought.

175
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,883
Yo, Ronnie,you see him?

176
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,921
Guy with the cigarettes?
Yeah, I got him.

177
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,957
That's good.

178
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,051
Either this guy is sneaking shit into Chino...

179
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,529
or he needs the world's largest patch.

180
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,533
Let's see where he takes us.

181
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,535
We can't provide 2 4-hour protection

182
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,537
to every woman
who has an ex with a temper

183
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,664
Sir, I did some checking up
on this asshole

184
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,833
The last ex who got
a restraining order on him

185
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,434
left a good job in Cleveland
to move to New Hampshire

186
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,479
just to disappear from this guy

187
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,481
She was sure that he would kill her

188
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,713
- This one feels real to me, sir
- Danny's right

189
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,153
This one feels real

190
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,658
Okay We can escort her
to and from work Extra patrols

191
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,628
You've got one week for this guy
to violate the order before I pull the plug

192
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,925
All right Thank you, sir

193
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,525
Don't thank me
She should be thanking you

194
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,831
I got 29 B-and-E's
of elderly women.

195
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,600
- Eleven in the last six months
- I called the hospitals.

196
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,667
They said they'd give us a heads-up
if anyone fits that profile.

197
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,613
What about your new promotion? You sure
you've got time to help me out on this one?

198
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,243
- For this? Yeah I'm all yours
- Yeah?

199
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,412
You ever hear of this guy?

200
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,919
''Mueller's Geographical Profiles. ''

201
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,189
That's the criminologist from Duke?

202
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,196
Doctor of Criminal Logistics

203
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,630
Takes data on serial violent crimes--

204
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,759
victims, nature of the assault--

205
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,327
Generates the most likely location
of where the perpetrator lives or works

206
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,876
Needs three confirmed cases
to work up a preliminary profile

207
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:55,345
- We've only got one victim confirmed
- Two, if Luann comes clean.

208
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,417
You think Aceveda will spring for it?
It's expensive

209
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,647
Nah Let's go find numbers two and three:
then we'll stick him with a bill

210
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,458
- You already made arrests?
- Caught 'em exchanging
packages of smokes and drugs

211
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,463
along with 7,500 in cash

212
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,965
Guess that's the going
smuggling rate these days

213
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,195
- Good work
- The banger puts together the care packages

214
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,204
The white guy's
a frozen food delivery man

215
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,206
Drops off at Chino twice a week

216
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,208
What are you working on exactly?

217
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,278
I got a tip from a cruiser last night...

218
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,438
about a guy sneaking swag
into the state pen

219
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,450
Shouldn't be too hard to getJoe Trucker
to roll on cholo and vice versa

220
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,121
You moved off the Alvarado corridor?

221
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,954
Yeah I couldn't find you,
so I moved up the ladder

222
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,227
- So I had some cigarettes
- We're not talking about
a couple cartons of Marlboros

223
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,393
We nabbed you handing off
20 thumbs of heroin too

224
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,028
Must be the old man's
'cause I learned in school to just say no

225
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,266
You take the orders, gather the shit...

226
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,672
hand 'em off to Fred,
who sneaks it in with the frozen peas

227
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,144
- Am I right?
- Yeah, we got you dead to rights, man

228
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,408
On all your wrongs Look

229
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,579
I spoke to the DA
If you cooperate

230
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,589
I can make sure that you do your time at
Chino again with all your fellow banditos

231
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,650
Otherwise, who knows?
Maybe you end up someplace chilly like Shasta.

232
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,570
Can I go home now?

233
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,940
Sorry It's gonna be a little while

234
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,942
What's the problem?

235
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,444
Wejust talked to Aramis.
He told us the whole thing.

236
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,677
Twice a week drop-offs you make
at Chino State Correctional Facility.

237
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,479
I'm a deliveryman
That's my job

238
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,283
There was heroin
in this week's care package

239
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,984
I don't look at what's in the packages.

240
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,788
But you knew it was wrong.

241
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,197
Um

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,135
I-- I should go home now
My wife's making dinner

243
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,674
Whoa, easy It's all right Easy

244
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,073
Fred. Fred.

245
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,669
You're under arrest,
you understand that?

246
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,443
No. That's not right.

247
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,115
If you can confirm
who receives the stuff on the inside...

248
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,521
- maybe we can make things a little easier on you
- No.

249
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,820
This is-- This is a mistake

250
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,556
This can't happen
I'm not a criminal

251
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,631
The Strike Team just made a bust
that included $7,500 in cash

252
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,641
I need you to run
the serial numbers of the bills...

253
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,973
against the numbers on this list

254
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,979
Again with this?

255
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,676
Let me know if you get any matches,
and then return that list straight to me.

256
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,947
Why do you have me doing
such menial things for you?

257
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,954
Because you're my assistant

258
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,617
I could be so much more to you

259
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,662
With the election and everything

260
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,663
I have a campaign staff for that

261
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,665
They don't know what they're doing

262
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,429
You have no idea the mistakes I fix
before they land on your desk

263
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,697
And I appreciate it,
but for right now, please

264
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,171
just check the numbers on that list
against the money in Evidence

265
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,916
- You okay?
- It's Layla

266
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,388
She reported a robbery
five months ago...

267
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:30,952
and after a lot of hand-holding
just admitted she was raped

268
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,657
-Jesus This guy is--
- She tell you anything that'll help?

269
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,430
No condoms, no climax,
a lot of cuddling.

270
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,767
That makes two confirmed
I struck out on my end

271
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,864
We need one more

272
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,307
I don't remember
anybody snooping around

273
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,311
Delivery guy?

274
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,247
- Anybody that seemed suspicious?
- This neighborhood?

275
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,250
Try to find someone
who doesn't look suspicious

276
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,186
The reason we ask, Luann,
is because there is a man...

277
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,123
who is breaking into homes
and sexually assaulting women.

278
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,593
- Sexually?
- I'm flattered, Detective

279
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,597
He's targeting women your age

280
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,635
- What are you talking about?
- Did someone hurt you?

281
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,636
Course not

282
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,041
Thank God

283
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,640
- I pulled Tavon's accident report.
- Thanks for doing that

284
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,946
You know, witnesses saw the car
swerving a couple blocks

285
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,043
before he hit that parked car

286
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,179
- Before?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,724
- Is Tavon a drinker?
- I don't think so

288
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,726
Which direction was the car going in?

289
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,661
Uh, north on Perry

290
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,665
North? Uh, thanks

291
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,534
Hey I thought
you didn't want me coming in

292
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,632
I thought you were gonna come alone

293
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,803
She wasn't sure I was good to drive

294
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,643
- Thoughtful
- Yeah What's up?

295
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,782
Tavon was headed away from your place

296
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,518
Witnesses saw his car swerving
all over the road before he hit the car

297
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:12,120
- Toxi report shows no drugs or alcohol
- That's weird

298
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,132
What do you think happened?

299
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,726
Don't know yet
Don't have all the facts

300
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,930
There's something missing

301
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,636
Like a coffee table or a painting

302
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,006
Look, he came over

303
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,051
Gave me this backhanded apology

304
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,144
We had some words

305
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,658
He jumped me, and I tagged him back
with a pretty good shot

306
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,819
- How good and where?
- To the back of the head

307
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,557
The back of the--
He has brain trauma.

308
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,327
It was from an accident
that happened miles away from my place

309
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,995
He was swerving all over the road
before the crash

310
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,299
Your blow probably caused it

311
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,306
You could face charges.

312
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,146
- What did you hit him with?
- A paperweight or something

313
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,340
Look, he was all over me

314
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,714
Where were you during all this?

315
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,083
I-- I was doing the laundry
in the basement

316
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,019
Really? Whites or colors?

317
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,182
- I--
- She wasn't there

318
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,385
All right?

319
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,394
This thing was all me

320
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,464
Uh, hold on

321
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,160
- Here's your list back
- Thank you

322
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,793
- Got two matches
- What?

323
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,031
Two of the bills,
their serial numbers were on the list

324
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,165
I wrote which ones down for you

325
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,076

326
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,218
- Where you taking him?
- Interrogation

327
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,288
- I'll meet you upstairs
- Sure thing

328
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,323
We miss a piece of the puzzle
putting together Aramis?

329
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,326
No We just need to talk to him
on an unrelated matter

330
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,420
I'll let you guys get back
to the Alvarado corridor

331
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,797
- Thanks
- Who's the suit?

332
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,497
His ID said Treasury That's the second
''T'' fed in our house in two weeks

333
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,575
What's Treasury want from our collar?

334
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,269
Aramis is one of Diagur's tenientes.

335
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,779
You think that Aceveda knows about
the corners we cut with Diagur

336
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,010
- to get those guns back?
- One way to find out

337
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,917
Don't care about that

338
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,793
Just tell us where you got the 7,500
in cash you gave to the delivery guy

339
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,798
I already made a deal
with the other cop.

340
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,800
I ain't got to rat on my boys
on the outside.

341
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,894
Your crime is now under
federal investigation

342
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,668
- That's why Agent Nell is here
- Which means any previous deal
is now null and void

343
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,675
Bullshit My ticket's punched to Chino

344
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,677
Your ticket's punched
wherever we say it is

345
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,044
Captain Aceveda's been checking
all money confiscated in big arrests

346
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,707
So?

347
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,082
Two of the bills you had
in your possession were marked

348
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,522
It was currency stolen from
an Armenian money laundering ring

349
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,093
- Holy shit
- We've been waiting for it to show up.

350
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,925
Guess what.
It showed up in your hands.

351
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,659
- Our money's marked?
- No way.

352
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,361
Aramis said he got that cash from Diagur

353
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,199
We got our bag back from Diagur
20 grand light

354
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,035
We're starting at square one, Aramis

355
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,076
Who did you get the money from?

356
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,805
- I don't know where I got it from
- Not good enough.

357
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,349
Whoever stole that money
killed two Armenians to get it...

358
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,941
and we're gonna tie someone
to these murders

359
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,285
You want it to be you
or someone else?

360
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,090
I really don't think you want to be facing
the death penalty for something you didn't do

361
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,788
Go! Go!

362
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,700
I got a sick feeling, man
It's all crashing

363
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,076
- Not if we steer it in the right direction
- Our money's marked?

364
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,376
- Some of it? All of it?
- We don't know, man

365
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,383
- Where are we going?
- To find Diagur.

366
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,120
Silence his smoking gun

367
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,429
We're looking for Diagur.

368
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,298
- Who are you faggots?
- Hey, watch your mouth

369
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,635
We're the guys busting you
for possession of an illegal substance

370
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,232
- Where's Diagur?
- Who?

371
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,277
Today's not the day
I just need to talk to him

372
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,279
- Where is he?

373
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,077
Yeah You give me a message,
I'll pass it on to him

374
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,014
How long you been
out ofTerminal Island?

375
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,454
Not long enough

376
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,253
You don't tell me where your boss is at,
you're gonna bejumping back.

377
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,954
Home is where the heart is

378
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,626
Huff the pipe, asshole
Take a hit

379
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,637
Take a hit

380
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,333
- Take it

381
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,675
Take it, goddamn it!

382
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,197

383
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,132
Join the party, sweetheart
Come on

384
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,068
He's at Yolanda's
One street over

385
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,640
Brown house with the Madonna

386
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,403

387
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,750

388
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,583
- Diagur?
- Si.

389
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,283
- Donde?
- En el quarto.

390
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,098
-Jesus Christ
- Get out!

391
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,193
- It's okay I know 'em
- How old are you?

392
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,896
Old enough

393
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:58,442
Glad Mom has such a firm grasp on things
Wait outside

394
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,374
- Come on, let's go
- I need my clothes

395
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,106
Whatcha doin',
breaking into my freak, yo?

396
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,114
You got a Byz Lats lawyer
on your speed dial?

397
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,116
Yeah One of my boys has an uncle

398
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,016
Call him Get him down to
the Farmington station house right now

399
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,646
- What's there?
- Your prison delivery boy, Aramis

400
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,055
If he's done anything,
it's without me knowing about it

401
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,150
I'm all over your Chino game.

402
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,422
And unless you want
my boss all over you

403
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,466
you get your lawyer down there
and make sure he zips it now

404
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,832
Someone left a rose
in Elena's mailbox this afternoon

405
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,734
Don't you have
more important things to do?

406
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,364
Actually, unlawful use of a mailbox
is a federal offense

407
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,002
We just got done talking to your boss
Technically, you were on the clock

408
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,740
- You were supposed to be making business calls
- You got proof it was me?

409
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:41,785
For future proof,your boss has agreed to
monitor all your calls and online activity at work.

410
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,720
- You can't do that
- No, but she can.

411
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:49,556
You can either spend your 9 to 5
stalking or spend it working.

412
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,927
- Can't do both
- Listen, lady, this is my job

413
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,331
Not for long
if you don't leave Elena alone

414
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,937
Have a nice day

415
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,840
I'll talk to you later

416
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,843
- Lawyer's on his way
- Good

417
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,745
You said before you didn't have my back
Why you helping me now?

418
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,908
Feds are buzzing around
the money you gave to Aramis

419
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,612
It's tied to a robbery

420
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,813
Somebody ripped off
the Armenian mob

421
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,983
Come on, man
I ain't suicidal

422
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,151
The Armenians find out
that you guys are suspects

423
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,025
the Byz Lats will be up to their necks
in severed feet

424
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,862
I'm just trying to prevent a war
Where'd you get the cash?

425
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,936
Who knows?
It comes in a dozen ways

426
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,937
Anybody asks, that's your best answer

427
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,303
You give Aramis anything
besides the 7,500?

428
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,672
Yeah

429
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,768
Fifteen grand

430
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,643
- You handed it to him personally?
- You think I'm gonna trust that
kind of cash with some flunky?

431
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,579
So your fingerprints could still be on it

432
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,709
- Any idea where he might've stashed it?
- Yeah

433
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,754
- In his freezer My idea
- Original

434
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,256
Get somebody down to his place
to pick it up

435
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,258
And you disappear
for a couple of weeks

436
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,830
Oh, shit

437
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,923
- He's back in the cage
- He talked

438
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,229
He goddamn talked

439
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,973
- Sarge

440
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,518
Cold hard cash

441
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,581
I'll run the serial numbers
against the master list

442
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,714
I get this to the lab before 5:00

443
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,124
I can get fingerprint results
by morning

444
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,162
You coming?

445
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,495
He gave us permission
to search his place

446
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,364
I'm curious what else
we might find here

447
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,563
I'll call some unis for a ride

448
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,072
Diana Peabo.
She came into the E.R. last month.

449
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,142
Injuries sustained during a home robbery.

450
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,143
Her kids just brought her in again

451
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,146
Allergic reaction
Mixed up two of her meds

452
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,342
They said that she's been
kind of out of it since the attack

453
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,885
One of the other nurses
saw your bulletin

454
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,888
- Thank her for us
- It's a him, actually

455
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,253
They're in consultation

456
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,262
- How's Tavon?
- He's the same

457
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,028
Excuse me
Could I talk with you a moment?

458
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,570
Detective Wyms
Detective Wagenbach

459
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,671
How's your mother?

460
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,115
She'll be just fine
What's this all about?

461
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,846
We were wondering if we could talk to her
about that robbery last month

462
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,618
- Why now?
- We think your mother might be able to help us

463
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,716
find the person who did it

464
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,172
It's not here.

465
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,948
Police! Don't move!
Keep your hands in the open!

466
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,574
Hey! Don't move!
Don't make me do it, man

467
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,949
Stop right there
Put your hands in the air

468
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,215
Don't make it worse for yourself

469
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,223
Turn around

470
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,395
On your knees, man

471
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,506

472
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,802
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

473
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,241
Hey, man

474
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,677
Hey, don't make this mistake

475
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,681
I'm a police officer

476
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,620
So you a cop, huh?

477
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,748
That mean you can do
whatever the hell you want?

478
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:45,296
Hey,you can still get out of this.

479
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,356
Oh, now you telling me
what to do, huh?

480
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,727
Hey, man, you need
to calm your friend down

481
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,667
Tie him up
Tie him up with something

482
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,082
Your hands, man

483
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,049
Your hands, man

484
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,653
- Hurry up

485
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,319
Hey, man

486
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,624
Don't throw your life away

487
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,892
I ain't afraid of prison,
but you should be

488
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,169
You ever, uh

489
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,732
suck a dick like a cell bitch, cop-man?

490
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:37,213
- Huh?
- Don't do this

491
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,340
It's your turn to gag on something

492
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,749
Huh?

493
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,321
No

494
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,653
- Open up, sweetheart
- No!

495
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,193

496
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,197
You wanna die instead? Huh?

497
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,893
- No

498
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,437

499
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,438
Captain!

500
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,802
Great

501
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,141
Probably had a limo
come pick him up

502
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,783
Can I get confirmation
on that pickup address?

503
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,218
There's no one here
at our current location

504
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,418
Negative, 1 -Tango-1 6 Unable to confirm

505
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,691
Let's head out

506
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,064

507
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,070
They're gone

508
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,311
Let's see that mouth

509
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,353
- El Presidente around?
- Captain Aceveda? No

510
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,722
- Where is he?
- Conducting a search at a suspect's house

511
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,727
Could you raise him on the horn for me?

512
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,729
I got an important question for him

513
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,291
I'll try, but I've left two messages for him
in the last 1 0 minutes

514
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,132
His cell phone coverage
is bad sometimes

515
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,577
No

516
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,578
Thanks

517
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,781
Put your groove into it

518
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,547
Suck it!

519
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,555

520
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,557
Little bigger than you're used to?

521
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:35,055
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

522
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,532
Yeah,just like that

523
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,271
Get your phone, man

524
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,365
- What?
- Your phone

525
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,376
I wanna get a Kodak of this

526
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,212
Yeah, that's the way.
Mm-hmm, okay.

527
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,487
- You ready?
- Yeah

528
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,922

529
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,630
- I got it

530
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,291
You don't remember anything else?

531
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,204
Nothing about his face?

532
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,106
His height?

533
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,548
I'm gonna tell you something you're
not gonna like hearing very much, Vince

534
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,313
I know, as a son,
it's the last thing I'd want to hear.

535
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,615
What's going on?

536
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,551
Um, we--

537
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,789
We think your mother wasn't just
knocked down by that guy last month

538
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,095
We believe he may have
sexually assaulted her

539
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,637
- Sexually?
- It would account for why
she's so distracted lately

540
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,638
That's a lot of pain to push down

541
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,731
We hope we're wrong.

542
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,072
Why don't you start by telling us
what happened that day?

543
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,614
I found her lying on the kitchen floor
She couldn't stop crying

544
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,173
- What else?
- Back window was broken

545
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,915
She said a guy came in, knocked her down,
grabbed a few things, then ran

546
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:09,653
She would've told me if--

547
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,161
Maybe she needed more time

548
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:19,900
- Yo, man, ifhe tells his boys, we're done.

549
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,699
- You gonna say anything?
- No

550
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,972
You can't believe that shit.

551
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,516
- What, you want to kill him?
- You do it

552
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,486
- You want it done, you do it

553
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,650
Hey, man, I have a little girl

554
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:49,895
I-- I have a wife

555
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,697
Mother

556
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,068
Yo, man, you gotta do it
I'll watch

557
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,232
You been wantin' the juice, man

558
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,776
- Do it

559
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,811
If your mother were here,
what would she tell you to do?

560
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:13,923
Not this kind of juice, bro
Not this kind of juice

561
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,426

562
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,265
It's that other cop Let's go

563
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,565
- I'm in here!

564
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:38,070
- Bust the door!

565
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,116
- Try it again.

566
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,311
- I got it.

567
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,321
- He's here!
- Sweep it

568
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,891
- You all right?
- Yeah

569
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,928
- Clear!
- Clear!

570
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,397
- They got my gun
- They?

571
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,560
Yeah Two of them

572
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,934
- Are you hurt?
- No

573
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,468
I was able to fight 'em off

574
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,112
Mom

575
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:15,345
I need you to tell me
what happened during the robbery

576
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,580
I told you everything I remember

577
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,657
Have you?

578
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,353
What else did he do to you?

579
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,728
Where are those police people?

580
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,734
He hurt you?

581
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,271
Stop it, Vincent.

582
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:40,811
- Raped you?
- Don't you say that!

583
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,812
Mom, did he?

584
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:47,442
Don't say that!

585
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,882
Why didn't you tell me?

586
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,117
Mama, why?

587
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,525

588
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,979
- Hold it
- You see something?

589
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,881
- Maybe.

590
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,959
- Let's go
- Yep

591
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,189
- You can't keep me here
- That's true

592
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,266
You'll probably make bail
sometime tomorrow

593
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,962
Trial won't be for another six months,
but in between

594
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,529
every time you roll a stop sign,
I'm gonna be handing you a ticket

595
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,168
Every lunch break you take, I'm gonna be
sitting right there at the next table.

596
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:51,112
- Yeah, that's harassment
- No, Lyle, that's stalking

597
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,585
Hey,you okay?

598
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,885
Yeah, I had a little run-in

599
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,895
No harm done

600
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,761
Let's not waste any time on it

601
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:12,859
- Hey, what happened?
- He fended off a couple of bad guys

602
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,962
Miracle he hasn't called
a press conference yet

603
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,649
She's in there alone
with her husband's service weapon

604
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,911
My key wasn't working
in the new lock

605
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,011
- She shot at me when I opened the door
- You okay?

606
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,682
Ma'am, come on
I told you to stay in the car

607
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,691
Luann!

608
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,198

609
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,239
Luann?

610
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,078
Luann

611
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:05,217
- Can you drop the gun?
- Put the gun down, Luann.

612
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:15,327
It's okay, sweetheart
I know what happened to you

613
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,731
That's our wedding

614
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,065
You were very beautiful

615
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,833
I was a size four

616
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,040
Can you tell me
what happened to you?

617
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,120
He robbed me
I didn't want to get robbed again

618
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,798
Hey, Cassie
Hello, Mr Mackey

619
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,096
Cassidy, Owen said hello to you

620
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,536
Hey

621
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,574
I'm sorry
She's struggling with this whole thing

622
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,973
It's okay

623
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:03,274
- Hey, little man
- I'm drawing a zoo

624
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,872
Wow Hey, that's great, Matty

625
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,883
Corrine's in with Megan

626
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,514
Hey

627
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,492
- How'd she do at Dr Franks?
- You know shrinks

628
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,994
You ask them one question,
they give you five back

629
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,656
She's being quiet and a little stubborn

630
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,791
He wants you and I to do sessions too

631
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,064
- One-on-one
- Look, I want her to get all the help she needs

632
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,662
But me laying down on a couch?
It's not gonna happen

633
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,175
Stubborn and incommunicative
Wonder where she gets that from

634
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,472
How's Tavon doing?

635
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,479
The last surgery gave them some hope

636
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,776
The brain tissue bruising
isn't as bad as they thought

637
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,512
- That's good
- The next 48 hours should tell.

638
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,350
Good

639
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:49,392
Oh, um, if he recovers

640
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,758
would he be able to remember
anything that happened?

641
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,923
I got him working on
this undercover assignment

642
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,365
Well, he could remember every detail

643
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:03,236
or he could wake up
and barely recognize his own reflection

644
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,174
IfTavon lives, he could remember
everything that happened

645
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:11,010
If he dies, an autopsy could reveal the blow
to the back of the head before the crash

646
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,678
We'll figure it out, baby

647
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,181
Chew on this, baby

648
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,285
We just found out the feds
marked some of our money train cash

649
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:29,992
- What?
- Part of a sting they're doing on the Armenians

650
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,366
- Oh, shit
- Deep

651
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,531
And if that's not enough,
this accident leads back to you

652
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,200
without us getting self-defense
on the books

653
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,210
I.A.D. could be all over you...

654
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,839
right at the time we're gonna
cash in on the money train.

655
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,180
- So what do we do?
- Oh Now it's ''we''

656
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,885
- Tell me the truth.
- I did

657
00:39:55,493 --> 00:40:01,227
You had a fight One of you hit him
It was self-defense

658
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,495
If you both tell your story right now,
this could all go away

659
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,497
Look, we gotta make a decision

660
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,806
Right now
Which road are we going down?

661
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,972
Look, everybody knew
Tavon and I had bad blood

662
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,113
No We gotta make this disappear

663
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:32,156
We think this cuddler rapist
has been around for a while.

664
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,163
We've looked at like-crimes...

665
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,290
we've interviewed dozens of women.

666
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,595
We've confirmed three victims...

667
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,670
which is required for his analysis

668
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,263
Mueller's results have been proven accurate
down to the square block

669
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,275
We match this with known offenders

670
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,437
we narrow our search dramatically.

671
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,879
Well, if this Mueller can help,
then let him

672
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,075
Mueller isn't free

673
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,312
- His fee's $5,000
- Right

674
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,286
- Then it can't happen
- We're really at a standstill on this.

675
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,292
A stranger perpetrator

676
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,419
The victims could just pile up
until he makes a mistake

677
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,157
and so far, he hasn't made one.

678
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,530
- Captain
- No I said no

679
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,263
We don't have the money

680
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,396
All right, roll up that rug

681
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,908
Hit some yard sales.
Pick up a new rug and a table.

682
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,844
Picture too. Use cash.

683
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,440
I'll drop by this weekend
and help you patch that wall.

684
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,542
What'd you hit him with?

685
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,725
Nice paperweight.
Put that in the truck with the rug.

686
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,956
It's a brand-new iron
I washed it It's clean

687
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,260
We'll get a new one.

688
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:47,064
Put the broken table in my truck.
I'll dump that too.

689
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,942

690
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,810
This is dangerous
You know that, don't you?

691
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,846
It's not my fault that he crashed

692
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,718
You mean it's not Shane's fault

693
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,184
He must really love you

694
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:15,391
- He's doing what he thinks is right
- What do you think is right?

695
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,399
I trust him.

696
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,275
We're gonna cover our tracks
the best we can

697
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:30,075
But if push comes to shove,
you gotta step up, tell the truth

698
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,638
The DA-- never gonna pursue
the conviction of a pregnant woman

699
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,719
trying to protect the father of her child

700
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,878
That's not how Shane wants to do it

701
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,480
He'll do it however you tell him to do it

702
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:45,289
- Is everything okay?
- Sure.

703
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,957
Sweetheart, let me get that
I got it

704
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,728
Hey, hey, hey Luminol

705
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,293
Spray it all around. Use the light.

706
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,533
Blood traces will glow

707
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,939
Here I--

708
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,878
Fumes could be dangerous to the baby
Cleanup's on you

709
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,245
- Thank you
- Yeah

710
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,495
Sir, we caught that stalker lurking
behind the victim's house last night.

711
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,296
- Good
-Just thought you'd like to know, sir

712
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,200
- Captain
- I need your signature.

713
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,907
- You ready for the monthly reports?
- Not yet
