1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,630
<i>You had Vic arrested?</i>

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,575
<i>- I just filed a complaint.
- Well, he's spending the night
in jail right now.</i>

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,271
<i>- I can't even bail him out till the morning.
- He broke into my house.</i>

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,715
Oh, come on. He worked his ass off
to pay for this house, Corrine.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,584
<i>- What are you thinking?
- My kids are sleeping. Good night.</i>

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,090
<i>- I really need for his head
to be in the game right now.
- Then go tell him.</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,851
<i>He's worried about you, and that kind
of distraction can get him killed.</i>

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,498
<i>- Me and the other guys too.
- That's not my fault.</i>

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,201
Go home, Shane.

10
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:40,036
<i>Would you just back off?
Just leave him...Just leave him alone!</i>

11
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,472
- What were you thinking?
- Hey, where I come from...

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,440
when a guy's lady jams him up,
his buddies have a talk with her.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,149
- Not in the middle of the night, Jethro.
- I'm sorry.

14
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:51,049
But you need to be able
to concentrate right now.

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,279
- Are you okay?
- Where are we with the money train?

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,221
- It's definitely pulling out tonight.
- What's the new collection point?

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,192
Well, we don't know yet.

18
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,820
What about the guy who ran
the last site, shut it down?

19
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,060
- We ran his plates. Got an address.
- His name's Chorekian.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,689
- He's the advance man.
- Follow him. Maybe he'll
take us to the new site.

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,136
Took us two months to scout the last site.
You want to do this one in a few hours?

22
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,067
We still got the truck, the equipment,
the plans. All that stays the same.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,942
<i>- Might stay the same.
- Never get another chance like this again.</i>

24
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,146
Let's remember where
this Armenian money's coming from...

25
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,543
prostitution, drugs, robberies.

26
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,050
<i>And the rest of this cash is just gonna
finance more of the same.</i>

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,711
They didn't earn it.
I don't feel bad about taking it.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,461
<i>We get a little for ourselves,
set the Armenian mob back months.</i>

29
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,895
Ronnie, you gas up the truck,
ready the equipment.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,128
Shane, Lem, you get on
this Armenian advance man.

31
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,460
<i>- See where he takes us.
- All right. Come on.</i>

32
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,435
- David, who'd you vote for?
- I'll give you a hint.

33
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,574
- He's Latino.
- And he's handsome.

34
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,099
<i>Any comment on the report
you recommended the chief fire...</i>

35
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>the anti-gang unit you oversee?</i>

36
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:57,276
I didn't feel they were meeting the high
standards we expect of our officers.

37
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,581
<i>The report also suggests
you offered yourself up as well.</i>

38
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,212
I'm their commanding officer.
They were my responsibility.

39
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,354
If I'm gonna hold them to a high standard,
I should expect the same of myself.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,827
Chief Bankston, it's good
to finally meet you.

41
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,638
Captain Aceveda seems to think
your team is a real problem.

42
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,467
He's recommending that I fire you all.

43
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,185
My team is responsible
for more than 50%...

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,050
of drug and gang arrests
in that district.

45
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,145
<i>The results are impressive.
It's the methods that have me concerned.</i>

46
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,558
Aceveda and I don't always
see eye to eye on tactics.

47
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,788
<i>Well, that won't be
a problem for long.</i>

48
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,957
After he loses
the primary today, he's resigning.

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,865
<i>I don't know what kind of latitude
the last chief gave you...</i>

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,301
but I believe in doing things well
and doing them right.

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,271
So do I.

52
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,242
<i>I know when a cop has
his toe over the line, Detective.</i>

53
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,346
Are you going to be able to maintain your
stellar arrest rate without crossing any lines?

54
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,314
<i>- Absolutely.
- Prove it to me...</i>

55
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,115
or I'll have no problem acting on
your captain's recommendations.

56
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,860
You put my team on the termination list
you gave to the chief?

57
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,733
I don't have time for you.
I've gotta tell 27 people today...

58
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,608
the chief's office
just fired them.

59
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:32,212
That's right, and I'm not one of them.
You are, aren't you?

60
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,806
Consider yourself
on desk duty for the day.

61
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,951
- Where do you get off trying...
- I heard about your arrest.

62
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,385
Congratulations.
Go clean up your own house...

63
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,584
instead of continuing
to mess up mine.

64
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,350
The chief wants me out making cases,
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

65
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,323
- I gave you an order.
- You're a goddamn lame duck.

66
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,692
- An order you'll goddamn follow.
- Or what? You'll recommend that I'm fired?

67
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,528
Been nice knowing you.

68
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,672
<i>Can you read his lips?</i>

69
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,079
<i>Even if I could,
I don't speak Armenian, bro.</i>

70
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,710
That's his third call in the last five blocks.
He's definitely notifying the troops.

71
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,981
<i>All right. He's moving again.
He's moving.</i>

72
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,251
Follow the money.

73
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,691
Let's go.

74
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,559
Claudette, there's been
a homicide on Dresden.

75
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,438
- Great. We're ready to roll.
- No.

76
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:36,169
- The victim's your ex-husband, Jeff Franklin.
- You're kidding.

77
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,069
Your daughter Bonnie's there.

78
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,404
She's supposed to be
in Florida. Is she okay?

79
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,244
I think so, but she's a witness.

80
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,510
Dutch, you take the case.
You'll have to be limited to observing.

81
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,555
Uh, I've got a personal involvement,
granted a tertiary one.

82
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,318
Shouldn't you hand it off
to Brent or Marlon?

83
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,584
We're gonna be a little shorthanded
today. The case is yours.

84
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,324
<i>- Brent, Marlon.
- Yeah, Captain.</i>

85
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,897
Can I see you
up in my office, please?

86
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,931
Here it comes.

87
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,168
- You ready?
- Not really.

88
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,287
- Mom.
- There's blood. Let me get that for ya.

89
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,486
- He-He shot him.
- I know.

90
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,722
He's gone.

91
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,526
I know, honey.

92
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,294
- You got it.
- I'm sorry, Bonnie.

93
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,642
There's not a single damn witness...
none that we could find...

94
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,843
except the daughter.

95
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,843
- That's Claudette's ex-husband?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,347
Tell the M.E. to move his ass. I want
the body released as soon as possible.

97
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,316
<i>Gotcha.</i>

98
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,460
Christ, is this guy
on quaaludes?

99
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:02,894
He don't want to get pulled over.
It's a good sign.

100
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,796
- Means he's close to a go.
- Goddamn it. Get your ass in gear, granny.

101
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,674
Did he just hit him?

102
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't think
you were gonna stop.

103
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,842
- It's goddamn yellow. What's wrong with you?
- No reason to get upset.

104
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,846
No reason for you. You drive a piece
of shit. I just bought this car.

105
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,611
<i>- Relax. I'm covered.
- We're gonna lose the
goddamn money train over this.</i>

106
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,382
- What do we do if...
- I don't know.

107
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,823
<i>- Oh, no way.
- Try getting outta here. Go around the block.</i>

108
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,295
<i>- Shit.
- Cover up.</i>

109
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,787
- You saw him hit me, right?
- Yeah, he rear-ended you, man. It sucks.

110
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,930
You be my witness for insurance?

111
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,595
- You would do that?
- Sure. Yeah. I guess I could do that.

112
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,866
- Yeah.
- Give me your number.

113
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,604
You know, I tell you,
I'm always on the road.

114
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,481
Maybe we should just
exchange cell numbers.

115
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,917
- Otherwise, you know, we'll
probably never hook up.
- Yeah. Okay.

116
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,589
It's always the ones that don't
give a shit about their cars...

117
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,649
- that run into yours.
- You don't have to tell me.

118
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,087
I'm Armin Chorekian.

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,699
- Cletis van Damme.
- Thank you for your help.

120
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,495
I call you.

121
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,864
Cletis van Damme?

122
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,741
There's nothing major
going on right now.

123
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,972
Streets are up for grabs, and there's not
one gang case in the last 24 hours...

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,037
- we can sink our teeth into?
- Sorry.

125
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,840
Hey, what's the rush?

126
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,880
The chief's evaluating our unit.

127
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,678
We have to appear busy
and irreplaceable.

128
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,414
I know Dutch is working
on a homicide from this morning.

129
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,091
I don't know the details.

130
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,560
Uh, Dutch-boy,
what are you workin' on?

131
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,861
Claudette's ex-husband
was shot and killed.

132
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,364
Her daughter Bonnie
witnessed the whole thing.

133
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,630
<i>Oh, man. What happened?</i>

134
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,572
They were sitting in a car,
black male walked up, said something...

135
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,142
then just shot the guy
ran away.

136
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,802
<i>- It's a gang thing?
- I don't know...</i>

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,278
and Bonnie's been
too upset to talk to.

138
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,316
<i>I still don't know
why she and her dad were there.</i>

139
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,282
Let me work the gang angle.
See if there's anything there.

140
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,218
Great. I'll make a copy
of my notes up till now.

141
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,994
If he's in here,
I'll recognize him.

142
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,198
There are a lot of pictures
in there, so take your time.

143
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,463
You need to take a break
to eat, anything, just ask, okay?

144
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,632
Okay.

145
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,808
You do me a favor.
You see him in there, you tell me first.

146
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,710
- Don't say anything to Dutch, okay?
- Why?

147
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,609
Because there are
a lot of ways to make a case...

148
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,977
and being a star eyewitness at a murder trial
doesn't have to be your first option.

149
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,114
Not with the kind of guy
who did this.

150
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,978
- This is Dad we're talking about.
- I know.

151
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,623
I don't care what I have to do.

152
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,427
I know you feel that way right now,
but I'm only watching out for you.

153
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,861
God, Mom.
I can't believe you.

154
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,637
I'm not talking about
letting whoever did this go free.

155
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,232
I just don't want you to get into
something you can't get out of later.

156
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,637
If you see him in there,
you tell me first.

157
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,774
I hear you called Julien's house.

158
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,214
Told his little boy
that he was gay?

159
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,354
- I think you got the wrong guys.
- I got the right assholes.

160
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,687
The both of you have been shooting your
mouths off about how much fun you're having.

161
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,527
I got no problem with someone
being gay out there, but in here I...

162
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,358
If it's so cool, why doesn't he just
come out and say it?

163
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,858
Why is he lying
about who he is?

164
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,092
I'm putting you both on notice.

165
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,068
Fun's over, or I end it myself.

166
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,169
- Herman, what do you got?
- Something.

167
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,782
But what's in it for my boys?

168
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:46,411
We lay off that gambling joint
you're running near MacArthur Park.

169
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,148
- What gambling joint?
- The one in the back
of Morty's Sporting Goods.

170
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,988
Oh, that one. Okay.

171
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,762
So you all heard
of the E-ParkJohnnies?

172
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,629
<i>- Not recently. They still kicking around?
- They still breathing.</i>

173
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,170
<i>With Armadillo and the Torrucos out
of business, everything is opening up out there.</i>

174
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,035
The Johnnies are looking to get back
on top of the bangers heap.

175
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,301
Good luck.

176
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,500
Jesus Christ, Herman, pick that up.
Pick it up!

177
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,245
Hey, sorry, man.
Strictly for medicinal purposes.

178
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,748
So what does the Johnnies
trying to bring back the glory days...

179
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,716
have to do with some dad
getting shot in his car?

180
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,825
All I heard was the Johnnies were bragging
about throwing some kind of April Fool's party.

181
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,453
- April Fool's party?
- Yeah, that's all I heard, man.

182
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,462
<i>- Bonnie.
- Yes?</i>

183
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,227
<i>- Hi, I'm Detective Mackey.
- Hi. Tavon Garris.</i>

184
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,195
<i>- Hi.
- I'm sorry about your father.</i>

185
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,133
- Thank you.
- I just have one question for you.

186
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,775
<i>The shooter...he said something
to your dad before he fired?</i>

187
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,574
<i>Yes. I...I couldn't hear him very well.
The window was up.</i>

188
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,305
<i>Did it sound like,
"Johnny says April Fool's"?</i>

189
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,348
It was something
like that, yeah.

190
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,284
I couldn't hear it clear, but...
What does that mean?

191
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,356
<i>Bonnie?</i>

192
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,693
- What are you doing?
- Answering his questions.

193
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,326
He's not involved in this case.

194
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,676
Look, 10 years ago,
the E-ParkJohnnies...

195
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,701
were the predominant
gang in Farmington.

196
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,946
They controlled drugs,
sex, everything.

197
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,073
Until the Mexicans
started outnumbering them.

198
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,576
Compton gangs started moving in,
squeezed the Johnnies right out.

199
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,754
I talked to my
old partner, Joe Clarke.

200
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,917
He says the E-ParkJohnnies
used to throw what they called
April Fool's parties.

201
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,188
What are those?

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,862
Every year they tally up how many
members got killed out on the street...

203
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,558
then they get the whole membership
together, and they pick dominoes.

204
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,125
- Dominoes?
- Yeah. You pick the right one...

205
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,036
you get to be one of
the shooters.

206
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,698
- Who'd they shoot?
- Didn't matter. Walk right up to 'em...

207
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,536
<i>and say, "Johnny says April Fool's,"
boom... they'd shoot 'em.</i>

208
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,677
And, uh, that's what your daughter
heard the shooter say this morning.

209
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,440
<i>The April Fool's parties dried up
about 10 years ago...</i>

210
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,278
but looks like
they're back on.

211
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,920
Thanks for the tip.
Dutch'll take care of it.

212
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,455
- Is there a problem with
us helping or something?
- No, it doesn't concern you.

213
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,785
Dutch will take care of it.

214
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,801
Run the gang database for Johnnies
that were killed in the last year...

215
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,598
and get a current address
for their leader.

216
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,162
Uh, street name's Lops.

217
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,408
- Lops?
- He's got a lopsided head.

218
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:25,206
- I don't know his real tag.
- All right. I'm working it.

219
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,881
- You lost him?
- He got in a fender bender
right in front of us.

220
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,656
- We're his witnesses.
- You gotta be shittin' me.

221
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,090
<i>Once he saw our faces and our ride,
we couldn't stay too close.</i>

222
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,095
We stayed back for a while,
tried to follow him. We lost him.

223
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,597
<i>Everything's ready, and you tell me
we still don't know where to go?</i>

224
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,393
We got his cell number.
Maybe we can trace it.

225
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,906
<i>- Not without a warrant.
- Yeah, and it's a trail we can't leave.</i>

226
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,609
Where's Radiohead's
crib these days?

227
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,517
<i>Radiohead?</i>

228
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,086
- Ugh!
- Oh, my God! What, did he die in here?

229
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,891
<i>Radiohead,
show us your ass!</i>

230
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,026
Hey, put the gun down!

231
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,532
I told you guys to stop
barging in on me like this.

232
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,234
God, man! When was the last time
you took a shower?

233
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:29,170
- The water got shut off last month.
- Ever heard of a sponge bath?

234
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,744
- I'm boycotting all things French.
- We got tracer software.

235
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,781
<i>We know you trace cell phones for
the Baja Diablo cartel.</i>

236
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,215
- You pick 'em right out of the air, right?
- Yeah.

237
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,253
We need a location
on a cell phone.

238
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:44,381
I can pull the cell
phones off the towers...

239
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,227
<i>but if he's not transmitting, I won't be
able to triangulate his exact location.</i>

240
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,991
We'll settle for an approximate.
Ronnie's gonna run the numbers.

241
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,892
The rest of us are headed for
fresh air.

242
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,301
That's really nice, you sending your fag
hag partner to fight your battles.

243
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,168
- I'm working.
- How come you lied to us about who you are?

244
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,371
How are we supposed to trust you with
our lives if you're gonna lie like that, Julien?

245
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,851
I'll do my job. You do yours.

246
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:15,218
You know what bothers me the most?
Is that you're a hypocrite.

247
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,347
You gave that faggot a blanket party, knowing
you'd like to be under the blanket with him.

248
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,194
You call my son again,
and I'll kill you.

249
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,662
You know, maybe I should've called
Social Services.

250
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,532
See if that kid
still has his cherry.

251
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,329
You understand me?
Call him again, and I'll kill you.

252
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,409
You think you could do
this job by yourself, huh?

253
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,544
You don't need backup?
'Cause they're never gonna show up.

254
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,416
<i>- I want to see a show, man!
- Easy.</i>

255
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,222
What's wrong?

256
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,968
Maybe, uh, Jeff's murder...

257
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:07,064
wasn't part of some gangland
April Fool's prank.

258
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,475
Bonnie's being, uh, vague...

259
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,909
about what they were doing
in that neighborhood.

260
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,845
That area's a known drug market.

261
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,846
<i>Stop right there.</i>

262
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,818
<i>I did some checking on Jeff.</i>

263
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,252
<i>He had a bit of a rough go of it
after your divorce.</i>

264
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,215
A couple of dope charges.

265
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,656
Disturbing the peace.

266
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,285
Is there anything you wanna
tell me about him?

267
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,991
He had his demons.

268
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,433
None that deserved
to get him killed.

269
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,402
Okay.

270
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,709
Anything yet?

271
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,776
No.

272
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,343
Was your father doing something
down there he shouldn't have been?

273
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,946
<i>- Mom...
- Something to do with drugs?</i>

274
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,189
You always thought
the worst of him.

275
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,056
<i>- No, I didn't.
- You did.</i>

276
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,630
You don't remember.
You were very young.

277
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,294
Why didn't you tell me
you were in town?

278
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,198
Dad wanted to see me.

279
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,740
It was only for a couple of days.

280
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,343
I just didn't wanna be
running back and forth.

281
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,517
Did you find him?

282
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,591
His signal has appeared somewhere in
the sector between these three cell towers.

283
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,058
This is mostly
unoccupied industrial area.

284
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,963
- Same type of place as last time.
- That's gotta be where
the money train's pulling in.

285
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,931
Do some recon. See if the old plan
will work at the new site.

286
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,101
<i>Hey, I got that
crib address on Lops.</i>

287
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,008
<i>- I'll have a warrant within an hour.
- That's great.</i>

288
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,378
- What are y'all doin' in?
- Can't stay away from this
place, even on our day off.

289
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,281
I'll leave you two to your work.

290
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,122
- How long till you get down here?
- Soon, I promise.

291
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,226
Machado called. Your interview's
playing all over the tube.

292
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,592
- People are responding.
- But we were four points back just last night.

293
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,561
The exit polls are encouraging.

294
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,370
- How's Hispanic turnout?
- Better than expected.

295
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:21,999
Machado says we really have a chance, baby.
We really do.

296
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,901
Uh, I'll see you
as soon as I can.

297
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,946
- I love you, babe.
- Me too.

298
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,920
Randy. Come on in.

299
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,151
- Yeah?
- Hey. We found it.

300
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,923
It's almost identical
to our last site.

301
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,689
One way in, one way out.

302
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,096
Even has a Dumpster we can use.

303
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,999
- They're still settin' up.
- So it's doable?

304
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,333
- It's absolutely doable.
- Let me talk to him for a sec.

305
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,468
Hey, boss, look,
if they change locations...

306
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,303
maybe there's other aspects
they've changed too.

307
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,949
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

308
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,381
Look, it's right in our
comfort zone, Vic.

309
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,818
Okay. What's the vote, then?
I'm good.

310
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,457
<i>He wants a vote.
He's in, so am I.</i>

311
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,718
<i>- What about you two?
- Let's do it.</i>

312
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,428
- Okay.
- We're good to go.

313
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,246
Thanks for
inviting us in, Lops.

314
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,317
- You didn't get no invite!
- Sure we did.

315
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,819
I can back him up on that.

316
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,256
<i>- What you want, man?
- How are the Johnnies these days?</i>

317
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,529
Black is back.

318
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,588
You lost three of your Johnny bros
this year, huh?

319
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,896
And loved them all.

320
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,435
You like playing dominoes, Lops?

321
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,768
You're bringing back
the April Fool's parties, huh?

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,740
I got one man dead already.
A black man, by the way.

323
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,514
<i>When are you dumbasses gonna shoot up
Beverly Hills for a change, huh?</i>

324
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,075
<i>There are two more shooters
out there, aren't there?</i>

325
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,391
I don't see any
double threes here, Lops.

326
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,655
That's the magic
number this year, isn't it?

327
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,557
- Double threes for your three dead homies.
- Whatever, man.

328
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,798
Who are the shooters?

329
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,494
You better step off, man,
before I get my Cochrane involved.

330
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,333
You think we playing, Lop-head?

331
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,553
<i>Hey, come on, man. You ain't gonna
do nothin'with that.</i>

332
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:50,317
You know who your buddy
killed today, Lops?

333
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,786
Look, man, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

334
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,127
- That was the husband of a cop.
- A cop we work with, asshole.

335
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,321
She's a friend of mine,
and you...

336
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,296
- you killed her husband.
- No, man!

337
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,162
Goddamn!

338
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,365
You only got five more
wrong answers in you, boy.

339
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,342
<i>Now, who... are...
the shooters?</i>

340
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,844
The only thing worse than killing a cop
is killing a cop's loved one...

341
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,483
so you know I will
pull this trigger.

342
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,382
<i>We'll just write it down as another nigger
in the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

343
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,685
Mmm!

344
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,262
- Who are they?
- This is gonna be the one, Tavon. I can feel it.

345
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,489
Yeah, me too.

346
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,760
<i>I better get my raincoat.</i>

347
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,767
Okay! Okay! Okay, man!

348
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,340
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Just put the gun down.

349
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,806
<i>You put the gun down,
I'll play ball with you, all right?</i>

350
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,243
What happened with
you and Jackson?

351
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,245
Nothing we can't
handle ourselves, sir.

352
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,782
I know what's going on, Julien.
What you've been subjected to.

353
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,923
<i>I don't care about your personal life.
What I do care about is intolerance.</i>

354
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,018
If you have a complaint...

355
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,957
now is the time to lodge it.

356
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,790
Like I said, sir,
nothing I can't handle.

357
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,030
Okay, then.

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,482
Okay, they're here.
Do me a favor.

359
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,383
- Ask them if they can give you
a ride back to the barn.
- Is everything all right?

360
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,415
Oh, yeah, I just gotta be somewhere for
an hour. I'll check back in on you then.

361
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,129
Your partner's a goddamn psycho!

362
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,199
Yes, he is.

363
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,029
<i>Then you tell that
asshole he's too late.</i>

364
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,137
Too late for what?

365
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,039
<i>Charlie there's already at
the street fair right now.</i>

366
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,774
Too late, man.
Hey, you tell him that.

367
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,579
Yo, Tavon!

368
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,352
<i>- Yo!
- Go get my truck, quick.</i>

369
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,723
Let's go. You!
Come and take this man!

370
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,134
Find out where
there's a street fair in this area.

371
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,227
Get every unit.
We got a shooter down there.

372
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,773
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna be
running a little bit late.

373
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,878
You and Shane are gonna have to
start without me.

374
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,278
- How late? What are you talking about?
- I can't explain right now.

375
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,781
- What's he sayin'?
- He might not be makin' it.

376
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,783
Are you serious? Vic, we'll never
get this chance again.

377
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,684
- Please!
- Put Shane on.

378
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,530
- Vic, what's going on?
- I'm gonna make it.

379
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,293
You're just gonna have to start
the plan without me.

380
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,233
- What if you get stuck or something?
- You can still do it.

381
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,101
- No. No way. Not without you.
- You planned for three. You still got three.

382
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,673
- That's when you were one of the three.
- You could still do this.

383
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,405
I trust you.
I'll be there when I can.

384
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,083
I'm driving.

385
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,981
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

386
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,990
What three-person plan?

387
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,530
- You were ready to do this without me?
- You always had reservations.

388
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,702
It was only Plan "B."

389
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,034
<i>- Fine. Let's go with Plan "B" then.
- I don't know.</i>

390
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,896
Until we see if Vic's gonna make it,
it's too risky.

391
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,033
We don't get on the inside now, the whole
thing will be ruined, even if Vic does show up.

392
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,772
- All right, I vote we go now.
- Me too.

393
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,980
Okay, we're looking for the guy on
the right. Pass it around. He's armed.

394
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,520
Follow me. Come on.

395
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,894
Fan out. Fan out.

396
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,930
Take that way inside.

397
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,868
<i>Guys, come on!</i>

398
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,458
Double threes.

399
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,423
- Take him!
- Take him.

400
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,664
Don't move. Don't move.

401
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,306
- That's not bad for a day's work, huh?
- Yeah.

402
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,245
Hey, listen.
You could do me a favor.

403
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,975
- I gotta be somewhere.
- I'll take care of the paperwork.

404
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,440
Thanks.

405
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,957
Only two more vans to go.

406
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,261
<i>What's this?</i>

407
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,798
<i>What the hell
are they talkin'about?</i>

408
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,774
What, like I speak
European hick?

409
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,676
<i>Goddamn it.
What the hell is goin'on?</i>

410
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,951
Oh, Jesus Christ.

411
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,120
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

412
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,850
Holy sh...

413
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,694
<i>- What do we do now?
- I gotta stop Ronnie.</i>

414
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,466
Maybe the best thing to do
is just stick to the plan.

415
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,639
We don't even know
if Vic's made it yet.

416
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:58,166
- And I'm callin' Ronnie off.
- Look, they got sidearms. We got rifles, man.

417
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,007
No. The whole plan
was no bloodshed.

418
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,410
It's all screwed up now.
Oh, Christ.

419
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,210
Look, it's not their money. They're not gonna
die for it, okay? We can do this.

420
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,286
Look, I'm not gettin'
you two killed.

421
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,319
- Goddamn it!
- What?

422
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,493
There's no reception.
I gotta get a signal.

423
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,656
Will you stop movin' around, man?
They're gonna see us.

424
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,194
Hey, listen, there isn't
cell service here, remember?

425
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,896
We're in the black hole.
That's how we found this place.

426
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:31,240
Sir, I need to talk to you about
Jackson and Carlson.

427
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,274
Is this about the fight with Julien?

428
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,642
Yeah, and the homophobic flyers
and the gay bashing.

429
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,808
<i>- They're behind all of that.
- I talked to Julien. He didn't mention names.</i>

430
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,618
Right. Look, I'm not a rat, sir...

431
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,555
but those guys have been making noises
about not backing us up on the street.

432
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,319
I mean, that's Julien's life and that's
my life. I'm not gonna let that pass.

433
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,688
Thank you for
mentioning it to me.

434
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,164
Since you're here,
I need to talk to you.

435
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,632
You know that the chief's
put together a list...

436
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,102
<i>- and we've gotta cut 20% of the force.
- You're kidding me.</i>

437
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,073
Your name's on the list.

438
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,176
<i>Armadillo's death in the cage.</i>

439
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,119
I got suspended for that. I paid
the price. You're firing me for it?

440
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,855
It's the chief's call.

441
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,526
I'm sorry.

442
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,937
Have you talked to Vic and the Strike
Team about how that guy got the knife?

443
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,778
<i>- I've heard the rumors.
- Yeah?</i>

444
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:43,839
Who's looking into it while my career's
being flushed down the goddamn toilet?

445
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,174
Right now... nobody.

446
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,342
Here's Ronnie.

447
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:15,472
- He must have heard the shots.
- Ohh, oh, this is not good.

448
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,810
- Where is Vic?
- We gotta do this now,
before he's hung out to dry.

449
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:25,290
Look, I'm gonna take the guy
with the MP-5.

450
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,418
You take the skinny guy with the beanie
and the blowgun.

451
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,092
Come on, man.
We gotta do this now.

452
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,299
On the goddamn ground!

453
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,064
<i>- Get down right now!
- Get down!</i>

454
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,003
Everybody down now!

455
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,675
Get your ass down! Down!

456
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,837
Get on the ground!

457
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,815
Get down! Get down there!

458
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,918
<i>- You good? You clear?
- Clear!</i>

459
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,520
Goddamn it, this guy's hurt.

460
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,885
<i>- Face down!
- Oh, shit. It's the last van.</i>

461
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,620
Guys, don't move,
don't move. Do not...

462
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,696
Okay.

463
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,331
Go. Go get him!

464
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,506
Don't move!

465
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,379
- Stay right there! Hands on the wheel!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

466
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,532
Thank God
you made it, man.

467
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,296
What the hell happened here?
We got dead bodies?

468
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,338
It wasn't us.
They turned on each other.

469
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,636
Ronnie heard the shots.
The whole thing went down a van early.

470
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,041
Jesus!

471
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,646
- We gotta go. If anybody heard those shots...
- We also got a wounded Armenian.

472
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,144
<i>If this guy doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna bleed out and die.</i>

473
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,112
That's not our problem.
We didn't shoot him.

474
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,920
Now let's load up
and get the hell outta here.

475
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,683
<i>Yeah, so we didn't shoot him,
but we can save him.</i>

476
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,181
I don't want that blood
on my conscience.

477
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,323
Me either. We better hurry.
Let's go.

478
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,007
- Do you want to live or die?
- Live. Please.

479
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,103
Well, then, you listen
very carefully, Dach.

480
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,310
- We're gonna get you to the doctor.
- Thank you.

481
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,574
Then we're gonna stop by your house
and hide some of this money...

482
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,219
and since you're the only guy
who's gonna be missing from here...

483
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:39,622
your buddies are gonna figure that we took
care of you because you were our inside man.

484
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,921
They'll come looking for you...

485
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,028
and the only thing they'll find
at your house is their stolen cash.

486
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,223
And then they'll know
you were the one...

487
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,965
who tipped us off
about the money train.

488
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,670
- I don't even know who you are.
- Well, that's gonna be our little secret.

489
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:58,265
Once you get fixed up, you're running
away, Dach, and never coming back.

490
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,842
Yes. Just get me help, please.

491
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,609
Do you see the man
that shot your father?

492
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,024
- What?
- If this goes to trial...

493
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,534
I don't want Bonnie being a witness...

494
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,195
in a gang killing.

495
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,239
Understand?

496
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,508
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

497
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,864
If I were to question these men...

498
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,330
any idea who I should
start with first?

499
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,944
I'd start with number two.

500
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,587
<i>You and your two friends...</i>

501
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,954
You all drew the double-three dominoes.
We found one on each of you.

502
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,685
Two of you didn't kill anyone,
but one of you did.

503
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,092
I don't know nothin'
about no killin'.

504
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,821
Okay, we'll see who your two friends
point the finger at...

505
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,830
'cause one of you is going to jail.

506
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,797
<i>Hang up!</i>

507
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,597
I don't want to go to jail
for something I didn't do...

508
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:38,776
<i>just 'cause one of them
said I did.</i>

509
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,210
Then put someone else there.
I don't care who.

510
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,509
It was Mouser.
He did it.

511
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,454
Hey.

512
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,184
<i>- Make it in time?
- Where?</i>

513
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,522
<i>- Wherever you were going.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

514
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,258
Just an errand.

515
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,492
Got it handled.
No biggie.

516
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,604
Anything happen around here?

517
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,834
We got the other two domino shooters
without any other killings.

518
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,007
- Dutch is upstairs sorting them out.
- Sweet.

519
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,110
Anything else happening?

520
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,804
<i>Nah. Other than that,
it's been quiet.</i>

521
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,973
Good.

522
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,410
- What's up?
- I just got fired.

523
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,955
- What?
- Yeah. My name's on the casualty list.

524
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,515
- Any guesses why?
- Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

525
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,587
You're the one that's always talking about
your boys being such stand-up guys...

526
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,666
You and I both know that my name
doesn't belong on that list.

527
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,894
Let's see how much of
a stand-up guy you really are.

528
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,580
<i>- What?
- You fired Danny?</i>

529
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:53,209
- The chief's office did.
- She doesn't deserve that.
You got to do something.

530
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,049
Armadillo died because Danny
didn't properly pat down the prisoner.

531
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,916
- Ah...
- Unless you have something
to share with the chief...

532
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,182
this conversation's over.

533
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,816
Do you?
Or are you a coward?

534
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,098
Too bad.

535
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,431
She was a good officer.

536
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,672
It was Mouser.
He did it.

537
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,753
Ohh, man!

538
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:31,381
I can't believe
he'd just give me up like that.

539
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,451
- I didn't do it.
- You ready to give him up?

540
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,794
He killed that man.

541
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,558
He wanted to be the first one
of the three of us.

542
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,530
Real important to him.

543
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,329
How do I know you're the one
telling the truth?

544
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,908
Yo, I fill you in
on where he hides his gun.

545
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,677
- I hear we got the shooters upstairs.
- Looks like it.

546
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,719
Well, not to pat myself
on the back or anything...

547
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,127
Results don't excuse bad behavior.

548
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,198
Tell you what.

549
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,701
It's clear you and I
have some issues...

550
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,943
so why don't we agree just not to work
with each other anymore.

551
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:29,447
The question isn't whether
I can work with you.

552
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:32,644
It's how you're gonna handle
working for me.

553
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,981
You?

554
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,356
Me.

555
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,700
Fired for cause.

556
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,639
Fired for cause.

557
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,512
This is bullshit!

558
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,980
They're gonna have the most P.C.,
useless force in the country.

559
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,373
Julien gets outed
and throws a bitch-fit...

560
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,710
and we take the fall
for some friendly ribbing?

561
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,222
Maybe they just don't get
your sophisticated brand of humor.

562
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:14,521
You trying to tell me this place is better off
with him than the three of us?

563
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,462
Don't put me in your corner.
I didn't deserve what I got.

564
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,909
I have prepared two speeches
for this evening.

565
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,583
I hope I get to use the one
in my left pocket.

566
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,155
But whatever happens, win or lose...

567
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,121
I thank you all.

568
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,760
Your support
has been a blessing.

569
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,089
To my lovely wife, Aurora...

570
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,027
<i>te amo.</i>

571
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,895
<i>Tu eres mi estrella brillante.</i>

572
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,468
Danny.

573
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,241
<i>This isn't fair.</i>

574
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,350
No, it's not.

575
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,487
Look, um...

576
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,489
I can't tell you...

577
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,150
<i>how much I... I've
learned from you.</i>

578
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,695
Well, here's one last thing...

579
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,395
You watch your back
around these people, okay?

580
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,692
- Any sign of Armenians yet?
- Nope.

581
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,132
<i>- How's our bleeder?
- Dropped him off at a clinica.</i>

582
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,339
Backroom doc's sewing him up
as we speak.

583
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:11,331
Our bleeder's gonna make it,
and he's gonna shake out of town.

584
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,736
Good. Let's finish this.

585
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,413
Although statewide turnout has been
somewhat lower than average...

586
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,044
<i>- How deep you wanna bury this?
- Not very.</i>

587
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,718
These transplants from Brighton Beach
are more beach than bright.

588
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,753
<i>In the city council races...
- Hey.</i>

589
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,688
<i>District three is reporting in now
with 89% of the vote.</i>

590
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,589
Nah, nah. A little more clever
than that, okay?

591
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,462
<i>The fifth district is still tight,
with Elliot Orlon edging closer...</i>

592
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,068
<i>to incumbent
Barnard Fortain.</i>

593
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,706
<i>Hey. This is good.</i>

594
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,469
<i>Police Captain David Aceveda
won a tight primary race...</i>

595
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,407
<i>against challenger Karen Mitchell
to become that district's...</i>

596
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,949
<i>first Hispanic
Democratic candidate for council.</i>

597
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,417
<i>And since the district
is 82% Democrat...</i>

598
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,023
it's a safe bet that Aceveda
will soon be the first elected...

599
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,124
Hispanic representative
on the council...

600
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,486
from the Farmington District
of Los Angeles.

601
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,256
- I thought he was gonna lose.
- He was supposed to.

602
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,467
What does that mean?

603
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:12,027
<i>It means Aceveda isn't gonna be gone
as fast as we thought.</i>

604
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,497
And six months from now,
he's gonna be our boss's boss.

605
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,909
<i>I can always tell
when you're lying to me.</i>

606
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,973
<i>No, you always
thought you could.</i>

607
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,014
What were you and your father doing
on that street today?

608
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,762
There's a flower store there.

609
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,560
He wanted to go in
and pick up some flowers.

610
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,468
For Jenny...

611
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,507
<i>his fiancée.</i>

612
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,647
Jeff was engaged?

613
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:59,946
- What... Why didn't you...
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

614
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,156
Dad told me once...

615
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,319
<i>how much you liked it
when he surprised you with flowers.</i>

616
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,560
He really got his life together.

617
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,197
He was... happy.

618
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,107
He was waiting for the right time
for us to tell you.

619
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,409
Oh, what was stopping you?

620
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,008
I don't know. You just...

621
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,878
seem lonely...

622
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,919
lately.

623
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,459
I'm just glad nothing
happened to you.

624
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,900
I lost my partner.
That's not nothing.

625
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,405
I know. Thank you, baby.

626
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,440
I hope she's okay.

627
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,341
Thank you, sweetheart.
We'll do what we can for her.

628
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,875
Um, let's talk
about this later, okay?

629
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,976
<i>No!</i>

630
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,534
I would've called. I just didn't have
the new number.

631
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,470
You can't be here. Uh, tell Shane
not to come back either.

632
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,673
I didn't send him.
He shouldn't have done that. Please.

633
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,588
Thanks.

634
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,995
We're not supposed to be
talking like this. You should go.

635
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,727
I know. Uh, I won't come back again
without permission.

636
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,896
I just was so worried about the kids,
spending time with them. I...

637
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,970
I got lost somewhere
in all this.

638
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,239
I never meant to hurt you
the way that I have.

639
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,078
I'm so sorry about that.

640
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,850
I want you to know,
uh...

641
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,327
you're gonna be taken care of.

642
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,194
The kids?

643
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,098
They don't have anything
to worry about either.

644
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,867
Tell 'em I love 'em.

645
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,773
<i>And, uh...</i>

646
