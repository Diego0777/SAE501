00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,948
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:15,449
Sir, what's the problem?

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:16,783
My dick. Please...

4
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,827
You're caught
in a rat trap.

5
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:20,036
I've got lupus.

6
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,908
I've had it for 15 years.

7
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,169
Don't move her.
Call the paramedics.

8
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,630
Why didn't you tell me Sadie
has a history of mental illness?

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,175
I made a life for myself.
You been missing me?

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,384
Ex-wife.

11
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,884
I wasn't worth taking care of,
and now I'm not worth shit!

12
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,848
I want to go home!

13
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,808
At least we found
his weak spot.

14
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:45,055
Shit, go!

15
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,941
You! You're under arrest...
for possession

16
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:52,360
of heroin
with intent to distribute.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,947
The price is simple. I help you
put away these four fine young men,

18
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:59,201
you make sure you put
them away right here.

19
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:02,045
You send Lem to Lompoc,
it's you that's the real murderer.

20
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,593
I had a conversation
with Antwon Mitchell.

21
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:04,827
You're bluffin'.

22
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,125
You don't have the stomach
to serve Lem up to Antwon.

23
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:08,919
I didn't used to.

24
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,594
Shit.

25
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,091
Morning.

26
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:49,328
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- Welcome home.

27
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,600
- You don't look so good.
- I'm not talking to you.

28
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,028
It's a social call.

29
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:02,396
You're lucky having
a friend like Mr. Holvis.

30
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:05,182
Smithen Holvis.

31
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:07,941
Your good buddy who posted your bail.

32
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,791
- Smitty.
- This is funny.

33
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,400
He doesn't remember you
that well either.

34
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:12,562
Just get out, man.

35
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,467
You know, when I find out how Vic
and the other two got that bail money,

36
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:22,000
they're gonna wish that they had
a friend like your friend Smitty.

37
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,300
Jesus! Is that blood?

38
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,634
You need a doctor?

39
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,133
Just get the hell out!

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,868
Just get out!

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,334
Heard you had
a rough week,

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,968
so I told Jon I'd stop
by and check in on you.

43
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,767
The sun will rise
in the west

44
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,734
the day that man cares
whether I live or die.

45
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,267
Well, he did the same
thing for me with my ex.

46
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:04,033
Did more for her
than he did for me.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,133
Sounds like you guys
are close.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,067
We've been spending a lot
of time together, actually,

49
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,300
On account of the job.

50
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:16,167
But Jon's kinda tough
to figure out.

51
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:22,367
Consider yourself fortunate.

52
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,367
He didn't tell me, uh...
you have kids?

53
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:28,534
Family wasn't on
Jon's "to do"list.

54
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,868
Just as well.
Easier to move on.

55
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:30,901
You want coffee?

56
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,133
Uh, water's fine.

57
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,367
So how does it work,
you and the ex?

58
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,601
Good and bad.

59
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:42,634
But I look out for her,

60
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,133
make sure she gets
what she needs.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,567
At least you guys
have a connection.

62
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,601
For better or worse.

63
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,334
You're not what
I expected.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,701
The truth is
I didn't have a clue

65
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,868
what sort of woman
Jon would have married.

66
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,501
Neither did he.

67
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,601
He still doesn't.

68
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,601
Just like him to send
somebody else over

69
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,834
to carry my emotional
baggage.

70
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,534
Tell the prick
I'm great.

71
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,133
Hey, it's tough
to be a cop's wife.

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,868
Jon's wife is the job.

73
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,767
It's what keeps him
warm at night.

74
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:24,968
Is there some other message
you'd like me to give him?

75
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,067
Sure.

76
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,801
Whoa. Whoa.

77
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:34,334
What about Jon?

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,133
When Jon left me,
he made his choice.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,834
I'll make mine.

80
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,534
Hey. Where you been?

81
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,934
I had an ex-wife thing.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,501
What'd you need us here for?

83
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:14,267
Not her, me.

84
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,934
I'm gonna
take a deal.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,100
Just listen.

86
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,601
If I plead guilty
to the heroin thing,

87
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,334
this all seals off.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,501
Without me, Kavanaugh's
got nothing else.

89
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,200
He's got nothing
on you guys.

90
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,767
We're not feeding you
to Antwon.

91
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,367
Lompoc's an idle threat.

92
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,767
The judge will
most likely place him

93
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,534
in a medium security
facility.

94
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,801
Kavanaugh's not gonna let
you skate with some cush deal.

95
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:36,601
He's got Emolia's testimony,
man. He wants years!

96
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,367
He's got the brass
behind him.

97
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,734
Not anymore.
O.I.G. and the chief,

98
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:42,133
they're losing confidence
in Kavanaugh's investigation.

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,601
D.A.'s receptive.

100
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,200
I plead guilty to theft
under color of authority,

101
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,467
they'll drop the intent
to distribute charge.

102
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,467
No!

103
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,067
5 years. Up for parole
in 18 months.

104
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:56,400
If you plead guilty,
it's your badge,

105
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,100
it's your pension.

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,534
We're talking prison.

107
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,234
18 months isn't a week.

108
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,467
I know.

109
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:05,601
Don't do it!

110
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,367
Don't do it, man!
We're fighting this, man!

111
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,334
I don't wanna
fight anymore.

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,200
I don't wanna fight
anymore, all right?

113
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:18,033
If you were in my place,
you'd take the hit...

114
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,534
to protect me,
the team.

115
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:25,868
I know you would.

116
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:33,914
OF MICE AND LEM

117
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:35,968
Look, no matter what we do,
end of the day,

118
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,400
Kavanaugh's still got
a brick of tar.

119
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,697
He's still got
Emolia's word.

120
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:40,897
You heard Becca.

121
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:42,031
The chief's losing
faith.

122
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,864
I'm working on
discrediting this guy.

123
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,864
So I.A.D. brings in
someone else.

124
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,331
They still have
the same brick.

125
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,864
I'm doing time
no matter what.

126
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,797
This way,
I got some control.

127
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:53,364
Look, I'm just so tired of not
knowing what's gonna happen,

128
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:55,830
worrying about
the rest of you.

129
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,563
I gotta see an end.

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,031
Jesus Christ, man!

131
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,764
I gotta get back inside
and talk to Becca.

132
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:05,897
Let us know
if anything breaks.

133
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,830
All right.

134
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:10,697
For him to get out
in 18 months,

135
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,398
he's gonna have to be
a model inmate.

136
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,131
That's not gonna happen.

137
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,264
Protective custody's
a joke.

138
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:19,530
He's gonna be fightin' for
his life the full 5 years.

139
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:20,964
What the hell
is he thinking?

140
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,597
Between Kavanaugh
spinning doom

141
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,197
and Becca selling him
a rose garden,

142
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,997
the poor guy doesn't
know what end is up.

143
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,964
Or he's taking the deal
because he knows

144
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,431
eventually Kavanaugh's
gonna get him to crack.

145
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,064
I'm off to Lompoc.

146
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,064
I was beginning to think that you
didn't have love for me anymore.

147
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,297
I was getting
a little jealous,

148
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:51,297
you spending so much
time with another cop.

149
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:55,197
Oh. Yeah, Kavanaugh's
an intense cat, isn't he?

150
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,997
Shame about Lemansky, man.

151
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:01,231
But you do know that blondie
will end up in my backyard.

152
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:03,964
We don't know
anything yet.

153
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,164
And if Lem does do time,

154
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,830
he's not gonna
land here.

155
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:09,563
I've got a real big backyard.

156
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,964
And wherever he lands,

157
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,398
I decide his quality
of life.

158
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,164
But that's why you're here.

159
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,264
You need something,
same as I do.

160
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,398
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have sent

161
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:24,031
that little black breezy
to find me.

162
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:29,331
Truth is Antwon Mitchell's
the answer to all your prayers.

163
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:32,498
Lemansky's guardian angel.

164
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:36,331
You see, we have
a relationship, you and me.

165
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,331
That relationship's
had its ups and downs,

166
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,730
but it's still
a relationship.

167
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,730
You make me drive all the way
out here for couple's counseling

168
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,530
or you got something
to say?

169
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,398
The Niners have taken
a serious hit

170
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:53,431
since my incarceration.

171
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:56,764
Halpern's been running
them under the radar,

172
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,364
until this black-brown
shitstorm plays itself out.

173
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,730
That cranky black bitch is
afraid of his own goddamn shadow.

174
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:05,930
I've got some serious
old-school weight coming in.

175
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:07,930
Kern Little.

176
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,997
I knew Kern's rap career
was in the dollar bin.

177
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,031
I didn't know he was
back in colors.

178
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,830
Eventually,
they all come home.

179
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:23,764
And Kern, he's eager to help
me with my cash-flow problem.

180
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,864
I've got to hand out a lot
of turkeys at Thanksgiving.

181
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,364
There's a warehouse
on ridge road,

182
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:35,431
a place where they're storing
what's left of the seized assets.

183
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:42,197
You want me to rip off
a P.D. warehouse?

184
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,697
Of course not.

185
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:46,331
Kern's already put
together a team for that.

186
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:51,530
You just gotta come up with a plan
on how and when to get my guys in.

187
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:54,097
Walk Kern and his
second, Moses, through it.

188
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,764
That's more than an escort.

189
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,597
That's a hooker
and a hand-job.

190
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:02,897
Hey. That's the price for my
guarantee that Lemansky stays alive.

191
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,064
Stand back.
Nothing to see here.

192
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,164
Jesus!
His dick's gone.

193
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,530
Somebody find it.

194
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,930
Jogger called it in.
No I.D.

195
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:19,064
- Gunshot?
- No.

196
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:22,331
There's a rat trap
in one of the stalls.

197
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:25,197
I was real careful not
to disturb the crime scene.

198
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:26,997
Good thinking. You
wanna get that on ice.

199
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:28,197
Send it with him
to the hospital.

200
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,297
It's not gonna matter if
we don't get him stabilized.

201
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,498
We need to move now.

202
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,264
Let's get
a canvass going.

203
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,997
The same M.O. as that attack
a couple of weeks ago.

204
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,597
The suspect was male,
caucasian, thirties.

205
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,431
Well, let's not rule
anyone out yet.

206
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:41,498
In a world of men,

207
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,297
the thoughts even
crossed my mind.

208
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:44,398
Serrated teeth,

209
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:46,398
Interlocking,
no less.

210
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:49,064
This is a lot more gothic than
the last glory-hole attack.

211
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,297
Did you talk
to the hospital?

212
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:51,597
The victim's
still unconscious.

213
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,597
He sustained a head
injury when he passed out.

214
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:54,797
He's in pretty
rough shape.

215
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:55,964
So we have no way
of knowing

216
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,097
if and when he'll
be able to communicate.

217
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,964
Canvass turn up
anything?

218
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,064
Nothing so far.
So we got dick...

219
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:03,663
which is more than I can
say for the victim.

220
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,663
We need to get
the word out.

221
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,031
Bookstores, bathhouses,
bars,

222
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,697
anywhere this sort of
activity goes on.

223
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:12,264
Uh, we need to re-interview
the victim

224
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,364
of the first
glory-hole attack.

225
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,563
What's his name?

226
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,364
He gave us everything
that he had.

227
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,498
He never talked
to a detective.

228
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:19,398
It's Alarico Trujillo.

229
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:20,997
I'll write
his address down.

230
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,897
This Trujillo guy,
he's married, kids.

231
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,530
I told him I'd keep his name
out of it if he cooperated.

232
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:26,663
He held up his end.

233
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,997
This has escalated way beyond
a twisted prank.

234
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,530
He's our only
conscious witness.

235
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,231
We'll be discreet.

236
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,530
Thank you.

237
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,830
Is this thing even
remotely safe?

238
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:45,197
We make sure it is,
'cause we got no choice.

239
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,897
Antwon's the devil we know.

240
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,697
What it it's
the other devil?

241
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:49,897
Kavanaugh laying
a trap.

242
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,231
He's been cutting deals
with Antwon.

243
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:53,764
Maybe this is his last stab
before Lem seals us off.

244
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,031
No, this place
is wide open.

245
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,864
We can spot a surveillance
unit a mile away.

246
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,097
If Kavanaugh was
planning a sting,

247
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,264
this wouldn't
be the place.

248
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:00,464
Or he knows we would
think that.

249
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,864
We sniff out
every inch of this thing.

250
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,597
Triple check
every last detail.

251
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:06,331
We get on bad whiff,
we bail.

252
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:08,764
Hey, why don't
you crank it up?

253
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,031
Might still be some cops in
long beach who can't hear it.

254
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,264
Why don't you relax, Teeth.

255
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,131
I was hoping I'd never
see you in purple again.

256
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,697
I never took it off.
You know how that goes.

257
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,398
Yeah, I do.

258
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:23,431
This is my boy Moses.

259
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,364
Check 'em both.

260
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,764
Looking for this?

261
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,797
No. We got a little
bug problem lately.

262
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,364
You think we work
for the white law?

263
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,264
White law, black power,
it's all the same shit.

264
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,131
I just want to make sure
our visit stays anonymous.

265
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,331
They're clean.

266
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,431
No shit, captain cracker.
That's clever.

267
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,164
Can't understand why that
rap career didn't take off.

268
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,498
Hey! Hey! Hey!

269
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,997
Easy! Easy! Easy!

270
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,897
Now, what's your
goddamn problem?

271
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,231
Times change, man.

272
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:51,997
I don't trust you
or your ghost squad.

273
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,398
Well, the lack of love
is mutual.

274
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:55,431
Yeah, I see that.

275
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:58,730
You and Antwon?
Nothing like karma.

276
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,197
Hey! The favor
I have to do.

277
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,997
Taking mouth shit from
MC Has-Been, I don't!

278
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,131
Come on.
Come on, fellas.

279
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,597
Now, let's just put
this history on hold

280
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,997
and get this shit done, OK?

281
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:11,563
Let's go over it.

282
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,897
OK. There's one guard.

283
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,398
He spends most of his shift
at the gatehouse, here.

284
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:22,164
A guy of ours says the warehouse
is wall-to-wall cameras.

285
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,097
They feed into a bank
of monitors back at the gate.

286
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,730
The seizure locker's here.

287
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,031
Can't miss it,
right past the hummer.

288
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,764
There's antiques, TVs,
and a safe, a big one.

289
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,864
Mitchell was right.
We checked the inventory.

290
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,697
Over 500 grand
in watches and jewelry.

291
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,597
Yeah, and that's all
we go for.

292
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:39,364
No one drives out of there with
a hummer or a flat screen.

293
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,131
Yeah?

294
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:42,997
- Where are you?
- Why?

295
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,730
We need to talk.

296
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,730
Kavanaugh's
covering his bets

297
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:50,297
in case the criminal case
against you doesn't make.

298
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,164
What do you mean
"in case?"

299
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,864
Surprised this clown hasn't
gotten the hook already.

300
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,398
By acknowledging you failed to
clear the room when Terry was shot,

301
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,498
Kavanaugh's to characterize your earlier
statements as false and misleading.

302
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:03,864
That's bullshit.

303
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,398
I've told the truth
since day one.

304
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:07,964
Nothing I've said has changed
because the facts haven't.

305
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:11,398
Then he's doing a good job
of twisting your words.

306
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:14,097
It's not unconceivable that he
could cost you your retirement.

307
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:15,730
Where'd you hear that?

308
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:20,197
Your case was referred to the
police committee for review.

309
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:22,597
You let him try
to take my pension.

310
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,563
PBA reps will have
his head on a pike.

311
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,563
I wouldn't be so sure.

312
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,663
You know, Kavanaugh
could get this

313
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,997
as a face-saving way
to end his investigation.

314
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:33,630
Never mind prying a cop with a
sketchy jacket of the taxpayer's tit.

315
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,197
Anyway, we said we'd share.

316
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,464
I thought you'd want
the heads up.

317
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,031
Thanks.

318
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,663
Wait a minute.

319
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,297
Is Kavanaugh making any noise
around here about me?

320
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,097
All's been quiet
as it relates to you.

321
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,997
Undermining him
is a priority.

322
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:51,131
For both of us.

323
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,197
We'd like to speak
to Alarico Trujillo.

324
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,597
About a car accident he
witnessed a couple weeks back.

325
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:05,464
Policía.

326
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,331
Policía?

327
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:10,131
Uh, we have a few more
questions about that accident.

328
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:11,331
I told you people
everything.

329
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,563
You didn't tell me
about no car accident.

330
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,031
I got nothing
more to say.

331
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,097
There's been another driver
that's been very seriously injured.

332
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,830
It's important
you come with us.

333
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,730
Someplace private.

334
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,097
Look, man...

335
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:27,164
just leave me alone, OK?

336
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,464
We can do this another way
if we have to.

337
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:41,663
Pretty soon this is
gonna be a lonely room

338
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,364
filled with
empty lockers, huh?

339
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,964
You and me are the only
ones on the way out.

340
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,997
I just cut a deal
with the D.A.

341
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:51,398
What deal's that?

342
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,697
Why don't you ask
the chief?

343
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,164
It's sitting on his desk
waiting for his signature.

344
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,730
He'll be out
on parole

345
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,597
before the blood rushes
back to your face.

346
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,663
You don't mind
if I check the facts

347
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,031
before I pack my bags,
do you?

348
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:06,897
I don't give a shit
what you do.

349
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,597
Yeah. Thanks.

350
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,131
Chief's office hasn't even
seen the Lemansky deal yet.

351
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,930
His mouthpiece's is
feeding him a happy meal

352
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,197
to keep his spirits up.

353
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:24,563
Speaking of
happy meals,

354
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,663
did Vic bite on that intel
about me going after his pension?

355
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,364
You didn't see the steam
coming off his bald head?

356
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:33,797
Beautiful, man.

357
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,398
I so want there to be
trust between you two.

358
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,031
I need to use
your office.

359
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:43,064
Of course.
Anything I can do for you?

360
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,364
No. It's a police
matter.

361
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,663
Mi casa es su casa.

362
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:57,064
You gave us all a scare,
that spill you took.

363
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,464
Well, if you got
one of these,

364
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,231
there's plenty of...
bounce to the ounce.

365
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:04,864
Let me get to the point.

366
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,197
I've been made aware that you
have a serious medical condition,

367
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,197
one that could compromise your
ability to perform your duties.

368
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,164
You needed to disclose
a disease like lupus.

369
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,331
You didn't.

370
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,431
Because it was
a personal matter.

371
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,264
Supposed you had taken
that heathout in the field?

372
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,630
You could have put
other officers at risk.

373
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:19,864
But it didn't happen.

374
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,064
And I'm not here because
of how I knock down doors.

375
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:26,164
I'm ordering you to see a city
physician for a full medical review.

376
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:28,064
Until then, you're assigned
to desk duty.

377
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,597
Then let's get it done,
ASAP!

378
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,431
I've got plenty
of cases to clear.

379
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:38,064
I'm responsible for the health and
welfare of everyone working here.

380
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,364
Then maybe you ought
to do something

381
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:44,231
about the epidemic
of bullshit in this place.

382
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,197
Claudette, don't let
your frustrations get you in over--

383
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:49,498
This man Kavanaugh that you've
just given the place over to,

384
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:51,563
I understand he's got
an investigation to run,

385
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,830
but have you any idea
what he's doing to morale?

386
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,331
She's got
a point there.

387
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:57,563
I.A.D. is arrogant
and intrusive.

388
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,930
It's nature of the beast.

389
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:03,031
But this man takes intimidation
to a whole other level.

390
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:06,031
He's got every officer
in this place spooked.

391
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,697
They spend more time
looking over their shoulders

392
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:08,797
than they do
doing their jobs.

393
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:09,897
That's a fair
assessment.

394
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,164
Our last captain had
unpopular policies.

395
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:15,597
So you stuck us with an interim
jellyfish that won't rock the boat.

396
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,730
Then you cut resources
that we need to do the job.

397
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,764
Talk about putting
people at risk.

398
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,830
Crime stats are down
since I took over.

399
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,930
If you aren't out to lunch,
passing the buck,

400
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:30,197
or leaving every day at 4:00,

401
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:32,297
you'd know that our citizens
aren't reporting

402
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:33,730
half of what's going on
out there

403
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:38,498
because they know that
we can't or won't do anything.

404
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,131
If you want me to go
and pee in a cup,

405
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:43,797
I'll be happy
to fill it.

406
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:45,964
But I'm not
your problem.

407
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,997
Pretty loopy.

408
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:55,830
Maybe that's why
they call it lupus.

409
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:59,131
Look, I've been here
too long as it is.

410
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:00,331
My wife's gonna
get suspicious.

411
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:01,964
You have a perfectly
plausible cover story.

412
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:03,431
If you'd like me
to call and explain--

413
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,398
No. Please...

414
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:08,064
- Dutch.
- I just wanna go home.

415
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,930
Give me a second.
Sit down.

416
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:12,597
What'd the assistant
chief want?

417
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:15,864
I'm trying to comprehend
why you felt the need

418
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,131
to inform the department
that I have lupus.

419
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:21,997
What? I did nothing
of the kind.

420
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:24,764
The chief's office
is certainly up to speed.

421
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,897
Well, not from me.

422
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:26,964
You're the only one
who knew.

423
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,231
Obviously not.

424
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,830
Because of you,
I'm riding a desk.

425
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,897
Claudette,
you're not hearing me.

426
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,097
I have not spoken
to anyone about this.

427
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,764
You went to
the D.A.'s office before

428
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,997
To make a separate peace
behind my back, remember?

429
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,797
Oh, come on!

430
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:43,563
You don't believe me?

431
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,264
If you didn't
tell them that directly,

432
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,930
Then somebody
you told did.

433
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:50,597
Maybe that little latina wet dream
you've been pushing up against.

434
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:51,630
Maybe you gave her
a little bit of gossip

435
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:53,197
so you could show how
plugged in you are!

436
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,730
Hold on--
you've crossed the line

437
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,930
into wholesale character
assassination.

438
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,530
Career assassination
is a lot worse!

439
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,274
This is good.
This helps a lot.

440
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,407
I'll have an officer
give you a ride home.

441
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,107
I'll take a bus.

442
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,174
I don't want to be
getting out of a police car

443
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:14,141
in my neighborhood.

444
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,441
Captain?

445
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:16,874
What can I do for you?

446
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,573
Art Gadway, Los Angeles
gay men's initiative.

447
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,573
I'd like to talk
to whoever's in charge

448
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,107
about recent attacks
on members of our community.

449
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,740
Julien, come talk
to this guy

450
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,840
about the rat trap
glory-hole business, will you?

451
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,408
This is officer Lowe. He's been
with this since the beginning.

452
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,374
Um, we've been
interviewing witnesses.

453
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,940
In the meantime,
we're asking anyone

454
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,074
with any information
to contact us.

455
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,374
So basically you're waiting for
this sadist to turn himself in.

456
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,807
That would be
a wrong perception.

457
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:49,807
Well, your captain couldn't
wait to shuffle me off onto you.

458
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,241
And it's clear that you'd rather
be anywhere else than talking to me.

459
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,074
Instead of playing
the blame game,

460
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:58,974
why don't you help us get the
word out and distribute these?

461
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,041
I'm sure you people know
where the glory holes are

462
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,840
better than we do.

463
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,640
Are you aware that e there are
at least a half dozen attacks

464
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,874
we know of haven't
been reported?

465
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,874
Maybe those people knew
what they were doing was wrong.

466
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,940
Adults engaging in
consensual sex?

467
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,607
In public...
which is a crime.

468
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,540
Thank you for coming down
and registering your concerns.

469
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,607
I need your name
and badge number.

470
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,007
You need to keep
your hands off me.

471
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,441
Look, you and your buddies in
blue can hate all you want to,

472
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,508
but we're here.

473
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:32,807
You need to get
used to it.

474
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:40,740
I did a 5-mile sweep.

475
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:42,374
No R.F. on infrared
readout anywhere.

476
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:44,207
Nobody's transmitting
any voice or video.

477
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:47,041
We've been up and down
the dial. No coded chatter.

478
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:19,508
Don't move.
Don't move.

479
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:21,207
You don't fight,
you don't die.

480
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,807
No fighting, man.
Whatever you want.

481
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,074
Shut up! Walk!

482
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,474
Come on!

483
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,774
Don't forget the tools.

484
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,740
What the hell
are you doing?!

485
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,974
Finishing the job.
Antwon's orders.

486
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,940
Holy shit! Turn around!
Against the fence right now!

487
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,740
He's gone.

488
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,573
Shit!

489
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,007
This was not
part of the deal!

490
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:38,974
Sure it was.

491
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,707
The part Antwon
didn't tell you about.

492
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,408
Kill me and you lose
favor with Antwon.

493
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,840
And your boy ends up
facedown

494
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,874
in a pool of blood
and blowjuice.

495
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,241
Hey! Hey!

496
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,874
Get up!

497
00:24:05,673 --> 00:24:07,041
Get the safe and get out!

498
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:09,774
You heard him,
let's go! Get up!

499
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:22,540
What the hell
do we do here?

500
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:25,174
Goddamn it.

501
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:28,241
Give me a hand.

502
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:29,974
Shit.

503
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,274
I don't get it.

504
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,341
Kern was no
backseat banger.

505
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,807
Antwon had him taken out
before Kern took over.

506
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:43,974
Why not just
whack him when he's in the hood?

507
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,540
Word got out that
Antwon took out Kern,

508
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,673
the street would take it
as a weakness.

509
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,408
A gang without a leader.
Brothers jump to other sets.

510
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:52,974
Kern goes down in
the line of duty.

511
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,740
Get some Niners
street cred.

512
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,074
Moses takes over,

513
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,307
pushes Antwon's agenda.

514
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,007
Goddam it.

515
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:04,274
Goddam it, man.

516
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,307
Let's go.

517
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:15,907
You gotta be shittin' me!

518
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,107
These brothers
can take a bullet.

519
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:22,007
Oh, God. What now?

520
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:25,673
Help. Help.

521
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,174
Let's go.

522
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,508
Vic, come on, man!
We can't just--

523
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,441
911 will take 20 minutes
to get here.

524
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,807
He's gonna be dead in 10.

525
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:39,174
We'll wait. Then we leave,
call it in.

526
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,974
You sure about this?

527
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,274
Kern's dead.

528
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,540
We can still save Lem.

529
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,074
Jesus!

530
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:10,874
Mackey!
Mackey, please!

531
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,774
Mackey!

532
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,540
Let me outta here!

533
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:18,441
Police! We're cutting
the lock!

534
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:21,374
On my command you stand,
hands on your head!

535
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,307
Sorry I spaced
on the combination.

536
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,907
There's glory hole over there
and a couple of rat traps.

537
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,041
The owner said
he put them out.

538
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:28,508
Tough to prove
whose whose.

539
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:32,840
Stand slowly!
Hands on your head!

540
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,307
We helped you catch him.

541
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:40,241
I expect you to hold up
your end.

542
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,141
What do you suppose
would happen

543
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:47,707
If someone snapped this--
on someone's dick?

544
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,107
You're sick,
you know that?

545
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't make this up.

546
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,907
This one here?

547
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:55,074
Serrated teeth.

548
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:57,374
Guy who got caught in this
is gonna pee sitting down...

549
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,241
if he survives.

550
00:26:58,307 --> 00:26:59,707
Aren't you glad
it wasn't you?

551
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,807
That'd be a hell of a secret
you'd have to live with.

552
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:03,307
Something personal
and embarrassing

553
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,573
that affects your ability
to function.

554
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,540
Not something you'd want
a lot of people top know about.

555
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,840
OK, you want
to do this?

556
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:11,940
You can talk to him.

557
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,307
I'll come back
later.

558
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:19,807
So, Jared, what do you got
against gay folks?

559
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,673
That some sort of tactic?

560
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,607
You pretend to pick a fight,

561
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:26,107
and then you do
the whole tag-team thing?

562
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:28,573
Just answer the question.

563
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:33,408
He give you anything?

564
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:34,774
Nope.

565
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,041
We need to put this guy
in a lineup.

566
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:38,441
He's all yours.

567
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:40,607
Tina, we need to bring
Trujillo in again.

568
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:42,974
I'll tell him to meet you
down the block from his place.

569
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,107
Keep up appearances.
Got it.

570
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,673
Alarico Trujillo
on Lattimer Ave?

571
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Yeah.

572
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,141
Unis just responded
to a domestic

573
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,508
at his address
that got ugly.

574
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:53,307
You should run with it since
you're dealing with him--

575
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,740
OK. OK.

576
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,740
I got balls in the air on a
big 211 that just got called in.

577
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:01,174
I'm gonna check in
on it personally.

578
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:06,707
We got here, he was standing
over her with a baseball bat.

579
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,807
What happened?

580
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,207
We got married,

581
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:17,274
the priest told her everything
I'd done before with men

582
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,673
was in the past.

583
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,707
I tried to stop, but
she knew what was up.

584
00:28:21,774 --> 00:28:24,707
You people started coming
around asking questions.

585
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,707
She knew why.

586
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:39,508
What the hell
is he doing here?

587
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:41,508
Pretending to be a cop.

588
00:28:41,573 --> 00:28:43,107
You guys
called this in?

589
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:45,740
Yeah. We got a tip the One-Niners
were hitting this place.

590
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,174
We got stuck in
the van on a stakeout.

591
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,974
Couldn't make it
back here in time.

592
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,141
What's the damage?

593
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:51,707
Looks like the guard
took out one of them

594
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,341
before he got his head
blown off.

595
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:56,640
Detective Mackey,
do you know him?

596
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:03,007
It's Kern Kittle.

597
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,607
Old-school One-Niner.

598
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:05,940
Went back to
the street game

599
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:09,540
once his hip-hop career
hit the skids.

600
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:11,141
Why don't you inventory
what's missing,

601
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,241
then we'll start turning over
One-Niner rocks.

602
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:17,241
Familiar scenario, this.

603
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:18,874
How so?

604
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,740
Come on.
You don't see it?

605
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:24,774
A dead cop killed by the
gun of a dead bad guy.

606
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,974
You two,
innocent bystanders.

607
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,408
We were on the other side
of Farmington, asshole.

608
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,740
Anybody see you?

609
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,640
Wouldn't have been much
of a stakeout if they had.

610
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,307
You know what? You should
start eating again, man.

611
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,074
Malnourishment's starting
to screw with your logic.

612
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,508
Lemansky's going
to prison.

613
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,041
You need to protect him.

614
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,508
You reach out
to Antwon Mitchell.

615
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:44,041
For some reason, he needs
his crew leader dead.

616
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:46,573
Bad blood, internal
beef, whatever.

617
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,508
So... you kill him.

618
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,241
Your end of the deal.

619
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,074
He keeps Lem alive.

620
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:53,907
His end of the deal.

621
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:57,940
How's that logic
sound to you?

622
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:06,074
Let me remind you of a few
things you seem to have forgotten.

623
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:08,840
I didn't kill Terry.

624
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,774
You've lost your leverage
with Lem.

625
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,307
And your ex-wife's pussy...

626
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:17,607
tastes like sweet butter.

627
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,874
What do you want?

628
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,640
Sadie, you gonna
let me in?

629
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,174
I'm in the middle
of something.

630
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:38,874
I just need to know
if you've seen this guy.

631
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,274
Yeah. He came through.

632
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,408
Are you OK?

633
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,974
What do you care?

634
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,174
Did he hurt you?

635
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,874
You're the only one
who ever hurts me, Jon.

636
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,241
That's not gonna
happen again.

637
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:59,474
Can you just...

638
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,241
tell me what he did.

639
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,374
Just tell me
what happened.

640
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,707
What did he do?

641
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:06,207
What did he do? Um...

642
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:07,573
he made me come.

643
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,341
That's what he did.

644
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,374
No, he didn't.

645
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,174
Oh, yeah.

646
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:20,874
Twice.

647
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:30,274
Do you know...
who this guy is, Sadie?

648
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,508
Your friend...

649
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:36,241
who you sent
to check up on me.

650
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:37,940
Well, he did.

651
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,074
What did you do?

652
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:43,740
Huh?

653
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:45,907
You need to go.

654
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,341
Move your arm
from the door, Jon...

655
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:54,007
now...

656
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,874
or I will call the police.

657
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,640
What's up?

658
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:11,340
What are you doing here?

659
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,674
Chief's office just
signed off on the deal.

660
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,007
It's OK, man.
It's over.

661
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,074
It's over.

662
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:29,373
Uh...

663
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,774
Thank you, man.

664
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:35,974
It's all right.
It's OK.

665
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,640
We got your back.
I know.

666
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,174
You're gonna be taken
care of, you understand?

667
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,308
I had nothing
to do with this.

668
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:49,807
But if you're asking me
if I think

669
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:51,274
these perverts deserve
to be punished,

670
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,841
look what they're doing
to our country.

671
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,507
Yeah, it's seducing our
kids, spreading AIDS.

672
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,407
You gave us your schpiel.

673
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,907
A moment of your time?

674
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:04,407
So where are we
with this freak?

675
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:06,640
He's guilty, just not
prosecutable.

676
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,141
The problem is the
evidence is circumstantial

677
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,174
and threadbare
at best.

678
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:10,941
He matches
the witness description.

679
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:13,974
There's no way the D.A.'s gonna
indict off a wife beater's say so.

680
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,407
Let's put him
on the tour.

681
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:18,107
Lose him in the system for a
couple of days, bye some time.

682
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:19,807
With I.A.D. bivouacked
to my colon?

683
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,340
Are you out of your mind?

684
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,540
If you can't close him,
lose him.

685
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:27,274
Oh. Uh, Claudette,
the chief's here.

686
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,874
He wants to see you.

687
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:33,007
Hey, I tried to keep it
copasetic for you and Phillips.

688
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:37,740
I got a preliminary report
back from the city physician.

689
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,774
Your medically fit
to resume your duties.

690
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:40,941
I could have told you that.

691
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,607
You'll be required
to have quarterly checkups.

692
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:44,607
Your nickel.

693
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:46,141
I understand
you unloaded

694
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,373
with both barrels
on my number two here.

695
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,640
Sometimes happens
I see red.

696
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,407
Changes have to be made.

697
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:54,740
For starters, I've decided
to appoint you captain.

698
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,974
What makes you think
I want that revolving door?

699
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,841
You know this place better
than anybody in the department.

700
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:06,208
Which is why you don't
see my jumping at the offer.

701
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:07,740
My predecessor
made a mistake

702
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:11,440
slapping you down
with that D.A. nonsense.

703
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,007
But you and I can find a
way to work together, right?

704
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:26,607
For starters, I would need a
guarantee that I would run the Barn.

705
00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:30,907
Not in theory,
in fact.

706
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:32,640
No one can do the job
with...

707
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,241
Sorry to interrupt,
but...

708
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,740
can I just confirm some
very disturbing news?

709
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,774
Did you...

710
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,874
did you sigh off
on a deal with Lemansky?

711
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,208
I did.

712
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:51,607
I thought we agreed
no deals.

713
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,774
The only way to get Mackey
is to leverage his guys.

714
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,308
We're in the middle of
something here, lieutenant.

715
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:58,874
So am I! And it just got derailed
because you guys backed down!

716
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,540
It's over, Jon.

717
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:03,640
Sending Lemansky to jail
sends a message.

718
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:04,774
We all move on now.

719
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:07,141
And Mackey
skates clean.

720
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,141
This guy--
This guy is just pissing...

721
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,607
just pissing
all over us...

722
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:17,041
and we just smile
and lick it up?

723
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:19,041
That's enough.

724
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:23,574
Vic Mackey kills cops!

725
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,540
He--
He deals drugs!

726
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,807
He beats suspects!

727
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:34,473
You know what
he did yesterday?

728
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,041
He--
He screwed my ex-wife

729
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:42,841
with the sole purpose...

730
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:48,607
of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

731
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:53,107
He may have assassinated
a gang leader.

732
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:56,674
And that's just
all in one day.

733
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,208
I wonder what
he's gonna do today?

734
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,007
I wonder what he's gonna
do tomorrow?

735
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:06,774
This guy--
This guy's just pissing--

736
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:07,941
He's pissing
all over us!

737
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:09,941
He's pissing on you!

738
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:11,373
What does it taste like?

739
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,407
Chief, what does
it taste like?

740
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:13,473
'Cause you know what?

741
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,707
It tastes like
piss to me!

742
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,274
You have 48 hours
to tie up the lose ends.

743
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,740
And find someplace else
to do the paperwork.

744
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:26,340
Captain Wyms
needs her office.

745
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,107
We'll sneak the whole cow
into you, man.

746
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:41,473
Hey, Lem, I'm sorry.

747
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,674
Glad it's over,
though.

748
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,807
That's OK. Thanks.

749
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:47,274
Thank you.

750
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,373
Man, you're gonna be a little
thinner next time I see you.

751
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,574
Yeah.

752
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,174
Thanks. Hey, I gotta
get some things in order.

753
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:57,208
I'll see you guys
at the party, all right?

754
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:58,707
Here you go.
What's that?

755
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:01,446
That's the paperwork for the
211 you called in last night.

756
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:04,774
EMT found a ton of jewelry in
the pocket of the dead banger.

757
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,041
Shitheads shot
an innocent guy

758
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,874
and walked away with
almost nothing.

759
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:12,174
Which means...

760
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:15,841
the goddamn safe
was empty?

761
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:20,674
Holy shit. I gotta
talk to Antwon.

762
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,574
These fags. They choose
a life of sin and suffering,

763
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,007
get what they deserve.

764
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:29,308
But I'm the one
in handcuffs.

765
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:35,141
Hey.
Stand up.

766
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,907
Does his family deserve
to have their lives ruined

767
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,574
because of what
you did to him?

768
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,907
Men's room on Alvarado.

769
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:44,941
I've never seen
that guy before.

770
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:46,340
But if he's being punished
for his wickedness,

771
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:48,373
then it's God's will.

772
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,607
You're His
spokesman now?

773
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:51,274
It's right there
in the book.

774
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,707
"You shall not lie with the
male as one lies with a female."

775
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,841
It's an abomination.
I mean, come on.

776
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,141
Hey! Hey!

777
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,041
Leviticus 18, I know.

778
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:02,974
Hey! Hey!

779
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,141
Where do you go to church?

780
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,241
Christ Bethany.

781
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:07,974
What is this?

782
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:12,174
So then you know that Jesus
lived a perfect life of truth,

783
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,274
and he was
crucified for it.

784
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,941
What do you suppose happens
to someone who lies in his name,

785
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,041
who passes judgment
on other people in his name?

786
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:27,841
Psalm 71, verse 4.

787
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:29,941
- Hey! Stop!
- "Deliver me, o my God,

788
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,574
"Out of the hand
of the wicked.

789
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,607
"Out of the hand of the
unrighteous and the cruel man."

790
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:35,707
Stop!

791
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,174
You wanted to look
at a man down there.

792
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,740
You wanted to touch it!

793
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:39,740
Thought about it
for a long time.

794
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:40,740
Maybe all of your life.

795
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:41,841
You just never did it

796
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:43,740
'cause you knew
that it was wrong.

797
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:45,507
No! No!

798
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,640
So you convinced yourself
that you were doing God's will,

799
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,574
gave yourself
an excuse to find out

800
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,440
what another man's
penis feels like?

801
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:58,274
No! I would never do something
so repulsive and disgusting!

802
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,274
You're no different than
the men you prey on.

803
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,774
You're a homosexual.
No! No! No!

804
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,941
Homosexual!

805
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,274
No.

806
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,308
You're just too weak
and afraid to admit it.

807
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:09,540
That's a lie!
That is a lie!

808
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,308
I am a christian!

809
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:12,340
They are vermin!

810
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:14,574
I did it because
they are vermin!

811
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,174
Why would any man wanna to
touch another man down there?

812
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:20,174
I did it to punish them!

813
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:26,373
What, no muffins?

814
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,907
You shouldn't have taken
the deal, Curtis.

815
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:30,674
You weren't supposed to
get the worst of this.

816
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,874
That's all you did from the minute you
picked me up is threaten me with jail.

817
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,674
That's all it was.
It was just a threat.

818
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,107
Well, you threw me
in country.

819
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,540
You arrested me.

820
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:41,208
I'd knew you'd make
bail, just not so soon.

821
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:42,874
It was just
a strategy, man,

822
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:45,941
a wedge to get you
to turn.

823
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:51,473
Cops will always give it
up with the threat of jail.

824
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,774
Always.

825
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,607
But not you,
not Curtis Lemansky.

826
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,707
I can't believe
you're doing this.

827
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:01,007
You're gonna take the
hit for him, for them?

828
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,208
Well, believe it.

829
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,841
I'm sorry that
I didn't...

830
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:08,874
that we didn't become
friends sooner.

831
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:11,473
Maybe, uh...

832
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,674
pulled this in
another direction.

833
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,674
If I'd just made a...

834
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:20,730
any man'd be lucky to
have you in his corner.

835
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,567
Good luck, Curtis.

836
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:34,932
Hey. Hey.

837
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,709
It's over.

838
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,451
I know.

839
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,935
Take care of yourself,
all right?

840
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:54,913
Things went south.

841
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:57,913
Dirty south.
Alabama south.

842
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:00,260
If I had all the information
going in,

843
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,518
We wouldn't be
sitting here.

844
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,405
But here we are right now.

845
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,703
Big blue and his
little black puppet.

846
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:07,639
What the hell
are you talking about?

847
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:10,445
Kavanaugh dimed me, man.

848
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,529
Told me you'd been braggin' about
how you were playing me against him,

849
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,408
How you manipulated me
into protecting Lemansky

850
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:17,859
To shit all over
his leverage.

851
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,279
That's bullshit!
He's jerkin' us off.

852
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,392
What do you care?

853
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:22,699
He can't get to you
in here.

854
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:25,264
No, but he can touch
everyone around me.

855
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:28,674
That crazy-ass nigger,

856
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,449
he initiated a full-scale D.O.C.
investigation of this place.

857
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,118
The heat's is on.

858
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:36,433
And soon, I won't be feeling
all the comforts of home.

859
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:41,692
Look, I'll figure out a way
to get you your cash.

860
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:43,168
I'll look into
this d.O.C. thing.

861
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:44,910
You've done enough.

862
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,442
The deal and this
conversation are over.

863
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,732
Jesus Christ! I took care of
that "little" thing for you!

864
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:55,022
Now, you're to tell me that
doesn't buy Lem some time?

865
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,151
Oh, that buys you
one more dead cop.

866
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:59,570
I got Niners in every
pen in the state.

867
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:03,562
So wherever he touches
down, it will happen.

868
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,788
And you can set your watch
to that inevitability.

869
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:09,635
If one of your crew
so much as hard looks my guy,

870
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:12,538
my reach will
get you shaved.

871
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:16,119
You got reach like that?

872
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:19,602
So why are you sitting down here
talking to me, grey boy, huh?

873
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,541
It's OK.
It's all right.

874
00:42:28,686 --> 00:42:33,453
That's just detective Mackey's
way of saying good-bye.

875
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,444
I cut you a break for that
meltdown in front of Phillips

876
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:44,544
on account of your
medical problems and so forth,

877
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:47,210
and then I find out it's part
of your campaign to steal my job?

878
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:48,843
I didn't go after this.

879
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,977
Why did you do me like this?

880
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:51,244
I thought you and me
were good.

881
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:54,010
We are good,
and I didn't do you.

882
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,910
Letting Kavanaugh loose
in this place,

883
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:56,810
they set you up
to fail.

884
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:58,678
It's not your fault.

885
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,339
I didn't fail.

886
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,433
Is that what people
are saying?

887
00:43:06,077 --> 00:43:08,210
I'll need you to help me
pick up the pieces.

888
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:13,210
I'm supposed to stick around after
getting shagged in the back like this?

889
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:16,177
No. I got some pride,
you know?

890
00:43:16,244 --> 00:43:17,444
Why don't you give it
a few days?

891
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,681
When you're ready
to talk, my door's open.

892
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,311
I gotta get
a good look.

893
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,344
Hey.

894
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:49,711
Your entertainment
just showed up.

895
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:51,943
I figured it was time
for me to leave.

896
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,311
Right.

897
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:55,177
This is not
the safest 'hood.

898
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:56,744
I'll get you
to your car.

899
00:43:58,544 --> 00:44:00,377
Oh, my.

900
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,843
I'm taking him to the
courthouse, 9:00 tomorrow morning.

901
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,843
Officially surrender.

902
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:15,577
You doing OK?

903
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:17,077
Yeah.

904
00:44:19,444 --> 00:44:20,977
We did the right thing, Vic.

905
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:24,877
Thank you for
helping him.

906
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:28,177
You're a good friend.
He's lucky to have you.

907
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:36,711
Hey. What's going on?

908
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,778
Listen, I gotta
tell you something.

909
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:49,010
What?

910
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:05,177
I hear we got a confession
out of trapper John.

911
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,244
He and Julien
reasoned together.

912
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:10,778
Congratulations
on your promotion.

913
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:13,077
Thanks. I didn't know
it was public.

914
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:14,943
I wanted you
to hear that from me.

915
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,244
Well, you know things
spread around here.

916
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:19,611
Like herpes at
a swinger's party.

917
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,477
While you were stretched out
on the floor over there,

918
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:26,044
the paramedics found
Prednisone in your purse.

919
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,778
They called your doctor to find
out what you were being treated for.

920
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:31,077
Billings overheard
and reported to Phillips.

921
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:32,977
He just told me.

922
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:37,644
He thought lupus
was an emotional disorder.

923
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:42,711
I'm sorry.

924
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:44,843
You can't un-ring
that bell.

925
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,411
You don't trust me.

926
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,611
I made a mistake.

927
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:51,943
You made a choice to
think the worst about me.

928
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:54,877
I'll need your support.

929
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:57,010
I've got my work
cut out for me.

930
00:45:57,077 --> 00:45:59,277
You'll do fine.

931
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:01,411
Whoever sits up there

932
00:46:01,477 --> 00:46:03,010
has to have
an active mistrust

933
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:05,244
of everyone and
everything in this place.

934
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,477
I can't imagine anyone
better suited to the job.

935
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:15,377
Who were they?

936
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:18,210
Look, you guys, I hate
to step on the pussy and laughs,

937
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:20,077
but we gotta talk about
a change of plans.

938
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,943
What change?

939
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,810
You're not going to prison.

940
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:27,110
What are you
talking about?

941
00:46:27,177 --> 00:46:28,744
We made a deal
with Antwon

942
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,544
to get you
safe passage inside.

943
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:32,477
It went bad.

944
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:36,177
The thing at
the warehouse?

945
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:37,810
Oh, Jesus Christ!

946
00:46:37,877 --> 00:46:41,210
Kavanaugh's launched a department of
corrections investigation of Lompoc.

947
00:46:41,277 --> 00:46:43,110
He's gonna make
Antwon's life hell.

948
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,010
Antwon's blaming me.

949
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:46,810
I won't end up
in Lompoc.

950
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:48,344
Word gets out that
Antwon's got a beef,

951
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:50,311
any prison,
any protective custody,

952
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:53,177
best-case scenario, you're gonna
bust enough heads to stay alive.

953
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,843
Which means I can kiss
early release good-bye.

954
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,177
Worst-case scenario, you're
gonna kiss everything good-bye.

955
00:46:57,244 --> 00:46:58,344
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

956
00:46:58,411 --> 00:46:59,778
You're gonna lay low
until I can figure out a way

957
00:46:59,843 --> 00:47:01,010
to get Antwon
back on board.

958
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:02,010
You're putting him
on the run?

959
00:47:02,077 --> 00:47:03,177
I can't run anymore!

960
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:04,244
We're out of options.

961
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:05,277
Look, Vic, I do not
wanna do this.

962
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:06,311
Do we even have a plan?

963
00:47:06,377 --> 00:47:07,277
I'm working on one
right now.

964
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,344
- Where's he gonna go?
- I don't know!

965
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:10,344
I don't know!

966
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,244
Now...

967
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:16,077
you're gonna hide while
I find Gilroy's contacts.

968
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:18,577
Mexico?!
No! No!

969
00:47:18,644 --> 00:47:20,877
Lem, it's only temporary.

970
00:47:20,943 --> 00:47:21,910
But what about my deal?

971
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,477
If I run, man, they're
gonna throw it out.

972
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:24,544
They'll have
all new charges.

973
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:26,711
It's better than
the alternative!

974
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:29,744
Lem, right now, this is about
keeping you alive!

975
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:36,311
Lem, I promise you...

976
00:47:36,377 --> 00:47:38,044
I promise you, man...

977
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,277
I promise you we're gonna
make this work.

978
00:47:50,544 --> 00:47:52,544
I try to be handy,
but it's...

979
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:54,411
Good thing.
Whatever--

980
00:47:54,477 --> 00:47:57,444
I don't know. I've heard
of a green thumb.

981
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:05,311
Hurry up!

982
00:48:05,377 --> 00:48:07,544
Oh, God! Julien!
Shit!

983
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:23,177
Can I talk to you
for a second?

984
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:27,177
Just one second.
