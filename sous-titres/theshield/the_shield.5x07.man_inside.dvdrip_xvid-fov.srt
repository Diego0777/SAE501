I'm just gonna tell the whole courtroom
what went down with us.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,906
ConvinceJuan
to miss his court date.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,881

16
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,602
Maybe she started lookin' at you funny.
So you killed her...

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,076

<i>so you could make yourselflook innocent.</i>

- I'll talk to you any way I goddamn please.

You can't arrest me, and you're not helpin' me.
I'll find her myself!

20

His own sister?

<i>I need him for a special assignment.</i>

64

I can get him freed up for an hour.
Who should I call?

65
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,655
Why don't you tickle your balls
on your own time.

66
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,384
- I'll see him in my office.
- Not until his lawyer gets down here.

67
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,462
- Tell her to hurry.
- We'll do that.

68
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm gonna feel him out,
then maybe spring Fatima's visit...

69
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,429
his missing death kit on him-
look for a crack.

70
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,132
- Actually I'm gonna go at him alone.
- That's not your decision.

71
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,268
It was his the minute he cut
Pauline Wahler's hair to look like mine.

72
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,040
Okay, okay. Okay, good, good.
He knows how I operate...

73
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,946
thinks he's got a bead on me.
Come at him from a new angle.

74
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,782
I'm gonna watch on the monitor,
develop a game plan. If you want me to jump in...

75
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,119
ask him if he wants you
to turn down the air-conditioning.

76
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,193
It's a code.

77
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,402
Between San Antonio and here...

78
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:10,209
you've killed at least eight women,
including one last night.

79
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:15,652
Your sister's missing 24 hours.
We think you killed her too. Let's start talking.

80
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,218
If you're lookin' for a rematch, I left my cleats
at the Barn. Left half his skin on the dirt.

81
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,230
<i>Unless it's the postgame activities</i>
<i>you're lookin'to finish?</i>

82
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,800
Nah, you cheated us fair and square.
We'll get you next year.

83
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,962
- Since when are you good losers?
- Since I got the news my task force was expanding.

84
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:38,977
I was thinking of offering your team the new slot.
I hear the Barn's a sinkin' ship.

85
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,740
We could've discussed this
over a couple beers just as easily.

86
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,942
<i>I was going to after the game.</i>
<i>Didn't get the chance.</i>

87
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,418
Figured we'd talk over a couple of bodies,
give me a chance to see you in action.

88
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,117
<i>I don't know if you heard, uh,</i>
<i>I.A.D. 's had a wild hair up their ass about us.</i>

89
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:57,162
I've tangled with those bastards a couple of times.
It just means you're gettin' shit done.

90
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>When this case is over,</i>
<i>we'll get those beers.</i>

91
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,827
- Hell, I'll even buy.
- Let's go.

92
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,427
- How old?
- She was two, maybe three.

93
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,031
<i>House belongs to Maurizio Ochoa.</i>

94
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,374
Dead woman's his girlfriend, Jenny Rayball.
Shot 15 times.

95
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,209
Ah, we've picked up Ochoa before.
Deals meth.

96
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,184
- Little girl's name was Violet.
- Didn't Ochoa get popped once
for bustin' up his girlfriend?

97
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,720
<i>Couple of times.</i>
<i>Broke her jaw six months ago.</i>

98
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,450
<i>[Shane]</i>
<i>That sounds like the crank talkin'.</i>

99
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,133
Ah, let me guess.
He took his stash with him on the way out.

100
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,362
Ochoa hooked up
with a Mexican cartel guy in Chino...

101
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,598
convinced him he had the chops
to handle the weight.

102
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,675
We've been set up
on Ochoa for three months.

103
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,006
Had our guy in place to make the buy,
just waitin' for the word.

104
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,479
So even if Ochoa didn't do this, his business did.
It could be a rival slanger.

105
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,678
<i>Either way, shot 15 times, it was personal,</i>
<i>and we gotta track down Ochoa.</i>

106
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,311
Well, he sticks his head up,
we'll be there to whack it.

107
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,152
We think he's sittin' on
a hundred pounds of meth... to sell.

108
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:07,331
<i>I looked into your finances.</i>
<i>You know what I found?</i>

109
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,834
<i>Yeah. Nothin'unusual.</i>

110
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:15,601
<i>How did you manage to hide</i>
<i>your dirty money so well, huh?</i>

111
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,610
The only money that I get
is from my weekly paycheck.

112
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,204
<i>You tryin'to tell me that you never took</i>
<i>just a little bit off the side?</i>

113
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,911
<i>Why don't you provide some proof</i>
<i>before you accuse him of a crime?</i>

114
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:32,924
<i>Ronnie, you got any idea where Mackey</i>
<i>came up with $65,000 in cash?</i>

115
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,959
<i>[Rebecca]</i>
<i>Don't answer that.</i>

116
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,961
<i>[Kavanaugh]</i>
<i>You said you wanted some proof.</i>

117
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,762
- I think you're bullshitting.
- Vendrell- He's got money
he can't account for either.

118
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,893
<i>Which means one of two things:</i>

119
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,905
<i>Either these guys,</i>
<i>they don't include you in their bounty-</i>

120
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,999
which should piss you off-

121
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,979
or... you're the one guy who's bright enough
not to leave a trail.

122
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,312
<i>Which one is it?</i>

123
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,319
You just said you checked my records,
and you didn't find anything.

124
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,482
And I don't keep track of how the other guys
balance their checkbooks.

125
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,894
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>One lawyer for four guys?</i>

126
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,022
Who's lookin' out for your interest?
'Cause from what I see...

127
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,260
she seems to be more concerned
with steerin' the conversation away from Mackey.

128
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,337
<i>Who hired her in the first place?</i>

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,839
<i>- Because she's certainly not</i>
<i>lookin'out for your interests.</i>
- Let's go.

130
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,432
My client is cooperating.
He's willing to answer any questions.

131
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,412
If you have another one, you let us know.
Come on. Let's go.

132
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,415
Ronnie.
Ronnie, you've been disciplined.

133
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:36,819
You've been careful, but not them.
They're gonna screw this up.

134
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,292
They're gonna bring you down for a mistake
that you were too smart to make.

135
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,362
That's it. Let's go.

136
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,697
We can pick this up later, okay?

137
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,099
<i>[Vehicle Engine Stops, Doors Closing]</i>

138
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,641
<i>- How'd it go with Kavanaugh?</i>
- Asked me if I knew where you came up
with $65,000 cash.

139
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,266
- 65? Exactly?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,607
He's been going through our financial records-
all of them.

141
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,273
- He said this in front of Becca?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,850
What'd you do with your share
of the money train cash?

143
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,852
I gave it to Corrine for the kids.

144
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,184
- She gave it up to Kavanaugh.
- What else could it be?

145
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,757
- You said she wasn't calling you back.
- Look, I'll get into it.

146
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,657
Well, tell me another way
that he could've known the exact number.

147
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,922
That's gonna look great.
Your ex-wife on the stand...

148
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,397
- talking about dirty money
we stole from the Armenian mob-
- She doesn't know how we got it...

149
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,470
and she's never testifying
against me in court.

150
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,631
Now let's go find Ochoa

00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,084
He gives your wife the bills,
and she writes the checks?

304
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,321
And we save every goddamn receipt,
every invoice, every cashed check.

305
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,421
<i>Everything is accounted for.</i>
<i>You wanna see 'em?</i>

306
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,094
I already have.
I've seen everything.

307
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,165
As I.A.D., you're only entitled
to look at department pay stubs.

308
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,937
You'd need a subpoena
for any other financial history.

309
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,171
<i>Every penny is accounted for...</i>

310
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,876
except for the normal, everyday expenses
of people living.

311
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,317
We scrape by.
You wanna jump in here?

312
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,878
<i>Do you get any help from anybody-</i>
<i>your friends, your family, your relatives?</i>

313
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,984
<i>- You doin'anything to make a little extra cash?</i>
- Don't answer that. We're done.

314
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:27,054
Next time, you submit your questions
in writing to my office.

315
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,364
Hey, I just wanna know where you get
the extra money from. Come on, Vendrell!

316
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,836
Now she's defending me
like we're guilty.

317
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,305
Why don't you just put it up
in big, flashing neon lights?

318
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,535
I'm not the one with bags of cash
floating around.

319
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,807
And excuse me if I step on his questions
to help keep you out of jail.

320
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,680
This is about more than that.
It's about keeping our jobs.

321
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,276
It's about walking out of here
with our pensions, our reputations-

322
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,050
Keeping us out of jail
is just one piece of the puzzle.

323
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:56,184
Until Kavanaugh charges somebody,
we just have to deflect-

324
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,263
- hope he reveals more than he should.
- Not me.

325
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,163
I'm sorry, darlin',
but you don't represent me anymore.

326
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,861
<i>- Can you give us a moment, please?</i>
- Yeah.

327
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,171
[Mackey]
All right.

328
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,765
- What the hell happened up there?
- He's lookin' into my records:

329
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,005
What me and Mara bring home,
what we're payin' for the house.

330
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,377
- I thought that was all covered?
- It is, to the penny.

331
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,383
The problem is, there's nothing left over,
and he knows it.

332
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,420
<i>- This isn't good.</i>
- No shit.
- All right, all right, all right.

333
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,753
- Let's just take a deep breath.
- Yeah, while we're still breathing free air?

334
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,089
<i>Vic, we got a "shots fired"call</i>
<i>from the address you guys just left.</i>

335
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,528
- All right.
- Lemansky, I need to see you for a sec.

336
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,606
- What happened?
<i>- [Man] Some kinda shootout.</i>

337
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,040
Dead guy inside
is this guy's brother.

338
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,543
- Who killed Jimmy? Was it Shusett?
- [Billy] No.

339
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:51,275
Saw him comin' up the stairs.
Knew some major stuff was gonna go down...

340
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,544
<i>so I went and got my gun.</i>

341
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,815
By the time I found it,
Jimmy was all shot up.

342
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,356
<i>[Ronnie]</i>
<i>Did you see who killed him?</i>

343
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,985
Some <i>cholo</i> dude, rolls with Ochoa.

344
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,391
Guess Ochoa was more broken up
than we thought about his dead lady.

345
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,492
- Or he wanted his drugs back.
- He killed my brother, man.

346
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,603
<i>My street intel says someone's tryin'</i>
<i>to unload weight-Mexican meth.</i>

347
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,702
Shusett didn't go to Ochoa's to kill
his ex-crank skank. He went to steal his drugs.

348
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,475
Those things flood the barrio, forget it.

349
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:29,179
- So let's find them first.
- Better yet, let's buy 'em.

350
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,018
Who do we know who could buy from Shusett
without raisin' flags?

351
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,592
<i>I got a dealer.</i>
<i>His street name's Burnout.</i>

352
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,856
- Think he got popped with Shusett once
for possession.
<i>- [Mackey] All right.</i>

353
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,262
<i>- Gonna check in with my guys.</i>
<i>Let me know if you find him.</i>
<i>- [Mackey] Great.</i>

354
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,770
[Tires Screech]

355
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,007
My quota's a little low this week.

356
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,134
- Who wants to do the bracelet dance?
- Back up, Burnout.

357
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,510
Look, we need you to buy some drugs
from an old friend of yours, Ted Shusett.

358
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,413
- You got popped together once?
- Once a fellow fiend, always a fellow fiend.

359
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,782
- Partying together don't make us tight.
<i>- Call him, all right?</i>

360
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,618
- Tell him you're lookin' for product. He'll listen.
- Do I look like a stupid nigger?

361
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,885
- Why do you think we're talkin'?
- Look, man. This is legit.

362
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,793
<i>When he stole those drugs,</i>
<i>Shusett killed a two-year-old girl and her mother.</i>

363
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,626
So?

364
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,326
- Tried to do it the easy way.
<i>- [Handcuffs Clicking]</i>

365
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,529
Okay. Hold up. Hold up, man.
Look, a call like that-

366
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,664
little girl dead, man- street's gonna know
I'm the one givin' it up.

367
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,742
That's pretty rough
on my reputation.

368
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,074
- What's the goin' rate for a reputation these days?
<i>- [Clicking]</i>

369
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,177
- Twenty-five grand.
- [Mackey] Get him outta here.

370
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,278
That's too much for the department to authorize
on less than 24 hours' notice.

371
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,085
- City council could rubber-stamp
a reward though.
<i>- [Car Door Closes]</i>

372
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,716
[Chuckles]

373
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,660
- See you guys inside, all right?
- See you inside.

374
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,332
<i>Councilman?</i>
<i>Glad I could catch you.</i>

375
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,402
- You got a minute?
- I have a speech to give.

376
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,631
- Yeah, this is really important for the investigation.
- [Man Chattering]

377
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,938
You ever heard of a guy-
[Quietly] named Antwon Mitchell?

378
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,275
You know I have.

379
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,281
- Talked to Lemansky-
<i>- [Man] Hi, David.</i>

380
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:09,343
And I don't want to push on Antwon Mitchell
until I heard what you got to say about it.

381
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,945
I don't know what <i>I</i> can tell you.

382
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,819
How did Mackey learn that, uh, Crowley
was workin' with Justice?

383
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,863
- What does this have to do with Mitchell?
- Humor me.

384
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,695
Well, I suspected it was Gilroy.

385
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,395
Maybe it was you.

386
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,995
You set up Crowley.
You tipped Mackey.

387
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,131
Right. I'm also the fifth Beatle.

388
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:35,976
Mrs. Mackey reported that he gave her
65 grand in cash.

389
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,311
What was your share?

390
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,545
<i>Runnin'a political campaign</i>
<i>gets really expensive, huh?</i>

391
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,144
So's my time.
And now you're wasting it.

392
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,022
I'm just tryin' to figure out how Antwon Mitchell
and a guy named Juan Lozano...

393
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,459
figure into all of this.

394
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,760
Lozano was the guy-wasn't that the kid
who assaulted you?

395
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,834
Yes!

396
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,937
- Yes.
- He grabbed your gun?

397
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,705
You killed his buddy durin' a robbery,
tracked Lozano down yourself-

398
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,304
I mean, that's a pretty impressive bust
for a desk jockey.

399
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,883
Then later you visited him in County.

400
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,818
Yeah, well, he was planning
to appeal his case.

401
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,255
Hmm. I know that, uh, Mackey and his guys-

402
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,792
they have some connection
with Antwon Mitchell...

403
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,853
and he was in the same cellblock
when Lozano was found dead.

404
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,298
Somethin' big goin' on here.

405
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:34,862
You, Mackey, Mitchell, Lozano-

406
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:39,376
- You wanna fill me in?
- Waste your time with these conspiracy theories...

407
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,642
and you'll find yourself even more lost
than you are now.

408
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,457
<i>[Julien On Radio] Clerk said it was a black woman</i>
<i>who used the credit card.</i>

if it was Fatima Gardner.

410
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,821

<i>- We've got a motel address for-</i>

- I'm not talkin' to you.

413
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,228
- Say again, Julien.
<i>- I said, we've got...</i>

414
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,066
a motel address where the woman
wanted the purchases delivered.

415
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,505
- We're headed there now.
- Okay, good.

416
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,238
<i>- Copy.</i>
- You gotta find Terry.
He's the one that needs to be in here.

417
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,574
Shut up.

418
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,942
That's pretty sloppy work you did last night,
killing that girl.

419
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,419
Not your usual work of art.

420
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,185

00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,262
One of the victims I.D.'d the guy

<i>We can lure "Someshit"out</i>
<i>if we make an offer to buy.</i>

432

The only problem is, we need a 25-grand reward
for our conscientious dealer first.

433
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,801
Why is this guy so important
you have to pay him?

434
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,471
'Cause he can guarantee puttin' us in touch
with the guy. He knows "Someshit."

435
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,142
It's the fastest way we can get our hands
on this guy and the suitcase full of crank.

436
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,847
- All right. How fast do you need it?
- Guy stole over a hundred pounds.

437
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,119
He's holdin' a fire sale.
It's only a matter of hours before he finds a taker.

438
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,490
- Or Ochoa's guy finds him first.
<i>- [Reyes] My boys put a lot ofhours into this.</i>

439
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,532
Hate to see it slip away,
end up on the street after all that.

440
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,668
All right. I can authorize the reward,
but expediting it's another question.

441
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,671
A two-year-old girl was executed.

<i>Hell, I'll give you some money.</i>

- It's dangerous.
- It makes amends.

610
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,513
I'll deal with the danger later.

611
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,866
- Haven't been here in years.
- Young and poor-

612
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,670
We actually thought
this was fine dining, remember?

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,712
[Corrine]
This doesn't feel too weird.

614
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,781
Listen, l-

615
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,343
You and the kids
can't get caught up with this.

616
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,182
- Well, feels like it's too late.
- No, it's not.

617
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:48,987
I want you to get a lawyer. Make a deal
that gets you clear with Kavanaugh.

618
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,789
- And make sure he gets you I.R.S. Immunity too.
- But he-

619
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:56,424
And I want you to answer all his questions.
From now on, complete cooperation-

620
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,196
like, the whole truth,
no matter what it makes me look like.

621
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,202
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

622
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,743
Let me worry about me.

623
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,512
<i>You just worry about our three.</i>

624
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,920
- What do I say about the money?
- Well, when we needed it, I came up with it.

625
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,049
I said I was gonna take some overtime
to cover the expenses.

626
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,389
As far as you know,
that's what I did.

627
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:29,592
- But that's not gonna go with anything-
- Let me worry about me.

628
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,174
Menu hasn't changed.

629
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,183
Ah, some things never do.

630
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,547
<i>Maybe I should just give them some minor bullshit</i>
<i>that won't stick. Get us all out of it.</i>

631
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,251
<i>You gonna trust Aceveda now?</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

632
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,963
[Sighs]
Why are we havin' this conversation without Vic?

633
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,297
'Cause Vic's listenin' to his lawyer
more than he's listenin' to us.

634
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,167
I don't like her representing
all four of us.

635
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:13,141
But I hate to say it, but we all...
have different levels of involvement.

636
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,236
<i>Yeah, they'll get Lem on possession.</i>
<i>They'll get me and Vic on tax evasion.</i>

637
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,372
You're the only one clean so far.

638
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:22,248
Hey, I'm in this with you,
and so is Vic.

639
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:26,483
But I don't like
this unified lawyer front.

640
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,186
Kavanaugh cannot handle
four lawyers pokin' holes in his case.

641
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:36,426
I say we all lawyer up, get them to throw
everything they can at him. Keep <i>him</i> off balance.

642
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,171
I mean, what are we waiting for?

643
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,565
- Vic.
<i>- [Scoffs]</i>

644
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,645
[Scoffs]

645
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,350
The medical examiner found
the hair of an African-American male...

646
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,011
on last night's victim's body.

647
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,953
<i>We're gonna need to draw some blood</i>
<i>and take some hair samples.</i>

648
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,320
- I won't agree to that.
- It's not your choice anymore.

649
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,293
It's the court's.
It's real stupid of you.

650
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,832
You got so pissed at us asking you questions
about Fatima's disappearance...

651
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,027
you finally got sloppy-
went out there, killed in a hurry.

652
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:17,972
<i>All the other times</i>
<i>your planning was just perfect. Why?</i>

653
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:22,910
<i>You've sat here before.</i>
<i>What's different this time?</i>

654
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:28,178
You had a fight with Fatima?
She confront you about the other girls?

655
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,880
Is that why you finally killed your own sister?
Or was it just me you couldn't control?

656
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,653
- I didn't kill her.
- You must have known what was happening-

657
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,218
seen her loathing,
her disappointment.

658
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,232
When she came to see us,
she said it was all her fault.

659
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,735
<i>- She never came to you.</i>
<i>- Sald she should have trled to stop you.</i>

660
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,238
<i>Is that what happened?</i>
<i>She tried to stop you?</i>

661
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,640
You're bleeding.

662
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,150
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>
- Let's get some ice.

663
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,919
- I'm fine.
- Come with me.

664
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,993
No.

665
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:22,066
Fatima hated you.
Her own brother, a killer.

666
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,107
- She loved me.
<i>- And you loved her?</i>

667
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,143
Bullshit.

668
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:31,442
You killed her over and over.
All those girls-

669
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,679
Texas, here, and God knows where else-
they were all Fatima to you.

670
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,550
You needed her, but you hated her.

671
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,114
And then you killed them until
you finally got up the courage to kill her.

672
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,956
- No.
<i>- And now with that hair we found</i>
<i>on that woman last night...</i>

673
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,520
we got you, you son of a bitch.

674
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,295
I've got you for her,
and the jury-

675
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,100
if I got one-will put all the others
on you too, including your sister.

676
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,664
- I didn't-
- We have the evidence this time.

677
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,042
- I could never-
<i>- You killed Fatima...</i>

678
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,014
<i>and the hair proves you killed</i>
<i>the woman last night.</i>

679
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,051
She was nothin'!
Those others were nothin'.

680
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:13,590
Fatima- Fatima was my sister.

681
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,097
So the others-you killed them?

682
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,099
[Exhales]

683
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,398
Pauline Wahler last night?

684
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,166
<i>Mary Simpson?</i>
<i>Lana Gregory?</i>

685
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,243
[Sighs]

686
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:40,239
They were just... things.
You could hardly call that killin'.

687
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:45,246
- The ones in Texas.
- Them too.

688
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,019
But not Fatima. Not her.

689
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,085
She was a person.
I didn't kill her.

690
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,013
Fatima?

691
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:16,351
You did this? You helped them
make me think you were dead?

692
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:20,480
Your soul's gonna burn, Kleavon.
And until it does, I'll visit you.

693
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,960
- You bitch!
- [Sobs] You're never gonna see Mom and Auntie.

694
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,553
<i>They're cryin'over what you've done.</i>
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

695
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,496
- Why'd you tell them?
- Move!

696
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,694
- Someone get her out of here!
- You traitor! I'm your blood!

697
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,397
- What's wrong with you?
<i>- [Claudette] Someone get her out ofherel</i>

698
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,374

702
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,679
- What's goin' on?
- No, no. She fainted. She was out before she fell.

703
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,415
- Claudette?
- She fell?
<i>- She bleeding?</i>

704
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,151
<i>Don't-Don't move her.</i>
<i>Call the paramedics.</i>

705
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,056

<i>- [Julien] Call an ambulance.</i>
