1
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:02,574
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

2
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,674
Sheet metal.

3
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,874
This coke's really pink?

4
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,074
No, not really. It just looks pink
in the right kind of light.

5
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:25,074
- Cool.
- Yeah. It's Peruvian.

6
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:29,074
Rondell said the street ain't seen blow
this strong since Grandmaster Flash.

7
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:30,974
What's that?

8
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:32,974
Never mind.

9
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:38,874
How much time are they giving these
days for installing an illegal wiretap?

10
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:41,274
Not as long as some of
this fruit's been here.

11
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:43,774
These Third World cavemen
ever hear of a Ralphs?

12
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:49,474
- Shane. Shane, Shane, Shane.
- Here we go.

13
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,974
- Yo.
- Yeah. Bakers are home, boys...

14
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:03,574
...and they're coming through
the front door. Exit the ass.

15
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:16,974
This is gonna be a sweet
win for us, boys.

16
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:19,774
Aceveda gets a gold star,
we get a little breathing room.

17
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,974
- Rondell gets product.
- The retirement fund keeps growing.

18
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:26,174
- Who's saving for retirement?
- Can you say "ski-doo"?

19
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,874
All right.
Hey, we're wired.

20
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:40,274
The Armenians speak Armenian.

21
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,274
- Theo Chorlian?
- Yeah?

22
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,774
Professor Gaffney says
you'd be the perfect guy...

23
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,974
...to help us with
a special investigation.

24
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,774
- What kind of special...?
- You'll love it. Come with us.

25
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:56,374
He'll meet you back
at the dorm. All right?

26
00:02:56,974 --> 00:03:00,174
These guys are
Eastern Armenian.

27
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:02,974
- So?
- So they got accents.

28
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,274
You understand what
they're saying or not?

29
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:11,874
The gardener delivers six loaves
of Agien white bread?

30
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:14,774
- Does that make sense?
- When and where?

31
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:19,574
Will arrive here
tomorrow night, 9:30.

32
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:22,674
- At the bakery.
- Bakery? What kind of bread this is?

33
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:24,774
- Thanks, kid.
- What's this all about?

34
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:27,474
- Who are these guys?
- National security.

35
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,574
Don't tell a goddamn soul.

36
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,474
You've been a big help.
Thanks.

37
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,174
Okay, Bingham,
here's the story.

38
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,074
You were driving these gothic
goons back from LAX...

39
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,374
...when you overheard them talking
about the shipment of cocaine.

40
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:49,174
I won't bore you with the details.
Being such a concerned citizen...

41
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:53,174
...you felt compelled to share
this information with the authorities.

42
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:57,274
All we need now is for you
to sign your statement.

43
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:59,374
Here you go.

44
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,374
Anything to take
a bite out of crime.

45
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,674
Judge Weiss is waiting.

46
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:12,474
Well, thank you for helping us
get our nice legal warrant.

47
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:15,974
- Feels good to do the right thing.
- Yes, it does.

48
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,494
- Showtime?
- There's seats still available.

49
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,894
I saw the warrant,
heard you were rolling out.

50
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,694
I'm backing you up
with a few uniform patrols.

51
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:53,194
That's not how we do it.

52
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,594
Well, that's how I do it. I wanna make
sure everyone comes home this time.

53
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:00,394
The more the merrier.

54
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:02,794
Good.

55
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:18,194
- Somebody here to see me?
- Over there.

56
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:26,094
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm here to report a hit and run.

57
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,894
- What?
- I was struck by...

58
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,194
...a beautiful black man
driving a big red...

59
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:32,994
- Not here. You have got to go.
- Look, you haven't called.

60
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:35,994
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine, now go.

61
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,594
Why are you
shutting me out then?

62
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,494
I'll call you later.

63
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:45,894
I don't wanna just hear your voice.
I wanna see you.

64
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:50,694
I'll stop by if you leave right now.

65
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,194
Okay.

66
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:58,494
But if you don't show,
I'm gonna be back here tomorrow...

67
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:02,094
...and the day after,
and the day after that.

68
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,194
- Danny.
- Hey, Dutch.

69
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:09,594
Here are those notes and study
guides for the sergeant's exam.

70
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,794
Great.

71
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:14,194
The test is at 7 a.m. In San Pedro.
What's up with that?

72
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:16,294
Lack of sleep thins the herd.

73
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,594
I barely know my name before 8.

74
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:23,894
Got lesson plans, practice tests.
I organized it all.

75
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,594
Should make it easier
for us to review it.

76
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,894
- Thanks. This is a big help.
- When do you wanna go over that?

77
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,094
- Tomorrow night good?
- Good for me.

78
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:38,394
- 9:00, my place?
- Your place, perfect. No distractions.

79
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:44,794
A study date? What kind of
backdoor con is that?

80
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:47,894
I'm helping her study
for the sergeant's exam.

81
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:50,794
Unless the first question is,
"Will you sleep with me?"...

82
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,394
...you're wasting your time.

83
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:22,994
Okay. Hang back.
Once we're inside...

84
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:26,794
...cover the exits.
I'll call you out.

85
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,094
Police, freeze!
Put that gun down!

86
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,094
Get it down!
Put the gun down!

87
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,594
Put your hands in the air!
Put them on your head!

88
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:08,594
On your head!
Put your hands on your head!

89
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,794
All right, we're clear.
We're clear.

90
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:16,294
- He's done. Cuff him.
- Ronnie.

91
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:18,894
- All right, call them up.
- We're secure.

92
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,494
One dead Armenian,
three to take home.

93
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:24,894
- Copy that. Code Four. Code Four.
- We're Code Four.

94
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,694
King, call for a body wagon.

95
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,194
- Cover that door.
- I'm there.

96
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,394
- Cover the back.
- Okay.

97
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:33,594
No one in or out not wearing a badge.
Mike, come with me.

98
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:41,094
- That don't look pink.
- It's not the right kind of light.

99
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:42,694
Get this stuff downstairs.

100
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,494
- Load them up.
- Thank you, sir.

101
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,294
Easy with that. Don't spill it
all over the place.

102
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:03,294
Hey. Jesus Christ here was
the shooter. Keep him separate.

103
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:05,494
Gotcha.
Come on.

104
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,894
Okay, Ronnie,
you got the ball.

105
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:11,194
You know how much fat
is in that cookie?

106
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,794
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

107
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:16,894
No, I'm serious.

108
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:19,294
Those are sugarcoated lard balls.

109
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,994
- Have you looked at your waist lately?
- Come on, Shane.

110
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,994
Get to it.

111
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:28,994
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

112
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,294
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

113
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:33,494
And...

114
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:36,894
...bag it.

115
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:46,094
Don't want my kids to end up
in U.C. Northridge hell.

116
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,594
- Hey, I went to Northridge.
- Majored in "Where's the Keg At"?

117
00:09:50,494 --> 00:09:53,694
- That's funny.
- Deliver this package to Rondell.

118
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,694
Right.

119
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,494
Hey, nice job, guys.

120
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:17,194
Way to go, guys.

121
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:20,094
Four bricks of Peruvian pink, people.

122
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:05,594
Hey, angel.

123
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,894
- What?
- You're five hours late.

124
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:12,894
- It's work.
- Yeah, well, I have to go to work too...

125
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:15,494
...in about five hours.
- Hey.

126
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,894
What? We just took down
some bad guys.

127
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,494
- I'm feeling it.
- Well, it doesn't mean I have to.

128
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:23,494
- Just give me 15 minutes.
- A marathon.

129
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:27,394
- 15 minutes. 15 minutes.
- All right.

130
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:33,694
- Four keys. Nice bust.
- Yes. Very nice.

131
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:41,794
- Don't see any money in the log.
- That's because there wasn't any.

132
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,094
- Major drug deal and no cash?
- Nope.

133
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:48,794
Just a million in powder,
a killer and two drug collars.

134
00:11:48,994 --> 00:11:51,594
Sorry. Slow night.

135
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:55,994
I guess if that's what you put
in the book, then that's what you found.

136
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,394
Look, it was a delivery, not a buy.

137
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:07,294
Why is it that no matter what I do,
you always assume the worst?

138
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,294
Have you given me a choice?

139
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,594
Believe it or not,
we want the same things:

140
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:15,394
Taxpayers safe,
bad guys behind bars.

141
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:18,794
I just wanna make sure
we're going about it the same way.

142
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:27,694
I know you blame me for Terry's death.
It was my command.

143
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:30,694
- I deserve that.
- Yeah, you do.

144
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:33,494
But what happened that night...

145
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:38,294
...if I could change it, I would.

146
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,194
I can't.

147
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:44,594
Neither can you.

148
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:13,994
You gotta be shitting me.

149
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,394
You're a cop.
Why couldn't you call it in?

150
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,994
- It's complicated. Police issues.
- What's that mean?

151
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:24,394
You have no idea how bad
I need for you to be quiet right now.

152
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:27,994
- We've been down this block 3 times.
- Unless you see a black Navigator...

153
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,694
...there should be nothing
coming out of your mouth.

154
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,994
- Black Navigator...
- Not funny!

155
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,194
- No, a black Navigator.
- It's not funny!

156
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,694
Hey.

157
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:41,494
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, pull over!

158
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:46,294
Pull... I'm a cop!
I'm a police officer!

159
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:48,094
Pull...
I swear to God.

160
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,794
- Pull over! Hey! Pull over! Pull over!
- Shane.

161
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:54,594
- Pull over right now! Goddamn it!
- Oh, my God.

162
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,494
- Pull your car over!
- Shane.

163
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:59,794
Pull over! Right there!
Pull over! Yeah!

164
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:02,494
Stay there. Right there.
You, come here!

165
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:04,494
You understand English?
Come here.

166
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:07,594
- Right now.
- Take the truck, man! Just take it!

167
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,894
- Don't shoot us, dude.
- Shut up. I'm a cop.

168
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:12,094
What'd we do?

169
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,794
You stole a police vehicle,
you little shitheads.

170
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:17,294
It's my mom's car.

171
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:34,894
Tampons.
No.

172
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:43,494
What? What?

173
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,794
- Let me do that.
- I got it.

174
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:51,794
- You make it too strong.
- Okay.

175
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,094
You're up early.

176
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:55,794
Thought I heard Matthew
having a nightmare last night.

177
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:57,594
- Did you hear Cassidy coughing?
- No.

178
00:14:57,794 --> 00:15:00,294
I think she's getting
what the baby had.

179
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:02,894
- The doctor's at 3:30.
- I know.

180
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,994
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:12,094
- Good morning, Corrine.
- Morning.

182
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:17,394
- What are you doing here?
- I kind of lost the truck last night.

183
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:21,594
You know,
the one with the stuff inside.

184
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:23,394
What?

185
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,794
I'm gonna go check on Cassidy.

186
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,894
- You lost the Navigator?
- Somebody stole it.

187
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,794
- With the drugs inside.
- Yeah.

188
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:35,494
- Where were you?
- At Amy's.

189
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,494
You stopped to get laid?
What the hell were you thinking?

190
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:40,994
I was thinking about getting laid.

191
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:44,594
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

192
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,994
I was wrong.

193
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:54,794
- So, what do you wanna do now?
- We got about four more hours...

194
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,994
...before that truck is
on the way to Mexico City...

195
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:01,394
...in about 10,000 pieces,
and our score's out on the street.

196
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,494
Call Lem and Ronnie,
get them to the clubhouse.

197
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,894
Nobody steals from us.

198
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,781
That quick, it had to be a pro.

199
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:13,581
- It's being chopped as we speak.
- So they have the drugs.

200
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:16,781
- And I'm out 50 K.
- We're all out 50 K.

201
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,281
- Maybe they're just letting it cool off.
- You hold onto that little dream.

202
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,181
Go to Rondell.
Tell him what happened.

203
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,181
- Tell him what happened?
- He'll hear about it anyway.

204
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,881
- All right.
- You, come with me.

205
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,681
I can't wait to tell Rondell.

206
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,581
Vic, my man.

207
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,281
- Officer Hoffman.
- Vic.

208
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,481
- Hollywood.
- What's up, Hoff.

209
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,281
- What you got yourself?
- Green Jeep.

210
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:55,181
Had a couple nibbles, no bites.
What can I do you for?

211
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,281
- Who's chopping the big trucks?
- What kind?

212
00:16:58,381 --> 00:16:59,481
- Navigator.
- Year?

213
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,081
- Brand new.
- 2002 Lincoln Navigator.

214
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,781
A few places offhand. Currently the
demand is greater than the supply.

215
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:10,681
- Where's demand the greatest?
- Hold on, hold on.

216
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,481
Slow day.

217
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:21,481
Look, main shop is in your part of town
where they chops those monsters.

218
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:27,581
Skinny Polish prick. Mark Wojo...
Wojohowitz or something like that.

219
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,881
- Don't tell him I sent you.
- Thanks, man. I owe you.

220
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,981
If you need another guy
on your team, man...

221
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:37,681
...maybe you'll toss my name
in the hat. I could use the action.

222
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:41,881
Who knows? Might be a new spot
opening up any day now.

223
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,781
Well, all right.

224
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,681
So many rocks, so little time.

225
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,881
Nothing like the bust
last night, though, huh?

226
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,381
That was a big one.

227
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:53,381
- What was the final score on that one?
- Four bricks.

228
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,081
Four?

229
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:59,081
Mackey sure knows how
to pull them out of his ass.

230
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:01,181
You might as well talk to us.

231
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,481
We've got four cops who saw you
blow your buddy's brains out.

232
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,981
You know what that means?

233
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,281
One of them could
get hit by a bus and we'd...

234
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:12,281
Still have three cops who could
put you away for first-degree murder.

235
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,281
You listening to me?
Add that to the trafficking...

236
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:19,181
Charge and, well, your prospects
aren't looking too pretty.

237
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,881
Tell me where you
got the drugs.

238
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,281
Tell me about your buddy Margos,
and his drug connections.

239
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,881
- You listening to me?
- I say something funny?

240
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:33,481
What if I stuffed big blue bananas
in your ears and set them on fire?

241
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,281
Any of this getting through?

242
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,381
This guy ignores me almost as much
as my kids did in high school.

243
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:44,181
- Nothing?
- No one's talking.

244
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:47,781
- They're all terrified of him.
- Anything on the prints?

245
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,881
Only Dizarian's came up on Interpol.
Lokely's got a Glendale address.

246
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,581
He's been questioned,
but not charged in...

247
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:57,381
...Kosovo, Bogotá, Sri Lanka.
- Frequent flier.

248
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:02,381
He just came back from a 36-hour
holiday from Chiclayo, Peru.

249
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,581
Harvest-time.

250
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,681
- Get a warrant to search his place.
- Yeah.

251
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,381
Revenge? Crime of passion?

252
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,981
He insult your mother?
Having a bad hair day?

253
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,481
Let me know if I'm getting warm.

254
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,381
- Yeah.
- This Universal Studios?

255
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:28,081
- What? No.
- What, you mean this ain't City Walk?

256
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,481
- Are you guys for real?
- Looky here.

257
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:33,681
Looks like a vehicle being
stripped for illegal distribution.

258
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,681
I'll be damned.
In plain sight too.

259
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,381
- It's a good thing we're policemen.
- No way.

260
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:41,681
Think that Universal thing's
gonna hold up in court?

261
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,181
Well, maybe, maybe not.
In the meantime, it looks like...

262
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,681
...we'll have to return these
to their owners...

263
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,081
...and bring you in,
Polish prick Mark.

264
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,181
- All right, what do you guys want?
- Blue Navigator.

265
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:57,581
- Don't have one.
- You get any offers last night?

266
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,881
Answer the question.

267
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,981
- I get to keep these?
- If you make me happy.

268
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:06,481
A guy Ricardo called.
Wanted to unload a Navigator.

269
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,981
- Ricardo have an address?
- Yeah. He's in Silver Lake.

270
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,481
Where in Silver Lake, asshole?

271
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:33,881
Must like you, officer. It's the first
thing this faggot's said all day.

272
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,281
- Hey, Dutch.
- Hey.

273
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,281
You interviewed that Armenian, right?

274
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:50,181
"Interview" would imply that
a conversation took place.

275
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,681
- This guy didn't say a word.
- He did to me.

276
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,681
- When?
- Just now.

277
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:56,981
- What'd he say?
- I guess it was Armenian.

278
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:00,481
It sounded something
like "hamal v otcar."

279
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:07,681
- Hamal v otcar.
- Hamal v otcar.

280
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:10,781
- You okay?
- Yeah. That guy just creeps me out.

281
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:12,481
Don't let him.
He's behind bars.

282
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,181
- I'll check on this.
- Thanks.

283
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:21,881
What the hell?

284
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:24,981
- Who are you guys?
- Shut up.

285
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,681
I'm trying to sleep here.

286
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:29,481
Where's the Navigator
you tried to unload last night?

287
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,681
How'd you get in my bedroom?

288
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,781
Look, I didn't jack it.
It was Dina.

289
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,781
- Who's Dina?
- Girl I'm trying to break into the game.

290
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,081
He's trying to bone.

291
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:48,381
- Where can we find Dina?
- Who are you guys?

292
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:53,581
Hey, call Lem and Ronnie and
have them bring you over to Dina's.

293
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,981
- Where are you going?
- I got somewhere to go.

294
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,081
- Where?
- You're not exactly...

295
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:00,781
...in a position to question
my decisions.

296
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,781
Just call me when you
have Dina or the drugs.

297
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,681
- Officer Sofer.
- Detective Mackey.

298
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,681
- What you got there?
- Notes.

299
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:15,581
Sergeant's exam.
Dutch is gonna help me out.

300
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,781
Dutchman isn't pulling the old
I'll-help-you-study...

301
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,481
...you-help-me-get-laid
manoeuvre, is he?

302
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,781
- He'd like to help me pass.
- He'd like to help you out of your pants.

303
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,081
Last night, Shane ran in
for a Slurpee and managed...

304
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:35,381
...to get our police-issue
vehicle jacked.

305
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:38,781
- Ouch.
- Yeah. Had our weapons in it too.

306
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:41,981
That stuff hits the street and gets
traced back to us...

307
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:45,781
...Aceveda will put Shane's balls
in a vice. And mine too, probably.

308
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:50,081
- What's the vehicle?
- 2002 blue Navigator, fully loaded.

309
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,981
I'd like to bring it in
personally, quietly.

310
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,781
Keep my eye open
and give you the heads up.

311
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,481
Thanks.

312
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:01,681
So is that what Shane's calling it
these days, a Slurpee?

313
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,481
I guess so.

314
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,981
Detective Wyms, I was hoping
I could talk to you.

315
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:13,981
- About?
- Advice.

316
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,781
Well, shouldn't you be going
to your P-3 for advice?

317
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:19,281
I'd rather talk to you.

318
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,881
- Why? Because I'm black?
- No.

319
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:24,781
Better not be because
I remind you of your mother.

320
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:27,181
No, ma'am.

321
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,681
I mean, detective.

322
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,681
Never mind. I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

323
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,781
Officer.

324
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,981
What is it?

325
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:47,281
I think I may have seen another cop
do something illegal on the job.

326
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:50,881
- And?
- And I don't know what to do about it.

327
00:23:54,381 --> 00:24:00,681
You're talking about jeopardizing
two careers here: His and yours.

328
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:02,881
Mine?

329
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,581
Nobody likes a rat, especially one
who hasn't proven himself.

330
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:10,481
- So I should keep this to myself.
- No, I didn't say that.

331
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:15,181
You gotta ask yourself if it's something
bad enough to risk that kind of heat.

332
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,481
Is it something you can't
live with holding?

333
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:23,481
You're certain there
were six bricks?

334
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:27,281
Six or seven.
Definitely more than four.

335
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,781
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah.

336
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:36,881
- I know it wasn't easy.
- No, sir.

337
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:41,081
We'd be a lot better off with more
men like you and fewer like Mackey.

338
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,181
So, what happens now?

339
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:50,081
Can you check on when
the blue Navigator was checked in?

340
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,881
Don't have to. Wasn't.

341
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:55,581
Supposed to be in five hours ago.
Wilshire's been asking for it back.

342
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:03,781
- He's supposed to be the best.
- They say that about every doctor.

343
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,581
- Yeah.
- Is Shane with you?

344
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,281
No. Why?

345
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,281
Just got a complaint from a woman
who said a police officer...

346
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,781
...fitting Shane's description,
assaulted her son at gunpoint...

347
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,581
...claiming he stole
a police vehicle.

348
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,881
You sure she's not
some crackpot?

349
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,581
Where's that blue Navigator
you signed out last night?

350
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,081
Don't know.
I'll ask Shane when I see him.

351
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:30,481
- I need that truck back now.
- Loud and clear. Gotta run.

352
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,481
- Sorry.
- Quite all right.

353
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,681
Why don't you both have a seat.

354
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:40,581
So, Mr. And Mrs. Mackey,
how are you both doing today?

355
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:43,081
You tell us.
How'd the testing go?

356
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,981
The past three sessions have
gone well. You're very lucky.

357
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:49,481
Matthew is a charming,
intelligent little boy.

358
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,581
He also has autism.

359
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:57,181
- What?
- Autism.

360
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,681
- Oh, God.
- Wait a minute.

361
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:05,481
He's a little shy, behind a bit...

362
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,981
...but autism? Jesus.

363
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:11,581
What does that mean?

364
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,881
It's a hard word to hear, but it's also
a very misunderstood word.

365
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:18,481
- Matthew's a beautiful child. He's...
- I know my son is beautiful.

366
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,981
- I understand what you're feeling.
- Really.

367
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,981
I have two autistic boys of my own.

368
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,981
- Two?
- Oh, man.

369
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:29,281
Yes. I felt everything
you're feeling twice.

370
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,881
What's gonna happen to him?

371
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,781
- He's going to grow up.
- What about school?

372
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,981
He may be best served
in a special program.

373
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:40,381
Special? What do you mean, like
blue-bus special? That's not my kid.

374
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:45,581
I mean, look at him.
He's just Matt.

375
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,481
I knew something was wrong.

376
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,981
He could stay in his present
school with some speech therapy...

377
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,381
...and special-skills instruction.
- Is he gonna be normal or not?

378
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,581
With the proper support, he will be able
to make gains to the best of his ability.

379
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:02,481
And with intervention,
the prognosis is very good.

380
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,281
He's just gonna need a lot of love
and work to get there.

381
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:07,781
He's got the love.
What kind of work?

382
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:11,781
Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm a cop.

383
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,081
- What?
- We are so screwed, man.

384
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:19,081
Aceveda just put a statewide
APB out on the Navigator.

385
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,781
What's up?

386
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,481
Roommate said this Dina girl went to
go get waxed. She didn't know where.

387
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,281
- You got anything more vague?
- What should we do?

388
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:39,081
Aceveda gets ahold of this truck, he's
gonna do a chem match on the blow...

389
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,181
...our fingerprints
are all over the bricks.

390
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:43,481
We'll all crash and burn
because of you!

391
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,181
Christ, Amy's not even that hot.

392
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,481
- Come on, Lem.
- No, bull!

393
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,981
He's right.
You boned us.

394
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:50,081
Oh, thank you for the support, assholes!

395
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,981
Cut it out!

396
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:53,781
We're not going down.

397
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,581
- You understand me?
- Yeah, yeah.

398
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:59,881
All right. Ronnie, you stay here
and wait for Dina.

399
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:03,081
Lem, they got a bunch of those
wax places over on Olvera Street.

400
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,881
We'll check the muff rippers
over in Little Tokyo. Let's go.

401
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:16,825
Well, if the DA is not gonna file...

402
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:23,325
- You check out Margos' place?
- Yeah.

403
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:26,925
You think this guy was spooky before,
you should see the way he lives.

404
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:29,225
- What'd you find?
- Nothing incriminating.

405
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:33,325
Just a couple hundred maps,
six dictionaries in five languages.

406
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:37,525
- Scanner, digital camera, GameBoy.
- Incense, meditation books.

407
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:41,125
- Disposable diapers.
- A whole case of microwave popcorn.

408
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:43,525
- Hey, no microwave.
- No microwave.

409
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,825
- No fridge, no stove.
- No plates, silverware.

410
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,325
- No soap.
- No toilet paper.

411
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,125
No more.

412
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,625
This guy just gets better and better.

413
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,725
- Break almost over?
- Yeah.

414
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:58,925
Did you get a chance
to look at those notes?

415
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,325
A little.

416
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,925
A lot of stuff to absorb.
Don't put it off too long.

417
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,725
I won't.

418
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:07,625
Hey, Dutch, any luck
with that translation?

419
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:12,225
You know, it's a phonetic spelling.

420
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:15,025
Armenians have this
Eastern-Western dialect thing.

421
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:18,625
- What did your guy say that it meant?
- This is by no means definitive.

422
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,725
But what Margos may have
been saying was...

423
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,225
...delicious feet.
- Excuse me?

424
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,625
- Delicious feet, yeah.
- Oh, God.

425
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,725
You probably just
heard him wrong.

426
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:43,925
Hey, hey.

427
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:51,925
Let's go.

428
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,025
Don't move.

429
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:59,425
Jesus.

430
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,825
He snapped his neck.

431
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:08,525
Let me guess. You're not talking.
Get them out of here.

432
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:11,825
And call Central, have them
get this guy out of my building.

433
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:15,425
Step outside the car by opening
the door from the outside.

434
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,025
Okay.

435
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:22,025
- Sorry.
- Step outside.

436
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,125
- I'm so sorry.
- Turn around.

437
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:30,225
- Put your hands on the window.
- Look, I...

438
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,625
I know it's not your problem, okay...

439
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:36,725
...but I'm sorry.
My dad's drinking again...

440
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:40,225
...and I had to grab my brother
and bolt out of there this morning.

441
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:44,425
It was so crazy.
God, I was so scared.

442
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:48,225
Well, sorry. Listen, is there anything
we can do for you?

443
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:52,125
Yeah. I just need to pick up my brother
at school before my dad gets there.

444
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:54,425
I mean, God knows
what he'll do to him.

445
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,025
If you could just let me go...

446
00:30:56,125 --> 00:31:00,525
Always pick up your abused brother
in a stolen vehicle with bogus plates?

447
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,125
Damn.

448
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:07,225
- One Tango 13, copy?
- Hey, hold up on that.

449
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:08,925
Stand by.
What?

450
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,025
Told Vic I'd give him the heads up
when we found the Navigator.

451
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,725
- What for?
- I don't know.

452
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:17,525
- He wants to be the one to bring it in.
- It's an APB. We have to call it in.

453
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:20,525
Look, I owe Vic one. Hey!

454
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,325
Where are you going?

455
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,625
You two look like you
needed some alone time.

456
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,625
Get in the car.

457
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:32,825
One Tango 13, we have a confirmation
on that stolen Navigator.

458
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:36,325
Roger, Tango 13.
I'll notify the watch commander.

459
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:40,525
I can't risk a bad mark on my jacket
this early in my career.

460
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:55,325
Anything touched?

461
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:57,825
No, sir, we secured the scene
and made the call.

462
00:31:58,025 --> 00:31:59,325
Okay.

463
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,925
Lock box.

464
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,425
Nothing.

465
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:22,425
Goddamn it.

466
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,825
He called it in before
I could stop him.

467
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:32,025
- Are you kidding me?
- What's his problem?

468
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,825
Look, he's just learning.

469
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:36,625
Look, the good news is
they didn't find those weapons.

470
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:40,425
- Did he find anything?
- Just Dina.

471
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,725
Looks like I located
your missing truck.

472
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,925
Was hoping I'd save you the trouble.

473
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:49,825
- All's well that ends well.
- Yeah.

474
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,725
- You're in deep, Dina.
- Yeah?

475
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:04,525
Shoplifting, assault.
Now grand-theft auto.

476
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,225
- What's next?
- Thinking about the police academy.

477
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:11,125
Why don't you go
get me an application.

478
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:15,725
You think this is a game, little girl?
This is real time in real prison.

479
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:19,525
Okay. Are you going somewhere
with this scared-straight angle?

480
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:23,425
Or is this where I tell you how my
daddy used to crawl into bed with me?

481
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:30,425
I wanna know what
you found in the Navigator.

482
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,825
I heard someone call you "captain."

483
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:37,325
I mean, isn't a stolen car case
normally a little below your radar?

484
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,325
You wouldn't be here...

485
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:42,325
...if I didn't have what you wanted.
- Where are the drugs?

486
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,525
They're safe.

487
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,925
Tell me where, and I'll make sure
the auto theft goes away.

488
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:56,525
Until I see it, I don't say it.
In writing, signed by the DA.

489
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:17,125
- Hey. That the car thief stuff?
- Yeah.

490
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:20,125
Hey, I hear you're
looking for another stripe.

491
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,425
- Yeah. See you.
- All right. Good luck.

492
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,825
Thanks.

493
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:29,325
She made three phone calls
after she stole the truck.

494
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:33,025
Two to her roommates and the other
to a pawnshop in Echo Park.

495
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:38,525
- Pemble & Pemble on Esther.
- Head for Esther in Echo Park.

496
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:42,825
- Man, do I owe you one.
- Please. At best, I'm even.

497
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:47,825
Stop staring at my feet,
you Balkan freak.

498
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:51,325
- "What"?
- Nothing.

499
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,525
Danny.
Come with us.

500
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,025
I think Aceveda got Dina to talk.
I gotta go.

501
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,925
- Damn it.
- What?

502
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,425
Hey, man, we're not closed yet.

503
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:12,025
Yo, sprechen sie Englisch, skinhead?
I said, we're not closed yet.

504
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:25,125
In 30 seconds I'll either know
what I wanna know or you'll be dead.

505
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:27,025
- Dina.
- I don't know a Dina.

506
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,725
- How come you have our guns here?
- Talk!

507
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:31,825
- Dina called for Freddy.
- Who's Freddy?

508
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:34,725
French guy.
Helps me out with the night traffic.

509
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,725
- Where are the drugs?
- I don't know. Maybe Freddy took them.

510
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,125
Not good enough!

511
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,325
I swear to God, man, I don't know!

512
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:46,725
Why would I cover for him?
Jesus Christ, he's French.

513
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,825
Where can we find the frog?

514
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,059
Looks like Freddy
couldn't hold his sugar.

515
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,159
Power of the pink.

516
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,459
- Blew a goddamn vessel.
- Oh, that's nasty.

517
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:24,559
All right, go through this place. Make
sure there's nothing here to tie us.

518
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,859
Vic! It's Aceveda.

519
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,759
Hey, let's clean up Freddy! Here we go.

520
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:37,459
- Oh, shit. Clean him up.
- Wipe it all down.

521
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:40,859
Tray. Here's the tray.
Here's the tray. Coming through.

522
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,159
Yeah, yeah. Is that it?

523
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,059
All right, all right.
Run this. Good, good.

524
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:53,344
- You got it?
- Clean fingers.

525
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:59,375
- What's going on here?
- It must've been a hell of a party.

526
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:06,506
- What happened to him?
- Looks like an OD. Found him that way.

527
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:10,406
- Been dead a while. Really dead.
- Yeah. We were about to call it in.

528
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:14,606
You were about to call it in.
What are you doing here?

529
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:19,106
Fair question. Tracking down the guns
from our stolen ride.

530
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:23,406
- Yep. All's here and accounted for, sir.
- Can't have them hitting the streets.

531
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:31,606
- Didn't want them in the wrong hands.
- Where's Mackey?

532
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:37,755
Hey. Thought he wouldn't mind
if I used the can.

533
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,555
What are you doing there, captain?

534
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:43,255
I'm looking for something.

535
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:53,755
- Where is it?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

536
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:57,455
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

537
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,255
I'll see you back at the barn.

538
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,455
Turn it inside out.

539
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,955
Every inch.

540
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:35,855
- I thought you were working.
- Yeah. I gotta go back.

541
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:37,755
Just snuck out
to tuck in little man.

542
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:39,855
Better hurry.
He might already be asleep.

543
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:41,255
Okay.

544
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:45,555
- How you doing?
- I'm all right. I'm just a little tired.

545
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:51,055
Yeah. I know.
Don't worry, we'll get through this.

546
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:18,055
What did you get for 38?

547
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:22,955
I answered C.

548
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,455
No, it's B.

549
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,855
Have to report the infraction
immediately to the commanding officer.

550
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:30,755
- There's no latitude on that.
- Stupid rule.

551
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,055
Would you turn in your partner
on something like that?

552
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:39,455
I know how I'd answer on the test.

553
00:39:39,655 --> 00:39:42,155
Hello? Hi.

554
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,455
No, are you okay?

555
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:48,555
No, come on over. Okay.

556
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:51,555
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

557
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,955
A friend of mine is having a crisis
and she wants to come over.

558
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:58,255
- She okay?
- I don't know.

559
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:03,655
- We got a lot of work done tonight.
- Yeah.

560
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:07,855
Hey, you're a good teacher.

561
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,955
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

562
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:13,855
We'll dive into administrative
and procedural.

563
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:17,955
It's dry stuff, but you can't pass
without nailing it.

564
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,955
- Good night.
- Night. I hope your friend's okay.

565
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,555
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

566
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,155
Okay.

567
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:31,755
Thanks.

568
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:37,655
Sorry about today, it was such a faggot
thing to do. Showing up at your work.

569
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,455
Don't do it again.

570
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:42,055
I won't.

571
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,455
You gonna sit?

572
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:51,055
I really am sorry.

573
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:53,855
I'll make it up to you.

574
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:58,355
I can't be the person that you want me
to be. I shouldn't even be here.

575
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:04,355
- You've never come back, have you?
- This is stupid.

576
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:10,455
What's stupid are the late-night cruises
and anonymous hummers in your car.

577
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,455
What?

578
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:18,155
I read a page of your diary?

579
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:23,555
You don't know anything about me.
Things that I believe, things that I see.

580
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:26,255
- You're a good person.
- I'm doing a bad thing.

581
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:28,155
You deserve to be happy.

582
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:30,055
You ever read the Bible?

583
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,855
Scripture teaches...

584
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:38,455
Never mind.

585
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,455
You came back.

586
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,055
Start listening to yourself.

587
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:14,755
- You're here late.
- I'm e-mailing my girls.

588
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:16,855
Just got a call from Central.

589
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:20,655
Margos Dizarian
escaped from the paddy wagon.

590
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:22,955
What? How?

591
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:27,755
Jimmied open the back door, dove out
at 40 miles an hour in his cuffs.

592
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:32,055
- Disappeared down an alley.
- Jesus.

593
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:35,755
- I know.
- That's a special kind of crazy.

594
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:39,655
Very special.
Just thought you should know.

595
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:44,855
I wish I didn't.
God knows where he is right now.

596
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,355
You okay?

597
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:57,555
Not really.

598
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:01,155
I'm just kind of all over the place.

599
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:05,755
- Job?
- Yeah. And I...

600
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,355
Brutal day.

601
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,955
Come on.

602
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:23,055
Where are you?

603
00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:26,055
I don't know.

604
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:32,355
I got something going on with my kid.

605
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:36,955
You don't wanna hear it.

606
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:41,255
Let's talk about something else.

607
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:43,455
Yeah.

608
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:05,455
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.

609
