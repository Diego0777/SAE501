2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,160
What's up, boss?

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,839
Seen the new 20?

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,409
Yeah, man
The colors are funky

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,002
Yeah. The old ones are gonna be phased out
of the system over the next year or so.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,674
So what does that mean
about our money train 20s?

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,774
Means we have to unload our 20s
sooner than we wanted to

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,445
before they stand out too much.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,419
Shit

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,083
So Claudette's in charge
of our team now?

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,558
That's the way she sees it

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,653
- You had a female boss before?
- You ever met my daughter?

13
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,325
She's insisting
we go mini-putting.

14
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,493
So how do we deal with her?

15
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,936
Kill her with kindness. Couple of months,
we'll get our freedom back.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,941
It's not like
we can't use the break

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,978
Catching those preppy lawyers
with their pants down.

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,048

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,515
I think you guys
got the wrong room

20
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,519
Wyms told us to shack up here
We're, uh, the Decoy Squad

21
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,988
We just transferred in
I'm Walon Eddie, Annie, Trish

22
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,583
Vic Mackey
It's a little crowded in here

23
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,186
Why don't I talk to my captain, see if
I can scrounge you guys up some new digs

24
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,198
- Seems okay to me
- Yeah We can make it work

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,860
What's that smell?

26
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,372
Oh I've been playing homeless
for the last three days Kinda ripe, huh?

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,635
Where's the, uh,
shower around here?

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,870
First door on the left

29
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,684
- Look. I need to go to work.
- Then go already

30
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,118
Well, I don't want to leave
arguing What's the problem?

31
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,315
Nothing.

32
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,325
What are you doing?
This doesn't have to be a thing.

33
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,895
You don't want me here

34
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,931
I said I thought it was a little
fast for you to be moving in

35
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,264
That doesn't mean that I don't
want you here when I get home

36
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,706
- Shit

37
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,609
Hey Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

38
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,514
- What, couldn't find the shower?

39
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,883
- Yeah, I found it Thanks
- Where's the rest of your team?

40
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,515
I gave Ronnie a pass. He's seeing
a plastic surgeon about his face.

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,651
- And Shane?
- Car battery died

42
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,695
- He'll meet us
- Okay

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,425
Our first target: prostitution

44
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,502
We've mapped out
four key red light zones

45
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,503
Phase one: Get the girls
off the street

46
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,505
Phase two:
Nail the johns

47
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,041
Temporary processing station's
been set up to expedite arrests.

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,044
Also, media crews will be filming
to discourage offenders

49
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,671
and anyone watching
from ever coming back.

50
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,341
The DA's office
has been helpful as well

51
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,547
Members of your team can now
show their, uh, members to the girls

52
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,589
Whoa We get to show our dicks?

53
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,386
- Time to pull out the pipes, fellas

54
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,257
Only to convince them that
you're not law enforcement

55
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,627
They can look
They can't touch

56
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,632
- Their loss

57
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,964
Chicken head, 2:;00.

58
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,436
Drive-through blow jobs

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,838
All right. I'm rollin'up.

60
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,410

- It's too nice a night to be lonely

00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,616

64
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,085

00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,058

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,029

68
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,623
- Halloween's early this year Want some candy?

69
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,902

70
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,972
Well, how do I know
you're not a cop?

71
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,304
I am a cop
See my badge?

72
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,010
Go, brother!

73
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,411
Oh, that just made my week

74
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,475
Head's 50. Sex is 75.
Anal's a hundred.

75
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,385
- Hey. Sorry.
You wanna be my back door baby?

76
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,923
- Where the hell you been?
- Dealin' with some stuff

77
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,653
Well, next time pick up a phone
Or at least answer yours

78
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,559
We got an assault
in progress. You guys see that?

79
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,599
- Lem, hit it!

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,170
Police!

82
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,210
- Get off
- Come here

83
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,711
- I got the runners!
- Get off, you asshole!

84
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,806
- Freeze! Police!
- You're under arrest, princess

85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,908
All right, ladies. Easy.

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,281
-Just relax
- Ow! My arm!

87
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,016
Everybody calm down!

88
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,524
Hey, I know you, right?

89
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,994
- No
- Yeah.

90
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,158
You're the cop that was there
when Connie got killed

91
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,032
I saw you at the funeral.
I was her friend.

92
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,867
You were too, right?

93
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,845
What do you want?

94
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,075
My pimp kicked me out on the street
Won't let anyone else take me in

95
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,083
I got no protection.

96
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,712
Well, looks like it's time to relocate then
Or find a new line of work

97
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,722
- Please! I just--
- Sorry

98
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:56,056
Connie said you helped her
Said you looked out for her and Brian

99
00:04:56,162 --> 00:05:00,462
Connie was just an informant of mine
Dropping her name is doing you no good

100
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,034
- But I heard you helped her out ofjams--
- You heard wrong

101
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,196
Please You're a cop
They're gonna kill me out there

102
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,966
Do something for me.

103
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,386
I'm not gonna judge
the life you chose

104
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,718
but I'm not gonna get
sucked into it either

105
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,157
Good luck

106
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,991
Ripped by:

107
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,396
Hound

110
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,335
Oh, my. You two
dirty up quite nicely.

111
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,571
Oh, this? Just a few
rags from my closet

112
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,579
I'll give you a full
runway show sometime

113
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,581
She's not kidding.
These are hers too.

114
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,015
All these arrests
are for solicitation?

115
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,020
Assault and battery Buys us an extra
three to six months off the street

116
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,852
Sorry to set the bar so high
your first night on the job

117
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,926
Well, we'll see if we can keep up

118
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,086
- Thanks for coming
- Yeah I had a flat

119
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,096
I got there as quick as I could

120
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,063
I told her your battery died

121
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,000
It was personal
It won't happen again

122
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,599
I talked to the hooker who got jumped

123
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,144
She's willing to build
a case against her pimp

124
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,146
I talked to her too
She's a liar

125
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,614
Then she should fit
right in on your team

126
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,651
Work with her

127
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,221
I've sent a message
to the gals and johns

128
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,552
and I'd like to send one
to the pimps too

129
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,557
You're the boss

130
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,856
I thought
you had that hooker sting.

131
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,300
It's in motion
I heard you got a call

132
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,304
I thought I'd check in.

133
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,500
Victim's name is Isabel Nelson
Raped by a lone male

134
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,339
Guy was waiting in the house
naked when she came home.

135
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,278
- Left with jewelry, a little cash.
- Is that her?

136
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,839
That's her daughter.
Isabel's 73.

137
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,481
He had a ski mask
covering his head

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,455
Was he black? White?

139
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,084
White Maybe Mexican
Not black

140
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,595
Do you remember anything
about his body?

141
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,564
Tattoos? Birthmarks?
Anything?

142
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,135
All I saw was his--

143
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,138
And it didn't look anything
like my husband's used to look

144
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,437
Well, we can talk
about this later

145
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,002
I want to help
He shouldn't have done this!

146
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,750
Is it true that, uh,
he didn't leave right away?

147
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,956
He wanted to know where my
jewelry was, and he took it

148
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,824
Then he laid down
on the bed again

149
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,091
Next to me
He put his hands on me

150
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,099
Two or three hours

151
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,135
Was he holding you down?

152
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,568
No

153
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,664
He just--

154
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,005
Cuddled with you

155
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,170
That was the worst part

156
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,374
It's okay Good

157
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,053
Would you stop ignoring my
messages and call me back, baby?

158
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,055
Okay? Please

159
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,182
Trouble in paradise

160
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,351
That's one I won't miss

161
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,326

162
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,330
What's up?

163
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm-I'm sorry
I went over your head

164
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,434
I didn't know
she was your boss.

165
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,237
You just don't understand
how dangerous Smooth is

166
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,244
I know pimps.

167
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,645
Only thing original
about them are their names

168
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,547
- Where are you from?
- San Jose

169
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,952
When this is over, why don't you
take a bus, open up shop there?

170
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,115
I like LA

171
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,455
Smooth'll kill you
if he finds out you helped us

172
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,189
Not if you protect me

173
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,131
Let's be clear This is
a one-shot deal, sweetie

174
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,262
Then we're done

175
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,238
The guy in the suit--
What's he in on?

176
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,833
Solicitation. Won't give
his name. Had no I.D.

177
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,108
- Nothing at all?
- Ass Invader?

178
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,616
I've been lookin' all over
Beverly Hills for one of those

179
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,017
Somebody dropped by the screw store
and said, ''Give me one of everything''

180
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,023
He has got a dildo in there
you could snake a drain with

181
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,492
I'll handle this one. Finish
the paperwork,;run it by me.

182
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,065
Captain's real
hands-on here, huh?

183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,066
You could say that

184
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,795
See anything
I should take home?

185
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,310
How are you, David?

186
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,245
Better than you,Javier

187
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,839
That policewoman
made a big mistake

188
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,385
I don't want to get
anybody in trouble

189
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,886
but, you know,
she's acted out of line

190
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,219
How?

191
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,055
She flagged me over
Said she wanted directions

192
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,652
I'm not out there looking
for this, so help me

193
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,459
Come on,Javier I saw the bag
you were arrested with

194
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,399
Embarrassing
It's not illegal

195
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,561
Why didn't you
give your name?

196
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,074
I panicked I-- I'm trying
to save the district from scandal

197
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,510
For God's sake, do you know what would
happen to me if people think I actually did this?

198
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,746
So why cuddle?
Is that a guilt reaction...

199
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,047
or some kind
of emotional souvenir?

200
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,214
''Just because I raped you
doesn't mean we can't be friends''?

201
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,554
Thanks for the assignment
Farrah's a real winner

202
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,756
- What'd she give us?
- Smooth's running a glorified
whorehouse for downtown suits

203
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,459
He keeps a drug stash in the house
in case his guests need a pick-me-up--

204
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,468
you know, ''X,'' oxy, coke

205
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,939
I'll call for a warrant You see
if Shane slept through his alarm

206
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:44,977
- All right. That's the target.

207
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,411
- All right. That's the target.

208
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,947
The drug stash is in the last
bedroom down the hall

209
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,449
- Tavon's got point
- Tavon? What about me?

210
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,951
You already got one strike
against you with Claudette

211
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,522
If something goes wrong,
I don't want you taking a double hit

212
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,682
- Why would something go wrong?
- It won't

213
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,956
- It's on
- Okay. Give up your hardware.

214
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,557
Farrah says they're running clients for
metal on the way inside, so give it up.

215
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,693
Okay You're not packing,
so keep it simple

216
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,136
Get in. Get solicited.
Shane'll call in the signal.

217
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,971
- Who's Smooth's bottom bitch?
- She's the queen whore-- Cocoa

218
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,978
- So how'd you hear about us?
- We came in for the car convention

219
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,412
The boys from Chevy
gave me your number

220
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,314
- Who you like?
- What about you?

221
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,014
You can get the mouth,
but only Smooth gets my booty

222
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,522
- Suck you bone dry for 1 00
- Hope you're worth it

223
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,526
- Now that's mine
- Party favors?

224
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,858
Coke? ''X''? Viagra?

225
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,090
I'll take some ''X''

226
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,667
And get my boy here
some of that Viagra

227
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,566
- He can use the boost

228
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,367

229
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,374
Follow me

230
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,645
You got a bathroom?

231
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,647
Mm-hmm Upstairs

232
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,185
I'm gonna give you something
more than you bargained for

233
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,827
Hey, it's a go Two guys packin'
just inside the front door

234
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,959
Go! Move, move, move!
Come on Move your ass

235
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,196

236
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,205
- Go!
- Go

237
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,400
- Oh, my God!

238
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,409
Shit! It's reinforced

239
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,479
The door's holding
Open it from the inside

240
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,445
- I got it
- Get out of the way!

241
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,482
- It's a raid!
- Where the hell's backup?

242
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,144
- Can't get in
- Get out, girls!

243
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,814
- Hey, get her, man

244
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,892
Let me down there!

245
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,952
- Police! Freeze!
- Where's Tavon?

246
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,430
She's flushing the drugs!
Move! Move!

247
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,728
Get down! Get out of here
right now! Get out!

248
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,167
- We need a ram in here!

249
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,330
- Hurry up!
- Get the ram!

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,170
Give it here! Give it here!
Give it here!

251
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,176
Go! Go!

252
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,145
- Too late
- Get on your feet! Hands on your head!

253
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,375
- Get against the wall!
- Turn to the wall!

254
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,646

255
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,121
- Yes?
- I'm Detective Wagenbach

256
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,091
I'm investigating a break-in last night at the
building next door You notice anyone unusual?

257
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,560
-Just the police
- What about the rest of your family?

258
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,927
It's just me and my son,
Josh, but he wasn't home

259
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,932
- How old is Josh?
- Nineteen

260
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,401
I'm gonna need to talk to him
Have him give me a call

261
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,972
That's my number if you
think of something else

262
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,769
Should I be worried?

263
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,777
That was a lot of commotion
for a break-in

264
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,643
Uh,just make sure you lock up
when you're not at home

265
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,649
Thank you
Uh, excuse me!

266
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,219
Smooth's smarter
than we gave him credit for.

267
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,379
He registered his cathouse
in Cocoa's name

268
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,049
Summer classes
at Pimp U paid off

269
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,322
Well, she's so brainwashed, she'll never roll
on him without a drug charge to hold over her

270
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,398
What are you saying? Everyone
but King Shithead gets busted?

271
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,865
Looks like it's time
for you to catch that bus

272
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,804
I didn't do this
so he could walk

273
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,033
And I didn't do this to settle
some personal grudge of yours

274
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,111
We got his house, his bottom
bitch, most of his girls

275
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,237
It was a good day

276
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,646
No. Use me if you have to.

277
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,119
That cocksucker turned out my 1 3-year-old
sister when she came to visit me

278
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,747
Got her shooting up
Next thing, she's hooking

279
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,883
- Then she gets sick.
- AI DS?

280
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,086
I haven't seen her in two months

281
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,892
Who knows who she's
sucking off for pocket change

282
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,729
Don't let him keep doing this

283
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,065
What do you think?

284
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,071
- Of her half-assed sob story?
- No

285
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,437
Using her to get to Smooth

286
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,568
Could get her killed But if she
doesn't care, why should we?

287
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,839
We send her out of town
when it's done

288
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,246
I say we move on to the next thing
Get her out of our lives

289
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,048
The reason pimp cases are impossible
is because girls won't cooperate

290
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,645
She's willing
I say we go with it

291
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,386
- Saddle someone else with it
- I'm saddling you

292
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,860
Look You want Smooth?
I want my clubhouse back

293
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,990
This isn't a barter
It's an assignment

294
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:04,236
Everyone's saying
Mrs Nelson was raped

295
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,534
Everyone's saying
Mrs Nelson was raped

296
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,539
Ma'am, we don't
discuss ongoing cases

297
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,871
Look I'm alone a lot
when my son's out

298
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,967
and I asked you
if I should be worried

299
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,706
Paul Fets
Have you talked with him?

300
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,510
- He's raped before.
- Paul Fets?

301
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,553
He's a registered sex offender.
Lives across the street from Mrs. Nelson.

302
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,283
Why am I the one checking on this?

303
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,828
Ma'am, there are 34 registered sex offenders
in a five-block area around that apartment

304
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,489
including 1 2 high-risk felons

305
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,192
Fets followed me
into my apartment once

306
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,099
Said he wanted to help
with my groceries

307
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:42,071
If my son hadn't come home
right then, it would've been me

308
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:46,008
- Well, we will talk to him
- He was looking in her window

309
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,705
Mrs Nelson's
About a week ago I caught him

310
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,305
Why didn't you tell me
that this morning?

311
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,478
Because you didn't tell me
you were looking for a rapist

312
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,751
Did you hear there was a woman
raped in the building next to yours?

313
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,689
No

314
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,025
Somebody crawled into her window
Raped her when she came home

315
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,531
Sounds a lot like that trouble
you got into before

316
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,396
Sorry I'm late Hello

317
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:17,532
Mandy Trujillo She was a paraplegic
girl in a wheelchair

318
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,237
You forced her side door open...

319
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,339
went into her bedroom,
put your penis in her mouth, didn't you?

320
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,884
I don't think that way anymore

321
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,945
Maybe you can explain why somebody saw
you looking into Mrs. Nelson's window.

322
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,322
- The same window the rapist went in.
- That wasn't me

323
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,885
Was she home, or did you decide
to come back when she was gone?

324
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,193
I didn't look through her window

325
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,669
And you didn't follow Wanda Ledda
into her apartment either, did you?

326
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,899
I was-- I was trying to help her
with the groceries

327
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,569
She-- She didn't have to tell
the neighbors about me

328
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,206
I-- I don't like that pressure

329
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,911
Be here by 1 0:;00 in the morning.
We'll take a run at your pimp.

330
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,318
Why can't we do it tonight?

331
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,050
'Cause you're not the only woman
in my life who needs attention

332
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,925
Well, where am I
supposed to stay?

333
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,554
Where'd you stay last night?

334
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,828
My place
But it's not safe there

335
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,335
Just give me some money
for a motel.

336
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,602
I already gave you a bus ticket
Feel free to use it anytime

337
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,041
Just call me
and tell me you're okay

338
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,113
Could you do that, please?

339
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,944
Great goddamn day

340
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,647
First Mara, then I gotta share
a locker with Pigpen

341
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,781
- They'll be gone soon
- Yeah, or we will

342
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,157
They made 1 5 arrests
last night Vice!

343
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,891
- So what's with Mara?
- These pimps have it figured out.

344
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,991
If you treat 'em like shit,
they stick to you like flies.

345
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,230
If only swatting
'em away was as easy.

346
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,704
I just don't want
to swat this one away

347
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,574
This is the first gal I've ever been with
that's better than me, you know?

348
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,511
She's not better than you

349
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,141
She's probably
just blowing off steam

350
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,809
Yeah

351
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,822
Just, uh, give her some space
She'll call ya

352
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,326
You goin' out?

353
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,989
Yeah I got my daughter tonight
Mini-putt and ice cream

354
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,090
That's good, man

355
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,069
Yeah Be nice to get away
from all the drama

356
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,264
Mom!

357
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,739
I'm sorry I don't know
what happened

358
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,868
She kept screaming
to come home.

359
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,436
- Go to your room and get ready for bed
- I want Daddy to tuck me in

360
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,448
- Go to your room!
- No!

361
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,451
Listen to your mother
I'll make it up to you I promise

362
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,351
- No, Daddy! Please stay!
- Cassidy, stop this right now!

363
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,857
Hold on. Hold on. Maybe I should stay,
just for an hour.

364
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,294
Cassidy, come here right now
Get over here Listen to me

365
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,390
I know what you're doing,
and it's not going to work, okay?

366
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,766
Your father's going to leave now

367
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,773
If you want to spend time with him,you
will behave when it's his turn to see you.

368
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,311
- Now, let's go
- No, Daddy Please don't go

369
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,379
- Please, Daddy, don't go!
- Go!

370
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,812
- Dad, don't! Please! Dad, please don't!
- Go!

371
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:13,318
- As you can imagine, I deal
with rape and death every day
- I'm sorry

372
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,584
- As you can imagine, I deal
with rape and death every day
- I'm sorry

373
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,658
I don't mind.
I feel like I'm helping.

374
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,162
Like I'm taking bad people away
before they can hurt somebody else

375
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,164
That's not me

376
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,429
In my experience, people
who would rape an old woman

377
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,870
or a crippled lady,
they always do it again

378
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,567
You do know that, right?

379
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,373
You know what a moral compass is?

380
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,218
It's-It's a thing in people that tells them
what's right and what's wrong

381
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,849
They know because this
moral compass guides them

382
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,951
Only it gets broken
in some people. Smashed.

383
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,897
So they do these horrible things,
but it's not their fault

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,333
Their compass is just broken

385
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,535
Can I-- Can I go to the bathroom?

386
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,281
Sure

387
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,250
- This is for girls
- The men's is broken

388
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,617
It's all right
Everybody uses this one

389
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,488

390
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:31,689
I did things

391
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,365
I know

392
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:45,603
What-- All right What if
your moral compass is broken?

393
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,976
How-How--
How do you fix it?

394
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,376
You can't

395
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,384
Isabel, that old woman--

396
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,548
This is the last sexual
experience she's gonna have

397
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,617
Can you even imagine that?
A grandmother!

398
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,357
Imagine if it
were your grandmother

399
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,231
I don't think you want
to hurt anybody again

400
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,865
But you gotta help me
make sure that doesn't happen

401
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,568
I don't wanna be broken

402
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,907
Okay Okay

403
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,005

404
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:33,125
-Javier send you?
- What are we going to do?

405
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,458
-Javier send you?
- What are we going to do?

406
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,830
I don't think there's much
we can do,Jorge

407
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,628
- Sanchez is a friend
- Of yours

408
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,635
He's been supportive of you

409
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,730
Letting him go without processing him while
I look into things is supportive.

410
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,277
He told me it was
entrapment Is it possible?

411
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,438
I plan on talking
to the arresting officer

412
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,917
I remember when a reporter was
asking questions about you once...

413
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,010
about the rape at USC.

414
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,817
I didn't rape anyone
She was an unstable woman

415
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:11,191
But I supported you. And I never
asked you if it was true or not.

416
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,493
Um, tell me
about the Sanchez arrest.

417
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,400
He pulled up to the curb--

418
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,404
- Did you flag him?
- I smiled at him

419
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,997
- I do have a nice smile
- Then what?

420
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,704
I engaged him. He said
the magic words,;I gave the signal.

421
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,611
- Be more specific
- He's into pegging

422
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,245
He said he wanted to do me
with his favorite dildo

423
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,950
then have me strap one on
and return the favor

424
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:44,188
Offered me 1 50 bucks, the cheap bastard.
I've had men go as high as five.

425
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,730
He's claiming it was entrapment

426
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,359
Did you see his bag?
Bondage is more like it

427
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,772
I'm still looking into this case

428
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,774
Don't discuss it with anyone

429
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,607
Hey,you guys took a call
at L.A. Sound Design last week?

430
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,046
- Yeah The one on Sixth Street?
- Yeah. I just took one at the store on Olympic.

431
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,948
I asked the owner
for a surveillance tape.

432
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,114
He goes in the back for two minutes.
Comes out. The tape is ruined.

433
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,886
Ours didn't have a camera

434
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:20,226
Two in two weeks Hey, can I get a copy
of the serial numbers you guys took?

435
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,358
Isn't that for the insurance
company to worry about?

436
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,767
Yeah, but the detectives
are short-staffed This is low priority

437
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,898
I was thinking, you know, maybe
we can sniff around on our own

438
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,739
Just 'cause you've been icing on the sidelines
doesn't mean you have to play Wonder Woman.

439
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,871
I might be able to dig up
the outfit if you're interested

440
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:41,351
- The call didn't seem right to me
- We filed our paperwork

441
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,980
Yeah There was nothing weird
that I can remember about the call

442
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,351
Fine Sorry
to interrupt your dinner

443
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,168
Hey, Danny Give me half an hour,
and I'll pull it all together for you

444
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,500
Thanks

445
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,165
Keep it simple Turn around

446
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,439
You tell him you want back into his stable,
and you'll do whatever it takes to do it

447
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,538
- I asked him before
- Most ofhis girls are in lockup.

448
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,549
Chances are he'll need temps

449
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,245
Can't wait to see his face
when we bust him

450
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,844
Well, if he gets rough,
I'll stop him

451
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,481
I can handle a beating

452
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,617
You won't have to

453
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,129
Bury it

454
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,132
- Don't touch me
- Come on

455
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:38,073
Like you never took a free suck
from Connie We can help each other

456
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,475
-Just put on the goddamn wire
- She said you were nice

457
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,947
All you ever been to me
is an asshole

458
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,413
Place the wire
and follow me

459
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,820
Dutch got a confession
from the rapist.

460
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,791
- Oh, that's great news
- Hey,just curious

461
00:24:55,894 --> 00:25:00,228
We arrested 1 5 johns yesterday
but only booked 1 4

462
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,392
- I released one
- Now I'm even more curious

463
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,369
Javier Sanchez is
the superintendent of schools.

464
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,269
I'm just double-checking
the facts before proceeding

465
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,205
His facts couldn't
be checked from the cage?

466
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm extending him a courtesy

467
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,380
What qualifies as the special
treatment club this week?

468
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,882
As soon as he's processed,
he'll be publicly humiliated.

469
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,476
His career effectively will be over

470
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,954
I was under the impression we were showing
people that things were changing around here

471
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,823
- We are
- Smells like the same cookin' to me

472
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:37,167
You made all these
arrests in the last hour?

473
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,067
Finish the handoff,
then get back out there

474
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,698
We keep haulin' in this many fish,
we might need to find you new digs

475
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,437
- We set?
- YeahJust waitin' for your okay

476
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,310

477
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,213
Yeah Where have you been?

478
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,715
Look You understand that once you go
in there personally, your life's at stake?

479
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,723
Yes

480
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,986
- You're gonna have to get on the bus
- I will

481
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,722
- Look I gotta go
- We're in the middle of something here

482
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,798
I'm sorry Look
I need a personal day

483
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,834
Not a problem

484
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,873

485
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,602
Look who
crawled out from under its rock.

486
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,874
- Can we talk?
- You got nothin' to say, bitch

487
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,779
I'll work twice as hard.
I'll be your best earner.

488
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,944
- I said you have nothin' to say!

489
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,717
- Gotta go

490
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,054
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

491
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,288
You go out, hit it hard enough
tonight, maybe we'll talk

492
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,957
You freak on me again,
I'll kill you

493
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,938

494
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,239
- It's good

495
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,717
We got it on tape
Good job

496
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,259
These turn into bruises,
get some Polaroids

497
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,261
Yeah.

498
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,299
Can I get your opinion
on something?

499
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,494
I'd stick
with the fishnets

500
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,538
French maid's outfit
might be too much

501
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,041
I got stuck between Claudette
and Aceveda on something

502
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,102
- Uh, what exactly are the politics around here?
- Tell me more

503
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,240
- That john I brought in with the goody bag?
- Mm-hmm

504
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,978
Seems like Aceveda wants it to go away
Important guy, I guess

505
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,350
And Claudette has another idea

506
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,515
So, push comes to shove,
which pony would you ride?

507
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,924
Aceveda's still the boss

508
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,691
After that, city council

509
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,824
If he asks for somethin',
do him the favor

510
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,834
Thanks

511
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:57,268
- You like Chinese?
- Sometimes

512
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,811
I'll take you to Chinese
sometime, pay you back

513
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:04,015
- Fets didn't cuddle
- What?

514
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,075
- Fets didn't cuddle
- What?

515
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,847
In his statement he says
he raped her, then he left

516
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,320
He also can't tell me
anything about the jewelry

517
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,790
Thinks he dumped it someplace
but doesn't remember where

518
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,793
We've got a confession

519
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,591
We've got a witness
who saw him at the window

520
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,598
He is slow

521
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,033
This is a guy who raped a woman,
didn't leave a single hair fiber

522
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:29,869
No. Not only have I been chasing
the wrong guy, I caught him.

523
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,876
Give Smooth the money
Be very clear you earned it hooking

524
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,242
That's like $600
It's not enough

525
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,815
You've only been at it
a couple of hours It'll be enough

526
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,817
He won't take this
It's an insult

527
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,750
Make it work
It's all we have

528
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,879
He'll kill me
if I give him this little

529
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,889
We're not gonna
let him hurt you

530
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,892
- No I'll just go to him and explain
- You won't explain anything!

531
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,724
I'll tell him I was working with you,
but I changed my mind

532
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,391
- You tell him that, he will kill you
- Let go of me!

533
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,230
You don't give a shit
about me! You're an asshole!

534
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,930
- He'll take care of me if I tell him the truth
- Don't do it!

535
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,530
I'm not doing this

536
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,439

537
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,342
You think you can just
walk away from me?

538
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,347
Get off of me!

539
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,976
You made me a promise
You told me you wanted this

540
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,055
I don't wanna do this anymore

541
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,824
- 'Cause you're scared?
- He'll kill me

542
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,862
You need to be scared of me

543
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,195
- Vic--
- Back off

544
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,495
Let me just go talk to him

545
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,231
Take it! Now!

546
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,866

547
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,035
Smooth's my bitch

548
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,410
which makes you
my bottom bitch

549
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,212
You're gonna go out there,
you're gonna do what I told you

550
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,448
or I swear to God I will hurt you like
you've never been goddamn hurt before

551
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,650
- You understand?

552
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,421
- Say it!
- Okay

553
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,965

554
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,901
Good

555
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,807
You wanna make me happy, huh?

556
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,938
- Yes
- Sure, you do

557
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,886
Okay

558
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,186
Now, do what I told you

559
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,131
Good girl Go ahead

560
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,873
- What the hell was that?
- I just saved her life You watch

561
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,781
Rolled some tricks for you, baby.

562
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,822
Slow your roll, ho.
Po-po's been cracking down. Come here.

563
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,085
A'ight. Give up the skrilla.

564
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,719
- I can't see her
- We're fine

565
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,821
I see petty cash.
Where's the cheddar?

566
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,900
Sucked a lot
of dicks for that

567
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,401
- You comin' crooked on me, skank?
- That's all the money I got

568
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,994
- You can shove it up your ass.
- What's she doin'?

569
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,540
- She's baiting him Let's go
- That's how it's gonna be?

570
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,442
- Punk-ass bitch You're nothin'
- Oh, yeah?

571
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,037
You don't scare me.

572
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,275
Let go of me!
I said let go of me!

573
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,252

574
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,449
Asshole!

575
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,253
Get back!

576
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,557
Stay still!
Don't fight me!

577
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,093
I got marks You and I can say he hit me
Get him put away longer

578
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,070
I'm not lying for you
We got him for what we got him on

579
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,108
It'll be a long time before another pimp
thinks about laying a hand on me

580
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,804
You forgettin' about
that bus to San Jose?

581
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,780
I don't need it anymore
You're protecting me

582
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,010
No, I'm not
We're done now Finished

583
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,953
Why are you such a shithead?
I chose you over Smooth

584
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,388
I stopped you
from killing yourself

585
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,461
- You stuck a gun in my mouth
- No, I did not

586
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,529
- Now you're not gonna protect me?
- Shut up right now.

587
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,393
You're a bigger
asshole than Smooth!

588
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,730
Even bigger than the one who
turned out your 1 3-year-old sister?

589
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,236
- That's right
- 'Cause I found out the only
sister you have is seven

590
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,274
You're just pissed off that Smooth
stopped you from earning

591
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,833
Is that what you did
to Connie too? Used her?

592
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,244
She trusted you,
and you got her killed

593
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,407
- It's time to go
- You dared that guy to shoot her

594
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,247
Her little boy doesn't have a mother,
and that's your fault!

595
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,253
Wouldn't want you to miss your bus

596
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,482
You didn't give a shit about Connie!

597
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,388
I tolerated her to the extent
she could help me make cases

598
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,393
She's dead because of you

599
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:48,454
No You all find ways
of killing yourselves

600
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,930
Go find yours

601
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,062
Asshole!

602
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,073
You call for backup?

603
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,473
Yeah We got a hit
on a stolen stereo

604
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,637
A Sun Yun Do at this residence
registered online to get the warranty

605
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,647
You sure you didn't want to call SWAT?

606
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,649
You guys were so helpful
breaking this thing

607
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,845
I thought you'd want to
be here for the arrest

608
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,980
- What the hell are these?

609
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,992
Uh, I went to see Isabel
One of them's Fets

610
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:20,190
You showed a 73-year-old
rape victim a penis lineup?

611
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,858
She wants the guy caught
All she saw was the penis

612
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,561
Plus, she picked the wrong one

613
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,002
So whose did she choose?

614
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,098

615
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,803
I couldn't get
anyone else to volunteer

616
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,402
- Ah, Dutch!
- Well, I didn't ask you to look at 'em

617
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,607
It's not like it's anything
you haven't seen before

618
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:43,278
The important thing is Isabel
confirms that Fets isn't our guy.

619
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,852
- We're sending you home.

620
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,656
- Why?
- Because you didn't rape Mrs Nelson

621
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:55,255
But I think about it with other
women,just like you said

622
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,266
Still, you didn't do it

623
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,393
No My moral compass is broken

624
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,270
Um look

625
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,275
That was just
an interrogation technique

626
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,245
I needed you to believe it
because I wanted you to confess

627
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,181
M-Mandy Trujillo
was seven years ago

628
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,377
You've been good
since then, right?

629
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,681
- I tried real hard
- Well, and it's working

630
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,021
There's a Dr Lakeman who's gonna come
talk to you about staying good

631
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,651
I can't go home

632
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:29,256
She told everybody about me
and about Mandy

633
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,565
Everybody hates me And now she's gonna
tell 'em that I did it to that old woman

634
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:37,630
I'll talk to your neighbors, and we're
gonna catch the guy who really did this

635
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,609
Here's my card You call me
if you need anything

636
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,179
Anything

637
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,916

638
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,614
You said you weren't
gonna be here

639
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,558
I wanted to see you for myself

640
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,062
I'm just gonna get the rest
of my things, and I'm leaving

641
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,394
What is your problem?

642
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,871
Why are you acting
like such a psycho bitch?

643
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,873
Just leave me alone

644
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,743
All right Fine Fine You wanna leave?
Then pack your shit

645
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,147
Get out! Here
Better yet, let me help you

646
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,219
What are you sulking for?
You're the one who turned on me

647
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,553
- That's not true
- So what was the plan, huh?

648
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,559
You couldn't afford a car,
so you give up a little ass

649
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,152
play house till you
can make your getaway?

650
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,427
- You're such an asshole
- How is the Lexus driving?

651
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:40,493
- Keep your goddamn car!
- You keep it You earned it

652
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,234
Hope the next guy enjoys it Oh, please
What, are you gonna start crying now?

653
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,073
Come on Let's see it

I'm pregnant

659
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,189
Bullshit

660
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,097
I am

661
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,228
It was an accident

662
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,541
Sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

663
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:26,282
- Well, we'll get married
- Oh, no! Oh, God

664
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,787

665
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,026
Hey Look at me

668
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,054
And I had some more ideas
on your transition team.

669
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,750
And I had some more ideas
on your transition team.

670
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,848
So did Aurora. Maybe we could
get together this week--

671
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,659
Just thought you should know Carlos Izturis
from the Daily News is downstairs

672
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,631
- Ah Hello

673
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,568
He is coming to ask
aboutJavier Sanchez...

674
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,367
being arrested for solicitation

675
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,841
I know Carlos
I can talk to him

676
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:31,404
Good Then you can tell him
I'm moving forward with the arrest

677
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,881
- Give us a minute
- Take a month.

678
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,317

00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,856

712
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:33,198

- Why would I call him?
- We're sending a message.

716

We're assuring people
that we are cracking down

717
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,576
and no one's safe in Farmington

718
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:51,553

00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,304

737

760
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,116

761
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,663
