1
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:07,722
Okay, come on. Take your seats.
Today is warrant-sweep day.

2
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:11,122
I know. We all hate sweeps.
We all hate sweeps.

3
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:15,522
But as long as they've got open
warrants, we've got to serve them.

4
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,322
You've all been assigned several
suspects. Find them. Bring them in.

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:22,822
If you see one of your regulars,
bring them in too.

6
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,022
We've probably got an open warrant
for them as well.

7
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:30,422
Word on the street will spread quickly.
We've only got three to four hours.

8
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:33,422
And listen, these are
the worst of the worst.

9
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:36,022
So watch out for yourself
and your partner.

10
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:39,822
That's it. Go find them.

11
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:42,022
These are all over the place.

12
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:45,022
Hey, anybody got an Echo Park
for a Koreatown?

13
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:49,522
Here. But you gotta take
Alvarado Corridor too.

14
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:56,022
Here. Let me see that. Is that Virgil?

15
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:01,022
Beautiful. Asshole took a swing at me
last time, in front of some kids.

16
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,122
- I got this one.
- Sarge says you got a visitor.

17
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:10,622
Police! Freeze, sucker!

18
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,422
What's the matter?

19
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,422
You all right?

20
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,422
- He had a knife.
- The john?

21
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,722
Okay, let me see.

22
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,922
- Oh, Jesus.
- He seemed normal, you know?

23
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:47,822
- Yeah.
- Even paid upfront.

24
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:50,122
I go to put the condom on,
and the asshole...

25
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,422
...he smacks me,
and he tries to rape me.

26
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,622
What?

27
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,422
I know a rape, for chrissake.

28
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:02,422
All right, what then?

29
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:06,422
I kicked and scratched till I got away.

30
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:11,022
I got some of his licence plate.

31
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:16,022
I want this prick to hurt.

32
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,722
- Dutch.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,422
I need a favour.
Connie here had a bad night.

34
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:25,522
Aceveda dumped a ton of warrants
on my desk. I was wondering...

35
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:29,322
- You want me to serve them for you?
- No, I'll kick down my own doors.

36
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:33,222
Can you get her to a hospital,
find out who cut her up?

37
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:37,322
- Sure. Why don't you come with me.
- I'm fine.

38
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:41,022
We'll get you patched up. You can
tell me what happened on the way.

39
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,122
Go on. I'll check in...

40
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:46,522
- Are you coming too?
- Yeah, I'll check in on you later.

41
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:50,722
Hey, Dutchboy, thanks. I owe you one.

42
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:01,822
- Freeze! Police!
- Get down!

43
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,822
Get down!
Get down on the floor right now!

44
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,922
- Hey, remember me?
- Yeah, I remember.

45
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:09,422
On your face.

46
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,022
- I'll tell you what.
- Hands up.

47
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,822
You tell me when these bracelets
get too tight.

48
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,722
Yeah, just like that.

49
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,422
- Yo, man with the tools.
- Hands up!

50
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:23,222
Put your hands on your head.

51
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,822
Hands on your head. Get out here.
Come on.

52
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:30,422
- Damn. You're...
- Derrick Tripp.

53
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,922
Derrick Tripp, yeah.

54
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:36,022
- Jersey's in town to play the Lakers.
- Put your hands back up.

55
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,222
You miss the exit
for the Staples Center?

56
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:39,822
No, man, I'm just chilling.

57
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:44,122
Yeah, well chilling with cheebas is
a problem here in L.A. Grab some wall.

58
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:47,822
Come on, man. It's just a private party.

59
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:49,822
That's some party favour.

60
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,422
- I got stalkers.
- Is that right?

61
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:55,022
- You got a permit for this?
- Left it in Jersey.

62
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:58,322
Well, that's a shame.
What are we gonna do about this?

63
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,922
Get those geniuses back down
to the Barn.

64
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,322
- All right, let's go. Get up.
- You stay put.

65
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:06,622
Let's go have some fun.

66
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,722
Check this out.

67
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:16,922
It's gonna be a zoo
when we haul this guy in.

68
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,522
- Yeah.
- Never liked him.

69
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,122
- He always gives the Lakers fits.
- Not tonight, he won't.

70
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:26,922
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

71
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:30,522
How'd you like to change
the course of sports history?

72
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:33,122
What do you need it for?

73
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:36,322
We're conducting surveillance
on an apartment across the street.

74
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:39,822
- How long you gonna be here?
- Out by tonight.

75
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:43,322
- You gonna break anything?
- Don't plan on it.

76
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:46,722
It's a bitch to collect from the city,
you know?

77
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,622
Here's a deposit.

78
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:55,422
- Drop them in the mailbox.
- Appreciate it.

79
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,722
Come on.

80
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:07,022
What are we doing here?

81
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:10,322
Keeping you out of the limelight
until we get a handle on this.

82
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,822
Did you do that sneaker
commercial in one take?

83
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,622
No way. That was some CGI mojo.

84
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,722
One take, all real.

85
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,922
You're the man.

86
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:28,022
Sponsors ain't gonna be too thrilled
to hear about this.

87
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:31,822
- I got a morals clause in my contracts.
- Let me see if I can help you out.

88
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,922
Give me one minute.

89
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,922
- Hello.
- Hi, there, captain. Vic Mackey here.

90
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,222
- What are you up to now?
- I got a problem.

91
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:46,122
Just arrested Derrick Tripp
on weapons charges.

92
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,922
The basketball player? Exciting.

93
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,422
Right. He's playing against
the Lakers tonight.

94
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:54,022
We're meeting Matthew's teacher at 7.
Don't forget.

95
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,722
I certainly won't, sir.

96
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,122
Would it help if I dropped off
clothes at work?

97
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:00,422
- Certainly would.
- Okay, then.

98
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:03,322
I'll tell him. Lemansky's got
the address.

99
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:06,522
- Is that it, or should I keep talking?
- That won't be necessary.

100
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:08,622
I'll see you soon.

101
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:12,622
Captain's a big fan. He'll come down
here and make this thing go away.

102
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:16,322
- Cool.
- In the meantime, just chill out.

103
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,922
You, you're nuts, man.

104
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,722
Without Tripp's penetration and
outside shot, the Lakers are a lock.

105
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:28,222
Damn, I gotta call my bookie.

106
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,076
You know what I love? I love what you
said to that ref in game six last year.

107
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:49,176
I had to say something.
That call was weak.

108
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,376
Looked like a foul to me.

109
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,176
Where was you watching it from?
Your 20-inch black-and-white?

110
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:59,476
Hey. We stopped by Big 5.

111
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:03,476
How about a couple autographs?

112
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,776
- The captain's on his way, right?
- Any minute now.

113
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,776
I don't usually sign for free.

114
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:12,376
- You're kidding.
- 150 a pop.

115
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:16,076
- Even little kids?
- People send their kids up to score.

116
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,076
"Derrick, please sign this for me."

117
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,876
Then Daddy turns around
and scalps it on the Internet.

118
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,676
Got that.

119
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,676
Derrick, sign this one
for my son, Matt.

120
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,676
It's on the up and up.

121
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,476
- Yeah, man.
- Cool.

122
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,976
Fifteen million a year, and you
gotta charge for an autograph?

123
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,676
Wouldn't you say that's weak?

124
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,076
The papers print 15 million...

125
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,576
...but after my agent, taxes,
lawyers, publicist...

126
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,076
...and business manager,
15 mil it ain't.

127
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:49,176
Oh, wow, that's rough.
So, what's that, like 6 million?

128
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:53,476
- Ain't 15 mil, is it?
- No, it isn't.

129
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,076
So look, I put a call into Murphy, man.
Spread's six and a half.

130
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:05,676
Lem and Ronnie are in for a grand
each. I'm in for five. How about you?

131
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,576
- I'll pass.
- Are you kidding?

132
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,976
Nobody knows about this.
It's like free money.

133
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,576
The Lakers can clinch home court
for the playoffs.

134
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:17,176
- It's about... It's not about the money.
- Well, it is to this asshole.

135
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,676
Hundred and fifty a pop. I'm surprised
the guy can sign his own name.

136
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,376
- What do you care?
- I don't.

137
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:25,976
What are we gonna do about
the rest of our warrants?

138
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:27,576
Already took care of it.

139
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:35,476
Vic Mackey called,
told me to turn myself in.

140
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:39,176
Line forms over there.

141
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,676
Goddamn warrant sweeps.

142
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,476
Problem, Nathan?

143
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,776
I'm one person doing a two-man job.
Look at this.

144
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:55,276
I know. Fortunately, I have
my MVP running the show.

145
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:56,976
MVP?

146
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,676
Most valuable policeman.

147
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:03,776
I wouldn't schedule these sweeps if I
wasn't sure you'd anchor the desk.

148
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,776
You're not gonna let me down, are you?

149
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,676
Of course not, sir.

150
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,276
That's what I wanted to hear.

151
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,876
- Capt. Aceveda?
- Yes.

152
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,876
Marsha Kramer,
attorney for Derrick Tripp.

153
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,876
The basketball player?

154
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:24,576
No hits on killers raping hookers
at knifepoint.

155
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,876
What about the partial plate?

156
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,676
The one our bag-bride scribbled on
her hand while running for her life?

157
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,476
Six hundred matches. I'll have
her look at every single one.

158
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:37,476
Hooker murders are up
for the entire East Side.

159
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,076
Past few show some similarities.

160
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,776
You're studying killings
on the entire East Side?

161
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:46,376
The whole city. You never know
when a disturbing pattern will emerge.

162
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:50,476
I think I'm witnessing
a disturbing pattern.

163
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,576
I wanna make sure
nothing slips through.

164
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:56,576
You're just looking for something
big and juicy.

165
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,876
Three months ago, Griffith Park,
beaten with a pipe.

166
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,276
Six weeks ago, Eagle Rock,
strangled by hand.

167
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,876
Two weeks ago, liquor-store dumpster,
choked with a rope.

168
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,676
Different locations, different weapons.
Some pattern.

169
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,576
They're all posed facedown.

170
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:16,376
You're stretching, son. Try yoga.

171
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:20,176
Connie was supposed to be victim
number four. We need a task force.

172
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,676
You need more evidence than that.

173
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:25,576
I'm taking it to Aceveda.

174
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,676
All he's gonna do is say no.

175
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,776
No.

176
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:37,276
Let's find the guy who attacked Connie,
try to tie him to the other murders.

177
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,776
Sounds like a plan.

178
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:42,676
Please, this is a mistake.

179
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,176
Where have I heard that before?

180
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,676
- Got another one for you, Nathan.
- I see that.

181
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,176
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

182
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:53,676
- Haven't I seen you hanging around?
- Step back.

183
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:56,876
No, I have, haven't I?

184
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,676
Hanging around outside The Abbey.

185
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,176
- Abbey?
- You know, West Hollywood.

186
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,376
- How come you never go in? It's fun.
- You've got the wrong guy.

187
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,676
Whatever you say, officer.

188
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,476
Stand back and wait in line.

189
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:15,676
I told you, he's not here.

190
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,276
I gave you a description.
Why can't Vic take care of this?

191
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:23,476
We're helping you, hon. Keep looking.

192
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,176
Hey, wait.

193
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,976
That's him.

194
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:34,576
- That's the asshole.
- William Greeley.

195
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:38,776
"Trespassing on federal grounds
as part of an environmental protest.

196
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:41,976
Three years ago. Charges dismissed."

197
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,876
Not exactly a criminal mastermind.
You sure?

198
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,676
Of course I'm sure.

199
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:49,376
I'll call for a warrant.

200
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:56,976
So you and Vic are...

201
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,376
...friends?

202
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:01,876
Interesting.

203
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:07,176
Vic and me have a bond
that transcends sex.

204
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,004
Don't move!

205
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,949
Police! Freeze!

206
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,649
What is this?

207
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,285
The room's clear.

208
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,346
- William Greeley.
- Yeah.

209
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,667
Put some clothes on, man.

210
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,967
Bolt cutters!

211
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,967
Hey, stay out of there!
You got no right!

212
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:03,267
You wanna bet on how many heads
he's got icing down in there?

213
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,667
No, thanks.

214
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,667
It's not mayonnaise.

215
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,567
You keep away from my children!

216
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,167
No!

217
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,567
Vic? Vic, a word, please.

218
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,167
Sure.

219
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,767
- Who's your friend?
- This is Marsha Kramer...

220
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:46,467
...an attorney representing
Derrick Tripp.

221
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,967
Mr. Tripp was last seen
in your custody.

222
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,367
We served a warrant
to one of his homeboys.

223
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,867
He was there. The drugs weren't his.
He was freed.

224
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,067
He was a good guy,
signed a couple autographs.

225
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:00,067
- Something wrong?
- Tripp is missing.

226
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,867
- Missing?
- He's not answering his cell phone.

227
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,667
His friends, family, teammates,
management, me...

228
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,767
No one has heard from him.

229
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,167
Weird.

230
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,667
Virgil Lewis said that it looked like
you were taking Mr. Tripp somewhere.

231
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:20,067
Is this the same Virgil Lewis I busted
sucking on a joint as big as your arm?

232
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:24,267
I think Virgil's memory might be
a little hazy.

233
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,467
I left Tripp a while ago.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

234
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,767
- This is totally unacceptable.
- Vic.

235
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,367
They stitch you up okay?

236
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,467
Between this and my caesarean,
I'm a goddamn road map.

237
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,967
- Jesus Christ.
- Those detectives won't let me leave.

238
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,967
I gotta go see somebody, soon.

239
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,467
All right, calm down.

240
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,867
Go back there and chill out.
I'll find out what's going on, all right?

241
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,267
Go on.

242
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,667
I'd never hurt anyone.

243
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:55,967
- What kind of work do you do, William?
- I was an actuary.

244
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,567
What about now?

245
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,767
I walked away six months ago.

246
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,667
Needed some time off?
Pressure getting to you?

247
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:06,967
Well, it's easy to lose your perspective
working every day.

248
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,067
What does this have to do
with anything?

249
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,467
What do you do for fun
with that free time?

250
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,167
- I have some hobbies.
- I know. Nice sperm collection.

251
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,667
Well, thank you.

252
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,067
Jag?

253
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,567
- Nope.
- Rolls?

254
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,067
Please. Lamborghini.

255
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,167
Sure, that's a sweet ride.

256
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,267
Where the hell's this captain?

257
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,867
Should be here within the hour.

258
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,067
I ain't waiting no hour.

259
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,567
Where do you think
you're going, sport?

260
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,767
This captain's kicking
the charges anyway.

261
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,167
I'll leave him will-call tickets
for the game.

262
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:46,167
- You're staying here.
- See, this meeting's too big.

263
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,767
- I ain't gonna miss it.
- Who's it with?

264
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,367
One of my little L.A. Honeys I bang
when I'm in town.

265
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,067
Maybe she would prefer
conjugal visits.

266
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,467
Hey, bring her on down here, man.
There's a bedroom.

267
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:02,567
What? It'll help pass the time
till the captain shows.

268
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:07,867
If the men's room at Spago's worked
for her, I guess this will do.

269
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,467
- Oh, you're a real classy guy.
- Here.

270
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,367
Here, yo, use my cell phone.

271
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:19,167
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

272
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,067
Anyone vouch for that?

273
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:24,267
- I live alone.
- You go out?

274
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,767
- Yeah.
- Where?

275
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,067
Well, you know, maybe I didn't go out.
I don't really remember.

276
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,967
- Well, which is it, William?
- What about December 15?

277
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,767
Were you out then?

278
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:40,167
I don't know. Probably at home.

279
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:44,467
- What about February 5?
- Home.

280
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:48,567
Always home. Filling up those jars
is a full-time gig, huh?

281
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:49,967
Back to last night...

282
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,667
The name Kitty Weir mean anything?
She was a streetwalker on Sunset.

283
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,367
I don't know what you're saying.

284
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,967
- Dutch.
- March 3, Rosita Pedraza...

285
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,667
...on Cesar Chavez.
You killed her too, didn't you?

286
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:04,067
- Dutch!
- I'd never kill anyone. I'm pro-life.

287
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,167
Jesus Christ.

288
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,167
You're all over the map.

289
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,267
This freak's straight out
of an FBI textbook.

290
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,567
What happened to the original plan?

291
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,767
Nail him for last night's assault,
use it as a building block.

292
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,667
Classic façade of innocence and
charm with bizarre sexual fetishes.

293
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,567
This kind wants to talk.
I have to lead him down the path.

294
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,867
Trust me, his ego won't let him shut up.

295
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:29,467
- Could we close this one case, please?
- I mean, Ted Bundy, anyone?

296
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:33,067
The attack on the hooker comes first.

297
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:36,167
Dutchboy, I asked you to find
Connie's john...

298
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,967
...not Jack the Ripper.
- You're observing me?

299
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:42,367
Fred Astaire never danced
around so much.

300
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:45,867
- Let me see if I can jog his memory.
- No. You tried that with me once.

301
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,567
Not again.

302
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:52,467
Now, you asked Dutch for help,
you got it. We'll get the guy.

303
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,367
Don't make me regret it.

304
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,267
Don't make me regret it.

305
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:04,767
Hey, Connie.

306
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,667
They got your guy.

307
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,267
You gonna let me watch?

308
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,767
- Watch what?
- You kick the shit out of him.

309
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,767
I think we'll have to settle
for jail time.

310
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,367
I want him to feel the pain I felt.

311
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:21,467
- Look, why don't you come lie down.
- I can't lie down!

312
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:31,967
You know what?
I have to get out of here.

313
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,967
I have a need, all right?

314
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:38,167
The detectives need you to stay around
to contradict any statement he makes.

315
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:42,667
Now stay in here, and I'll take care
of your need. Got it?

316
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,067
Yeah.

317
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,567
Just stay here, okay?

318
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,867
Hey, hon.

319
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,167
Hey, little man. There he is.
Come here.

320
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,467
Who was that?

321
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,167
It's a case I'm working on.

322
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,267
Got my clothes?
Thanks.

323
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:13,067
Hey, Matthew, what a treat
to see Daddy during the day.

324
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,467
Let's hope we get to see him
tonight, huh?

325
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,267
- Hope so.
- Hey, I can't miss that.

326
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:22,667
Gotta see little man's teacher
and talk to her.

327
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,567
You know, we've got a play date.

328
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,267
Okay. Thanks for the fresh cape.

329
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:30,167
Let's go help Mommy outside.
Come on.

330
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,567
Derrick here?

331
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,967
Shane Vendrell.

332
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,067
So he's here or...?

333
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,467
Yeah.

334
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,067
Where?

335
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,967
Hey, girl.

336
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,967
God, I missed you.

337
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,367
Oh, save it for Spago's.

338
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,967
When are you gonna get traded
to a West Coast team?

339
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:11,967
I'm here now, ain't I?
Go get the sheets warmed up.

340
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,967
Okay.

341
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:18,067
- Be right in.
- Okay.

342
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,767
Damn. That is, like, the hottest chick
that's ever been, man.

343
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:30,467
Her? Please, dog. Adriana's a par.

344
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,567
I got this one in Seattle,
a goddamn birdie.

345
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:37,167
Oh, she's probably spread her legs
for half the league.

346
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,767
It's too bad you can't make
a jump shot.

347
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:46,267
Hope y'all got your earplugs.
I'm going in.

348
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,467
He's pretty confident.

349
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,967
I'll be over here.

350
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,167
- O for two.
- How many warrants left?

351
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,867
Counting this no-show, one more.

352
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,067
Neighbour here makes
quite the racket.

353
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,467
She says she's gonna call us
when he gets back.

354
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,767
Who's up?

355
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,167
Felipé Tejada.

356
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,167
- Officer.
- What?

357
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,467
I really need your help.
All right, just give me five seconds.

358
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,567
Why?

359
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,367
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

360
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,667
You've got three seconds left.

361
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:12,067
Okay. I passed a bad check. I paid
the fine. I got a suspended sentence.

362
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:16,467
This warrant is a mistake. All you
gotta do is call my legal-aide guy.

363
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,567
That would take another five seconds.

364
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,867
Please. Look at me.

365
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,167
And now look at the other guys in here.

366
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,267
I'm not supposed to be here.

367
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,567
Stand back.

368
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:47,967
Gotta be careful with these guys.
They're all a bunch of con men.

369
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,567
This is a nightmare.
I'd never hurt anyone, let alone rape.

370
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,767
I don't even use prostitutes.

371
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:58,067
I don't have to. Women need me.

372
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:00,767
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a fact.

373
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,567
Survival of the species.

374
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,367
Meaning what?

375
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,967
Well, men find large breasts attractive.

376
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:12,067
They signify that a woman can
amply nourish her young.

377
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:16,567
Conversely, women respond
to some of my assets.

378
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:21,967
Well, I've seen you butt-naked, son.

379
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,667
- Your assets don't impress.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

380
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,067
You see, penis size is overrated.

381
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:31,867
I'm talking about my testes,
the true seed of male virility...

382
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,567
...the engine that drives the train.

383
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:39,267
I am packing a pair
you gotta see to believe.

384
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:47,067
Found an old girlfriend.
Greeley's got a hair-trigger temper...

385
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:50,667
...and an inoperable brain tumour
driving him schizo.

386
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,567
That explains a few things.

387
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,467
Doesn't explain why he's dumping
the bodies facedown.

388
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,467
Will you forget about making a name
for yourself as a serial-killer hunter?

389
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:03,367
We need to corroborate
the hooker story. Period.

390
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:06,067
He wants to tell us.

391
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,567
- Can't this wait? I'm right out front.
- Oh, yeah?

392
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,867
Yeah, well, listen to this crap.

393
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,867
Oh, God.

394
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,467
Any word from the captain?

395
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,767
No.

396
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,867
Call him again. I'm almost done here.

397
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,667
Oh, baby.

398
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:38,867
The only reason he has any teeth left is
that I'm making a killing on this thing.

399
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,967
- I upped my bet to 10 grand.
- Later.

400
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,167
Vic? Vic.

401
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:51,667
No! Give me my Evan!

402
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:58,167
He's fine! Please! My baby!

403
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:03,067
- Guy's a crackhead!
- He's dusted! Evan!

404
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,667
It's cool. Why don't you give me Evan.

405
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:09,367
No, he's on fire. He's burning up.
He's red-hot!

406
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,267
He's fine! Please!

407
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,567
- I gotta cool him down!
- I'm a doctor. I can cool Evan down.

408
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,567
You don't look like a doctor.

409
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,767
I get that all the time. Give him to me.

410
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,867
- My baby!
- No, it's too late!

411
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:26,267
- Don't do that!
- He's dying!

412
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,467
Don't do that!

413
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,667
Come on, man!

414
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,867
Where's the guy?

415
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,167
He's still under.

416
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,967
Nice save, Vic.

417
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,367
These nut-jobs have a way
of finding me. Be careful.

418
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:20,367
This one tried to strangle me
on the way over here. Come on.

419
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:25,167
Vic, I need a piece.

420
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,867
All right, hold on, hold on.

421
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:33,067
Smoke it by the window.
I can't have my office reeking of rock.

422
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,267
When am I gonna see you again?

423
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,767
You know the drill.

424
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:55,567
Just remember, Section 101,
red tank top.

425
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,867
How can I miss that body, right?

426
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,867
- Okay.
- See you at the game.

427
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,067
See you.

428
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,867
See you, Adriana.

429
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,367
- She's a sweet girl.
- Well, boys...

430
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,867
...tell the captain he missed me.

431
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:25,367
Another booty call?
One of your sponsor's Viagra?

432
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,367
Shoot-around's at 5.

433
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:30,567
You're not going anywhere, Romeo.

434
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,767
- Get this captain on the phone.
- He's not available by phone.

435
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:39,467
- You said you called him. Where is he?
- Police business. You'll have to wait.

436
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,067
You been yanking me all day?

437
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,067
Sit down.

438
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,267
Ain't no captain coming, is there?

439
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,567
I said, sit down. You're bugging me.

440
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:55,267
You got your autographs,
a little peepshow.

441
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,667
Game's over. Colour me gone.

442
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:01,167
Hey, colour you staying, nigger.

443
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:07,667
You'd love it if I popped you.

444
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:10,067
Got your name in the papers
right next to mine.

445
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,567
Come on, come on.

446
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:16,067
Let's hear what my lawyers
have to say about this.

447
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,267
Badge will look real nice
on my mantelpiece...

448
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:22,167
...right next to my
Rookie of the Year trophy.

449
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,967
- Shane, get off him!
- Come on, come on, come on.

450
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,967
Hey, hey, I said, wait.

451
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,067
Vic, please.

452
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,967
Give me the lighter.

453
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:39,067
Come on, give it.

454
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,667
Okay, here.

455
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,367
Blow it out the window.

456
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:56,367
Aceveda.

457
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,967
The hospital just called.
Baby checked out fine.

458
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,767
- Good job.
- Good.

459
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:06,067
I am curious. You saved that kid
from the same apartment complex...

460
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,667
...where Tripp was last seen.
- Crazy, huh?

461
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,767
I lost my wallet during the bust,
went back to look for it.

462
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:14,167
- Oh, some luck.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

463
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,867
There's no smoking in here.

464
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:19,667
My mistake.

465
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:25,167
Derrick Tripp's Jersey's leading
scorer. They'll be hurting without him.

466
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:27,167
No clue where he is?

467
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,867
Come on, captain, you know
how these rich pricks are.

468
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,767
He's probably got his face
snorkel-deep in some broad's snatch.

469
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:37,367
Give him a few hours,
he'll come up for air.

470
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,467
You know how these celebrities are.

471
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:45,867
He's probably with a female admirer.
Give it a few hours. He'll turn up.

472
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,367
Step away.

473
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,767
I made some calls.
The warrant was a mistake.

474
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:57,567
I apologise on behalf
of the department.

475
00:29:57,867 --> 00:29:59,767
See, that wasn't so tough, now,
was it?

476
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,867
Sorry for the inconvenience.

477
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,267
The only inconvenience is, I'm leaving
without your phone number.

478
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,767
- Excuse me?
- I just meant so that I could...

479
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:11,467
...thank you for doing me this favour.

480
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:17,467
Who knows? Maybe I can return
the favour someday.

481
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:25,667
If so, you know where to find me.

482
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:30,867
We know about your brain tumour.
No wonder you're angry.

483
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,367
I'm not a killer.

484
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,567
William, tell me more
about your sperm.

485
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,167
So many people waste it.

486
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,767
With condoms...

487
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:46,267
...masturbating indiscriminately.

488
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:49,367
It's a holocaust.

489
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,067
So you collect it?

490
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,167
My tumour may render me
impotent one day.

491
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,867
And with so many women needing me...

492
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:00,267
You'll still be able
to impregnate them.

493
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:03,867
I want my essence to be passed
on to the next generation.

494
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:06,567
Who doesn't?

495
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,267
I know I do.

496
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,067
Can you give me a second, sport?

497
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,867
- No.
- It's okay, Dutch.

498
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:23,967
It's not okay by me.

499
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,667
Oh, come on, buddy.
Help me out here.

500
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:32,867
We need our privacy.

501
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:47,267
Have a seat. I didn't see your name...

502
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,967
...among the sergeant's applicants.
- Well, I've been putting it off.

503
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,967
Don't. If you pass, you'll get
my recommendation.

504
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:59,267
You'll receive a post immediately
instead of waiting on a list for months.

505
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,367
Why the big endorsement?

506
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:04,467
I'd like you in a leadership position.

507
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,667
You mean you'd like to promote
a woman.

508
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:11,767
It's not how you get there. It's what
you do once you have the chance.

509
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:15,967
- I'm offering you the chance.
- I'll think about it.

510
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,467
So I saw the bad-check writer
was released.

511
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,067
For all his whining,
turns out it was a mistake.

512
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,867
But you had to go and check
that out. He got to you.

513
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:28,067
- No, I just believed him.
- Well, don't make it a habit.

514
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:32,567
You do favours for these guys,
it comes back to bite you in the ass.

515
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:40,167
Yeah?

516
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,067
- Ricky Harris?
- Yeah?

517
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:45,767
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

518
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,267
Yes.

519
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,567
No problem. All right?
Just give me a second.

520
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,367
Damn it!

521
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,267
Pull that stuff up. Get that stuff out.

522
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,167
- Hurry up.
- Is it okay if we come in?

523
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:00,067
Yeah...

524
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,167
You mind if we take a look around?

525
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,667
There's nothing here.

526
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:11,167
Let me see your hands.
Put them on top of your head.

527
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,267
- You got any drugs in here?
- No, I'm clean.

528
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:19,667
- Who are your buddies?
- Nobody.

529
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,767
Come on, look, I'm ready. Let's just...

530
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:26,167
Tattoo man, what are you doing
by that couch?

531
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,067
- Just standing.
- Yeah?

532
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,767
- Go stand over there.
- I'm not doing anything.

533
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,567
- You heard me. Move.
- I thought you wanted him.

534
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,067
One Tango 13, requesting backup.
30151 l2 Sutter.

535
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,767
Everybody's cool. Let's just go.

536
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:42,167
Tattoo man, you heard me.
Get over there.

537
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:50,467
Don't you dare move!
I will blow your brains out!

538
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:54,067
Get on the floor! On your stomachs.
Put your hands behind your head.

539
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,667
Move it. Check the couch.

540
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:59,567
Whatever he's got in there,
I got nothing to do with.

541
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,667
Shut up.

542
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,867
One Tango 13, code three.

543
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,567
What good's your 15 million now,
asshole?

544
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,467
- It's only six take-home.
- Shut up.

545
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,367
- What's going on?
- This guy's totally out of control.

546
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,267
I hope you hate your jobs.
They're about to disappear.

547
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,267
Thinks he's goddamn Shaka Zulu.

548
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,667
When you can fill 20,000 seats
at 200 a pop...

549
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,367
...you'll get the cash and tail.

550
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:30,567
Until then, drag your lily-white ass
back home to Simi Valley.

551
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:33,467
Hey, I live in Hollywood, you mother...

552
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,567
Come here.

553
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,967
- Christ, what's the matter with you?
- What?

554
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,267
- The guy resisted.
- Resisted what? I told you to babysit...

555
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,167
Somebody needs to teach him a lesson.

556
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,567
By doing what? Executing him?

557
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,867
Well, why not?
I mean, isn't that what we do now?

558
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,667
I told you, that's over.

559
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:57,367
We killed a cop.

560
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:05,367
Lem and Ronnie failed to clear
the room, and Two-Time killed Terry.

561
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:10,067
Get over it and don't bring it up again.

562
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,167
Your partner's very uptight.

563
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,567
He overcompensates.

564
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:26,567
He could learn a lot from you.
You're very maternal.

565
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,567
You have kids, don't you?

566
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,767
Two.

567
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:33,867
- Boys?
- Girls.

568
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,267
I knew that.

569
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,167
They still at home?

570
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,467
One's a schoolteacher.

571
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,567
The other's a newspaper reporter.

572
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,667
- You see them much?
- Not as much as I'd like.

573
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:53,267
You ever think about having more?

574
00:35:55,567 --> 00:36:00,267
Well, it would have to be soon.

575
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:03,967
I'd have to find the right man.

576
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,767
What's he like?

577
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:13,067
Compassionate, responsible...

578
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,667
...honest.
- I'm those things.

579
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:23,767
What if I told you
I could give you a son?

580
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,567
Where were you last night?

581
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,367
If I don't spread my seed,
it dies with me.

582
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,167
You found a prostitute?

583
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,867
Oh, come on, Will.

584
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:40,567
If we're gonna make this step...

585
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,867
...you gotta show me that you're...

586
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:48,067
...the type of man who's gonna take
responsibilities for his actions.

587
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,967
Isn't that what a good father is?

588
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:57,167
She tried to put a condom on me.

589
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:01,167
Why would she do that?

590
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,067
So you cut her?

591
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,067
I never had to do that before.

592
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,667
Before?

593
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,467
There were other women?

594
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,567
How many?

595
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:24,467
I wanna trust you.

596
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,267
You'll make 12.

597
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,867
You raped them to spread your seed?

598
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,767
After they're pregnant,
they'll forgive me.

599
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:48,567
The prostitutes, did you kill them?

600
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,867
No. God, no.

601
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,167
I spread life, not death.

602
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,567
- Okay.
- So when can you and I consummate?

603
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,367
- Oh, that's not gonna happen.
- You promised me something.

604
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:05,467
You may have thought you heard that,
but I didn't say it.

605
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,167
Yes, you did, right here.

606
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,467
You promised me a baby.

607
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,867
You give me that pussy!

608
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,567
That's mine, damn it!

609
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:20,867
- Give it to me now!
- Get off me!

610
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:27,167
Oh, my balls.

611
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,267
You all right?

612
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:33,467
The bigger they are...

613
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,167
- So no serial killer, huh?
- I don't know.

614
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,667
If there is one, it wasn't him.

615
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:47,167
- Heard about your gun bust. Nice.
- The wait for backup was...

616
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:52,567
...the longest two minutes in my life.
- It always is. Still, you kept your cool.

617
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:57,267
Aceveda wants me to take
the sergeant's exam.

618
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,367
I suck at tests.

619
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:04,367
I get so much grief for being a woman
in this place. I can't not pass.

620
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,167
- It's not that hard.
- Oh, for you maybe.

621
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,867
Hey, could you tutor me?

622
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:14,167
I could dust off my old notes.

623
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,567
- All right, get out.
- Get out?

624
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,667
I don't even know where
the hell we are.

625
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,567
- That's your problem.
- You're an asshole.

626
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,567
Yeah? Well, that's my problem.

627
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,167
- My lawyers are gonna make sure...
- You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

628
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,067
Your homeys are still in custody.

629
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:40,167
One visit to the evidence room, and
that ounce of weed becomes a pound.

630
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,267
Play any road games in San Quentin?

631
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,667
- You done with me yet?
- Tell me something.

632
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:50,467
Why would you risk everything,
slumming with those losers?

633
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:53,867
They was my boys before I made it.

634
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,867
Who else am I supposed to trust now?

635
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:00,167
The fans?

636
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,767
- You?
- Listen, if they were your boys...

637
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,767
...you'd pull them up instead of letting
them drag you down.

638
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,567
Take the subway three stops down
to the Staples Center.

639
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:23,567
That's Derrick Tripp.

640
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,967
Can I get your autograph?

641
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,867
Isn't that that basketball player?

642
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,667
Check him out, man.

643
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:43,367
We certainly hate to lose you, Nathan.
It's the end of an era.

644
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,567
I guess I just lost that edge.
Of course, I'll give two weeks.

645
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,367
Not necessary, really.

646
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,567
I need to train my replacement.

647
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:55,267
I have a system tracking suspects
from processing to the cage that...

648
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,567
Nathan, we'll manage...

649
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,867
...somehow.

650
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,367
Hey.

651
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,767
I heard you gave sperm boy
a nice whack.

652
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,567
I could use a good ass-kicker
on my squad.

653
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:17,267
- Be careful.
- Hey, thanks.

654
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:20,067
We wouldn't have gotten him
if it weren't for Dutch.

655
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:23,267
Yeah, but you were the closer.

656
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,867
You all right?

657
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,967
Let's go.

658
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,967
Hi.

659
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:09,767
At the station, you implied
that I was gay.

660
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:15,067
- Aren't you?
- No.

661
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,467
I'm not.

662
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:21,567
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

663
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,667
Sure.

664
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:29,167
I wasn't gay either, until the day
I just admitted that I was.

665
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,567
It's okay. It's okay.

666
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,567
It's safe.

667
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:01,084
The class loves to paint.

668
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,484
- Cleanup's always the problem.
- I've seen it.

669
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,384
Thanks again for the art supplies.

670
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,684
- I got them on sale.
- The kids had a ball.

671
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:10,884
Excuse me, we're here
for a reason, right?

672
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:14,684
Of course. Sit down.

673
00:43:19,884 --> 00:43:25,084
I'm concerned about Matthew.
He's not socializing properly.

674
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:27,384
He's a little shy. He'll grow out of it.

675
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:30,184
I'm afraid it's more
than just being shy.

676
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:32,584
Matthew's way behind
the other children.

677
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,084
So he's not Michelangelo. So what?

678
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:39,084
What I'm trying to say is,
I think there's a problem.

679
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,584
- What kind of problem?
- I can't tell you exactly.

680
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:44,184
Well, who could tell us exactly?

681
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:47,484
I think it's something that
a developmental paediatrician...

682
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:50,184
...should diagnose.

683
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:54,784
A neurologist, maybe.

684
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,884
Trampling New Jersey, 101 to 78...

685
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:01,484
... clinching home- court advantage
throughout the playoffs for the Lak ers.

686
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:05,984
Kobe Bryant had a game- high
35 points. Shaq chipped in with 29.

687
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:09,584
Derrick Tripp was a no-show
after getting stuck in traffic...

688
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:15,384
... returning from a charity event.
Only in L.A.
