1
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,682
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,892
<i>Well, I can't say the content of
this report comes as a surprise.</i>

3
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,396
<i>The changes around here
can't just be cosmetic.</i>

4
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,273
<i>I agree.</i>

5
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:43,106
<i>On top of this mess, we have
a budget cut. No more O. T.</i>

6
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,037
<i>- What about a pay freeze?
- Done. Even the pension is taking a hit.</i>

7
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,042
- Ayear longer to qualify, less in benefits.
- Jesus.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,648
You think I like doing this
my first month on the job?

9
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,057
This squad is going to have to
cut its work force by 20%.

10
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:01,619
20%? How are we supposed to maintain our
arrest numbers with a depleted force?

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,658
<i>We have to find a way.</i>

12
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,594
Start with the disciplinary cases
and the retirement phase-outs.

13
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,362
Then fire whoever
you have to to get to 20%.

14
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,641
- You want me to choose who goes?
- You're the C.O. You know them best.

15
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:17,235
You want the blood on my hands,
not yours. I won't do it.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,872
<i>- Yes, you will.
- Why should I?</i>

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,414
<i>I'm on borrowed time here as it is.</i>

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,414
You can't afford to lose your job...

19
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,882
the day before a close election.

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,785
For the moment,
you are still my employee.

21
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,851
<i>I want the list of who's gone
by this evening.</i>

22
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,964
- Tomas.
- Julien. Thanks for coming.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,133
<i>- This is Gary, my sponsor.
- I help with Julien's reorientation therapy.</i>

24
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,371
<i>Look, I came to tell you
to stop calling me.</i>

25
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,675
There's no room
in my life for you.

26
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,253
You gotta be kidding me. And you brought
him along as muscle?

27
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,551
<i>Look, Julien's made his intent
with you very clear.</i>

28
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,186
Any further contact
is only gonna damage you both.

29
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,121
<i>Listen, I got no place to stay.
I got no money.</i>

30
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,458
<i>- Shelters can help you.
- Stop trying to keep yourself
connected. It's over.</i>

31
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,294
- You stay out of this!
- Tomas, I am married now. I have a son.

32
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,366
My life has to be
about them and God.

33
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,935
You fags can hide
behind Jesus all you want...

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,902
but you're not
fooling anybody.

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,132
That's enough.
You've been warned.

36
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,044
<i>Gary!</i>

37
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,444
<i>- My eye!
- What's going on over there?</i>

38
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,081
Look up, look, up, look up.
Oh, God.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,051
All right, all right, all right.

40
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,884
<i>There's a full five paragraphs
in the report...</i>

41
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,889
on the Bob and Marcy case.

42
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,891
Well, it wasn't our finest hour.

43
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,931
<i>I appreciate you
including yourself...</i>

44
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,934
but everybody knows it was me who let the
suspects go with the victim in their trunk.

45
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,801
<i>Jeffrey Cole, 14. Been missing since
as late as last night.</i>

46
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,199
- Are you the parents?
- He's the father, but I'm the parent.

47
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,612
- Don't be like that.
- This wouldn't have happened
if he was still with me.

48
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,445
- When was the last time you saw Jeffrey?
- Last night when I left for work.

49
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,110
When I got back, I didn't want to wake
him. I shoulda checked on him earlier.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,257
I live in Venice. I called everyone
we know there. Nothing!

51
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,023
<i>We'll need a recent picture so the officers
can pass it around to everyone in the area.</i>

52
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,020
- Maybe someone's seen him.
- There you go.

53
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,993
Oh, God. If anything's
happened to him...

54
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,431
I'll never forgive myself.

55
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,739
- The money train's moving up?
- We don't know...

56
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,468
but the ship the Armenians use to get the
money out of the country hits port tonight.

57
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,077
- It's not due for two weeks.
- According to the manifest...

58
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,874
it's scheduled to
ship out in two days.

59
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,213
The Armenians can't be onto us.
We've been careful.

60
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,943
Maybe they're just
changing things up...

61
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,155
<i>- just trying to avoid a routine.
- Goddamn it.</i>

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,647
There's no room for last-minute
surprises. This kills us.

63
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,093
<i>- We can't just walk away
from the money train.
- Look, I know you need this.</i>

64
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,255
<i>- We all do!
- But I'm not takin' any chances.</i>

65
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,295
<i>At least let Ronnie and me try
to find out where they might be
moving the money train to.</i>

66
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,265
<i>Let's not give up yet.</i>

67
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,268
All right.

68
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,772
But if this thing's
not rock solid, we're bailin'.

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,685
- What's your name?
- Kandle. You can light me
up at both ends.

70
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,754
<i>Have you seen this boy
in the past 24 hours?</i>

71
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:21,120
- Sorry, sister.
- Thanks.

72
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,596
I haven't read the report yet, but I
hear there's a whole paragraph...

73
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,156
on Armadillo getting stabbed
to death in the cage.

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,760
I saw you frisk him.
He got that knife some other way.

75
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,597
Yeah. Tell that
to the bosses. Sir.

76
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,975
Excuse me, sir. Have you
seen this boy recently?

77
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,411
Last night. Walking around.
He seemed a little lost.

78
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,513
- Sure it was him?
- He stood out from the sickos.

79
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,477
- Did you see which way he went?
- He got into a car.

80
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,482
<i>On his own, or was he forced in?</i>

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,148
I was running somebody's credit card,
and I looked up...

82
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,388
and the car drove off
with him in it.

83
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,025
What kind of car was it, sir?

84
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,596
<i>Jeffrey attended school in Venice.</i>

85
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,224
Dad lives here, wanted to take
his son in for a year.

86
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,829
Mom reluctantly agreed. Kid's only been
in Farmington for two months.

87
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,933
Hasn't really made
too many friends.

88
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,871
<i>- What's that got to do
with him hitching a ride?
- Fits the profile.</i>

89
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,736
Isolated, alienated, vulnerable. He's the perfect
candidate to be taken by an adult aggressor.

90
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:17,281
Two kids were snatched in that area
three months ago.

91
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,554
Both taken at different times,
bodies found weeks apart.

92
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,045
These are the two kids who were
duct-taped and shot in the face?

93
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,152
Yeah. One 12, the other 13.
Both sexually assaulted and tortured.

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,021
That's Brent's case. Talk to him. See if
there's anything else pertinent in his file.

95
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,598
We may only have a couple of hours.
Kid may already be dead.

96
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,531
I hate to say it, but our best
hope is that this deviant's...

97
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,239
got the boy chained up to a fence
somewhere, loves his ass so much...

98
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,503
- can't give it up for a few days.
- That's my son, asshole!

99
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,773
Hey, hey, hey! Get off him!

100
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,573
<i>Get off him!</i>

101
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,019
That's my son he's talking about!
He's talking about Jeffrey!

102
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,580
Goddamn it, stop it! It was a stupid
thing to say. Now calm down!

103
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,782
We're the ones that are
trying to help you, okay?

104
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:04,423
The only thing that's important right
now is finding your boy, right? Right?

105
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:09,160
Come on.
Let's go talk about it.

106
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,385
The idea of some monster and my boy.

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,182
We don't know yet
if that's what's happened.

108
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,984
Well, that's what that
goddamn detective said.

109
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,559
Look, Dutch-boy's people skills might not be
first-rate, but his detective work is.

110
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,618
<i>He doesn't want to know my son.
Jeffrey's a good kid.</i>

111
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,091
He's been through a lot of things,
but he's a good kid.

112
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,497
We're gonna do everything
we can to get him back to you.

113
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,935
- You too?
- Yeah. Me too.

114
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,872
How's the dad doing?

115
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,844
He'd be a lot better
if we found his kid.

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,112
- Look, this pedophilia
thing's not my strong suit.
- I can run with it.

117
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,815
Nah. If it's all the same
to you, I'd like to lend a hand.

118
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,457
Just tell me how to help.

119
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:09,019
Okay. Well, um, the first two victims
suffered sadistic torture ritual.

120
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,690
<i>That stuff usually starts
at the fantasy level.</i>

121
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,696
What, fantasy, as in kid flicks?

122
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,767
All three abductions took place
in the same neighborhood.
If the guy gets his victims there...

123
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,671
<i>maybe he gets
his porn there too.</i>

124
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,163
Vic and I'll run the smut shops, get names of
the K.Y. cowboys who prefer to ride ponies.

125
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:26,911
<i>It won't be easy getting names from
a sex shop. Uh, privacy issues involved.</i>

126
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,977
Maybe we can get around it.

127
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>Learn anything new?</i>

128
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,089
I, uh, checked Brent's
files, ran the names...

129
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,217
of all the sex offenders who live in the
neighborhood where the boys were abducted.

130
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,764
- So did Brent. He didn't find anything.
- He didn't follow up.

131
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,561
A convicted child molester
lives in the neighborhood.

132
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,900
He just didn't register until after the
investigation. Our guys talked to him.

133
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,829
They didn't know
the connection.

134
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,997
Get Brent's files,
consolidate the two cases...

135
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,473
- and the two of you take the point.
- You got it.

136
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,580
<i>Detective Wyms.</i>

137
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:03,105
A pleasure to meet you.
I'm Chief Bankston.

138
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,981
Yes, I know.

139
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,144
My tour is done.
Would you mind walking me out?

140
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,153
Sure.

141
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,121
I read Ms. Kellis's report.

142
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,930
I haven't had a chance yet.

143
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,694
Well, she thinks you're
the best candidate to run this place.

144
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,035
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

145
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,472
- How do you think things are here?
- The barn has problems...

146
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,501
as deep as the report
indicates, but not as wide.

147
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,507
- Meaning?
- I'd rather not elaborate.

148
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,309
- So, about the job, then.
- I'm a detective, not a leader.

149
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,952
I do my work.
I go home. I like that.

150
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,426
Hey. We got
a missing kid, huh?

151
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,293
Yeah. Shane and I are running the
skin shops. I want you over in Venice.

152
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,127
- All right. What's there?
- The mom.

153
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,996
Find out who the kid's hangin' with.
See what they know about him.

154
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,966
Me and Ronnie'll
stay on the money tr...

155
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,230
Money what?

156
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,970
- Money, uh... Money trail, right?
- Yeah, right.

157
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,913
<i>Yeah.
That's what the, uh...</i>

158
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:10,076
Find out if the kid was using the dad's
credit or check cards, right?

159
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,380
<i>- Yeah.
- All right. Let's get going. Come on.</i>

160
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,644
Let's go, Ronnie.

161
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,157
Hi.

162
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,626
<i>All right, man. See ya.</i>

163
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,993
- "Me and Ronnie'll look
after the money train"?
- I stopped before I said it.

164
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,104
- Not before Tavon smelled it.
- I forgot. Tavon feels like one of us.

165
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,841
Yeah, well, he isn't one of us.

166
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,275
- We don't know who this guy
is yet, you understand?
- All right. I'm sorry.

167
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,077
You two are on edge about this
entire thing, and you pull that shit.

168
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,410
You know what? I screwed up.
Like it's never happened to you before?

169
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,582
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,128
Hey, Julien, man, we just responded to
an assault victim at Mission Cross.

171
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,564
<i>- Gary. I dropped him off.
- Poor guy's vision's blurry.
They say it may be permanent.</i>

172
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,528
<i>- Really?
- Yeah. And he said the guy who did it...</i>

173
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,638
was wearing a ring or something and screwed
up his eye, and he didn't see who did it.

174
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,436
- Um, I... I saw him.
- What?

175
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,548
Who hit him.
His name is Tomas Motyashik.

176
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,416
<i>- He's on parole.
- Okay. We'll pick him up.</i>

177
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,781
Thanks.

178
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,116
What did Tomas do this time?

179
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,691
He went too far.

180
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,499
<i>- Get out.
- Hey, hey, hey. You got a warrant?</i>

181
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,433
I just busted a couple of guys cruising, asked
them where they got their jerk-off material.

182
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:46,573
- Well, it's still legal to sell pornography.
- They said you got a back room.

183
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,477
- How many back doors you got around here?
- I see one.

184
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,479
I want to see the warrant.

185
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,211
I'm not goin' anywhere
your regular customers don't go.

186
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,587
- Hey. What's in here?
- This is all legal.

187
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,061
<i>- Child bondage films.
- No minors were used.</i>

188
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,535
<i>The faces were just digitally morphed
to make 'em look like kids.</i>

189
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,867
- Yeah, hooray for Hollywood.
- Well, you may not like it...

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,907
but the Supreme Court says it's cool,
'cause no real kids got hurt.

191
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,034
Until some asshole watches this
and gets some ideas.

192
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,743
Technically, you're out of luck.

193
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,783
Yeah, well, technically, I see about
a dozen fire-code violations in here.

194
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:25,944
I'm gonna need a list
of your more deviant clients.

195
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,115
- Want me to call and get the
fire marshal on the horn?
- No, that won't be necessary.

196
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,187
Will it?

197
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,023
He looks very sweet.

198
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,366
<i>We have a witness who saw Jeffrey get
into your car around 9:30 last night.</i>

199
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,802
- How do you explain that?
- You better get yourself a better eyewitness.

200
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,068
<i>- Why is that?
- I was at dinner at 9:30.</i>

201
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,571
<i>- With whom?
- A group of, uh...</i>

202
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,405
like-minded individuals.

203
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,774
We talked about boys...

204
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,008
but we didn't have any for dessert.

205
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,277
You're not funny.

206
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,479
You're a monster.

207
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,251
Men who kill and torture
are monsters.

208
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,087
Not me.

209
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,355
<i>You're a registered sex offender.</i>

210
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,295
You molest children.

211
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,502
I have never molested a child.

212
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,300
I have only shared experiences
with those that give consent...

213
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,599
with those that yearn
to experience life.

214
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,068
<i>These boys are flowers
looking to bloom.</i>

215
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,839
I am their sun and their water.

216
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,242
Right.

217
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,317
This guy didn't do it. Makes my
stomach crawl, but he didn't do it.

218
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,118
I know. A 15-year-old named
Lydell Crouch was just abducted
from the same neighborhood.

219
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,693
Oh, Jesus.
Anyone see who did it?

220
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,163
No. It was in his house.
Window was broken.

221
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,594
- Kid's just missing.
- Wait a minute.

222
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,634
Maybe our predator's pathology...

223
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,331
is to abduct multiple boys
simultaneously.

224
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,202
- I don't want to hear this.
- In Brent's case, the first two
were killed at the same time.

225
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,140
Maybe our predator needs a voyeuristic
component to fulfill his fantasy...

226
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:07,342
forces them to interact sexually
or maybe molests one while
forcing the other one to watch.

227
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,785
The point is, if he needs
them both alive to get off...

228
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,584
there's a good chance
he hasn't killed Jeffrey yet.

229
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,727
Okay, thanks. Keep working
on the other friends.

230
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,128
- I'll run this freak list
against the D.M.V. records.
- Good.

231
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,565
You found anything yet?

232
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,869
- We're working on some good leads.
- What does that mean?

233
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,171
It means you're gonna have to trust me.
I'm doing everything I can.

234
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,446
Okay.

235
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,210
Um, one of my men spoke to one of
Jeffrey's friends over in Venice.

236
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,646
<i>He said that Jeff's been depressed
lately. Is that true?</i>

237
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,955
I guess.

238
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,583
I just thought he was
going through a phase.

239
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,495
<i>I mean, he's a teenager. I missed
so much of his life after the divorce.</i>

240
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,497
<i>I just thought he was
acting out, you know?</i>

241
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,796
<i>You think he ran away and got in a car
with somebody he shouldn't have?</i>

242
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,131
<i>If he did run away, you have any idea
where he may have gone?</i>

243
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,635
To his mom's.

244
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,968
I mean, she's the only one
that's really been there for him.

245
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,847
Julien, Julien! Come here.

246
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,010
<i>Don't turn your back on me.
Not after all we've had together.</i>

247
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,056
Oh, you got laid. Now you want to
just ignore me? Huh?

248
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,957
- That's right. I was his lover!
- Shut up! Now!

249
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,822
You loved me. Every night for a month.
You still love me!

250
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,364
You know what?
You can cool off upstairs.

251
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,901
- We did everything. Everything!
- Stop it!

252
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,407
- And now you won't help me?
- You got yourself in trouble.

253
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,045
- I didn't have anything to do with it.
- You can't admit who you are!

254
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,514
<i>- Leave him alone!
- Your dick in my ass means you're gay.</i>

255
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,813
<i>- Shut up!
- My dick in your mouth
means you're really gay!</i>

256
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,982
You okay?

257
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,697
Corrine subpoenaed your police jacket
and financial records...

258
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,257
froze your joint savings,
emptied your checking account.

259
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,534
Now, in my experience, no one goes
straight to DEFCON 5 the way she did...

260
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,636
without a reason.

261
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,442
The other night
when you served her the papers...

262
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,042
she came over
to my apartment.

263
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,546
You weren't alone?

264
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,151
You know this makes my job
a lot tougher, right?

265
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,087
Look, you gotta protect
my rights with my kids.

266
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,521
<i>- That's the only thing that matters.
- I'll do the best I can...</i>

267
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,353
but screwing some broad
and getting caught isn't going to help.

268
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,665
Look, I'm supposed to go over and see Cassidy
and help her with a science project.

269
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,030
If you had a predetermined
time to be with your kid, honor that.

270
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,849
Corrine?

271
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,991
Aw, come on, Corrine!
I know you're home!

272
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,825
<i>You're such a good girl.</i>

273
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,895
Corrine!

274
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,769
Matthew! Matthew!

275
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,783
You know what? Wait here
and keep an eye on your sister, okay?

276
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,495
Shit!

277
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,102
Corrine, what's the code?

278
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,332
- What are you doing here?
- Matthew was screaming.

279
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,042
<i>Great!</i>

280
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:26,808
<i>- God. You broke the window?
- You changed the goddamn locks!</i>

281
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,739
- To keep you out!
- It's my house!
- Not anymore.

282
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,351
I came here to see Cassidy.

283
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,478
You'll have to go through my lawyer
to set up a time from now on!

284
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,847
I'm not gonna schedule time with
your lawyer to see my children!

285
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,015
Then you're not gonna see them!

286
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,524
Megan!

287
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,095
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- It's okay, Cassidy. Is she all right?

288
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,500
- No. It's scalding water!
- Let me see. Let me see.

289
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,172
She just got splashed.
She just got a little scared.

290
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,406
Just go!

291
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,240
<i>Now!</i>

292
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,225
Hello? Yeah, uh, the code?

293
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,190
"Little man"?

294
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,625
Yeah. No, we're okay. Thank you.

295
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,707
<i>Matt?</i>

296
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,809
You okay, little man?

297
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,811
Come on.

298
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,213
Okay. Okay.
Come here. Come here.

299
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,227
- Yes?
- Chief offer you my job?

300
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,337
Yes. I wasn't interested.

301
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,637
- Why not?
- Because I really don't
want to be you right now.

302
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,209
<i>Hey, we think we've found a poss...</i>

303
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,847
Where have you been the last hour?

304
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,813
- Taking care of some personal stuff.
- Do it on your own time.

305
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,654
You're either on this case
or you're not.

306
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,782
Shane cross-checked the kiddie porn
client list with the D.M.V.

307
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,087
We might have found
a possible match to the car.

308
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,296
- Might have?
- The same general description.

309
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,696
And his X-rated interests
are a match for our predator.

310
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,364
- That's not enough to satisfy a judge.
- It satisfies me.

311
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,801
Look, one of us better start getting creative
while this kid's still breathing.

312
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,533
<i>Which won't be much longer if he follows
the same M.O. as his previous victims.</i>

313
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,143
<i>He killed both kids
within 30 hours of abduction.</i>

314
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,440
Go around the warrant for now.
Pick him up on the street...

315
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,639
just for questioning.

316
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,251
I'll use kid gloves.

317
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,113
- That's okay, Adam. We'll drive.
- What'd I do?

318
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,656
<i>- Two 14 year olds.
- Where'd you get the shiner?</i>

319
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,223
One of'em fight back,
you sick prick?

320
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,397
- I didn't do anything.
- This used to be a church, man.

321
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,831
- If you lie in here, you're
going straight to hell.
- He's going there anyway.

322
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,829
Is that the guy?
Is that the one who...

323
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,636
Hey, hey. That's what
we're gonna find out.

324
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,550
I'm on this for you.

325
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,881
<i>You stay here. You stay calm.</i>

326
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,514
<i>It's okay. Just go in there
and sit down.</i>

327
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:08,459
We have a witness who saw Jeffrey Cole
getting into your car yesterday on Doverson.

328
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,403
I've never seen him before. Sorry.

329
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,634
<i>- He barely looked. He's lying.
- You didn't even bother to look at the photo.</i>

330
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,301
What about Lydell?
Did he fight back?

331
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,144
He give you that black eye
when you abducted him?

332
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:26,018
<i>- I didn't abduct anyone.
- So they went along willingly.</i>

333
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:28,714
Okay, that's not kidnapping.
That might help you.

334
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,279
<i>We're dusting your car
for their prints.</i>

335
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,482
If either of theirs turn up,
we'll know you're lying.

336
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,059
You know, I was told that you just
wanted to ask some questions.

337
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,424
Now, if you want to start treating me like
a suspect, I want to talk to my lawyer.

338
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:48,300
- You don't have a thing on him.
- Lawyering up this fast, we know he's lying.

339
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,139
Captain, patrol just found a body.
Looks like one of our kids.

340
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,643
<i>- Over there.
- Mark it. Make sure
they pick it up later.</i>

341
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,719
It's Lydell, our second missing kid.

342
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,358
Looks like two shots,
back of the head.

343
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:10,089
Be a while before the M.E.
Can determine sexual abuse.

344
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,556
Maybe Adam had Jeffrey
shoot Lydell...

345
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,997
his own twisted snuff film,
only without the film.

346
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,170
- Where do you get this stuff from?
- Hey, it happens.

347
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:21,401
<i>- At least we got the creep in custody.
- For the moment.</i>

348
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,242
- I don't like talking about this now.
- This is important.

349
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,471
- What?
- They cleared out the money
location, moved everything out.

350
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,276
That's it, then. We're out.

351
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,353
- Hold on.
- I hacked into the port computer.

352
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:36,821
The Armenians reserved a container with
a bigger break point than before.

353
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,588
- That means more money.
This thing is a gold mine.
- I just said we're out.

354
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,250
<i>The company they're running the
shipment through filed for Chapter 11.</i>

355
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,554
After this shipment, they're closing the
money train, moving it someplace else.

356
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,030
- Seattle, Frisco, who knows?
- And we're only gonna get one shot at this.

357
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,968
So we gotta take it. We have to
come up with a new plan right now.

358
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,606
Look, I'm done
talking about this.

359
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,350
<i>I set up a series
of important rallies for you.</i>

360
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,615
<i>- You were supposed to be there.
- I'm sorry. I sent Aurora.</i>

361
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,152
<i>I am financing you
in this election, David.</i>

362
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,086
<i>Not your wife!</i>

363
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,486
I have a very important case here.
I can't get away.

364
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,629
I need you to get
out on the streets...

365
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:21,656
and try to win every vote you can get,
especially now.

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,468
I have three dead children
and a missing one.

367
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,298
I'm overseeing
the investigation.

368
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,274
That takes precedent...

369
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,674
over scrambling
for a few hundred votes.

370
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,678
<i>A few hundred votes will make
the difference, David.</i>

371
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>- Well, right now
I have a job to do here.
- A job?</i>

372
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:41,913
The chief is going to
take your job away. He told you so.

373
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,553
This primary is all you have,
and it's tomorrow.

374
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,349
You need to be out there.

375
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,864
I have a lot of important decisions
to make. I can't spare the time.

376
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,905
Sofer, what the hell's up
with your partner?

377
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,999
- What do you mean?
- This gay thing. You know about that?

378
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,911
I know that guy in the cage
is a total player.

379
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,438
- Sounded convincing to me.
- Yeah, and why would he lie about that?

380
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:11,912
Who knows?

381
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,381
That Arab widow came after me
for no reason.

382
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,884
- You killed her old man.
- You know, I think the question here is...

383
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,524
if Julien's lyin' about this,
then what else is Julien lying about?

384
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,127
And how could
we trust him now?

385
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,796
You know what?
Julien's a good cop.

386
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,801
- Most of the time, better than
the two of you combined.
- So it's true, then?

387
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,031
Grow up.

388
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,200
<i>We need prints from his car.
Without prints, there's no warrant.</i>

389
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,141
The lab says
three hours minimum.

390
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,613
His lawyer's gonna
be here in 20 minutes.

391
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,874
Now you give me five minutes
alone with him...

392
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,416
- And you'll what?
- Once he lawyers up, things get
much more difficult for us.

393
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,224
Okay.
How about this?

394
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,455
<i>- Let him go. You wait for
the warrant. I'll follow him.
- Yeah.</i>

395
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,521
- What could go wrong with that?
- What could go right is,
he leads us right to Jeffrey.

396
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,393
He might not be able
to resist the thrill.

397
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,160
<i>Look, once his lawyer gets here,
he's gonna walk anyway.</i>

398
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,367
All right.

399
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,543
- My lawyer here?
- Uh, no, not yet.

400
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,517
But, uh, there's been a mistake.
We were able to clear you as a suspect.

401
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,153
You're free to go.
I'm-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

402
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,299
Shit.

403
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,737
<i>- Damn it.
- Went straight home.</i>

404
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,934
<i>The one place we can't
bust in without a warrant.</i>

405
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,471
- Well, what if Jeffrey's in there?
- Jesus.

406
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,545
<i>Look, maybe we just tell a judge we
heard the kid screamin', had to go in.</i>

407
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,516
If Jeffrey isn't in there, we've ruined
any shot we have at a legit arrest.

408
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,383
All right, so what do we do?

409
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,492
<i>- Aw, man!
- Mmm-mm!</i>

410
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,377
Hey, hey, Julien, what are...

411
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,120
<i>It makes it awfully hard
to defend this place to the chief...</i>

412
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,520
when I see crap like this.

413
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,457
<i>Anyone who knows who did this
has an obligation to tell me.</i>

414
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,730
Let's start acting like adults.

415
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,505
<i>Okay, here they are.</i>

416
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,917
- That's the son of a bitch's house.
- Yeah.

417
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,062
Once we're finally
able to go inside...

418
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,587
I'm gonna need you to identify
anything that belongs to your son.

419
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,627
- What are we waiting for?
- A search warrant.

420
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,438
The judge we pulled
is just left of Karl Marx.

421
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,805
- Our captain is trying to soften him up now.
- How long do you have to wait?

422
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,401
<i>A while.
Maybe the rest of the day.</i>

423
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,309
<i>Wait a minute, man. My son is in there.
He could be doin'...</i>

424
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,606
The law only allows us
so much latitude.

425
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,151
These guys have rights too.
I'm a cop.

426
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,379
I have to honor that.

427
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,191
Well, I'm not a cop.

428
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,460
That's true. Just a father
lookin' out for his son.

429
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,833
<i>- You check this guy for a weapon?
- Yeah, I patted him down.</i>

430
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,537
Good. This guy'd kill for his kid,
so let's be ready.

431
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,112
Ooh, that's a felony
in progress. Let's go.

432
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,315
<i>Where is he?</i>

433
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,985
Where is he?
Where's my son?

434
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:22,566
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?

435
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,567
- He was in my car, but I did not
kidnap him. I swear!
- That's enough!

436
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,173
<i>- Stop! Right now!
- Where's Jeffrey?</i>

437
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,165
Hey, he was in your car,
and you didn't kidnap him?

438
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,578
<i>- Try again, you bastard!
- Where is he?</i>

439
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:36,240
I just picked him up,
and I offered him $20 for a blow job.

440
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,409
Keep goin'!

441
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:44,020
We went behind a grocery, and then he pulled
a knife, stole my wallet and hit me.

442
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,717
<i>- I did not kidnap him.
- You liar!
- Your son attacked me!</i>

443
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,522
Let me get him!
Let me get him! Let me get him!

444
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,733
Hey, hold on.
Vic, where's Adam?

445
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,703
He's not our guy.

446
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,069
<i>- How do you know?
- Ruled him out.</i>

447
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,042
Doesn't have the kid.
Checked his house and everything.

448
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,510
I asked where's Adam.

449
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,951
He's at his house.

450
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,917
What did you do?

451
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,999
William...

452
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,301
you told me
Jeffrey was a good kid.

453
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,811
That's not what I'm hearin' now.

454
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,109
<i>I never said he was a saint,
but he's got a good heart.</i>

455
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,612
<i>My guy in Venice talked to
some more of Jeffrey's friends.</i>

456
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,787
He's been sellin' drugs. He's been
gettin' in fights, carrying a knife...

457
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:52,382
- No. No, not Jeffrey.
- We know he's been rollin'
queens with that knife.

458
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,123
Why, 'cause some baby-raper says so?

459
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,785
Look, another kid is dead.
I don't know how Jeffrey's involved in that.

460
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,431
He's not.

461
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,965
I'm sorry. I... I...
I know this is hard...

462
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,438
but you don't know Jeffrey as well as
you've been lettin' on, do ya?

463
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,436
- I need to leave.
- You need to help me find him.

464
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,344
I don't wanna hear this.

465
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:16,939
There's another boy dead.
His name is Lydell Crouch.

466
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,982
- Now, you need to think
about how his parents feel.
- I know how they feel.

467
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,911
I been helpin' you all day.
Now you're gonna help me.

468
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,314
Help you arrest my son?

469
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,925
No. I'm leavin'.

470
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,391
You can't arrest me.

471
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,298
Hey! Hey, what's the charge?

472
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,957
- Assault.
- Well, you had me do that!

473
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,933
<i>No, I didn't.
I told you the facts.</i>

474
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,470
You decided what to do with 'em.

475
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,703
Look, believe it or not,
I'm trying to help you.

476
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,206
Safest place you could be
right now is in here.

477
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,451
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to salvage what's left of my job.

478
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,919
David, please, you can't.
It'll cost you the election.

479
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,923
Hey, at least I can do
the right thing here then.

480
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,891
<i>- What do you gain by it?
- Nothing.</i>

481
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,964
- Then why?
- Because I can't fire people arbitrarily...

482
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,964
or in between campaign stops.

483
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,637
<i>You'll have no job
and no political career.</i>

484
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,569
I won't do it.

485
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,901
You're gonna be
throwin' both away.

486
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,637
You don't think
I've thought of that?

487
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,252
Hey.

488
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,286
Okay.

489
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,324
<i>Police!</i>

490
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,699
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

491
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,735
I just wanna be left alone.

492
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,392
<i>I saw Adam.</i>

493
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,190
William went after him. Good thing
we were there in time to break it up.

494
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,957
So how did he know
where his house was?

495
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,894
Probably heard
somethin' around here.

496
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,863
You allowed an innocent man
to get the shit kicked out of him.

497
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,230
He's not innocent.
He's a pedophile.

498
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,266
<i>But he's innocent
of this crime.</i>

499
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,005
Ah, I'm sure he'll think twice before cruisin'
the school yard and committing his next crime.

500
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,808
But he's innocent now!
You just don't get that, do ya?

501
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,752
<i>Boss!</i>

502
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,586
Kyle Hutton.
He's a 15-year-old piece of work.

503
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,752
<i>Jeffrey's friends in Venice say that he's
the only one that Jeffrey talks to anymore.</i>

504
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,394
Cool.

505
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,594
I already told that monkey cop.
I don't know where he is.

506
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,836
<i>What'd you just say?</i>

507
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,670
- Nothin'.
- "Monkey cop."

508
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,947
You said it for a reason.

509
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,644
Come on. You got special
insights in life. Let's hear it.

510
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:15,120
<i>80% of the world
doesn't look like you.</i>

511
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,829
I'll bet that drives
you crazy, huh?

512
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:21,629
- Let's see how hard-core you really are.
- Don't touch me, faggot!

513
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,663
Nice.

514
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,568
Where'd you pick up
that party line?

515
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,906
The Internet?
Some angry short-order cook...

516
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
<i>a couple of credits
short on his G.E.D.?</i>

517
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:40,082
- I been reading.
- Jeffrey read those books in school?

518
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,018
No way.
That school's all Negro.

519
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,819
<i>Jeffrey can't even walk
to class without gettin'jumped.</i>

520
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:51,657
- He have any trouble with Lydell Crouch?
- Him and his homies. Yeah.

521
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,527
<i>- So Jeffrey took out Lydell.
- I didn't say that.</i>

522
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,367
<i>What's Jeffrey's beef with the gay guys
over on Doverson?</i>

523
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,177
No beef. Just for fun.

524
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:12,715
When we need cash, we pull a knife,
take their wallets.

525
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,114
They're not gonna
talk to the cops...

526
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,949
<i>say they're tryin'to
fudge-pack some teenagers.</i>

527
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,617
What'd Jeffrey
need money for last night?

528
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,690
A gun to kill Lydell with?

529
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,330
<i>Is that what he was plannin'to do
with the rest of Lydell's buddies?</i>

530
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,535
Come here!
You see that?

531
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,643
You see that?

532
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:41,771
<i>If there's one thing this country's good
at, it's incarcerating black males.</i>

533
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,979
That's where they belong.

534
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,120
Yeah? Well, guess what?

535
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,317
It's one thing to chant "Heil Hitler"
in your buddy's rec room.

536
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,451
It's another thing entirely
to say it loud and proud...

537
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,753
in the exercise yard
at Pelican Bay.

538
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:02,128
You do the math and tell me exactly how it is
you think you're gonna survive down there.

539
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,428
With help
from the brotherhood.

540
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,347
I don't get it.

541
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,276
You got the attitude.
You got the tats.

542
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,753
Why would you help a nigger?

543
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,290
<i>- I'd never do that.
- Well, you are right now.</i>

544
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,824
- Jeff's father's a black guy.
- I've met his mom. She's pure.

545
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,629
His dad's not.

546
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:44,137
Look. See that guy right there?
That's Jeffrey's dad.

547
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,768
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

548
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,472
Jeffrey never told you, did he?

549
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,444
Come on.

550
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,251
I'll go introduce you to him.

551
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,523
<i>Then you'll tell me
where I can find Jeffrey.</i>

552
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:11,599
<i>- Jeffrey's a nigger?
- The worst kind.</i>

553
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,659
<i>Shane!</i>

554
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,169
- Shane!
- Oh, God. Shane!

555
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,935
He's hit! Oh, God! Shane!

556
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,948
Drop it!

557
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,386
Everyone all right?

558
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:12,096
Shane took one in the vest.
Luckily the door slowed the bullet down first.

559
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:15,759
<i>It's just a bruise.
Found this in Jeffrey's pocket.</i>

560
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,330
It's a hit list and a map of
his victims' houses circled.

561
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,199
You got him before
his spree really started.

562
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,238
Lem got him.

563
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,189
- What's goin' on?
- Somebody called my house.

564
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,833
- They told Vanessa?
- They told Randall.

565
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,695
A 10-year-old boy.
They just threw it in his face.

566
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,773
<i>- Oh, man, that's horrible.
- I made those choices.</i>

567
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,968
<i>- I can live with the consequences.
- Julien...</i>

568
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,073
But why punish a little boy?

569
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,097
Keys.

570
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,184
Jeffrey was armed.

571
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,753
<i>He was planning
on hurting other kids.</i>

572
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,988
<i>He shot another police officer
in the chest. We had no choice but to...</i>

573
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,635
I really tried
to get him back to you.

574
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,018
I've got a ton of work to do.

575
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,621
Whoever killed those other
two boys is still out there.

576
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,293
Gotta comb through the rest of Brent's files,
make sure nothing else was missed...

577
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,361
probably re-interview witnesses.

578
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,690
Can't let the trail get too cold.

579
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,266
Probably not
gonna get much sleep.

580
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,299
I'll see ya in the morning.

581
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,444
Pitching him not to cut it so deeply
on the supplemental...

582
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,084
and that pencil-neck
deputy of his...

583
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,949
- uh, what's that... that guy Kelly...
- Kelly.

584
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,816
Pipes in and says,
"What about the supplemental?"

585
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,654
- And the...
- Excuse me.

586
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,763
I'm sorry to disturb your dinner.

587
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,228
It's quite all right.

588
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,163
What can I help you with?

589
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,240
If you offered me
that job, I'd take it.

590
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:12,300
- So now you want it?
- No, but I'd take it.

591
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,011
You always communicate in riddles?

592
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,079
I've kept
my head down long enough.

593
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,014
I don't like
what I'm seeing lately...

594
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,619
so it's either do something about it
or quit.

595
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,218
And I'm way too young to retire.

596
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,023
Enjoy your meal.

597
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,446
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk about this...

598
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,744
but me, Lem and Ronnie really think
that there might be...

599
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,384
<i>- Money train's back on.
- What?</i>

600
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,842
<i>Look, I don't know
how we're gonna do it, but we are.</i>

601
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,589
We have to make it work...

602
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,827
because we do need it
to get past all this.

603
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,068
The money train's our safety net.

604
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,669
The way things are changin'...

605
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,071
we're gonna need one soon.

606
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,683
<i>Well.</i>

607
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,584
<i>I see you've been
doing your homework.</i>

608
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,656
You have those names?

609
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,528
- Is this a joke?
- No.

610
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,968
<i>I told you to cut
the work force by 20%.</i>

611
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,234
<i>- There are five names on this list.
- Those are the real problems.</i>

612
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,607
The others are good, hardworking people
who deserve to keep their jobs.

613
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,579
- Vic Mackey?
- It all starts with him.

614
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,943
Shane Vendrell,
Ronald Gardocki...

615
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,950
Curtis Lemansky...

616
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,054
David Aceveda.

617
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,626
They couldn't
have done it without me.

618
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,829
That's all right.

619
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,502
<i>I sent the same list to the Times
and a few of the news stations.</i>

620
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,467
<i>What?</i>

621
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,702
<i>The election is tomorrow.
This'll kill you.</i>

622
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,376
I know.

623
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,846
It's the only way to pressure you into
doing something about the strike team...

624
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,349
once and for all.

625
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,421
Julien.

626
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,962
Listen, it's just a couple of guys.
They're assholes.

627
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,660
<i>It's not the whole barn.</i>

628
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,004
I need to get home
to my wife and son.

629
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:10,215
- Detective Vic Mackey?
- Yeah?

630
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,323
- You're wanted for questioning, sir.
- Excuse me?

631
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,759
Your ex-wife filed a domestic dispute
complaint, says you broke into her home.

632
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:20,058
First of all, it's my wife,
and it's my home.

633
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,596
I don't know the facts.
We're just here to affect the arrest.

634
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,667
<i>- Jesus Christ. It's just a misunderstanding.
- I'm sorry.</i>

635
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,873
I work here.
I know these people.

636
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,706
Please, can these wait
until we get outside?

637
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,977
You know I can't do that.

638
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,079
We need your gun.

639
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,743
Can you block the way, at least?

640
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,749
Gun.

641
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,285
Here.

642
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,250
<i>- What in the hell is this?
- Corrine.</i>

643
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,889
- We had an argument. It's a mistake.
- Jesus Christ.

644
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,526
- Ah, come on. Guys, it's bullshit.
- I'm sorry.

645
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,894
Hold on a second.

646
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,371
- I got him.
- Thanks.
