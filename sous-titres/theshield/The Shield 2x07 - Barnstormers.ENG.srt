1
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,457
Bang! You're dead.

2
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,755
<i>Now, on the day, there'll be two guys
with Glocks at 11:00.</i>

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,751
<i>Damn, I thought you said it was 9:00.</i>

4
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,165
That's why
we're rehearsing.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,966
<i>- Mind getting that thing off of me?
Gives me the creeps.</i>

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,964
<i>There'll be no one inside that bay.</i>

7
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,597
<i>Vans will pull in there.
We'll be waitin'for 'em.</i>

8
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,870
- Secrecy over muscle.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,213
So how much dirty money
is this thing gonna be carrying?

10
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,815
Enough for the four of us
to retire.

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,683
- Sorry I'm late.
- This job depends on the four
of us having our act together.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,450
<i>- Where the hell were you?
- I've been driving around in circles.</i>

13
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,128
<i>I thought I was being followed
by some Mexican.</i>

14
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,255
<i>- One of Armadillos's boys?
- I don't know.</i>

15
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,224
Maybe. Uh...
Maybe it's just some pizza delivery guy.

16
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,167
Stalked by a cheese and sausage.

17
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,841
- This greenlight thing is serious.
- You been gettin' enough sleep?

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,312
Yeah, just being cautious.

19
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,907
Okay, good. All of us should be
extra careful till we find this prick.

20
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,719
Now that paranoia boy's here,
you gonna run through this thing again?

21
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,447
- Till we get it right.
- All right. Let's do it.

22
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,456
Marcy Lindhoff agreed
to a plea.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,261
<i>How much time's
she getting?</i>

24
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,355
Eight years, in exchange for testimony
against her husband.

25
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,594
Eight years?
The D.A. agreed to that?

26
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,666
<i>To avoid shining the light
on our screwup, yes.</i>

27
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,568
<i>We had the victim alive
in a car trunk...</i>

28
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,540
in our own parking lot for hours
until you released the main suspects...

29
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,371
at which point she died.

30
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,374
The D.A. arranged for you
to take Marcy's statement.

31
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,820
<i>Confirm the facts she gave him
jive with your investigation.</i>

32
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,417
Dutch, the chief
called me personally.

33
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,463
He's not pleased,
and to be honest...

34
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,395
I'm concerned about
your performance as well.

35
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,731
Uh, I'm going through
a rough patch.

36
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,999
<i>- It happens to everybody.
- Claudette says you're moody, distracted.</i>

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,167
She said that?

38
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,275
You need to start
closing cases...

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,382
<i>and closing them
without incident.</i>

40
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,381
Okay.

41
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,789
<i>Detective!</i>

42
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,225
<i>It's Doug
from the front desk.</i>

43
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,160
<i>Detective!</i>

44
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,630
Detective,
that couple's at it again.

45
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,067
<i>Aren't you going to do something?</i>

46
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,169
Goddamn it.

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,203
- You want me to back you up?
- I've only done this about 3,000 times.

48
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,938
Okay, if you need me,
I'm here.

49
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,386
- Yes?
- I live across the street.
I'm here about the noise.

50
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,624
I'm sorry.
I had the TV set up too loud.

51
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,318
Let me in. I wanna talk to the jackass
who's beatin' on you.

52
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,829
- I'm fine, really.
- Is he still here?

53
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,297
No.

54
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,198
It was just an argument.

55
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,103
- I see he talks with his hands.
- I didn't call the police.

56
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,206
Yes, you did,
through my closed windows.

57
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,110
- Look, it won't happen...
- I can't lay in bed and listen
to him doing it to you, okay?

58
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,186
- So you're either gonna move...
or get some help.
- We can't afford to move!

59
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,515
I don't need any help!

60
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,955
<i>If you're not gonna move,
then you're gonna get some help. Let's go.</i>

61
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,872
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm perfect.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,805
<i>Congratulations
on your plea.</i>

63
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,850
- Thank you.
- The plea's bullshit, Marcy.

64
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,350
You deserve life
just like Bob.

65
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,388
No, I mean, thank you.

66
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,925
I guess the D.A. didn't
want this to go public.

67
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:28,031
You need to be 100% open and honest
with me, or you lose your deal, understood?

68
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:32,129
- Yes.
- The peephole... Who put it in and why?

69
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,470
<i>That was Bob. He liked how Kayla looked.
He wanted to see more.</i>

70
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,112
- You were okay with this?
- Bob liked bringing other women into our bed.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,374
I wanted him to be happy.

72
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,916
Did Bob want to bring Kayla
into your bed?

73
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,782
He asked me to talk to her.
I did. She wasn't interested.

74
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,683
So you lured her over
to your apartment one night?

75
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,023
<i>Bob was... obsessed.</i>

76
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,562
He thought
she was so pretty.

77
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,894
Bob said it was your idea
to cut off Kayla's arm.

78
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,494
Yeah.

79
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,006
After that, she, uh,
she wasn't so pretty.

80
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,717
<i>Okay.</i>

81
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:21,175
Me and Shane are gonna clear the roof.
Ronnie, you disarm this guy.

82
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,857
Lem, you hit the ground,
grab the truck.

83
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,223
- Hit 'em fast and leave 'em reelin'
- It can work.

84
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,293
<i>Why are we even talking about this
when Armadillo's got a hit out on us?</i>

85
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,158
We got feelers out on the street.
We get a call, we'll grab him.

86
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,199
And when we do,
Vic and me got a plan.

87
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,929
We're gonna tie him up, stick him
someplace safe till we hit the money train.

88
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,473
Then we're gonna leave him dead
in the getaway truck.

89
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,975
<i>The Armenians and cops
will think the Torrucos are responsible.</i>

90
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,542
- Two birds with one stone.
- Only one problem.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,377
<i>- Besides the fact we don't
know where Armadillo is?
- Stop being such a pussy.</i>

92
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,676
Excuse me for wanting
to stay alive.

93
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,186
<i>Then let's stick
to the job at hand.</i>

94
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,219
What are we gonna do
with the money?

95
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,590
- It's too much to spend right
away without drawing attention.
- We launder it.

96
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,959
Got a friend who just bought into a restaurant.
Practically an all-cash business.

97
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,330
That's what I.A.D. is gonna look into.
We can't do this alone.

98
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,767
You're sayin'
let someone else in?

99
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:16,032
Someone we can control, who's gonna
be more afraid of us than going to prison.

100
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,668
You used to know
a guy named Tio?

101
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,343
- Why are we not in a police station?
- Theodore Osmond, drug dealer.

102
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,111
Guy you helped to buy
a comic book shop in another building.

103
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:32,225
Tio, sure. I heard somebody, uh,
burned him to death.

104
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,523
- That's terrible.
- So you did sell him the store?

105
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,758
I brokered that deal.
I'm a licensed realtor.

106
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,727
- Then you know Tio sold
narcotics out of that store.
- No.

107
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,527
He bought the place cash.
Where'd you think he got his money from?

108
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,103
I don't ask my clients
where they get their money.

109
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,571
<i>Is that because most of your clients
are drug dealers?</i>

110
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,333
<i>I think you specialize
in buying property for drug dealers...</i>

111
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,274
so they can launder money.

112
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,913
<i>- Isn't that right?
- This is ridiculous.</i>

113
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,573
Checked your files,
Leith.

114
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,987
Tied you to four
major dealers.

115
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:05,253
How'd you like to see
our police station now?

116
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,651
I don't touch
any of that.

117
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,819
I just buy and sell
property.

118
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,454
The only property you're gonna be
sellin' now is bunk space in Pelican Bay.

119
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,498
Please.

120
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,000
Wh-What do you guys want?

121
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,036
Real estate.

122
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,485
She'll have to be wait-listed
at another shelter.

123
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,754
Can't you pull some strings?
She's a neighbor. You're a friend.

124
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,323
I filled my last bed this morning.
What about a hotel?

125
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,262
She can't afford a hotel.

126
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,001
I might be able
to double her up someplace.

127
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,764
Do, and I'll owe you dinner.

128
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,066
Even if I find a spot,
she's not gonna go.

129
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,213
And I'm partial
to steak joints.

130
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,376
They don't leave until they call
from the street or the hospital.

131
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,751
She didn't even call.
It's a waste of time.

132
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,218
Just find a bed.
I'll put her in it.

133
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,021
Is that everything?

134
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,526
Yeah. We're done.

135
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,735
Why'd you do this?

136
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,569
It just kind of... happened.

137
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,439
No, I mean, uh...

138
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,480
what made you think
you could fool me?

139
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,211
I didn't fool you.

140
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,653
I just let you
fool yourself.

141
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,864
Dutch, how'd it go?

142
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,628
- I got everything I needed.
- Good, 'cause we got a case.

143
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,234
Woman strangled to death
in Fairview Park.

144
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,435
You sure you want
my help?

145
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,068
According to Aceveda,
I'm moody and distracted.

146
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,742
He said that to you?

147
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,248
Why am I even in a police station?
I didn't do anything.

148
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,183
Fine. Go home.

149
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,189
Next time Prince Charming starts using you
for sparring practice, keep it down.

150
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,227
Look... I know it's hard
to leave your home.

151
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,433
<i>- It was hard my first time.
- I don't need a damn shelter.</i>

152
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:32,132
<i>Sometimes staying away even one night
makes him realize he's crossed a line.</i>

153
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,003
If you don't do it now...

154
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,642
you might never get
another chance.

155
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,012
<i>- I don't even have any of my stuff.
- Here, give me your keys.</i>

156
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,322
- I'll bring you whatever you need.
- I don't want you in my house!

157
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:51,722
<i>I'll get you some clothes.</i>

158
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,160
You can't make somebody
get help.

159
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,095
Sure you can.
Keep working on her.

160
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,097
You don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,102
So eight years as a street cop cleanin'
up messes like this means nothin'?

162
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,798
It's a different game when you're the one
on the receiving end of a fist.

163
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,707
That's why the next time this guy wakes me up,
I'm gonna have a chat with him.

164
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,108
It'll stop. Trust me.

165
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,045
Stop violence
with violence?

166
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,650
<i>Why do men
always have the answers?</i>

167
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,685
That's a good question.

168
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,722
<i>- Any witnesses?
- No.</i>

169
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,867
Couple of teenagers smoking joints
discovered the body.

170
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,734
Found her purse and wallet
in the bushes.

171
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,629
Her name's
Leah Madson.

172
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,400
Never seen a victim strangled
with an over-the-shoulder boulder holder.

173
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm not in the mood, Ray.

174
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,041
M.E. said no prints
on the victim's body.

175
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,412
<i>Doesn't appear to have been forcibly
removed. Bra's not damaged either.</i>

176
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,146
But the clasp is missing.

177
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,452
- Probably fell off when he strangled her.
- What are you thinking?

178
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,290
I don't know.
Uh, rape turned homicide maybe.

179
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,295
What's this?
Chocolate?

180
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,666
It's on her fingers.
Means she helped him remove the bra.

181
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,602
This didn't start off
as a rape.

182
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,675
<i>- They knew each other.
- Yeah.</i>

183
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,439
Guess I'm wrong again.

184
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,648
Downtown just faxed
a list of promotions.

185
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,947
Stewart and Hernandez
got the two senior lead officer spots.

186
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,286
I was next in line
for that.

187
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,595
I know.

188
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,928
This has to do with the complaint
the widow's been filing against me, huh?

189
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,797
The marijuana I.A.D.
found in my car.

190
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,802
<i>I.A.D. believed you. There's no reason
that should have any bearing...</i>

191
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,207
<i>Come on!
That promotion was a lock.</i>

192
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:52,439
You're telling me this has nothing to do
with the bogus complaints put against me?

193
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,103
Of course that's what this is about,
but the brass will never admit it.

194
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,951
You're gonna have to
ride this out.

195
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,320
<i>Detective Vendrell.</i>

196
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,527
There's somebody here
to see you.

197
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,896
Well, well, it's the penis flytrap.
Hope you're not a daddy.

198
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,768
Hey, Georgia.
Can I talk to you?

199
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,964
I'm, uh...
I'm a little busy right now.

200
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,476
I got a case.
Illegal activities.

201
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,384
My ex, selling 'scrip drugs
to illegals, grannies...

202
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,819
anyone looking for
a cheap way to medicate.

203
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,895
- Sounds like you found
yourself a real winner.
- I said my ex.

204
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,991
Bastard was banging my neighbor while I was
sweating my ass off at the strip club.

205
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,029
<i>Figured the best way to pay him back
would just be to drop a dime on him.</i>

206
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,296
Still all class, huh?

207
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,772
Are you still upset
about what happened between us?

208
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,739
Nothing happened
between us.

209
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,844
Come on.
It was just fun.

210
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,844
No. It was blackmail.

211
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,540
Seriously.

212
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,313
My ex,
he's a bad dude...

213
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,726
and I would only trust
a really good cop with this.

214
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:17,492
Look around and take your pick.
I'm not your guy.

215
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,301
So why aren't we following up
on Tulips's lead?

216
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,301
She's a lying whore.

217
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,141
I trusted her,
and she screwed me.

218
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,666
From what I saw that day,
the screwing was mutual.

219
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,041
I just don't want to
be around her.

220
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:39,047
So we lose an easy bust on our record
because you got played for a fool?

221
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,120
Fine. Fine.

222
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,260
Brent. Brent, it's okay.
I got it.

223
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,056
You, come with me.

224
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,095
Groovy.

225
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,699
You know this woman, Stu?

226
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,637
This girl at the rib joint I work at
set me up with her.

227
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,006
- Went out with her last night?
- We met at her place at 9:00.

228
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,046
How long did you stay?

229
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,580
I didn't.
I wasn't attracted to her.

230
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,741
I figured,
why waste both our time?

231
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>- Where'd you go then?
- Home.</i>

232
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,655
- Anyone who can corroborate that?
- I don't think so.

233
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,256
I just went home,
watched some TV.

234
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,955
Any word on Stu's alibi?

235
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,928
No one to confirm
or deny.

236
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,036
- What about his coworkers?
- I'm heading over to talk to them now.

237
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,732
Long as I'm not too moody
to change my mind...

238
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,140
or too distracted
to lose my way.

239
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,246
Why is what I said to you in confidence
about Dutch coming back to me?

240
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,885
Because his results lately
are a concern.

241
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,945
<i>I was concerned about Dutch personally,
not about his job performance.</i>

242
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,686
It's not just me.
This is the chief.

243
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,294
Bob and Marcy were a serious
black eye for us.

244
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,956
It happened right under the nose
of our civilian auditor.

245
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,026
- Is Lanie behind this?
- She hasn't been here in a few weeks.

246
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,203
Who knows who
she's talking to?

247
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:08,037
<i>Until further notice, you'll be
lead investigator on all your cases.</i>

248
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,507
Oh. How is Dutch supposed to get back on
the horse when you cut him off at the knees?

249
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,305
<i>- I just don't want to see him screw up again.
- He won't.</i>

250
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,478
I hope not.

251
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,346
<i>- Because if he does,
I can't protect him anymore.
- Why?</i>

252
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,817
Too busy protecting Vic?

253
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,435
Who the hell are you?
What the...

254
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,540
- I'm a cop.
- What do you want?

255
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,836
Look, I don't know what she told you,
but she's a lying bitch.

256
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,541
She said it was all her fault.
You didn't touch her.

257
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,648
The lying bitch.

258
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,221
<i>Hey, where you going?</i>

259
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,127
Where is she, man?

260
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,923
What, you sleepin' with her
or somethin'?

261
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,560
Answer me, man!

262
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,933
<i>That's not hers. It's my sister's.
Give it back.</i>

263
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,903
I said give it back!

264
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,710
Thanks, asshole.

265
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,146
- You just made me a very happy man.
- Ow!

266
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,714
Thank you
for bringing lunch.

267
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,186
Wait till you see the spread you get
when you're actually my husband.

268
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,623
So it's okay if I drop off Randall later
when I get my dress fitted?

269
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,628
- Sure.
- What's wrong? You seem a little distracted.

270
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,427
- Uh...
- Don't tell me. Cold feet.

271
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,535
No, no. No.

272
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,770
- So?
- Um...

273
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,469
The prayer group that I go to
on Thursday night isn't just Bible study.

274
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,275
What else is it?

275
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:03,217
- It's also a sexual reorientation group.
- Reorientation?

276
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,789
I've made some bad choices
in my past.

277
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,360
- Bad relationship choices.
- We all have.

278
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,258
- It's okay.
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

279
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,329
Um...

280
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,704
I used to be attracted
to men...

281
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,707
but through counseling and the grace of God
and Jesus, I've straightened myself...

282
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,707
- You're gay?
- No. No, I am not.

283
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,380
Oh, God. God.

284
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,143
<i>- Randall looks to you like you're his father.
- Vanessa. Vanessa.</i>

285
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,946
I am the man that God
intended me to be.

286
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,556
<i>I am with a beautiful woman.
I'm about to start a family.</i>

287
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,321
I love you.
I just didn't want any secrets.

288
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,158
- When was the last time you were with a guy?
- It has been months.

289
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,657
I've been in this group
for months.

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,894
You had sex with a man?

291
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,911
I... I have made mistakes
in my past...

292
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:02,677
but I am begging you for your
understanding and your forgiveness.

293
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,109
I need you.
I need you.

294
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,224
I need to think.

295
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,205
<i>Hey, hey, baby! Baby!
Baby, tell them it's all good with us!</i>

296
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,969
You said you wouldn't arrest him!
He's on parole!

297
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,342
<i>If he goes to jail, he loses his job.
I lose my apartment.</i>

298
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,813
- You stay alive, and I get some goddamn sleep.
- Keep your hands off her!

299
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,338
- He didn't hit me. Let him go.
- Stay back.

300
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,648
<i>- I'll take her.
- Baby, get me out of here.</i>

301
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,078
- Call Skeeter. He knows a bail guy.
- Shut up.

302
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,189
<i>A couple can hit each other,
hate each other...</i>

303
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,285
but tell them they're wrong
for each other, they look at you
like you're speaking in tongues.

304
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,661
Gee, I never heard that before.

305
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,198
You actually thought she wouldn't go back
to him? Are you unromantic or just dumb?

306
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,700
I just didn't want to
hear 'em in my living room anymore.

307
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,534
It's harder to get out
than you think.

308
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,939
- Like the bad boys, did we?
- It had its appeal for a while.

309
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,238
And then it didn't.
She hasn't hit bottom.

310
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,246
She's not ready
for me yet.

311
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,509
He touches her again,
he's mine.

312
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,450
You just can't stand
anything you can't control.

313
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,215
That's part of my dance.

314
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:31,167
Your, uh, coworkers say you're a bit
obsessive about your weight.

315
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,396
Summers at fat farms,
dozens of diets...

316
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,075
weight training,
yoga, running.

317
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,203
<i>- All true.
- What happened with Susan Lane?</i>

318
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,704
Aggravated assault
when you were 12 years old.

319
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,875
That's what they called it. She didn't want
people to think she was a slut.

320
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,289
<i>Now, you and some other kids
were playing spin-the-bottle.</i>

321
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,655
On her spin,
the bottle pointed to you.

322
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:04,662
She was supposed to kiss you.
She refused. You were humiliated.

323
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,796
So 11 years later, I killed some chick?
Come on!

324
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,739
A few days later, you followed
Susan home from school.

325
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,208
<i>You told her to kiss you.
She refused.</i>

326
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,371
You struck her.
You broke her nose.

327
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,983
<i>She tried to kiss me.
I wouldn't.</i>

328
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,711
She slapped me,
so I hit her.

329
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,355
You were the last person
to see Leah Madson alive, Stu.

330
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,118
- Except the killer.
- Yeah, except the killer.

331
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,527
Pretty quiet in there.
Any thoughts?

332
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,602
Uh... hard to read.

333
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,438
- Let's check his apartment,
see what we can come up with.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,214
Keep it short and simple.
Tell him I got a supply, I need a buyer.

335
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,080
Just, uh, get a time and place
and then hang up the phone.

336
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,583
- How come you don't look at me?
- What?

337
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,120
You don't look at me.

338
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,317
Just make
the goddamn call.

339
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,326
God.

340
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,938
It's me.

341
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,940
Mmm, look,
I don't want to fight.

342
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,546
I've got a guy who wants to
hook you up with some product.

343
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,218
Hell, yeah, I'm still pissed,
but you know what? A buck's a buck.

344
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,050
<i>- Danny, find the bra clasp?
- Nothing yet.</i>

345
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,585
<i>I'm guessing it's here
or in his car.</i>

346
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,721
<i>Maybe on a shoe or, uh...</i>

347
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,237
We find that bra clasp,
we've got this guy dead to rights.

348
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,305
We're lookin'.

349
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,450
<i>Odd place.</i>

350
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,320
<i>What's it tell you
about our guy?</i>

351
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,299
Uh... I don't know.

352
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,360
You must be thinking something.
What's your gut tell you?

353
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,069
There are red flags
everywhere with this guy.

354
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,906
- Red flags for what?
- Possible serial predator.

355
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,944
<i>- Think he's a serial killer?
- Or a rapist.</i>

356
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,344
He has the makings of one...
the obsession with detail...

357
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,952
the, uh, reliance
on fantasy.

358
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,289
They're warning posts.

359
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:41,350
He's young, and if he is one,
I'm guessing Leah's his first or second.

360
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,492
- You know, it's a bunch of crap.
- No, no.

361
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,828
We got nothing else to go on.
It's worth exploring.

362
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,698
- We need to find the bra clasp, people.
- Our guys are already on it.

363
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,465
Let's go back to the barn,
get a confession from Stu.

364
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,700
- I don't have anything to work with.
- You've done it before.

365
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:04,272
I'm gonna head back to the crime scene,
make sure those guys didn't miss anything.

366
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,154
Three, four million, I can get you
a few 10-acre lots in Castro Peak.

367
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,423
<i>They'll appreciate nice
in a few years.</i>

368
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,125
Nothing in your name,
but you'll have total control.

369
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,171
- All cash.
- All cash.

370
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:28,537
I usually get
a five-percent commission.

371
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,570
- Why don't we make it ten percent?
- Uh...

372
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,575
Ten?

373
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,079
Good faith.

374
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,684
Plus a little extra money,
since you're taking the extra risk.

375
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,583
What extra risk?

376
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,849
Well...

377
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,324
if you even think
about rattin' us out...

378
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:53,624
we tell the four drug dealers you've been doin'
business with that you ratted them out.

379
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,097
Bang, bang.

380
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,269
I understand.

381
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,244
Look, you guys searched
my apartment, right?

382
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,373
There was nothing there.
I'd be hearing about it if there was.

383
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,883
<i>If you're so innocent, maybe you'd like
to take a lie detector test?</i>

384
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,886
No.

385
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,156
Afraid of something?

386
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,850
No, I just hear
they're not so reliable.

387
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,294
What if I took it, and it said
I was guilty when I'm not?

388
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,434
<i>He's suspicious but clean.
Dutch has a theory though.</i>

389
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,873
<i>What's your theory,
Claudette?</i>

390
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,001
I don't have one.
Ask Dutch.

391
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,943
It's nothing.

392
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,013
He thinks Stu's guilty.

393
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,617
He shows signs
of being a predator.

394
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,690
- We have any proof?
- There are definite warning signs.

395
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:55,524
He refused to take a lie detector,
talked about getting a false guilty reading.

396
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,052
Nobody who's innocent
does that.

397
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,464
Thinking he's guilty is one thing,
proving it's another.

398
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,367
Find out who did it
and close this case.

399
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,877
A night at a shelter is a good first step,
so how do we get her to take it?

400
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:21,313
<i>- Not by forcing her caveman style.
- I do have to get some sleep.</i>

401
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,546
And I wanna see her
stay in one piece.

402
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:28,115
I have been known in dire times
of resorting to trickery.

403
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,591
If I spend a night
in the shelter...

404
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,131
Dez won't have to
spend a night in jail.

405
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,768
It's a new city law.

406
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,370
We have to hold alleged
abusers overnight...

407
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,336
for the woman's safety.

408
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,240
Okay, then. I wanna try your place
for a night.

409
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,780
Good.

410
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,693
Nice tits.
How much they cost?

411
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,862
<i>Hundred percent natural.
Jealous?</i>

412
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,600
- Is she legal?
- Born in Inglewood, bitch.

413
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,439
<i>- I meant is she 18, stupid?
- Yeah, and I take her everywhere with me.</i>

414
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,978
- She doesn't piss me off.
- Screw you.

415
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,879
- Not anymore.
- Ah, and you miss it. He gets it all now.

416
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,451
So this asshole's
your new boyfriend?

417
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,819
- Yeah, it's a relief not
having to fake it anymore.
- Can we get down to business?

418
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,594
So what you got?

419
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:39,325
- Uh... Ex, oxy, pot, mash, stash, Rx.
- I need Viagra.

420
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,957
Yeah, you do.

421
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,159
Anything to make it bigger
like my man's?

422
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,669
- I need "V" and Ex. That'll be all.
- How much weight you need?

423
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,533
Start out slow.
How 'bout five-grand worth?

424
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,834
Five grand?
Yeah, I'm your man.

425
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,113
<i>- Don't forget about my cut.
- I pay loverboy.
You get your money from him.</i>

426
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,877
- That wasn't the deal. That was not the deal!
- Is now.

427
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,648
- Just get in the car, dear.
- Anything you say, honey.

428
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,591
Here you go.

429
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,256
You got the money?

430
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,269
Here's your 5K.

431
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,104
<i>- If this stuff sucks, I'm comin' after her.
- Be my guest.</i>

432
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,935
- He doesn't mean that. That's love talk.
- Let's go.

433
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,907
<i>All right. Let's go. Piggies in the air!</i>

434
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,177
Right now!
Turn around!

435
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,922
Come on! Turn around, high life boy!
Let's go! Hands on your head.

436
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,617
You too, darling. Let's go.
Hands on your head.

437
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,959
<i>You dumb a-hole! You just got busted
by my new big-dick boyfriend!</i>

438
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,257
How does it feel, you fag?
Aah!

439
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,868
<i>- How does it feel?
- Bitch!</i>

440
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:54,631
<i>Will you shut up?
Damn it.</i>

441
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,985
<i>You ever know
somebody's guilty...</i>

442
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,417
but you just don't
have the evidence?

443
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,115
- On occasion.
- How do you handle it?

444
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,761
You wearin' a wire?

445
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,628
I'm tired of people
gettin' away with murder.

446
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,295
Sometimes the evidence
fits the case.

447
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:31,773
Sometimes you gotta
make the evidence fit the case.

448
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,708
If you know the guy did it.

449
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,706
<i>We're still working it.</i>

450
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,351
- Hey, still didn't find anything?
- The place is clean.

451
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,020
- I'm gonna take one last look.
- Sure.

452
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,975
- Well?
- You sure you were thorough?

453
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,811
- Yeah.
- Do me a favor. Check one more time.

454
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,680
The trash, uh, his clothes.

455
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,449
- You gonna sign for the overtime?
- Yeah. Just be sure.

456
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,645
Yeah?

457
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,189
I think
I left somethin'.

458
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,283
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

459
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,049
Actually, I'm not.
I'm having...

460
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,025
A really bad day.

461
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,062
We busted him, didn't we?

462
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,725
<i>This whole thing was about you burning some
guy who dumped you for somebody hotter.</i>

463
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,701
It was not.

464
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,466
And no way was that taco tart
hotter than me.

465
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:22,442
- You don't think so, do you?
- I think you use people.

466
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,083
<i>You're really upset
with me.</i>

467
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:29,417
- You got what you wanted.
Just get out of here.
- Oh... my God.

468
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,318
I really hurt you,
just like he hurt me.

469
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,053
- I'm sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

470
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,492
I'm always falling
for the wrong guys...

471
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,097
when I'd just be better off
with someone like you.

472
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,363
Yeah, you would,
but you'll never know.

473
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,240
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

474
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,811
I got like six hours
left on my shift.

475
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,971
Oh.

476
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,849
Well, don't you have to, um,
interrogate me or something?

477
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,319
You know, just to wrap it up.

478
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,279
- Come on. I'm bailed. Let's go, baby.
- She's not going home with you.

479
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,212
<i>- You stay out of my business, bitch.
- She's not going home with you.</i>

480
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,750
- Emma?
- I'm doing this for you. It's the law.

481
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,083
<i>What law? They can't keep us apart.
Come on. Let's go.</i>

482
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,954
She needs a break from your macho bullshit,
so go hit somebody else tonight.

483
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,288
You want some too,
bitch?

484
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,263
<i>Dez!</i>

485
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,371
<i>What's going on?
Hey, hey. Stay still. Stay still.</i>

486
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,167
<i>Oops.</i>

487
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,548
It was self-defense.

488
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,949
- She pushed a man off the balcony.
- He was attacking her.

489
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,384
It happened on our property.
There are legal and civil considerations.

490
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,184
- I don't want her in the cage.
- Then bail her out.

491
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,849
Thanks for your help.

492
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,432
- Come on. Let's go.
- Where?

493
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,469
- What are you doing?
- Had some bad mojo in there lately.

494
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,475
<i>I need a new room.</i>

495
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,807
It's all yours,
Dutch-boy.

496
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,454
You couldn't take a lie detector
if you wanted to...

497
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,553
because the wire wouldn't fit
around that thick wrist of yours.

498
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,662
- What?
- You know what word you never use, Stu?

499
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:55,257
"Fat." I bet people don't call you that
to your face either.

500
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:59,295
They're too polite.
They should, though, because... you are fat.

501
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,768
You were a fat baby.
You were a fat little kid...

502
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,200
and now you're just
a goddamn whale.

503
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,436
I-I've busted
black killers...

504
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,240
<i>white killers,
smart killers, dumb killers.</i>

505
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,575
Never anybody
as fat as you.

506
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,244
See, the bra you used
to strangle Leah with...

507
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,685
the clasp was broken.

508
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,621
Your, uh, fat fingers
weren't nimble enough to unclasp it...

509
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,227
so you just ripped it off her,
didn't you, Stu?

510
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,367
Which means that bra clasp
is somewhere in your house...

511
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:33,963
your car, your extra, extra,
extra-large clothes.

512
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,067
I don't need
a lie detector, Stu.

513
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,111
I can get you
on physical evidence.

514
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,645
<i>And let me
tell you something.</i>

515
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,080
A jail cell feels small...

516
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,051
<i>to someone my size.</i>

517
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,083
He's going too far.

518
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,718
- You can't get me.
- I'm gonna get you right here.

519
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,761
<i>I'm unstoppable.</i>

520
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,100
Hey, big guy,
your mom's here.

521
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,672
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mom.

522
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,847
Baby, keep your grandma company.
She's in the car.

523
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,338
- I parked it out back, okay?
- Okay. See you, Julien.

524
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,116
See you later, big guy.

525
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,693
- You should've told me sooner.
- I know.

526
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,727
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:38,464
I believe you when you say
that you've changed.

528
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,434
- I believe in the power of our Lord.
- Thank you.

529
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,504
But...

530
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,803
if you ever feel...
like you want to be with a man...

531
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,709
- I won't. I won't. I never...
- I need...

532
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,713
I never will be again.

533
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,816
I'm gonna make
the two of you so happy.

534
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,927
Kiss me.

535
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,353
Okay.

536
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,517
Well, uh, I have a hundred things to do
before the wedding.

537
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,788
Okay.

538
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,796
Okay.

539
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,899
So, um...

540
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,131
so the wedding's
still on?

541
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,935
Don't keep me waiting
up there, okay?

542
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,041
Never.

543
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,216
- She's a beautiful girl.
- Yeah.

544
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,983
I guess I must have
missed somethin'.

545
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,895
Last person I saw you kissin'
was a little more... male.

546
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,999
- You sure you know what you're doin'?
- Yeah.

547
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,239
In that case,
congratulations.

548
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,917
When was the last time you saw
your dick without using a mirror?

549
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,355
Shut up.

550
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,291
So you got set up on a blind date
with Leah Madson.

551
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,566
Oh, wow.

552
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,831
I mean, her friend was cute.
You must have expected a hottie.

553
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,663
Nope. Instead
it's big, fat Leah.

554
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,436
I mean, you deserve better, right?

555
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,772
- I get better.
- No, you don't.

556
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,381
Women won't sleep
with you.

557
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,913
So you're horny.

558
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,385
You figure, what the hell...
park's dark.

559
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,059
Wh-What's the old joke
about fat chicks?

560
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:18,358
Roll 'em in flour
and aim for the wet spot.

561
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,299
Hey, is that...
is that what it's like?

562
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,629
- I wasn't attracted to her.
- I know.

563
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,067
Leah was fat. She couldn't stop eating.
She had no control.

564
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,937
<i>You hated that.</i>

565
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,508
But there you are...

566
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,976
on that park bench...

567
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,243
hating yourself for every minute
you can't control your little hard-on.

568
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,020
You had this
in your fridge for years.

569
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,748
Never took a bite.
Mmm.

570
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,991
The chocolate bar
was the trigger.

571
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:58,568
You wanted to get laid. All she could think
about was the candy in her pocket.

572
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,432
She pulled it out,
and you just lost it.

573
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,767
Strangled her with the same bra your
fat fingers were fumbling to get off of her.

574
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,707
<i>That's not who I am.</i>

575
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:12,008
- Yeah.
- Tell him you found the bra clasp.

576
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,640
Good to know.

577
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,878
<i>We found
the bra clasp, Stu.</i>

578
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,080
It was in your car.

579
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,090
- I'm not fat.
- Yeah, you're not fat.

580
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,354
I'll kill you too!
Say I'm fat! Say I'm fat!

581
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,795
<i>I'm gonna be thin!
I am! I'm gonna be!</i>

582
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,161
I'm gonna be thin!

583
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,429
Help! Get some help!
Get off of him!

584
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,665
Come on! Get off!
Get off!

585
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,201
<i>Don't move. Don't move.
Cuffhim up.</i>

586
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,075
Hey, Ronnie.

587
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,714
Shane got the pictures back. I don't want 'em
lying around for anyone else to find.

588
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,050
- Can you run 'em by my place?
- Sure.

589
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,890
Listen, while you're there,
can you get my checkbook?

590
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,432
How come?

591
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:05,129
State won't pony up the money
for a decent burial for Connie.

592
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,927
I figure it's
the least I can do.

593
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:13,006
Hey, careful out there. I hear the Thai food
delivery guys are packin' heat.

594
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,044
- You guys are dicks.
- Jesus!

595
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,875
Take a joke! God!

596
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,822
If he's freakin' out now, how's he gonna
be takin' down the money train?

597
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,687
Or when it comes time
to take care of Armadillo?

598
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,793
You trust him every day
bustin' down doors.

599
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,660
Doesn't mean I trust him to sit
on a few million for a year or two.

600
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,027
Money does strange things
to people.

601
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,533
All right. We'll keep
an eye on Ronnie.

602
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,737
- You finish up with Tulips?
- Yeah, it was a clean bust. No hitches.

603
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,704
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

604
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,880
Nice job.

605
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,178
Don't sound so surprised.

606
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,051
Well, I was just worried
about you for a little while.

607
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,454
You should have had
more faith in me.

608
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,392
- Nice work.
- I know.

609
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,122
- I'm glad.
- You should be.

610
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,803
<i>I break cases nobody else
in this division can.</i>

611
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,364
I deserve a little more goddamn respect
than I've been getting around here lately.

612
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,308
<i>You wanted me to close a case
without incident?</i>

613
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,571
I did it.

614
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,078
I guess he's back.

615
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,808
I guess so.

616
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:38,519
You run off to Mexico and miss your
court date, you owe me three grand.

617
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,195
You play with fire,
that's the chance you'll take.

618
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,527
Is he okay?

619
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,194
Unfortunately.

620
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,272
- Guess I should feel bad.
- Don't.

621
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,239
<i>Sorry.</i>

622
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,779
- Hello?
- Matthew's been asking for you.

623
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,947
- He wants to say hi.
- Great. Put him on.

624
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,916
Okay.
Say hi to Daddy.

625
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,919
Matthew,
say hi to Daddy.

626
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,682
O-On the phone.

627
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,420
Talk into the phone.

628
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,427
Say... Say-Say hi.

629
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,362
Matthew? Hey, buddy.

630
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,162
Hey, it's Daddy.
Did you go to school today?

631
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,771
Did you have fun?

632
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,431
Matthew?

633
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,077
Um... you know,
I'm sorry.

634
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,840
Uh, h-he was talking
just a second ago.

635
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,610
- It's okay. Thanks for trying.
- Okay.

636
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,482
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

637
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,554
Thanks.
I'll see you.

638
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,224
Your dog or your kid?

639
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,920
Kid. One of three.

640
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,658
I'm more a dog person.

641
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,631
Wife?

642
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,134
Separated.

643
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,452
- Wait. Wait.
- What's wrong?

644
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,962
What's that smell?

645
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,804
- What's goin' on?
- Shh. Get down.

646
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,583
Stay down.

647
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,957
Ronnie!

648
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,395
- Oh, my God.
- Call an ambulance.

649
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,966
Ronnie.

650
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,203
Vic.
