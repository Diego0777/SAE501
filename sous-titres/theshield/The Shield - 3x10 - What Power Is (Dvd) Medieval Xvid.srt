1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,634

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,737
Elisa. Be a good bitch. Get out here.

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,644

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,552

5
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,660

6
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,728
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

7
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,365
Let's go, let's go.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,710

9
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,616
Ah Detective Wagenbach
Craig Milne Pleasure

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,847
This is my partner, Claudette Wyms

11
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,753
The minute I saw the scene,
I thought of your case

12
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,817
Strangled, sexually assaulted
Semen on the abdomen

13
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,397
- It's him
- He's moved his hunting grounds

14
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,262
- We're canvassing, but so far, nothing
- Point of entry?

15
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,896
Back door. I know your guy steals figurines,
but this lady was a clean freak.

16
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,531
There's no dust
It's hard to tell if anything's gone

17
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,975
I contacted her kids They'll be able to
tell us more about her movements tonight

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,014
- Help establish a timeline
- Great. After you've done your report--

19
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,414
Oh, absolutely I'll put a rush
on the DNA and keep you posted

20
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,009
We should cross-check our notes
for similarities

21
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,520

22
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,503
Workin' on a name for the baby yet?

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,446
Uh, no, we're gonna wait
till we find out if it's a boy or a girl.

24
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,744
Let me look at your ring again

25
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,320
Oh!

26
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:06,256
- You found yourself a good one this time
- I know

27
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,796
A real Southern gentleman.

28
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:15,061
Ma, I, uh-- I need to talk to you
about that money that we gave you

29
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,705
You don't know how much it helped

30
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,367
We're not asking for it back
See, one of my clients gave it to me

31
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,809
A two percent kickback for moving
their bid to the front of the line

32
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,713
People do it all the time
in the real estate business It's just--

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,911
- It's just that it's not exactly--
- Legal?

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,113
Look, it's not a big deal

35
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,157
What Mara didn't know
is that this guy, he's, uh--

36
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,227
he's a bit of a player

37
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,888
I found out that the feds are investigating him
and that the money could be dirty

38
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,725
So, if anyone comes asking

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,806
you can't say
that it came from me 'cause--

40
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,001
'cause I could lose
my real estate license

41
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,315
It wouldn't be the first time
I covered for you, would it, sugar?

42
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,319

43
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,488
Yeah

44
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,155
Where's the goddamn money?

45
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,227
Let her go, man!
Do it now!

46
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,126
- Put the money in the bag!

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,926
Let's go
I need money! Hurry!

48
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,966

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,060
I swear to God,
I'll blow your head off

50
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,299
- Stop screwing around!
- Okay, okay!

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,433
- What the hell, man? Move your ass!
- And the coins too, asshole!

52
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,307
And the coins too!

53
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,006
Okay, okay! Don't shoot!

54
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,074
Let's go, let's go! Now, bitch!

55
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,881
Police!

56
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,151
- Get down! Get down!

57
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,988

58
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,272

59
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,171

60
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,106
Call 9-1 -1

61
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,514

62
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:53,217

63
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,658
Ripped by:

64
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,220
Hound

65
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,233

66
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,101

67
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,607
Two in the 1 0 ring Nice

68
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,077
- Yeah
- Two got away, and you hit one of them?

69
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,547
Yeah, in the, uh, arm
or the shoulder

70
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,710
I'm gonna have to
take your weapon, Captain

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,152
Well, it's my personal piece

72
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,225
I, uh, was running errands
when I saw the robbery go down

73
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,159

74
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,629
When we get an I.D., check your gang
contacts, see who his running mates are.

75
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,859
They're Byz Lats

76
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll rattle a few cages

77
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,067
You wanted back on the street,
promised you'd be more valuable there

78
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,508
I want to know every pressure point
this gang has by morning

79
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,441

80
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,913
The dead guy watched me shove a bong
down his buddy's windpipe

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,492
Twenty bucks says his buddy's
one of the other shooters

82
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,061
Captain out here in the middle
of the night, he runs into them?

83
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,529
- It's a pretty big coincidence
- Unless it's not a coincidence

84
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,368
What if these are the guys Diagur sent
to get the money out of the freezer?

85
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,770
What, the ones you told him
to send over?

86
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,901
If it's true, then these are the assholes who
kicked the shit out of Aceveda, took his gun

87
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,775
which means he was tracking them here
when this thing went down

88
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,349
He might track 'em right back
to us and that marked cash

89
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,250
Let's not get premenstrual
until we talk to Diagur Come on

90
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,084

91
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,094
Jesus, Diagur!
Who are these guys, huh?

92
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,528
Every time I see you, you've got
your mouth wrapped around a clam

93
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,863
Throw something on
We've got problems

94
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,597
Killing Ricky was payback for him
and Juan getting his gun off him

95
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:50,472
Ricky,Juan Those are the guys
you sent for the marked money?

96
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,840
- Juan, he was in on this robbery?
- Yeah

97
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,243
- What about the other guy?
- Talking about Vido?

98
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,282
One of my boy's cousins
He wanted courting in

99
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,374
Nice initiation,
shooting at a cop

100
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,215
They told me they were
gonna rob some slant-eyes

101
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,346
- They check in yet?
- No

102
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,915
When they do, you tell them
to get their asses out of here

103
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm not talking about a long weekend
in Eagle Rock I mean Mexico

104
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,498
I'll take care of the rest.

105
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,590
I'll take care of the rest.

106
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,940
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine

107
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,739
You didn't call
I just saw it on the news

108
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,476
I'm trying to track down
the two guys who escaped

109
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,985
David, you shot someone,
they shot at you

110
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,055
Come home

111
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,456
Whatever's happened

112
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,860
you need to come home now

113
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,330
I'm not finished

114
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,836
How's Matthew doing
with his workshops?

115
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,771
Very well. His aptitude
for cognitive reasoning's accelerated.

116
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,604
Ideas and thoughts are often clearer

117
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,838
- How's he doing with other kids?
- He's internalizing less

118
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,847
So he's making friends

119
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,645
He still keeps mostly to himself

120
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,719
but he's getting more curious.

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,720
These are great

122
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,349
The children's assignment
was to draw a picture of their family.

123
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,656
- Where's Matthew's?
- I took it down

124
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,731
I didn't think you should see it
without an explanation first

125
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,800
What kind of explanation?

126
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,462
Matthew's picture was
ofhis mother, his two sisters...

127
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,904
and his therapist, Owen

128
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,808
It's often common for autistic kids
to become confused

129
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,574
- during changing situations, right?
- Absolutely.

130
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,048
I can get you the drawing,
if you want

131
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,119
- Sure
- Okay.

132
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,562

133
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,563

134
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,297
- Yeah
- My mom wants more money

135
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,305
What?

136
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,934
She did the math
Two percent of a $600,000 sale

137
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,605
- She said that adds up to more than seven grand
- She said that?

138
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,773
- When?
- As soon as you walked out the door.

139
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,716
She waits to get me alone
to pull her shit

140
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,880
Well, maybe you just misunderstood

141
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,958
She asked me
for another three grand

142
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,586
- What did I misunderstand?
- Your mother is blackmailing us

143
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,922
Look, let's just give her
the money, okay?

144
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,505
No

145
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,745
Ronnie, could you close that door?

146
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,086
I know who took our cash
from the storage locker

147
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,023
It was Mara

148
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,626
It was all the midnight runs we were doing
She got suspicious

149
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,102
- She thought that I was hiding
something from her.
- I don't believe this

150
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,105
Look, she found a key.

151
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,767
She tracked down the storage place
from a receipt

152
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,674
She thought that the cash was mine

153
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,313
- I'm sorry. I was careful--
- Does she know about the money train?

154
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,948
No, no She thinks that we've been
skimming off drug busts or something

155
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,959
''We''?
She knows that we're involved?

156
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,463
We need her help
with the marked bills in Indio

157
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,995
Why? Who's in Indio?

158
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,066
- Mara's mother lives there
-Jesus Christ!

159
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,006
-She sent her a few grand,
before I knew she had it.
- So the mom knows too?

160
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,739
- No, but she thinks there's
more where that came from
- This is beautiful.

161
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,476
We're already in deep shit with the marked
money if Aceveda tracks down Diagur's errand boy

162
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,678
- Now we gotta sweat
your future mother-in-law?
- I'm trying to wrap her up

163
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:59,281
I'm trying to wrap her up, but the broad is
a piece of work Mara's got horror stories

164
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,852
How come every piece of ass you hit
is more trouble than the last?

165
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,864
- Hey, I'm marrying this girl
- Well, I'm not, all right?

166
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,493
- So unless she's got a pussy that cures cancer--
- Shut your mouth right now!

167
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,969
Hey, hey.

168
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,700
Look, Mara's having my child

169
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,708
We can trust her

170
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,246
You know what I would do
if I had her in interrogation?

171
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,907
I'd tell her the only way
to save her kid's daddy

172
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,281
is to give up
the three guys he works with

173
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,219
It'd take about 1 5 minutes
to flip her

174
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,787
- We can trust her
- 'Cause you say so?

175
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,262
Mara's not the problem
at the moment

176
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,731
The mom is.

177
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,505
They don't get on to her,
they can't get back to us

178
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,097
- I will keep working on the mom
- No.

179
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,269
We have to erase the trail
without her knowing

180
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,347
And how are we gonna do that?

181
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,148
We gotta think--

182
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,342
We gotta think--

183
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,081
Juan Lozano,
one of the guys I shot at

184
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,089
Pretty quick ID

185
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,127
Yeah, I checked the dead guy's priors,
looked for known accomplices

186
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,696
Follow me
I want you in on this too

187
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,936
Lot of manpower for a robbery

188
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,065
You weren't the one with bullets
flying past your head

189
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,837
Juan Lozano, Byz Lats soldier

190
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,539
Take a look at the map
of their territory

191
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,740
Turn every block over

192
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,253
Anybody catches this guy, I'd like a call,
as a professional courtesy...

193
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,322
so I can bring him in myself

194
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,088
All right, that's it

195
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,559
Vic, uh, what were you
able to find out?

196
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,290
What businesses
are the Byz Lats into?

197
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,492
- They got some juvies running rock
- What else?

198
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,070
Some gambling joints

199
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,867
A body shop that moonlights
in crap shooting, poker

200
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,841
That sounds profitable
Let's take a run at it

201
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,935
- I'll talk to my CIs, and I'll organize a sting
- No

202
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,514
Right now, you and me

203
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,885
Assistant Chief Phillips just called.

204
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,357
He wants you to send copies of all
your cuddler files to the Hollywood Division

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,020
- Why?
- No clue

206
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,393
He's reassigning the case
to the hotshot

207
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,966
- No one said that to me
- Makes sense.

208
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:26,003
We've had five victims in two months,
and I'm down to working scraps

209
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,506
Probably didn't help making an ass
of myself in front of Phillips

210
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,974
I appreciated that

211
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,308
Maybe it does need
a new set of eyes.

212
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,214
This is still our case.
I, for one, could use a win.

213
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,218
So what's the plan?

214
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,220
Oh, not much of one

215
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,418
I checked out guys who got more
than one parking ticket in a hot zone
week prior to an attack

216
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,154
In case he's driving the area,
scoping out women on foot

217
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,595
Yeah, but it's pointless None of'em
are registered sex offenders

218
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,530

219
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,797
Maybe we should go back to
our original list of probables

220
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,997
see what they've been up to
this past month

221
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,574
- How many parking tickets you got?
- Four

222
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,043
Okay Let's start with them
Call them in first Rule it out

223
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,046
All right

224
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,011
Go, go, go! Give me the gun!

225
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,644
Hands in the air right now!

226
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,588
- Your hands right now!

227
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,127
Stay right there, fat boy

228
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,365
Who runs this place?

229
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,163
Call your boss,
get him down here

230
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,210
I never read those damn signs,
but I thought I paid my outstanding tickets

231
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,474
- Am I in trouble?
- This is regarding an unrelated case

232
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:47,041
Actually, we're looking for a white
or Latino male, so you're in the clear.

233
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,646
-Anyone else drive your car?
- No, I have a fleet of five trucks for my crew

234
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,521
- Crew?
- I'm a contractor

235
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,755
Okay Well, thanks
for coming down anyway

236
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,331
Well, what's this about?
Maybe I can help

237
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,401
We've got a man
breaking and entering homes

238
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,027
He hangs around the neighborhood
during the day

239
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,038
spies on his victims first

240
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,268
- That's terrible I'll keep my eyes open
- Thanks

241
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,642
Teenage girl, drops offher baby,
says she'll be back to pick him up.

242
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,647
That was three hours ago

243
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,081
Why'd she leave her baby with you?

244
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,881
She said she ran out of gas and didn't have
no money, begged me to give her a tank

245
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,082
Said she'd go get some cash,
and we'd square it up later

246
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,558
- She say where she was headed?
-Just that it was an emergency

247
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,428
I told her to leave her driver's license
and gave her some gas

248
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,898
So you have her driver's license?

249
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:40,097
She didn't have one Offered to leave
her baby instead as collateral

250
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,005
- Wh--
- You agreed to that?

251
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,567
Boss don't like me
giving out free gas

252
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,080
and who abandons her kid?

253
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,622
- Diagur, right?
- Yeah

254
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,420
I want your boys who shot at me
He's one of them

255
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,320
I don't know where they are

256
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,035
What other operations
does this asshole have?

257
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,470
Something about running rock
out of a panaderia on Virgil?

258
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,134
That's a start

259
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,076
One-niners will appreciate
a new customer base

260
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,775
When business gets bad enough,
call me

261
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,017
Keep him away from a phone
till I get to his rock store

262
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,452
We tried calling you.

263
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,395
There was a mix-up at the phone company
We were temporarily disconnected

264
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,467
We're looking into parking violations
for license plate number

265
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,627
3PCI499

266
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,537
Uh, that's Will's car
My husband

267
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,608
- Is he home?
- No, he's working

268
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,509
- Oh What does he do?
- Can you tell me what this is about?

269
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,414
Oh, it's routine We're checking all the
residents who received tickets in this district

270
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,748
Does your husband work
in the Farmington area?

271
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,086
No, uh, he may make deliveries there
He's a courier for a law firm

272
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,022
Cute kids

273
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,460
They're from my class
I teach third grade

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,390
Does your husband
let anyone else drive his car?

275
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,494
I take the bus I'd end up driving
on the wrong side of the street

276
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,410
- That's 0 for 4
- We should talk to the husband

277
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,979
- He doesn't fit the profile
- He's a courier

278
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,049
Parking tickets place him in the hot zone
prior to two of the rapes

279
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,744
He works for a law firm
She teaches

280
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,752
They're not lower class enough

281
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,084
Only the lower classes rape and kill?

282
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,318
Our guy's uneducated If he has a wife,
which I doubt, she isn't so--

283
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,055
British. Pretty.

284
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,291
I was gonna say independent

285
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,596
- This is all screwed up
- Are they on the way to TJ or not?

286
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,138
I found Vido He's holed up
at Dr Ausanta's house, getting sewed up

287
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,207
- Shoulder's a mess
- We'll be gentle

288
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,209
- Where's Juan?
- Still no answer, man

289
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,779
You better figure it out,
and do it quick.

290
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,348
My vatos are spinning
They think I'm losing control

291
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,918
When I track down Juan, they want me
to give him up to your boss

292
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,146
If you do that,
you lose everything

293
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,121
The captain is taking everything
right now!

294
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,193

295
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,489
- How much does Juan know
about your operations?
- He's way inside.

296
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,969
You don't think he'll give up
you and your buddies for early parole?

297
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,335
He's gonna bring
the whole goddamn gang down

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,135
Shit, man

299
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,642
Makes you think

300
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,872
Is he really a problem worth having?

301
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,583
If not, you get rid of him

302
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
-Juan's my dog, man
- You're the big dog now

303
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,119
It's time your balls dropped

304
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,356

305
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,365
Police! Don't move!

306
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,100

307
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,468
Hey, this one's pretty serious

308
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,201
- He's gotta get to an E.R. immediately.
- Please.

309
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,436
Get him to Mission Cross

310
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,571
- Nice setup.

311
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,774
A.M.A. know you're operating here?

312
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,785
Look, my son has a problem,
a drug problem

313
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,788
His dealers asked me to help them.

314
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,552
I do a favor like this,
they won't sell him drugs

315
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,787
So aiding and abetting a fugitive's
gonna get him clean?

316
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,798
- He's my son.
- There's another man we're looking for

317
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,198
He came in alone

318
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,669
- Get him to the Barn
- Come on Let's go

319
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,937
- I thought you said they were both here
- That's what I was told

320
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,172
At least we know you scared Diagur
into cooperating

321
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,711

322
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,617
What's up?

323
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,690
Here's Treasury's new prime suspect

324
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,453
Neil O'Brien. Who's he?

325
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,029
A violent multiple offender
who's not gang-related

326
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,258
Six years, armed robbery
Assault with a deadly weapon, two and a half

327
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:06,133
- He's on Treasury's radar?
- As soon as he puts some of our
marked money into the system

328
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,706
So we plant money on an innocent?

329
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,275
If you can say that
with a straight face

330
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,674
The guy's been ass deep in it
since junior high

331
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,748
Best part about it is
he's got two brothers in Indio.

332
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,339
The feds are gonna be
falling all over him

333
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,817
And off Mara's Mommie Dearest

334
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,289
- Your prisoner's all patched up
You can take him now
- Thanks, Corrine

335
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,893
Listen, about Matthew's picture

336
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:34,796
We're both his parents We both need
to be involved in these decisions

337
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,368
I think that the job that Owen's done
with him is amazing

338
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,438
Matthew seems to be
coming out of his shell

339
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:45,374
But you're his father, and if you're not

another therapist for him

00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,382
Good That's what I want

343
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,048
Social Services is sending someone
to pick him up

344
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,151
- You want me to hold him?
- No, no I'm fine

345
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,823
- Maybe we should get him some formula.
- Hey!

346
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,628

347
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,932

00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,982
- Where's Juan?
- I barely know the guy

352
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,452
You know him well enough
to take a bullet with his name on it

353
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,922
I was just in on the ride.
Lats say go, I go.

354
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,017
Now Simon says you're being a moron

355
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,792
You showed up at the doctor's alone Your
Byz Lat big brother at least give you cab fare?

356
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,526
- He ditched me
- Where?

357
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,967
Stop asking I just met him last night
He came by Elisa's--

358
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,266
- Who's Elisa?
- No one!

359
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,273
His cooch? Huh?

360
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,775
- I'm done talking

361
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,808
- Track down the drug dealers
who arm-twisted the doctor
- What for?

362
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,680
Because they're drug dealers and they
extorted him for medical services

363
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,254
That can wait How 'bout I find out
who this Elisa is instead?

364
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,984
No, I got it
You get the other thing

365
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,992
Hey, what's going on?

366
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,894
Call Diagur Tell him we're looking
for some chick named Elisa

367
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,364
Elisa

368
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,264
Elisa Ortiz

369
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,935
- We're looking forJuan Lozano
- So am I, half the time

370
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,944
Do you mind if we look for him inside?

371
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,071
Put back any shit you move

372
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,316
- No, no You stay outside
-Juan ain't here!

373
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,115
Clear!

374
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,589
- I told your stupid ass
- Your boyfriend's a fugitive,
armed and dangerous

375
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,526
- Clear.
- I have a few questions. 

376
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,427
Legal firm Will Faulks works for--

377
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,591
Ponte and Cruz Immigration

378
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,329
- ''You want to stay, we'll find a way''
- Excuse me?

379
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,530
They're not even lawyers

380
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,301
For 50 bucks, they'll fill out
your visa application

381
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,505
They've got Will and 1 0 other guys
plastering cars and doors with flyers

382
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,877
He's a flyer guy
The wife said he was a courier

383
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,782
Records show he also works
for a 2 4-hour video store

384
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,786
Great excuse for the wife...

385
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,689
on the occasional nights you feel like
hiding naked in a woman's closet

386
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,523
Still, he's got no record
of sexual assault

387
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,529
He's never even been charged

388
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,089
- I can't see our guy not having a history
- Maybe he's got one

389
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,863
We just don't know about it

390
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,632
- Detective.
- Mr Freeman

391
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,180
Uh,James, please
I did some thinking about your case

392
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:40,183
I'm in that area all the time,
and I remembered seeing a guy

393
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,810
A suspicious guy
He was hanging around the buildings

394
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,413
At first I thought he was a gardener,
but he wasn't dressed like one

395
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,359
Well, we already have a viable suspect,
but we appreciate your lead

396
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:55,161
Okay Sure
Just thought I should report in to you

397
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,830
Uh, leave the details with
the desk sergeant We'll look into it

398
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,937
We have another viable suspect?
That was cold

399
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,411
He could have phoned that in
He likes you

400
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,108
- You're just figuring that out, Detective?
- So?

401
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,117
I'm working

402
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,018
I don't know whereJuan is

403
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,084
- Tell me everything you know about him
- So you can send him up?

404
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,188
- Forget you

405
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,267

406
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,703

407
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,170

408
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,109
There ain't no cop house up here

409
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,113
Let me out!

410
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,742
Take these cuffs off me.
I need to talk to my lawyer.

411
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,753
You'll get a lawyer as soon
as we get back to the station

412
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,982

413
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,761
Hey I hear you went on
some run with Aceveda?

414
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,762
- Yeah
- Where were you?

415
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,799
He picked up the suspect's girlfriend
They back yet?

416
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,734
- No Uh, how long ago was this?
- Half an hour

417
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,603
No sign of Aceveda He's somewhere
talking toJuan's girlfriend

418
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,768
He could be getting close to Diagur and us,
and we got nothing

419
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,778
One problem at a time

420
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,508
You sure you got the rest
of the marked money from our stash?

421
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,550
- Almost 30 grand
- All right

422
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,552
You two drop the money where
you're sure our Irish patsy'll find it

423
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,145
- No problem
- Try not to be too obvious

424
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,225
- Shit

425
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:33,328
- Yeah?
- Woman just called in a shooting

426
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:37,390
Dead guy fits the description of
Aceveda's robbery suspect,Juan Lozano.

427
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,062
Thanks

428
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,833
Well, looks like
Diagur's balls just dropped

429
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,856
What are you doing?

430
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,926
What's going on?

431
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,831

432
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,902

433
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,634
Help me!

434
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,372

435
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,448
Let me go.

436
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:31,219
Tell me everything you know
aboutJuan Lozano

437
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,757
starting with where I find him

438
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,928
That's notJuan.

439
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,365
Byz Lats ink.

440
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,937
Hey, dumbass

441
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,667
Right gang, wrong dead Mexican.
This isn'tJuan Lozano.

442
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:55,144
Neighbor saw the whole thing He said Lozano
was the shooter after this guy pulled first

443
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,146
Aceveda been notified?

444
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,842
We've been trying to get ahold of him
He's not answering his cell

445
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,181

446
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,519
Mrs Faulks, you have time
to answer a few more questions?

447
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,322
- About parking tickets?
- Is your husband home?

448
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,919
No, he's still at work
What is this?

449
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,489
The truth is, someone made
an anonymous call

450
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,230
stating that your husband's car
was involved in a string of robberies

451
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,034
That's ridiculous Please

452
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,508
Chances are, Will cut someone off in traffic;
they're trying to make his life miserable

453
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,512
Easiest thing is just to let us
take a quick look around

454
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:33,209
We don't find 50 VCRs stashed
in the closet, end of story

455
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:42,258
Uh, we would need you to sign
this consent to search form

456
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,887
Oh, my God!

457
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,091
- Is he okay?
- He was left at a gas station

458
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,536
He was with my babysitter, Taniesha

459
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,832
When I got home,
they were both gone

460
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,930
Is Taniesha black, around 1 6?

461
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,272
Yes Is she okay?

462
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,107
A girl fitting that description
left your baby at a gas station.

463
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,113
What?

464
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,113

465
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,224
Come this way
I need you to fill out some paperwork

466
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,758
I'm getting a stomachache already

467
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,424
- Is that our guy?
- I don't think so.

468
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,434
- No, no, no It's him
- Man, I thought he'd never come out of there.

469
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,706
- Come on You see it
- Pick it up

470
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,003
Pick it up, you Irish prick

471
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,944
That's it That-a-boy

472
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,915

473
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:46,055
Congratulations You just got yourself
a spot on Treasury's Most Wanted.

474
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,586
Arroyo, he was mi mejor amigo.

475
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,461
I don't listen to you, he's not dead

476
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,366
Then you should have sent more than one
vato, made sure you got the job done right

477
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,769
That captain? I'm giving him a call
I'm giving Juan up

478
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,341
- You know whereJuan is?
- Yeah, he's holed up

479
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,410
- He's freaking He needs supplies
- Good

480
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,775
This time send a small army

481
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,576
You know what? You do it yourself

482
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,652
Otherwise,
I'm gonna give the big man a call

483
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,321
That's not necessary
You tell me where he is

484
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,034
Sancho?

485
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,607
No

486
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,212
On your knees

487
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,081
On your knees!

488
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,717
- Police!

489
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,017
- Clear!
- Check the back room.

490
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,560
Yeah, we're clear in here.

491
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,334
Found him, huh?

492
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,597
Yeah

493
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,605
Cuff him

494
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,804
Put your hands above your head

495
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,981
In back

496
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,028
Will's a writer. He still uses that.

497
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,427
- What does he write?
- He's trying a novel

498
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,591
He's written a couple of short stories

499
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,635
- Has he been published?
- No.

500
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,398
It's hard to get published

501
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,921
You collect figurines

502
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,423
My husband gives me knickknacks
Ever since we started dating

503
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,222
They're sweet, really.
I just don't know where to put them.

504
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,488
He turned it off

505
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,717
He's gonna scare him
into giving up Diagur

506
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,794
who'll tell him that we knew about the marked
money, told him to send someone to pick it up

507
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,988
Diagur's not who he's after.

508
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:17,796
- If it was, he'd be in the cage by now
- Then what?

509
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,305
Sit down.

510
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,509
I said, sit down

511
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,078
You followed me to that stickup?

512
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,777
How long you been following me for?

513
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:39,118
How many chances you have to pull
the trigger on me and never could, huh?

514
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,420
What's that say about you, lawman?

515
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,552
Shut up and sit down

516
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,062
Why don't you suck my dick?

517
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,934
Again

518
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,767
A different room,
but you the same bitch

519
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,577
We'll have surveillance on the house
until we get the warrant

520
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,980
just in case the wife tips him off

521
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,986
Did you talk to the rape victims?
Any of the figurines match?

522
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,990
There's a little boy fishing, ballerina,
girl holding a four-leaf clover

523
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,584
- He's going to need the luck
Unis are ready Let's go
- I'll grab my stuff

524
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,163
Thanks for inviting me
to ride with you

525
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,700
- I haven't made many arrests of this caliber
- No problem

526
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,770
- How old are you, by the way?
- Thirty-three

527
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,840
I was 3 5 before I got a table
in the Detective Squad

528
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,808
- You must have aced the exam.
- I did okay

529
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,777
What'd you get?

530
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,940
Come on

531
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,712
- Uh, 97
- Wow

532
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,788
Yeah Let me go hit the head
We could be out there a while

533
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,857
Uh, right there

534
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,490
- I got a 98
- Oh! Let's get moving

535
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,657
No, I did

536
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,162
I talked to some of my guys

537
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,137
got a good description
of the man I told you about

538
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,470
and the building addresses

539
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,567
Thanks I really can't talk to you right now
We just got our guy, so--

540
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,646
Oh Well, that's great

541
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,614
Well--

542
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,880
So if you'd like to skip
to the part where you ask me out

543
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,614
hurry

544
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,816
You don't like a man
to play hard to get, huh?

545
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,088
- Uh, can I use your pencil?
- Yeah

546
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,158
You're running for mayor
or something, right?

547
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,600
How people gonna feel when they see you
blowing my big jail-cell cock, huh?

548
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,601
I got a Kodak moment, remember?

549
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,938
You remember

550
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,820
You mean on this?

551
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,758
I deleted the photo.

552
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,128
So I put it on disk, man

553
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,133
I'll tell you what

554
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,504
You get me out of this trouble

555
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,574
I'll make sure no one ever sees it

556
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,872
You put it on a disk? How?

557
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,912
Huh?

558
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,982
How did you do it?
Take me through the steps

559
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,950
You're too stupid
to change a lightbulb...

560
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,081
let alone figure out
how to download.

561
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,922
You didn't show the pictures,
and you didn't tell anyone

562
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,225
- Oh, yeah?
- 'Cause bragging about what you did...

563
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,766
to a cop--

564
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,895
Even you're smart enough to know my force
would've ripped apart the Lats to get to you

565
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,974
No way you'd want your boss
knowing you're the reason...

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,942
business was getting shut down.

567
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,012
No

568
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,514
This was your little secret

569
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:58,078
So I'll just tell everybody now
I ain't got nothing to lose

570
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,419
Right

571
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,755
You talk now

572
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,829
it's a desperate attempt
to avoid the gas chamber

573
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,194
Or did you forget?

574
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,393
I killed the only witness you had

575
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,603
I spent the last few weeks
getting to know who you are,Juan

576
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,838
Do you know your girlfriend Elisa's
been banging someone else?

577
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,613
- Yeah, right Uh-huh
- Someone you know Horatio

578
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,689
When you go play cards
with your boys twice a week

579
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,054
- She likes it too
- Yeah.

580
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,289
Think I care what that bitch does?
Nah

581
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,865
I know you've got
a grandmother who's sick

582
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,934
Only got a couple of years left

583
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:49,098
She spends every day worried
that Immigration's gonna send her
back to Mexico to die

584
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,176
Maybe I should send a few border boys
to knock on her door, hmm?

585
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,176
No

586
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,803
I know your mom's late
on her mortgage payments...

587
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,883
and she's involved with some pyramid scheme
to make money to save the house

588
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,817
I barely even talk to that drunk.

589
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,686
I know you're working
stolen credit cards for your gang

590
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,316
and you're skimming profits
off the top

591
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,295
even though Elisa keeps telling you
it's gonna get you killed.

592
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,195
I know about the headaches you get

593
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,861
I know about the uncle
who molested you when you were 1 2

594
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,472
I know about your cousin who's trying
to get a scholarship to UC Irvine.

595
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,034
I know which magazines you jerk off to
that you think Elisa doesn't know about

596
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,137
I know about your brother in Fresno

597
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,309
I know the inmate who tried to
shank you twice at Terminal Island...

598
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,352
is Koren Hennessy Denton.

599
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:41,153
And I know the number to call
to clear up a bunk in his cell just for you

600
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,461
So you sucked on my dick

601
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,659
and then when you had the gun on me,
you couldn't pull the trigger, huh?

602
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,437
You think I couldn't find
the courage to kill you?

603
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,997
I spent the last three weeks...

604
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,568
finding the courage
not to kill you

605
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,307
Don't think for a second
it means I don't believe in revenge

606
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,852
You tell just one person some wild story
about some incident that never happened

607
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,589
you, the people you love

608
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,155
will find out about a dozen
different kinds of revenge

609
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,964
You will learn
the things I know,Juan

610
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,041
the things I can do

611
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,545
It's back

612
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,628
Where's my gun?

613
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,424
Find Rodriguez or Wagenbach

614
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,001
He's ready to give his confession

615
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,069
Man, all I did
was take the girl to dinner

616
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,146
- Where's the kidnapping in that?
- He didn't do nothing I did

617
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,706
- What happened?
- I was babysitting when Anquoin
called and asked me out

618
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,286
I needed someone
to look after the baby

619
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:20,221
I was gonna pick him up after,
'cept there was an accident on the freeway

620
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:25,023
You dumped a baby with a gas station
attendant to go out on a date?

621
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,565
- I'm gonna kick him
- You see Anquoin?

622
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,659
Sometimes you only get one shot
with a boy like that

623
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,316
Mrs Faulks, we have a warrant

624
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,317
- What?
- Freeze, right there!

625
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,944
- William Faulks? You're under arrest
- What are you doing?

626
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,023
You saw he didn't steal anything

627
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,116
For the rapes of Diana Peabo,
Isabel Nelson and Layla Gist

628
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,196
- Rapes?
- For the rape-murders of Dory Smythe

629
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,026
Debbie Reese
and her daughter Crystal

630
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,033
- Will!
- Mrs Faulks, step back!

631
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,763
- Why are you doing this?
- Will gave you figurines as gifts

632
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,568
- They were keepsakes stolen from his victims
- That is a sick lie!

633
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,802
You're arresting him because of those?
That's not what you said you were looking for!

634
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,845
I did not give you permission for that!

635
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,244
- You gave us permission to search the house
- No!

636
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,817
- We didn't specify what we were searching for
- No!

637
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,718
You said there were crank calls,
robberies! You lied to me!

638
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,620
Joanna, stop it

639
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,784
Calm down

640
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,261
- Will!
- Take him.

641
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,333
Get the crime scene geeks in here!

642
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,494
I don't want anybody to touch anything
until they've been over every inch.

643
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:44,008
...most of the time.

644
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,602
...most of the time.

645
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,613
- What took you so long?
- Ma had to see where you worked.

646
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,615
Vic take good care of you?

647
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,312
- Nothing's sexier than being
around three men with guns
- I gave her the tour

648
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,616
We werejust leaving.

649
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,691
Bye, Vic

650
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,689
She-- She got a message
on her answering machine in Indio

651
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,858
From who?

652
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,698
From a guy from the US Treasury

653
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,704
He wants to meet with her

654
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,831
Okay

655
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,410
We'll talk about it later

656
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,479
Okay

657
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,390
- The mom is poison
- She got a message from a guy with Treasury

658
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,519
He wants to meet her

659
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,995
Tell Stella to wait a week
before calling back

660
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,069
Hopefully, by then Irish will have
spent some of his newfound cash

661
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,331
and he'll be Treasury's
new prime suspect.

662
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,430
Okay

663
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,509
In the meantime

664
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,738
we've moved our stash
to another location

665
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,815
Where?

666
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,215
Mara found out once before

667
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,585
We think it'd be safer
if you-- if you don't know

668
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,455
- Hi
- Hi

669
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,932
- How was work?
- Good

670
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,672
- We're gonna have a child
- What?

671
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:27,005
God spoke to me today through a baby

672
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,579
We're gonna have our own child

673
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,981

674
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,054
Baby? Baby Baby

675
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,725
Julien

676
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,851
Baby?

677
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,829
Jesus!Julien!

678
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,958

679
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:10,044
- Nice work on the extortion case
- Thanks The same

680
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,714
Must feel pretty good

681
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,883
Getting the guys who shot at you

682
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,927
Yeah

683
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:23,193
I hear the Korean community's
calling you ''the sheriff'' Big hero

684
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,670
What's been going on?
What happened yesterday?

685
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,048
I wrapped things up

686
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,947
David I--

687
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,353
- There he is. Captain, over here.

688
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,363
Captain Aceveda?

689
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,798
Captain, the shooting of one of the suspects,
the minor? What's his condition?

690
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,801
Thank you all for coming

691
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,803
- Captain?
- Yes, Carlos?

692
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,465
It took a lot of guts to take on
three armed men, come under fire

693
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,600
then get right back into the field.

694
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm inspired, on a daily basis,
by the bravery exhibited

695
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,844
by the men and women
who work under my command

696
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,816
I just try to live up
to their standards

697
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,546
Was this robbery one
of a number of increasing...

698
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,385
gang-related crimes
in the Korean community?

699
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,358
On the contrary, there has been
a substantial reduction of gun violence

700
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,587
as you'll see in our quarterly report

701
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,426
Is it true you have a meeting
next week with the Korean Chamber--
