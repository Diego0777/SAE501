1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,466
<i>Detective Mackey.</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,741
<i>Hey, weren't you supposed
to meet me here to suck my dick?</i>

3
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:12,337
<i>I hope you all made it.
I wanted to speak to you one last time.</i>

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,010
<i>You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.</i>

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,449
<i>I've already taken care of my brother.</i>

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,215
<i>And now... you've
been greenlit.</i>

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,390
Department of Corrections
just sent this over.

8
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,894
<i>When were you planning on telling me
about Armadillo's death threat?</i>

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,331
<i>Relax. Cops get
greenlit all the time.</i>

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,992
<i>It's just talk.
Nothing ever happens.</i>

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,301
Armadillo had his own brother killed. If there's
one guy who'd be the exception, it's him.

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,242
Look at the bright side. This tape serves up
Armadillo for accessory to murder...

13
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,744
and conspiracy to kill
a police officer.

14
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,246
- All we gotta do is find him.
- Before he finds you.

15
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,520
Not a problem.

16
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,853
<i>About the minority
on the Strike Team, Vic.</i>

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,155
I've got a candidate
I want you to meet.

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,657
Sure. Send him by anytime.

19
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:06,264
<i>Vic... make sure you
and your guys watch your backs.</i>

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,464
Yeah.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,969
<i>- Why does Aceveda want
to bring on another guy?
- It's a quota thing.</i>

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,802
We need color on the team,
so the brass can feel better...

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,841
about underpaying
their Mexican gardeners.

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,082
Taking on a new guy...
This means one of us gets booted?

25
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:25,449
No. It means we go from four to five.
Have a seat.

26
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,720
<i>I, uh...</i>

27
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,190
I'm sorry about this
Armadillo heat.

28
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,319
It's my shit.
It should be on me.

29
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,025
I never meant to get
you guys on a hit list.

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,528
<i>Hey, we're a team, right?</i>

31
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,762
- Yeah, right.
- Right.

32
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:49,068
<i>So, um, Armadillo's saying
you're greenlit.</i>

33
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,438
Is that like you in a plural sense
or you in a singular sense?

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:00,519
No. It's just... I was on the porch the whole
time. I mean, he didn't really see me.

35
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,954
Don't worry about it.
We'll find him before he gets to any of us.

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,317
<i>What about this new team member?</i>

37
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,056
Someone who doesn't understand
how we do things...

38
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,162
could throw a wrench
into how we do things.

39
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,598
I'm not bringing anyone on
unless they understand.

40
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:22,141
How are the wedding plans
coming along?

41
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,105
Good.

42
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,203
Look, I'm not gonna say
anything to Vanessa...

43
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,478
you know, about things.

44
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,878
It's not my place.

45
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,816
Thank you.

46
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,822
It's just that if she hears from somebody else
though, you know, or if you slip...

47
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,651
she's gonna be hurt
really bad.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,059
I'm not going to slip.

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,727
That's us.
Washburn Terrace.

50
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,907
- What's the call?
- 911 hang-up.

51
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:58,241
Some three year old probably
just learned how to use the speed dial.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,980
<i>What's up?</i>

53
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,584
I need you to put guys
on my wife and kids 24/7.

54
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,017
You think
she's seeing someone?

55
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,924
It's not about that.

56
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,360
But if she is seeing someone,
you want to know about it, right?

57
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:19,194
Look, I've been putting a dent
in this Mexican banger's drug trade.

58
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,827
He made a threat. I gotta make sure
he stays away from my wife and kids.

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,767
- I'll put my best guys on it.
- And one more thing.

60
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,339
Corrine can't know you're watching.
You're invisible. You got it?

61
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,306
Got it.

62
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,945
<i>Julien.</i>

63
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,922
<i>One-Tango-13 requesting backup.
We have a forced entry.</i>

64
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,688
<i>Roger that, One-Tango-13.</i>

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,338
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,680
<i>One-Tango-13. We have a 187.
Requesting additional backup and an R.A.</i>

67
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,757
<i>Roger, One- Tango-13.
Sending additional units and an R.A.</i>

68
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,832
God.

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,432
<i>It's a battered woman's shelter.
Go to the other side.</i>

70
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,110
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Come to me.

71
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,622
It's okay.

72
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,742
<i>- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.</i>

73
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:19,200
<i>- Stop it!
- Let me see it.</i>

74
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,047
<i>- No, I like that open.
- Stop it!</i>

75
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,814
Cassidy. You still
locking up at night?

76
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,248
<i>- Of course.
- Cassidy, stop!</i>

77
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,985
- Okay!
- I'm putting a new alarm system in the house.

78
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,594
<i>- Why now?
- 'Cause with me not here...</i>

79
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,756
it's the only way you and the kids
are gonna feel safe.

80
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,739
Yeah. Where is it?

81
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,740
Private shelter
for battered women.

82
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,302
They decide to leave their abuser.
They call a 1-800 number.

83
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,447
Get picked up, brought here.
Location's never given out.

84
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,187
Looks like
the wrong person found it.

85
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,781
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only six suspects.

86
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,791
- A boyfriend or a husband.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,291
No I.D.'s anywhere
in the house.

88
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,195
These places usually issue aliases,
collect the women's wallets.

89
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,393
- Looks like he found them.
- He spent time in the house after.

90
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,398
<i>Cut the power.
Snatched the closed-circuit videotape.</i>

91
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,041
This is more premeditated
than blackout rage.

92
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,461
<i>Any of the kids talk?</i>

93
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,066
The child psychologist will
let us know when they're ready.

94
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,100
<i>Ma'am, you can't go in there.</i>

95
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,499
- I'm Emma Prince, director of this shelter.
- Step back!

96
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,702
- Can I help?
- I live here. I run this shelter.

97
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,774
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

98
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,436
- I have to get inside.
- It's pretty bad.

99
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,915
I left for a few hours to pick
up some clothing donations.

100
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,489
They're all dead?

101
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,955
- What about the children?
- They're okay.

102
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,292
We're gonna need some help
identifying the women.

103
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,099
We couldn't find their I.D.'s.

104
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,259
I only know their aliases.

105
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,200
Who would know
their real names?

106
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,569
Ms. Henry. She keeps
all that info in her computer.

107
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,170
- Where is she?
- She was in there when I left.

108
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,041
<i>We're gonna need
that information.</i>

109
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,878
Her computer
is password protected.

110
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,680
- Who else would know it?
- Our assistant, Julie.

111
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,754
She was... also...

112
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,289
All seven of them?

113
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,464
<i>- We only found six bodies.
- Six?</i>

114
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,833
There should be seven.

115
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,170
We take a picture when they
arrive to document the abuse.

116
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,373
- And she arrived?
- Today. A prostitute.
Said her pimp had beaten her.

117
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:13,212
We usually don't take them in,
but she said if she went back on the street,
he'd kill her.

118
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,977
You were right
to help her, then.

119
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,418
I got two more women
coming in tomorrow.

120
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,157
I can't send them back to their abusers.
Where am I supposed to take them?

121
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,458
Maybe the city
has room for them.

122
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,728
If the city had room, I wouldn't have
had to start my own shelter.

123
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,440
Hold on.

124
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,099
Yeah, that's her.

125
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,475
Hey, Walt. This is our missing woman.
Get her face and name out to everyone.

126
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,115
<i>You got it.</i>

127
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,752
It's password protected.

128
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,415
I-I know. That's why I called you.
You're the computer guy, right?

129
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,350
Yeah, Police Information
Systems. P.I.S.

130
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,251
- "Piss?"
- We don't call it that.

131
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,061
<i>I don't have any suspects until I get the real
names. Can you get 'em out?</i>

132
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm not cleared to work on
non-departmental computers.

133
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,329
It's an emergency.

134
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,101
<i>Oh.</i>

135
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,644
<i>- Danny.
- Yes?</i>

136
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:22,650
Yassirah Al-Thani just filed
another complaint against you.

137
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,222
She claims you made a threatening
phone call to her.

138
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,690
I didn't threaten her.

139
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,864
So you did
call her then? Why?

140
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,697
I just told her I knew what she was doing,
and I told her to stop.

141
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,035
Just please tell me you did not call her
from your house.

142
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,332
There will be a record of it then.
What were you thinking?

143
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,002
That bitch destroyed my car.
She called here saying that my mom died.

144
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,511
- We can't prove any of that.
- Oh, please! Jesus!

145
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,947
She is trying
to ruin my life!

146
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,881
We just ducked a major lawsuit...

147
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,921
and you have just given her
a valid claim for harassment.

148
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,555
You're gonna make
a formal apology.

149
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,794
How's it coming?

150
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,795
It's complicated.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,025
What's going on?

152
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,967
Our "PIS" guy's
incontinent.

153
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,969
Mind if I take a look?

154
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,971
No.

155
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:21,412
Emma I.D.'d our missing woman.
Dorea Pinchuk. Five priors for solicitation.

156
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,239
- She's either a witness or a victim.
- Or an accomplice.

157
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,385
Emma says her pimp
was beating her.

158
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,478
That's our guy.
We'll find out who he is.

159
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,289
<i>No, I'll find him. If this guy's behind the
shelter slaughter, he won't go down easy.</i>

160
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,326
<i>Thanks. We'll run down other leads.</i>

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,964
<i>How are you doing
with I.D. 'ing the victims?</i>

162
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,998
- Your boy know what he's doing?
- Better than this PIS-poor pud.

163
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,432
Her name is Dorea Pinchuk.
She's a pro.

164
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,308
We think she was kidnapped from the shelter
this morning. Might still be alive.

165
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:52,402
Don't recognize her.
Who decorated her face?

166
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,871
Her pimp. I want him.
You find out who he is. Ask around.

167
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,644
<i>- See if anyone's spotted her.
- Okay.</i>

168
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,478
<i>Vic, um...</i>

169
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,418
this is, uh... kind of
a big thing, isn't it?

170
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,616
<i>High profile.
A lot of press.</i>

171
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,492
<i>- A lot of work.
- Help me find her.</i>

172
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,997
I'll make sure that it counts
as two of your C.I. tips.

173
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:20,436
Yeah. I was thinking...
more like a bonus.

174
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,043
I'm, uh, trying to get
a decent place to live.

175
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,942
Maybe show I can
take care of Brian.

176
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,551
Find the pimp.
I'll see about your bonus.

177
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,256
She didn't firewall
her backdoor.

178
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,850
<i>- Most people don't.
- I can route around her password...</i>

179
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,657
by changing the operations
post back to default.

180
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,195
I-- I tried that.

181
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,664
There. What do you wanna know?

182
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,829
Fantastic! I need the real names
of those women and kids.

183
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,443
<i>Along with a formal apology
from this department...</i>

184
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:00,537
Officer Sofer would like
to address your client personally.

185
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,186
<i>Mrs. Al-Thani,
I apologize...</i>

186
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,986
for the phone call in which
I accused you of harassment.

187
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,893
I had no proof
to support such a claim...

188
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,624
and I am very sorry
if it caused you any undue stress.

189
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,067
That's all good and well.
But we are still filing...

190
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:25,059
a temporary restraining order
against Officer Sofer.

191
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,368
- On what grounds?
- For what?

192
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,167
Mrs. Al-Thani
fears for her safety.

193
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,971
<i>You didn't shoot
and kill my husband?</i>

194
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,674
<i>You'll be receiving our
paperwork by the end of the day.</i>

195
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,596
Stay put!

196
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,898
- What's this about?
- It's about her! Do you know where she is?

197
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,099
Dorea? I wish I knew.

198
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:08,110
Get up here! You think
I'm screwing around, man?

199
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man! I haven't
seen that bitch in a week, okay!

200
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,976
- Who did that to her face?
- Her pimp! Oh, yeah, that's right. That's you.

201
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,647
Man, I never put my hand
on any of my employees!

202
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,625
That's some old school bullshit.
They can't go down if their lips are busted up.

203
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,278
You call me
if you hear from Dorea...

204
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,847
and I don't haul
the rest of your stable in.

205
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,418
They can't go down
if they're locked up.

206
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,185
No, they can't.

207
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,561
Our pimp's a dead end.
You guys got anything?

208
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,927
According to shelter records, three of our
victims checked in with a total of five children.

209
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,729
<i>- Hold on. We only found four.
- I know. We're a kid short.</i>

210
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,439
- There's a seven-year-old boy missing.
- The missing hooker's son?

211
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,068
No. His dad's the one guy we haven't been able
to locate. His mom's one of our bodies.

212
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,072
- Looks like we got a suspect.
- If it is him, he left his
two-year-old daughter behind.

213
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,408
A two year old's
harder to travel with.

214
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,040
Maybe he just
doesn't like women.

215
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,720
I'll call back.

216
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,595
Who's our father of the year,
and why would he take a hooker with him?

217
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,620
Name's Mike Holden.
He's a firefighter.

218
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,594
He's got a thing for hookers.
Three priors for solicitation.

219
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,903
Any connection to Dorea?

220
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,237
She lied. The pimp never beat her.
He hasn't seen her in a week.

221
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,542
How much do you wanna bet we find her
sliding down our fireman's pole?

222
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,381
All right. Okay.
Settle down.

223
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,317
Brass finally get wise?

224
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,592
The new chief wants every captain in blues
and on the street once a month.

225
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,731
A sort of keeping-it-real thing.

226
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,730
Yeah. Keeping it real funny.

227
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,795
I'd let you try out for the Strike Team,
but, you know, very competitive.

228
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,834
- Ready?
- Sure.

229
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,809
Let's roll.

230
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,883
<i>It was black and yellow.
Brand-new, with a black seat.</i>

231
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,681
- A Street jammer.
- One of those new sleek things
with the 18 speeds.

232
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,881
Eighteen speeds.
Got it.

233
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,392
<i>- Where was it stolen from?
- Our yard.</i>

234
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,623
<i>- Was it locked?
- Yes, but I told him not to leave it out.</i>

235
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,632
$300, and I just bought it
two days ago.

236
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,634
We'll try to get it back.

237
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,634
Emma, hi.

238
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,110
These are the two women
I mentioned.

239
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,578
- Hello.
- I couldn't believe your message.

240
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,082
You really have a place
I can use temporarily?

241
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,983
The city has a few apartments, houses
they use to stash witnesses during trials.

242
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,656
I fudged the paperwork, got it
signed out for a few days.

243
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,557
This isn't gonna get you
into trouble, is it?

244
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,322
It's as white
as a lie gets.

245
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,864
- I just hope it helps.
- You don't know how much.

246
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:21,269
Here's the address, the keys.
Call me if you need anything.

247
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,101
- Thank you.
- Sure.

248
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,538
Emma...

249
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:29,340
- you're doing a good thing for these women.
- Well...

250
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,608
someone did it for me once.

251
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,323
You get my wedding
invitation?

252
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,691
Yeah. Moving pretty fast.

253
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,493
Yeah. Vanessa and I
are excited.

254
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,900
<i>- How long you been married?
- Eight years this June.</i>

255
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,968
Anything I should know
going in?

256
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,699
Secrets.

257
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,979
<i>Don't have any.
Tell her everything.</i>

258
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,540
<i>Because the one thing you think
she can't possibly know about...</i>

259
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,076
that's the one thing that
will come back to haunt you.

260
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,122
Good to know.

261
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,317
<i>Hey, that stolen bike...black
and yellow Street jammer, right?</i>

262
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,590
Yeah.

263
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,602
- Is that your bike?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,209
It's kind of small
for you, isn't it?

265
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,314
It rides, don't it?

266
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,511
We got a report of a stolen bike.
Brand-new. It looks just like this one.

267
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,320
- I didn't steal it!
- You may be young, but I will arrest you.
Give me the bike.

268
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,549
- But I-I...
- Do you want me to take you in, book you?

269
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,693
- No.
- Run home.

270
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,493
Go on.

271
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,097
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

272
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,844
Two hours on the street.
Already cracked a case.

273
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:14,183
Well, you know...
once you got it, you never lose it.

274
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,947
Have pimp daddy
get these to his girls.

275
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,823
Five grand? That's like
a hundred hand job reward.

276
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,358
Vic, that guy was the pimp you were looking
for, right? That was good, right?

277
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,227
Yeah, that was good. I'm
working on that bonus for you.

278
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,834
In the meantime,
I got something else.

279
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,063
We think
this is our shooter.

280
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
Judging from his rap sheet,
he's a regular john.

281
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,008
- Hand 'em out to the girls,
see if anybody knows him.
- Five thousand dollars?

282
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,946
- That how much my bonus is going to be?
- No.

283
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,280
That goes to whoever gives us
direct information that leads
to the arrest of the guy...

284
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,850
or the safe return
of the kid.

285
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,652
- Just get 'em out on the street.
- Yeah, okay.

286
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,064
<i>Want to tell me
why I'm here?</i>

287
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,396
- You know Mike Holden?
- Yeah. He's a friend.

288
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,693
<i>You're more than just friends. Weren't you
best man at each other's weddings?</i>

289
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,100
<i>- Yeah.
- Bailed him out of trouble a few times?</i>

290
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,609
Arrest for soliciting prostitutes.
A drunk and disorderly.

291
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,008
Each time, the charge
was dropped on a technicality.

292
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,012
Officers make mistakes.

293
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,514
And sometimes cops
help out their friends.

294
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,745
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Maybe not at Western division.

295
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,982
<i>- But here it's a different story.
- That's not what I hear.</i>

296
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,856
Six women were murdered
last night at a place...

297
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,592
where their husbands shouldn't
have been able to find them.

298
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,041
That's-That's Mike's wife Julie.
What... What happened?

299
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,804
<i>Oh, don't tell us
you didn't hear.</i>

300
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,409
Someone broke into a woman's shelter
and killed them. We think Mike did it.

301
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,280
<i>- No way.
- There were five children
staying at the shelter.</i>

302
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,044
Only Mike's son was taken.

303
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,020
Mike wouldn't do that.
Mike loved Julie. He wouldn't kill her.

304
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,284
He's violent enough
to beat her regularly, isn't he?

305
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,418
She knew how to push
his buttons...

306
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,589
but it was never as black and white
as she made it out to be.

307
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,169
- Why am I here?
- I think you got the address of the shelter.

308
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,339
It's secret to the public,
but a cop could get it.

309
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,638
You told him where she was. Then he
sent his hooker girlfriend over there...

310
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,210
<i>to make sure, and then
he killed those women...</i>

311
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,613
and disappeared
with the hooker and his kid.

312
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,346
Any idea where your
best man is now, Lou?

313
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,793
If I knew, that would make me
an accomplice after the fact.

314
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,326
No. We just want
to find Mike.

315
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,091
I need, like, 20 minutes
to think about some things.

316
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,734
We don't have 20 minutes.

317
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,065
Then I can't say anything.

318
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,949
Yo, Tecks got a hit.

319
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,558
I talked to one of my girls.
Seems your fireman had a thing for Dorea.

320
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,252
He started seeing her regularly
and then off the books.

321
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,024
Started playing Jack and Jill
on my goddamn dime.

322
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,668
- Anyone seen him?
- No. And the bitch won't return my pages.

323
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,669
Oh, screw her.
You hear something, you call us.

324
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,940
- I can't believe it.
- Sometimes we're good.

325
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,436
Sometimes we're lucky.
Sometimes we're both.

326
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,615
- Hey, this is not mine.
- What?

327
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,211
<i>This is not my bike. I scratched
my initials under the seat. See?</i>

328
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,589
- J.D. It's not there.
- You didn't tell us that.

329
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,089
Well, can I keep it
anyways?

330
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,061
I'm afraid not.

331
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,095
Sorry.

332
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,064
I just stole a kid's bike.

333
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,005
Time's up.

334
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,644
I hope you used it
as wisely as we did.

335
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,215
Your bank says you withdrew
$400 today.

336
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,877
<i>While you were on duty.
You mind if we look in your wallet?</i>

337
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,390
Where's the cash?

338
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,758
<i>You got a call on your cell from a pay phone
10 minutes before you made this withdrawal.</i>

339
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:24,095
<i>That money was for Mike, wasn't it?
You saw him after these murders.</i>

340
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,702
Look, I can't lose my job.

341
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,999
- This isn't about your job.
- Yes, it is!

342
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,666
It's about a child's life!

343
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,609
You know how many of these
things end in murder/suicide?

344
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:40,911
Look... I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
something and make me lose my job at 32.

345
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,613
<i>- I'm not even sniffing a pension yet.
- You knew Mike, Jr.</i>

346
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,055
You've been
to his birthday parties.

347
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,560
Believe me, I want this
thing to end well. I do.

348
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,188
But I got my own kid
to worry about.

349
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,205
He's not gonna talk. He knows talking
helps us more than it helps him.

350
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,708
He's not gonna break
unless we give him a reason to.

351
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,675
The fact that he's a cop
helps us.

352
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,179
He may not like being unemployed,
but he'll like prison even less.

353
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,120
It could take us all day to make
a deal with him. The kid could be dead.

354
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,884
Let's throw him a lifeline,
give him a free pass for the information.

355
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,417
Just 'cause he's a cop doesn't
mean he gets a free pass. Not from me.

356
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,586
- Dutch is right.
- I'm not talking to you.

357
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,892
- I'm talking about saving a kid.
- Don't act like I'm not.

358
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,627
- I vote he gets a pass.
- Who says your vote counts?

359
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,499
<i>I've been chasing down leads all over this
goddamn city. Better believe my vote counts.</i>

360
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,834
- This isn't your call. It's ours.
- I think he's right.

361
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,719
How old did you say
your daughter was, Lou?

362
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,050
<i>- Three.
- I got two little girls of my own.</i>

363
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,490
<i>- Family's good.
- And expensive.</i>

364
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,959
<i>- No kidding.
- Yeah.</i>

365
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,335
But, see, I understand
what your problem is, Lou.

366
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,929
You gotta keep your job,
gotta keep providing for them.

367
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,068
<i>I'm in a real tough spot here.</i>

368
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,606
Yeah. Except
Mike's still out there.

369
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,176
We think he has the kid.

370
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,042
<i>We don't think he's
in the best frame of mind.</i>

371
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,479
For Christ's sake, you think I don't
realize that? I don't know what to do here.

372
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,317
I mean, I'm... I'm
in an impossible position.

373
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,048
Well, I think there's a way
we can both get what we need.

374
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,216
How?

375
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,488
Uh... you a smoker, Lou?

376
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,063
- Are you jonesing for a smoke
about now, huh?
- Yeah.

377
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,272
How's about you and me head down
to the motor pool, you grab that smoke...

378
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:43,901
<i>make an anonymous phone call,
tell me where Mike might've gone.</i>

379
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,802
I don't know.

380
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,915
That's too risky. You find him, you can make
me an accomplice after the fact. No way.

381
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,752
- Come on, Lou.
- Look, you know I want to help. I just can't.

382
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,256
You son of a bitch.

383
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,654
For the record, I have
no useful information.

384
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,197
You know he's out there!
You know he's got the kid!

385
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,565
- All you can think about
is saving your own ass!
- Whoa, what are you doing?

386
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,067
<i>Oh, look. It's the po-po
who stole my bike.</i>

387
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,541
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding.

388
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,839
- I told you I didn't steal it.
- Yes, you did.

389
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,176
- And you didn't believe me.
- Well, we had a report.

390
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,307
- The description matched.
- Description?

391
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,250
<i>My parents said
that's racial profiling.</i>

392
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,650
<i>No, look. That's
not what happened here.</i>

393
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,590
They said if I ever get profiled,
be polite, respect the officer...

394
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,594
but, um...
get a badge number.

395
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,232
- Look, here's your bike back.
- Is that a eight or a three?

396
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,132
<i>I'm sorry about the mix-up.
It's his first day on the job. He's still learning.</i>

397
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,772
<i>What do you say
we just forget about it?</i>

398
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,341
<i>I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.</i>

399
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,808
And I'll owe you one.

400
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,943
All right. But, uh...
better not happen again.

401
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,790
Thanks.

402
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,658
Better not happen again.

403
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,268
I hear Aceveda's putting
a new member on your team.

404
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,465
No. He's jamming affirmative action
down our throats.

405
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,607
Looking at any women?

406
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,381
Yeah. We're bringing in
Batgirl and Charlie's Angels.

407
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:08,114
Oh, I see. 'Cause someone like me could
never run with the real cops, right?

408
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:15,386
No. I mean, you know, we're gonna
look at all viable candidates.

409
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,265
- Asshole.
- What?

410
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,859
Come on! I didn't know
you were being serious.

411
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,302
Three years on Vice,
a year on Narcotics.

412
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,838
- Any gang time?
- Just what I saw in Vice.

413
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,341
A little undercover
when I first got my shield.

414
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,110
<i>- I'm a fast learner though.
- We're a tight team.</i>

415
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,076
Trust and brotherhood
keep us alive.

416
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,579
Well, I'm looking
to be part of a team.

417
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,014
I see that.

418
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,222
Decorated marine.
You see any action?

419
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:47,055
Short tour in Bosnia.
Marines saved my ass.

420
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,228
<i>I used to be a hell-raiser.
Needed the discipline.</i>

421
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,788
<i>- You know how to follow the rules.
- Yes, sir.</i>

422
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,257
And I'm a guy who likes
busting people who break them.

423
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,535
Good.

424
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,834
- I see you got a wife and kid.
- My boy'll be four next month.

425
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,103
Brave guy.

426
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,011
Must've been a tough decision
to join my crew right now...

427
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,276
especially with people
you love at home.

428
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:18,047
Yeah. Uh...
what do you mean?

429
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,020
Didn't Aceveda tell you?

430
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:24,025
We pissed off a serious Mexican player.
The whole team's been greenlit.

431
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,254
- Greenlit?
- Yeah.

432
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,025
Hits out on all of us.

433
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,471
What did you say to Villanueva?
He withdrew his application.

434
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,971
That's too bad.
He had promise.

435
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,271
- You scared him off.
- Better in here than out on the street.

436
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,643
<i>Look, the field is only gonna get thinner. The
choices don't get much better than Robbie.</i>

437
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,345
Maybe the next guy'll
feel right.

438
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,920
Don't think these stall tactics are gonna work.
We're gonna hire a minority and soon.

439
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,615
Yes, Officer.

440
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,536
Carla here says that fireman
picked her up...

441
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,263
with another girl
a couple of times lately, weekends.

442
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,901
For a threesome?

443
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:16,343
To baby-sit. She'd watch his kid
while he banged the other one.

444
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,345
Sometimes
the other way around.

445
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,451
Jesus. Why isn't she
telling me this?

446
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:27,353
She, uh... She just
don't trust cops.

447
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,221
Or maybe you just forgot
to tell her about the reward.

448
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,430
Whatever.

449
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:34,955
- He come around lately?
- A couple of weeks ago.

450
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,368
Okay. Well, he's got
the kid back.

451
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,667
You tell her to call me if he comes around
looking to play nasty nanny.

452
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,200
<i>- Don't worry. I'll call.
- Connie.</i>

453
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,777
Thanks for your help.

454
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,681
We know if our hooker's got a car?

455
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,013
- None that's registered.
- That means he's driving his own.

456
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,817
Or he stole one. Get me
a list of every car stolen...

457
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,185
within a five-mile radius
of the shelter last night.

458
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,727
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,099
Maybe you, uh, should go in,
try your way.

460
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:17,572
If Lou knows we've got nothing on him,
what am I gonna use for leverage?

461
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,040
Yeah. I don't know.

462
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,707
Well, I'll try, but
it's a waste of time now.

463
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,616
I checked the arrest reports.

464
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,351
You guys have been on the street
seven hours, haven't made a single collar.

465
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,324
We're working a robbery.

466
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,895
- How's that going?
- It's progressing.

467
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,398
- From the donut shop,
to the sports bar, to the strip club.
- Absolutely not.

468
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,631
- Cute.
- The captain does not like excuses.

469
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,206
He just likes results.

470
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,075
You want to get the paperwork
on this bicycle thing, or should I?

471
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,714
I'll do it tomorrow.

472
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,944
We need to complete
our reports the same day.

473
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,248
I'll let myself slide.

474
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,551
Yeah?

475
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,287
- The guys are here putting in the alarm.
- Oh, good.

476
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,898
Vic, this isn't some
simple keypad by the door.

477
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:19,302
<i>They're wiring the windows, putting in timed
lights outside, setting up motion detectors.</i>

478
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,067
Is there something
that I need to know?

479
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,869
Know that you have
nothing to worry about.

480
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,202
It just seems a bit much.

481
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,836
It seems a little complicated at first,
but you'll get used to it.

482
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,915
- Okay.
- Okay.

483
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,488
Followed Corrine all day.
No problems.

484
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,455
- Same with the kids.
- Good.

485
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,060
- They're beautiful children.
- Yeah. Thanks.

486
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,529
Listen. This protection... I can cut you a deal,
but it's still gonna cost a bundle.

487
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,602
- I know.
- I'd welcome the windfall.

488
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,705
But paying to watch
your kids at recess?

489
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,608
Let me just stick a couple of guys on the house
at night. That plus the alarm.

490
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,042
I don't want to take
any chances right now. Stay on them.

491
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,545
Sure. Okay, Vic.
Good news is you're right.

492
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:10,013
She's not seeing anyone.
At least not yet.

493
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,624
You're a lucky man.
I'd leave the house to get milk...

494
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,783
my ex would be balling some other guy
before I got to the 7-11.

495
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,054
<i>I gotta take this.</i>

496
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, sure.
I'll talk to you later.

497
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,865
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

498
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,199
- Hey, Connie, where are you?
- I'm in an apartment. I'm with the kid.

499
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:32,677
- What are you doing?
- I was with Carla when Dorea
came looking for a baby-sitter.

500
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:35,145
- I figured it was for him.
- Where are you?

501
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:40,207
1530 Los Prisa, number 24,
right next to the 101 on-ramp.

502
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,819
This'll get me the five grand,
right, Vic?

503
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,888
Get the kid
and get out of there right now!

504
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,787
I can't. I'm in the bedroom.
I gotta go past them to get to the door.

505
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,395
Is there a window
or a fire escape?

506
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,998
- Who are you talking to?
- Connie!

507
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,533
Setting up my next date.

508
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,171
You're still mine
for another 20 minutes.

509
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,068
Come join us.

510
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,036
Shouldn't someone
stay with him?

511
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,646
No. He sleeps
through anything.

512
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,579
Okay. Let's set up
a containment.

513
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:44,844
Ronnie, you take the rear.
Lem, you take starboard.

514
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,385
- You take port.
- Where are you going?

515
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,548
Through the front door, as soon
as the department snipers get here.

516
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,320
<i>Shit!</i>

517
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,755
Ah, we're supposed to be
non-code.

518
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,385
Nobody told the ambulances.
Goddamn it!

519
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,808
- You called the cops.
- No. I swear!

520
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,245
- Drop the gun, Mike! Put the gun down, Mike!
- Call 'em off!

521
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:21,280
Take that gun away from her!
Otherwise, you might as well be
putting a bullet into your head!

522
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,954
- I want 'em gone!
- Okay.

523
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:28,582
Back off!
Everybody, back off!

524
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,661
<i>Mike, I'm coming in to talk.</i>

525
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,665
- I don't need to talk!
- Two hostages are better than one!

526
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,165
Gun stays outside!

527
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:46,004
Throw down piece two! Come on!
You think I don't know cops?

528
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,546
Okay, Dorea, get the door.

529
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,922
<i>Come on!</i>

530
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,958
Shut the door! Lock it!

531
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,958
<i>Lock it!</i>

532
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,333
Shut the blinds!

533
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,359
<i>Goddamn snipers, right?
Shut the blinds!</i>

534
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,872
You okay?

535
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,067
<i>You need a plan.</i>

536
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,578
I'm the man
that can make it happen.

537
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,411
Cut the negotiator 101 crap! You're gonna do
what I tell you, or I'll kill you both!

538
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,076
Fine. Take me.
Let the girl and the kid go.

539
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,348
I already have what I want!
Call your buddies!

540
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,619
Tell 'em you're in here if they're thinking
of using gas or knocking down the door!

541
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,854
It's not gonna matter
to them that I'm in here.

542
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,760
They're not gonna do the risky
stuff with one of their own!

543
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,366
- Do it! Do it!
- Okay. Okay.

544
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,406
<i>- What's going on?
- Mackey's inside.</i>

545
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,377
<i>So... why don't you
let him go? The kid.</i>

546
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,851
<i>- He's been through enough.
- I didn't go through all this
just to lose him again.</i>

547
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,910
<i>- He's mine.
- He's your son. He's not your property.</i>

548
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,414
You don't know a goddamn
thing about it!

549
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,719
The hell I don't!
I got a boy. I had a boy.

550
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,724
<i>My wife has him now.</i>

551
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,899
She left me.
Made me leave.

552
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:17,732
Then she took my son
and my little girls.

553
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,942
- They always take everything.
- Everything except advice.

554
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:28,173
<i>That's why I like whores.
You know what you're buying.</i>

555
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,946
- We never had a problem, did we, baby?
- No, baby.

556
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,816
<i>It's not even like I feel alone.
I just feel abandoned.</i>

557
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,677
- Pissed off?
- Yeah. Hell, yeah, pissed off.

558
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,756
I tried with Julie.

559
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,290
<i>I didn't want... I didn't...</i>

560
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:48,592
It's all right. I've had the same thoughts
go through my mind that you've had.

561
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,930
<i>You're not the only guy
who's been used.</i>

562
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,403
Most of all, I...
I just miss my kids.

563
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:02,569
I... I can feel myself becoming
a stranger to 'em, you know?

564
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,584
- You're so full of shit.
- No.

565
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,286
<i>You're gonna sit there and pretend
to understand me, what I'm going through?</i>

566
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,897
- I'm telling you the truth.
- You think I'm gonna believe
a bullshit story like that?

567
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,102
<i>- Hey, calm down!
- What, it's gonna make me
associate with you?</i>

568
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,229
<i>- Calm down!
- I'm gonna give you this gun?</i>

569
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,769
You think I'm some kind of idiot
that you don't have to take seriously?

570
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,342
<i>- Of course I do.
- This is how serious I am!</i>

571
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,969
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

572
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,548
<i>- Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
- No!</i>

573
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,818
<i>Suspect is wearing
a gray T-shirt.</i>

574
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,156
<i>- She's dying.
- You're gonna be dead too if you move.</i>

575
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,531
<i>- You didn't need to do that.
- Shut up.</i>

576
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,032
Jesus! What the hell
is the matter with you?

577
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,605
- Shut up!
- You stupid piece of shit!

578
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,638
<i>Dad, what's wrong?</i>

579
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,545
Mikey, it's all right.
Stay in there, okay? Shut up.

580
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,013
- Dad?
- Shut up. I can't think when you're talking.

581
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,075
<i>- Dad?
- It's okay. It's okay. Just go inside.</i>

582
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,873
Oh, Christ!

583
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,949
Oh, Vic, I'm...

584
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,433
- Officer Sofer.
- Yeah?

585
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,133
Detectives Branning
and Simpkins.

586
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,539
- I.A.D.
- Yes?

587
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,942
We need to search
your vehicle.

588
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,345
Why?

589
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,351
We got an anonymous call. Someone claims
you're dealing marijuana out of your car.

590
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:30,255
Okay, look. I was involved
in an on-duty shooting last month.

591
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,593
<i>That guy's wife
has it out for me.</i>

592
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,788
This is another bullshit
prank of hers.

593
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,436
Either way, new regulations say
we have to investigate every complaint.

594
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:41,701
No matter how bogus.
Where's your car?

595
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,246
Got something.

596
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,787
Wait a minute.
That's not mine.

597
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,256
<i>I told you, this Arab woman.
She wants my job!</i>

598
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,828
She's the one that vandalized my car.
She must've put the pot in at the same time.

599
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,730
We'll look into that, but we're also
gonna have some questions.

600
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:15,031
What sort of questions? Dust the bag for
fingerprints. You're not gonna find mine.

601
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,333
Let's talk inside.

602
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:23,272
Oh, please! What do you think I am,
some big-time drug dealer?

603
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,682
I just happen to keep my pot...
all four ounces of it... in an unlocked car...

604
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,445
in the middle
of a police station?

605
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,755
It's a setup.

606
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,695
Mike's been shot.
He's dead.

607
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,163
Oh, Jesus!

608
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,634
<i>He also managed to take
another woman's life before he died.</i>

609
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:54,004
Eight people dead.
But you saved your job.

610
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:58,274
<i>- Listen. I never wanted any of this to happen.
- Good for you.</i>

611
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,645
Now get the hell
out of my sight.

612
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,968
Okay, your system's
running fine.

613
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,062
Well, it should.
They told me it cost $2,000.

614
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:25,466
I got a deal from a guy I know.
Sort of a barter thing.

615
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,476
What's wrong?

616
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,676
<i>- What?
- Did something happen?</i>

617
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,616
It's just work.

618
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,658
Just make sure you
turn it on when I leave.

619
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:43,252
I will. Are you...
Are you sure you're all right?

620
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,127
Yeah.

621
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,164
I'll see you and the kids
tomorrow for dinner.

622
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,163
Okay.

623
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,681
Here you go.

624
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,279
<i>- They found it, Mama.
- Whoa.</i>

625
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,015
Put this on, little man.
State law.

626
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,251
Okay. Go, go!

627
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,521
Go! Thank you.

628
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,927
We're here to serve.

629
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,668
$300 for a bike!

630
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,831
Lucky this uniform thing
is only once a month.

631
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,967
Any more crying kids,
I'd be broke.

632
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,254
I thought I'd stop by
and check out the new digs.

633
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,092
Nice.

634
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,388
What's this?

635
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,395
Donation.

636
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,396
Thank you.

637
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,198
Things we do to each other.

638
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,471
- Maybe someday I'll understand.
- I doubt it.

639
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,913
Thanks for the food.
