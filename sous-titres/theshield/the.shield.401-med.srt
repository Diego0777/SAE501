- I didn't even hear him.
- Suspect cut the vocal cords.

they do that now?

a couple of months back?

What's he coming down here for?

- Oh, shit.

Assistant Chief Phillips, you didn't need
to come all the way down here, sir.

- Nothing else he could have done.
- Is he the shooter?

The kid had no choice.

The dog was reaching.

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,933
It was kill or be killed.

42
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:59,070
Oh, come on, Roy.
If the dog had a piece, he was gonna use it.

00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,205
But I signed up for the full tour.

170
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,140
[Clears Throat]

171
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,507
- Hey, yo.
- What up?

172
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,808
Somebody offed a family
at the Pavo Real.

173
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,816
They drowned 'em in the tub
and took a little kid.

174
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,148
- First /'m hearin'it.
- Yeah?

175
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,245
I know you maggots use that motel
like it's a frat house.

176
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,758
You give us back the boy alive, and
I won't burn your cash cow to the ground.

177
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,124
Man, we ain't been to that spot
for a minute.

178
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,891
You wanna step to a brother,
get yo'facts straight.

179
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,765
Hey, big man. You wanna get into it?
Come over here.

180
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,667
What's your name?

181
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,672
T-Gun.

182
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,742
Turn around, T-Gun.

183
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,612
Put your hands on your head.

184
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,085
Still joustin' and roustin'.

185
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:59,419
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be surprised
if I ran in your old man.

186
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,358
- I never knew my pop.
- Yeah, well, I bet I did.

187
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,793
What's this right here?

188
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,388
Are you on probation, T-Gun?

189
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,401
- Hmm?
- Yes, ma'am.

190
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,403
And you're carrying a knife?

191
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,905
- When are you gonna get it right?
- Never.

192
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,636
He'll be a shithead his whole life, which,
at this rate, will be a couple of months.

193
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,644
How about our missing kid?

194
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,771
We don't know shit.

195
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,511
- Yeah, well, I'll just keep your I.D. Okay?
- What for?

196
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,247
/ gotta write up the blade,
but / don't have time now.

197
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,586
So just come by the Farmington Station
and ask for the new captain.

198
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,957
Otherwise, I know
where to find you... Gunther.

199
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,096
That was a waste.

200
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,098
Well, we stirred up the pot.

201
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,998
Now we'll see what boils over.

202
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,196
You all know Assistant D.A. Insardi?

203
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,205
Hey, have you
identified the child yet?

204
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,207
Little Eddie. Three years old.

205
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,641
- I've got the crime lab rushing everything.
- Robbery, kidnapping-

206
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,146
But why kill the people who'd pay the ransom?
They must want him for some other reason.

207
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,649
We found a pay locker key in the car. Dutch
and Claudette'll run down nearby businesses.

208
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,983
There's a kid missing. Your office
wants us on locker-hunting scut work.

209
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,751
Excuse me?
I don't hand out assignments here.

210
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,759
You know what /'m talking about.
Your office is blackballing us.

211
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,261
Shut it down, Dutch.
Find the locker.

212
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,821
I can think of some possibilities.
Come on. Let's make ourselves useful.

213
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,339
[Corrine] Any chance you can stop by
to sign that Realtor's agreement today?

214
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,907
[Laughs]
Yeah. Next to none.

215
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,306
She needs your signature
in order to show the house.

216
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:30,144
Well, listen, uh, can you drop off the
paperwork at the Barn after you're done?

217
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,615
Um, sure.

218
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,312
Cassidy still got the sniffles?

219
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,821
Nah, she's-she's better.

220
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,450
What about Matthew and Megan?
What are they up to?

221
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,585
Matthew's been great this week.
He's in a good routine.

222
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,493
Wish I could say the same.

223
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,193
[Chuckles] Listen, I gotta go.
I'm kinda tailing someone.

224
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,531
- Okay. Don't lose 'em.
- Okay, good.

225
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,605
[Beeps]

226
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,872
Wife?

227
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,343
- Soon-to-be ex.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

228
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,349
[Radio: Dispatcher
Chattering, /ndistinct]

229
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,715
So, you're planning
on leaving the Barn?

230
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,950
Uh, you might as well know. I put in
to head up the new street crime detail.

231
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,025
- Oh, the citywide thing?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,095
Paul Reyes took that.

233
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,827
Reyes?
No, I don't think so.

234
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,924
Yeah. Last night.

235
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,962
He's been kicking ass in Inglewood.

236
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,305
Huh.
Good for him.

237
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,073
- [All] Respect!
- [Man] We're only killing ourselves.

238
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,980
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,779
Our sisters need us.

240
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,548
They're raising our babies alone...

241
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:49,060
while we're out in the street chasing women,
money or drugs instead of giving them respect.

242
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,061
[All]
Respect!

243
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,064
[Man] Our babies,
they need us in their lives.

244
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,293
- Not in jail. Not in the street.
- That's right!

245
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,302
And not in the grave.

246
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,565
Our mothers need us.

247
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,574
Too many have cried
too many tears...

248
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,270
buried too many sons.

249
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,278
Word.

250
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,281
Our brothers, they need us...

251
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,183
lifting each other up
and not shootin' 'em down.

252
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,312
Is that respect?

253
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,015
[All]
Respect!

254
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,422
That's Antwon Mitchell.
O.G. One-niner.

255
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,427
Yeah, I know Antwon.

256
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,966
There's the Harbor set,
Warren, Crenshaw.

257
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,035
- [Antwon] One night they tore up my boys.
- [Monica] Pico.

258
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,935
Came straight through the wall.
And his woman had to shield their baby.

259
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,667
A lot of these folks
aren't wearing colors.

260
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,675
A lot of them are just citizens.

261
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,871
The bullet ripped through her body,
killing that child.

262
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,575
We're keeping the gravediggers
too busy...

263
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,583
and that's a damn shame.

264
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,585
[Woman]
Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,588
And I guess the police,
they need us too.

266
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,319
You put more than two black men together,
and look who shows up.

267
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,327
Hey, but you know what?

268
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,329
It's our own fault.

269
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,991
Because we commit the crimes.

270
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,001
I did myself.

271
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,663
I slung rock...

272
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,637
messed people up.

273
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,437
But I don't fight the power anymore.

274
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,704
[Men Muttering]

275
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,749
We got to be about
changing that power.

276
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,251
And you, keep your heads up.

277
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,446
Be a man.

278
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,453
Demand respect!

279
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,456
[All]
Respect!

280
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,459
Because sooner or later,
they got to give it to you.

281
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,223
You take the skills
that they forced on us-

282
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:36,733
slingin, pimpin, survivin

283
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,735
These are business skills...

284
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,965
skills that we need
to open our restaurants...

285
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,407
our banks, shops that we own.

286
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,036
Take back this neighborhood
and make it ours.

287
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,741
- Then we'll get respect!
- [All] Respect!

288
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,874
- Respect!
- [All] Respect!

289
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,646
- Respect.
- [All] Respect!

290
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,311
- Respect.
- [All] Respect!

291
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,980
- Keep sayin'it.
- [All] Respect!

292
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,990
- Say it again.
- [All] Respect!

293
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,458
- Keep sayin'it. Live for it.
- Respect! Respect!

294
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,188
- Die for it!
- Respect!

295
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,662
- Sleep with it! Eat with it!
- Respect! Respect!

296
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,427
- Mean it. Give it.
- Respect. Respect.

297
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,332
- Get it.
- Respect.

298
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,337
We've been frozen out for months.

299
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,966
- They'll take us out of the doghouse eventually.
- Yeah, when?

300
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,307
- What do you want me to do, Dutch?
Take obedience training?
- How's it going?

301
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,973
If the D.A. is waiting for me to apologize,
hell isn't nearly cold enough.

302
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,246
And you're happy to let my career
rot along with yours, huh?

303
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,583
/ appreciate your support.

304
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,350
I won't hold it against you
if you want to put in for a new partner.

305
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,859
So I can either be a traitor
or a coward? Thanks.

306
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,861
Don't mind me.

307
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,261
Oh, I won't.

308
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,357
Well, these match.

309
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,868
Yeah?

310
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,564
You could definitely
fit a child in there.

311
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,209
[Chuckles]
Or a shitload of cash.

312
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,506
- [Hip-hop]
- [Chattering, Laughing]

313
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,421

314
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,328
Stank, come on.

315
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,331
Someone drowns an entire family
on your turf, snatches a little kid...

316
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,333
and you don't know nothin' about it?

317
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,869
If they mindin' they own business,
we cool.

318
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,201
- We chillin', not killin'.
- Right, right.

319
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,173
'Cause you're all about
using your drug-dealing skills...

320
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,176
to get free checking.

321
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,543
Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

322
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,616
Antwon Mitchell.

323
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,177
- Do I know you?
- [Chuckles] I know your mug shot.

324
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,313
I worked with Rich Nelson.

325
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,985
- How's he doin'?
- Passed three years ago.

326
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,994
- Cancer.
- Damn.

327
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,996
Cancer's rough.

328
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,999
But he was always talkin' 'bout
how he was gonna piss on my grave.

329
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,696
[Laughs] Guess I gotta grab me a 40
and go pay my respects.

330
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,705
[Men Laughing]

331
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,709
Somebody drowned a family at the Pavo Real,
snatched a three-year-old boy.

332
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,836
Nobody here would do that.

333
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,779
- That motel is a One-niner cesspool.
- Mmm.

334
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,318
These Million Men?
They're One-niners.

335
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,819

He was bound to find trouble
one way or another.

00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,957
- What are you working?
- Oh, Coronado Boys.

501
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,968
A gang in the loosest sense.

the supposed friend
of the drowned boy.

504
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,977
All these should be in a database,
or at least on a wall somewhere.

The Barn's an apt name.
We're low-tech.

When Mackey ran point on gangs,
how did he organize his intel for everyone?

00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,786
Organization's not

to square things with the D.A.?

What are they planning on doing
to square things with me?

516
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,111
Seventeen cases overturned?
Another 40 on appeal?

517
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,185
They have a right to be pissed.

518
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,883
Aceveda could have fought for me.
So could you.

519
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,961
You've made your point.

- I got his cell phone number.

If we get a warrant, the phone carrier
can triangulate his position.

Killing a little kid?

Tito held Pops's head underwater to
get him to talk, but the old man died.

Tito said we had to do the others too.

- What was Pops supposed to say?
- Where the 35 grand was.

- Where the 35 grand was.

with that much cash in the first place?

He thought he was buying la cura.

00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,754
- The cure? Heroin.
- Chalindo convinced the son to set it up.

610
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,262
We sell some to Pops, he turns around
and sells it for five times the money.

611
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,457
- Maybe he buys the family a house.
- So what went wrong?

00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,169
There was no "H. '"
Plan was just a rip-off.

613
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,104
So the son set up his own father
to be robbed.

614
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,176
- Beautiful.
- Pops should have just handed over the cash.

So why'd you take the kid?

After the others, I couldn't let Tito do him.
A little kid?

But Tito said he could I.D. us to the cops.

00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,084
- He's three years old.
- And talks, right?

619
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:21,090
Tito wanted to put a body onto my hands,
so he told me to do him.

620
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,322
And I couldn't, so I hid him at my place,
told him I did the killing.

621
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,491
This is all gonna help me, right?

622
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,500
I di- I didn't drown anyone myself,
and I saved the kid!

00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,970
What the hell are you doing here?

832
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,982
I had a call about a shooting.
What are you doin'?

833
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,212
- We didn't hear any call.
- One of my C.I.'s phoned in a tip.

00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,449
[Mackey]
Where's your backup?

835
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,958
I'm solo tonight.

836
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,585
[Mackey]
Well, did you call it in?

837
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,664
I was about to.

838
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,836
What's your vice unit
have to do with this guy?

839
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,737
Dead-Eye had a lot of vices.

840
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,367
Watch the door.

841
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,013
So, how you doin'?

842
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:03,018
Kids all right?
Is, uh- Is Cassidy still with you?

00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,924
Yeah.

844
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,730
Heard you and Mara had the baby.

00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,562
Yeah. Yeah.
Three, uh-

Three weeks ago.

00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,905
Named him Jackson.

848
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,200
As in Michael?

849
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,311
As in Stonewall.

850
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,315
Congrats.

851
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:40,221
So, I heard about Reyes
takin' the, uh, street crime detail.

852
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,293
Guess you'll be stuck on videotapes
for a while, huh?

853
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,291
I worked the drowning.
The hotel.

854
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,297
Yesterday?
The Pavo Real?

855
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,799
Yeah.
That place always was a pit.

856
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,463
Yeah, a pit we were
about to pull the plug on.

857
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,700
Except we were too busy
covering our asses.

858
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,710
Yeah, well, too many dickheads,
too little time.

859
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,643

860
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,215

861
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,217
Had some dealings with this guy.
You know how that is.

862
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,287
No, I don't.
Put it back.

863
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,323
I can't do that.

864
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,393
My name's in there.

865
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,830
What about Antwon Mitchell's?

866
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,400
What are you, I.A.D. now?

867
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,562
I don't see that jacket fitting.

868
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,473
Why are you here?

869
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,543
Who did this?

870
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,212
You wanna smell my gun?

871
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,885
Antwon Mitchell do this?

872
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,378
You know,
I honestly don't know.

873
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,360
But I tell you what-
I'll let you call it in.
