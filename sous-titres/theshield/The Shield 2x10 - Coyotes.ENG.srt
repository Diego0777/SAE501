1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,098
<i>Yeah, hold on!</i>

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:14,269
<i>Hey, Vic, it's me! Open up!</i>

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,006
- What's up?
- You see this?

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,673
<i>- What?
- I thought Lanie's report
wasn't coming out for weeks.</i>

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,421
<i>- It's not.
- What's it doing there in black and white?</i>

6
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,049
<i>- Are we named?
- Yeah, Strike Team's mentioned.</i>

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,390
<i>You bitch.</i>

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,222
<i>Well, at least we're not alone.</i>

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:38,133
<i>Aceveda's name is mentioned...
more than three times.</i>

10
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,829
<i>Will you get me a towel, please?</i>

11
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,177
- See you downstairs in a few minutes.
- All right, man.

12
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,255
- Yeah?
- Just reading the newspaper. Have you?

13
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,826
Lakers cut it pretty close last night.

14
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,125
They're not the only ones.

15
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,004
That about the Armadillo thing?

16
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,538
<i>I just don't like not liking my job.</i>

17
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,802
Well, lucky for you we might not
have jobs in a couple of weeks.

18
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,746
We better talk,
get our stories straight.

19
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:22,977
I don't have time to talk. I have to
manage perhaps the most dysfunctional...

20
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,016
<i>inefficient precinct in the city.</i>

21
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,121
- Yeah?
- Vic, Gilroy called.

22
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,854
- What?
- Gilroy. He called here at the house.

23
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,396
- You spoke to him?
- He left a message on the machine.

24
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,322
He said he was coming over.
I thought he was in jail.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,661
Well, he's out on bail, but he's
supposed to be under house arrest.

26
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,666
All right, I'm on the way.
Is the alarm on?

27
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,032
Yes! What if he gets here first?

28
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,403
Keep the doors locked
and the alarm on.

29
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,136
<i>I just got married. Now is not
a good time for me to be losing my job.</i>

30
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,142
<i>That's not how it works.</i>

31
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,713
They start by offering older
officers early retirement.

32
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,251
Then they cut
the discipline problems.

33
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,310
They're not gonna take a young
black officer off the street...

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,179
not in this district.

35
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,324
- The only one that's in trouble is me.
- No way.

36
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,725
Do you know they practically
blamed me for Armadillo's murder?

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,460
<i>Just a sec.</i>

38
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,000
I need to clear my name
on this Armadillo thing.

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,730
- How can I help?
- You were the lead on the case.

40
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,299
If there's anything you know
or discover, would you fill me in?

41
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,741
- I'll keep an eye out.
- I patted that guy down.

42
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,006
There's no way
I missed a knife that big.

43
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,817
Maybe you didn't.

44
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,014
The only thing I can think of is another
inmate must have given it to him.

45
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,718
<i>- Or another cop.
- Why would a...</i>

46
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,061
I probably shouldn't have said that.

47
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:45,189
Wait. What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

48
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,990
<i>Sarge wants us
on the street. Now.</i>

49
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,637
I'll talk to you later.

50
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,171
<i>- I want to apologize!
- Go away!</i>

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,108
<i>- I want to say I'm sorry!
- You said it! Now go!</i>

52
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,344
Please, I'm not here to hurt you!
I need to speak to Vic!

53
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,382
<i>Hey! Are you kidding me?</i>

54
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,181
I need to talk to you.
You wouldn't pick up the phone!

55
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,145
- Vic, get rid of him!
- Corrine.

56
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,449
Shut up. Go back inside.
I've got this under control.

57
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,126
<i>- Vic!
- Go inside!</i>

58
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,889
You were supposed to be
under house arrest.

59
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,657
- I cut off my ankle transmitter.
- You've gone fugitive?

60
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,999
- Let me explain this.
- Save it! I'm hauling your ass in.

61
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,762
<i>Sure, and you can start
sizing up the cell next to mine.</i>

62
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,532
The D.A. wants me
to give you up.

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,901
There's nothin' to give up.

64
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,807
There's places you don't
want them lookin'.

65
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,515
<i>I can't go to prison, Vic.</i>

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,574
<i>The best my lawyer can do
is eight years.</i>

67
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,909
My liver can't do seven.

68
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,057
I'm not gonna rat you out,
but I'm not gonna go back to jail.

69
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:46,548
- You're running out of options.
- Help me get out of the country.

70
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,656
No!

71
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,692
Once I'm gone,
you're in the clear too.

72
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,978
They wanted me to wear a wire.
I told them to go to hell.

73
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,970
We haven't got a lot of time, Vic.
We gotta do this now.

74
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,488
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Then you better put a gun to my head...

75
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,119
because if you send me
back to prison...

76
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,593
I'm not gonna hold out
much longer.

77
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,792
Just help me
get across the border.

78
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,898
Get in the car.

79
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,506
What a stupid bastard you are.

80
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,127
Fresh clothes.
You owe me $200.

81
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,464
- How you doin', Shane?
- Great.

82
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,207
<i>All right, your picture's gonna be
plastered at every border crossing...</i>

83
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,110
so you're gonna need paper
to survive on the other side.

84
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:14,341
I'll need American and Mexican
passports and I.D. and money.

85
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,542
Oh, you lookin' for a loan from us,
you can tickle my zipper.

86
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:22,184
This key here opens up a safe-deposit
box. The money's in there.

87
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,717
<i>- How much?
- 75,000.</i>

88
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,654
That's all you got left
from your land schemes?

89
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,259
Sedona disappeared
with most of it.

90
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,897
<i>Seventy-five grand
isn't gonna last very long.</i>

91
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,662
Ah, I don't need much.
A hut on the beach and rice and beans.

92
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,037
<i>I'll make it last.</i>

93
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,837
<i>- They'll look for you in Mexico.
- I know a guy in Brazil.</i>

94
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,838
<i>I just need a ticket
from Mexico City to Rio.</i>

95
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,741
Jesus, what do we look like,
we're wearing little headsets?

96
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,711
- Where's the money?
- Tellmare Savings on Vermont.

97
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,579
- I owe you, Vic.
- Shut up.

98
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,518
<i>- Your report wasn't due for two weeks.
- That isn't my report.</i>

99
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,355
<i>I was supposed to have advanced copy.
This is completely one-sided.</i>

100
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,832
Someone stole my notes, then
leaked the damaging portions to...

101
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,357
<i>- Who has access to your notes?
- That's what I'm trying to find out!</i>

102
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,570
The chief's office just called me!

103
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,265
Do you have any idea
how much this screws me?

104
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,807
Look!

105
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,299
Look, the fact is
nothing was embellished.

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,110
All the incidents
in the paper happened, David.

107
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,673
<i>I am sorry that they don't
show you in a good light...</i>

108
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,883
<i>but they all happened.</i>

109
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,523
Aceveda and I picked out a new
Strike Team guy. He starts today.

110
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,488
Talk about crappy timing.

111
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,253
Lem, you keep him occupied.
Test him out. See how he runs.

112
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,327
Why do I have to
baby-sit the new guy?

113
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,798
<i>Somebody's gotta handle our car-ring sting
while Vic and I clean up a little problem.</i>

114
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,232
<i>- What problem?
- Gilroy skipped bail.</i>

115
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,907
Shane and I are gonna
slip him out of the country.

116
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,137
I thought that we were gonna keep our
noses clean till we hit the money train.

117
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,709
If Gilroy goes back inside,
starts cooperating with the D.A. ...

118
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,679
there won't be any money train
or anything else.

119
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,645
<i>Gilroy said the D.A. came to him...</i>

120
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,115
so the question is who's
going to the D.A. about us?

121
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,119
- Lanie?
- Or Claudette.

122
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,882
<i>I'm thinkin'Aceveda.</i>

123
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,391
Whoever it is, timing on this
and the morning headline...

124
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,325
<i>- is no coincidence.
- And you think they're related?</i>

125
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,464
<i>I think we gotta be
extra careful.</i>

126
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,100
<i>Look in every dark corner.</i>

127
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,533
Yeah?

128
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,933
- Tavon.
- Hey.

129
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,439
Tavon here has been
in Special Crimes the last few years.

130
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,100
It's a job.
This one sounds better.

131
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,874
<i>- Lemonhead, Shane.
- What's up, man?</i>

132
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,414
<i>Hell of a first day.
We still have jobs?</i>

133
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,418
<i>All the assholes in this city...
we'll always have jobs.</i>

134
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,885
- So what's on the agenda?
- We have a one-day window...

135
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,482
to sting the head of one of L.A.'s
biggest car theft rings.

136
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,052
We've been targeting this guy
for a while, but he knows our faces.

137
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,729
We've never been able to get close.

138
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>You, however, he doesn't know.</i>

139
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,030
- Here's his file.
- It's a one-day trial period.

140
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,197
Lem here'll fill you in.

141
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,207
- Let's go.
- I guess it's on.

142
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,248
What's the deal
with Mr. Special Crimes?

143
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,045
Seems a little too cool
for school, don't you think?

144
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,244
Let's give him a chance.

145
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,387
I remember the last guy
we gave a chance to.

146
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,117
This time I did my homework.
I spoke to him a couple of times.

147
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,958
- He seems straight up.
- Yeah, we'll see.

148
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,195
<i>Toni Jahnes, 71, widow.</i>

149
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,925
- Looks like the intruder entered here.
- What's missing?

150
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,190
Nothing that couldn't travel.
No appliances.

151
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,900
<i>Someone did go through
the jewelry though.</i>

152
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,700
Robbery-homicide. Looks like
he hit her head on the mantle.

153
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,002
Being so old, probably
couldn't put up a fight.

154
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,940
You know I closed three robbery cases
last week, one homicide?

155
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,544
<i>Way above departmental average.</i>

156
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,483
Think that gets mentioned
in the report?

157
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,713
No.

158
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,553
<i>- No.
- Sorry.</i>

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,786
Yeah, so am I.
Just doesn't seem fair.

160
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,060
- Looks like she had two daughters.
- I saw that. How are yours?

161
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,034
Good question.

162
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,825
<i>Look, Quazi's gonna get the money,
make the fake I.D. 's...</i>

163
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,094
and Gilroy will be out of our lives
for good with no blood spilled.

164
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:35,168
I know you got a soft spot for Ben,
but if he goes sideways...

165
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,274
I'm not gonna let him
hurt us, Vic.

166
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,252
<i>- Morning, Chief.
- Sorry I have to meet like this.</i>

167
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,125
I understand.
You're a busy man.

168
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,498
<i>- So.
- I was supposed to have a chance...</i>

169
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,171
<i>to respond to the report
before it went public.</i>

170
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,933
<i>- Respond to it now.
- It's completely biased.</i>

171
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,905
Compared to other divisions...

172
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,113
Farmington has the steepest
reduction in crime rates in the city.

173
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,946
Our arrest records far outweigh
any allegations of misconduct.

174
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,951
What would you do in my position?

175
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,317
- My first instinct would be to fire me.
- So far, I'm with you.

176
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,248
<i>And then I'd think
how that might look.</i>

177
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,390
Fire me on the day
this news breaks...

178
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,392
you give the charges credibility.

179
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,100
<i>Then when the whole truth
comes out...</i>

180
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,897
<i>that the barn has a first-rate
return against crime...</i>

181
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,702
a real success story...

182
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:47,404
I suggest you withhold judgment a while
before shaking things up.

183
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,606
I've heard about this kind
of slick shit of yours.

184
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,482
It doesn't work on me.

185
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,417
You're running for office.

186
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,183
<i>I'll leave you as captain
until that run is over.</i>

187
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,594
<i>If you win, you graduate
to city council...</i>

188
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,893
and you remember that
I gave you another six months.

189
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,868
<i>If you lose the primary...</i>

190
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,302
<i>you need to spend
more time with your family...</i>

191
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,932
<i>due to the strain...</i>

192
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,509
<i>and you resign quietly.</i>

193
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,336
<i>Relax, David.
Every campaign has a crisis point...</i>

194
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,239
which is why we always have
a contingency plan.

195
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,285
<i>- What?
- Campaña de ataques.</i>

196
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,423
A smear campaign? No.

197
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,914
Dirty tricks might be the norm
in Mexico, but not here.

198
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,953
Half of your voters
were born in Mexico, David.

199
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,925
To them,
this is a way of life.

200
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,927
Look, if I do this,
where does it stop?

201
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,362
<i>With you beating Karen Mitchell.</i>

202
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,969
No. No, I'm going
to rearrange the barn...

203
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,438
and if I'm lucky, I can
get things back on track.

204
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,303
I can turn things around
before the primary.

205
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,342
Not soon enough.
Whoever leaked this...

206
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,179
was coordinated and determined.

207
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:00,114
We have to be all that, plus smarter.

208
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,311
No. There's got to be a better way.

209
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,050
<i>You think Aceveda's the one
who went to the D.A.?</i>

210
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,285
<i>- Yeah.
- Backstabbing bastard.</i>

211
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>Who knows? Maybe he
caught wind of the report...</i>

212
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,496
figured he'd have us take the hit.

213
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,067
<i>Look, I don't like the timing of
this whole new Strike Team guy.</i>

214
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,033
Aceveda signed off on him.

215
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,241
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.

216
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:25,301
It's just one day.
He'll be gone tomorrow.

217
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,946
Okay, he's got it.

218
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,050
Oh, crap.

219
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,050
I guess intelligence
is his second language.

220
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,015
<i>He can duplicate government documents
flawlessly. He can't tell his left from his right.</i>

221
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,355
<i>- He's nervous.
- I just hope he remembers
where the meeting place is.</i>

222
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,441
<i>- Drop the weapon! Let go of her!
- Freeze!</i>

223
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,205
<i>Get your hands off of her!
Hey, you, come here! Stop!</i>

224
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,009
<i>On your knees!
On your knees!</i>

225
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:09,085
<i>Get on your knees now!
Put your hands on the ground now!</i>

226
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,085
Open your mouth.

227
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,392
Spit it out! Spit it!

228
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,859
<i>Turn over!</i>

229
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,862
Turn over.

230
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,964
Jesus Christ.

231
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,004
We talked to some of the girls
in your neighborhood.

232
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:31,336
<i>They said this isn't the first time you started
a fight in the last couple of weeks.</i>

233
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,605
You're eight months pregnant. You want
to tell us why you're mixin' it up?

234
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,340
<i>Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean
I have to stop bringing it.</i>

235
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,248
<i>- You're a little old to be brawlin'
- You want to try me?</i>

236
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,387
Why don't you tell us about
the father, this Antonio.

237
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,387
<i>- I don't know, and I don't care.
- Maybe he cares.</i>

238
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,583
<i>- Well, it ain't about him.
- No, it's about the baby.</i>

239
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,891
You don't want to hurt it, right?

240
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,398
Right?

241
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,232
<i>You trying
to lose this baby?</i>

242
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,397
Look, whatever happens happens.

243
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,374
I'm just gonna keep
doing my thing.

244
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,407
And what about that
little boy inside of you?

245
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,480
That's right. It's a boy.

246
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,210
Which means it's gonna look like
Antonio, sound like Antonio...

247
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,112
<i>and I don't wanna be looking at a little
Antonio for the rest of my life.</i>

248
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,915
Have you thought about that?

249
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,063
She worked for the Parks
Department for 30 years.

250
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,896
Outlived both her daughters.
One was killed by a drunk driver.

251
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,296
Other died of ovarian cancer last year.

252
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,401
<i>I ran a check on like crimes.</i>

253
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,664
<i>- Three break-ins the last two weeks.
- That the report there?</i>

254
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,441
<i>- No.
- What is it?</i>

255
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:40,743
Win list. I'm compiling
a folder of all my wins.

256
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,947
Your wins? What have you
got to be worried about?

257
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,075
<i>- You've got a great jacket.
- You weren't mentioned in the report.</i>

258
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,982
- People remember headlines.
- M.E. sent over Toni Jahnes's prelims.

259
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,853
<i>You can close your folder.</i>

260
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,863
<i>- Wasn't a murder.
- What was it?</i>

261
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,491
Uh, she died of a heart attack,
not the blow to the head.

262
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,701
When did she have
a heart attack?

263
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,101
They haven't determined that yet.
Why?

264
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,233
Because maybe she had it when
she saw the burglar in her house.

265
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,043
<i>File that under "we'll never know."
Should I contact next of kin?</i>

266
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,410
She had no kin, no heirs,
no friends that I could tell.

267
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,815
Heart attack probably
doesn't qualify as a win, does it?

268
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,755
Ben? Ben!

269
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,353
These were my last two beers,
the only booze I had left in the house.

270
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,960
- Goddamn it. Come on.
- Where we goin'?

271
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,430
Nearest bar.

272
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,775
- Here are my buddies right now.
- You the police?

273
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,416
<i>- Yeah. Why?
- He got physical with my customers.</i>

274
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,577
<i>When I go to remove him,
he says he's a cop.</i>

275
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,010
<i>I called 20 minutes ago about this guy.</i>

276
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,715
<i>- Good thing I wasn't being robbed.
- Okay, we'll take care of it.</i>

277
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,893
- Stand up now and walk out with us.
- Hey, Vic, listen.

278
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,690
You know how long it's been
since I've had a drink?

279
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,828
- Fifteen seconds?
- Four months in jail.

280
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,830
I want to buy you guys a drink.

281
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,832
- The cops are on their way here.
- Let's buy them a drink too.

282
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,599
- Stop making a scene, you dumbass.
- Oh, no! You!

283
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,902
This could be my last chance here.

284
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,478
It is your last chance. Get up!

285
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,480
Ooh! God...

286
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,913
Oh, geez!
Grab him.

287
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,146
Hey, I can't do this thing.

288
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,157
- Come on.
- I can't do it.

289
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,489
When our backup shows,
you tell 'em we took care of it.

290
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,221
<i>- Hey, who's gonna take care of the tab?
- Go ahead.</i>

291
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,429
Louis, you want a break on this
drug charge, you're gonna help us out.

292
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,935
Denon's my cousin.
I can't dime him out.

293
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,167
<i>- Why not?
- He's my cousin.</i>

294
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,743
It'll screw up Christmas...

295
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,938
<i>and I'm not lettin'some
cracker cop ruin the holidays.</i>

296
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,982
What'd you say to the man?
What'd you say?

297
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,280
Get off of me!
Get off me, man!

298
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,220
Easy, brother.

299
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,223
Dude, there's cameras in here, man.
You gotta watch your shit.

300
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,828
I heard we did things
different around here.

301
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,261
Well, you heard wrong.

302
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,666
Listen, you go along willingly...

303
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,568
or I release you right now and tell your
homo homies you're my snitch bitch.

304
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,638
<i>All right?
You're gonna help us.</i>

305
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,437
It's up to you
how much it has to hurt.

306
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,677
Come on now, Louis.

307
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,286
This boy's just your cousin.

308
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,251
Ain't like he's
your brother or nothin'.

309
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,261
What'd he say?

310
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,161
He's drunk. He wants him
to sober up first.

311
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,699
<i>Oh, no, ese, uh-uh.</i>

312
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,561
<i>- Where's my money?
- We're holding on to it for now.</i>

313
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,036
<i>Why don't you wait until Quazi
does your I.D. makeover?</i>

314
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,471
- What?
- We got the cousin to roll.

315
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,641
<i>Meeting with Denon's
set up for this afternoon.</i>

316
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,910
- Aceveda wants a progress report.
- Okay, tell him we're on the way.

317
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,742
Sting's happening. Let's go.
We gotta get down there.

318
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,649
- Where's Claudette?
- Not sure.

319
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,488
- What are you doing, Dutch?
- Little homework.

320
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,886
How about a little police work
instead of dusting off your résumé?

321
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,395
You, uh, saying I don't need to?

322
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,567
Shooting with casualties
on Penn and Sunset.

323
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,762
<i>- Find Claudette and get down there.
- Yes, sir.</i>

324
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,732
Hey! Where you been?
Been lookin' all over for you.

325
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,636
Nice try.

326
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:08,981
- How's Tavon doing?
- He seems to be trying hard.

327
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,006
<i>Yeah, we all should be
doing that about now.</i>

328
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,249
If you've got a case that you could close,
today would be a good day to do it.

329
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,680
What, are you worried
about keeping your job?

330
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,986
I'm a Latino police captain.

331
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,922
I could find a spot tomorrow
in a dozen cities.

332
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,088
<i>- You're the one who should be worried.
- Well, if we stick together...</i>

333
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,566
neither one of us will have to worry.

334
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:35,298
I'm still willing to honor our deal.
What about you?

335
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,932
Our arrangement's
more important than ever.

336
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,748
Aceveda's definitely screwing us.

337
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,581
- How do you know?
- He's saying all the right things.

338
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,476
Only wants to know about the new guy
and our car thief bust.

339
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,314
<i>- Nothing about Gilroy.
- Well, it must be an epidemic.</i>

340
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,118
The assistant chief of police is on the
run, there's not one single news story.

341
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,897
D.A.'s too embarrassed to put
the word out on the news yet.

342
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,491
We gotta take advantage
of the time while we can.

343
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,497
You track down Coyote Jack yet?

344
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,102
<i>Yeah. He's delivering a shipment
of illegals in about an hour.</i>

345
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,872
Got the drop point from my C.I.
We're good to go.

346
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,604
<i>- You back from the scene?
- Yeah.</i>

347
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,010
- How many casualties?
- Just the one.

348
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,982
Still trying to figure out whether she
was dead before or during the break-in.

349
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,789
- What? This is the shooting on Penn?
- No. I'm working the Jahnes case.

350
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,087
<i>I thought that got knocked down
to a simple B-and-E.</i>

351
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,025
Not by me. If the burglar caused her
heart attack, he killed her.

352
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,653
- The law doesn't see it that way.
- I do.

353
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,164
You were to move on to a priority crime.

354
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,826
<i>- Where's Dutch?
- I don't know.</i>

355
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,735
I guess he's got
his priorities straight.

356
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,738
<i>And you?</i>

357
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,815
I'm finishing what I started.

358
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,309
This is a break-in with no victim.
Move on to a real case.

359
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,222
<i>I am working a real case!</i>

360
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,688
And if you spent more time
letting me and less time stopping me...

361
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,087
maybe these people wouldn't have
to worry about their families...

362
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,323
<i>how they're gonna feed them
because of a bunch of crap...</i>

363
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,556
they know nothing about
and had nothing to do with!

364
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,258
Damn it!

365
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,332
No wonder this precinct's upside down.

366
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,476
<i>Saving these people's jobs
should be your priority.</i>

367
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,413
Damn!

368
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,422
- Are you okay?
- Am I being graded?

369
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,159
Sorry.

370
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:38,152
It's going to be hard to back away
from the things leaked in those notes...

371
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,332
<i>no matter what
my final report says.</i>

372
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,826
<i>- So some of us are gonna be swept away.
- That is the way it looks.</i>

373
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,134
But maybe you can help me point
the broom in the right direction.

374
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,641
Maybe.

375
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,163
<i>- Hola.
- Policía.</i>

376
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:19,671
<i>¡Vamos!
¡Vayanse! ¡Vayanse!</i>

377
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,471
<i>Coyote Jack, looks like you
brought a full load north, huh?</i>

378
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,911
Get out! Now!

379
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,415
<i>- This is I.N.S.?
- No. That's downtown...</i>

380
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,822
about three miles away from here.

381
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,416
- We can drop you off there too.
- Look, those people were hitchhikers.

382
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,360
I picked them up
outside of Oceanside.

383
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,818
We want to hire you to drop
someone back across the border.

384
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,192
<i>What? You want me to smuggle
somebody into Mexico?</i>

385
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,099
<i>Yeah. How much
for something like that?</i>

386
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,932
- I never charged anybody before.
- Come on.

387
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,840
We know the tunnels run both ways.

388
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,967
Now, you can either help us
deliver our package...

389
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,433
or we can deliver you
inside to booking.

390
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,613
I'll get your package
across the border.

391
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,516
I thought you were
at the Penn shooting.

392
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,153
I'd rather be working with my partner.

393
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,452
- Broke easy, huh?
- Caught the guy two blocks away...

394
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,059
.22 still in his belt.

395
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,095
Another win. All we gotta do now
is file the paperwork.

396
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,927
But I came here before I did that.

397
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,902
Congratulations.
Check the kitchen.

398
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,979
- What's up, Louis?
- What's up, guy?

399
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,607
- A'ight.
- This nigga here got a bead, man...

400
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,480
<i>- on a fleet of Expeditions, man.
- A'ight.</i>

401
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,118
Yo, I ain't never seen you before.
Where your hood at?

402
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,626
Detroit, man. Guess that's why
a nigga's into rides, right?

403
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,891
- Who you run with?
- Fourth Street Clown Posse here.

404
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,364
So I hear you're movin' trucks.

405
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>- Yo.
- What condition?</i>

406
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,970
Factory fresh.
Straight outta Motown.

407
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,732
How's it work?

408
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,345
A'ight. My boy's a truck foreman.
He assigns the routes.

409
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,781
Driver of the rig, he gets a small
piece of the action, you know?

410
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,720
A'ight. I'll pay you
10 G's a truck, 11 for leather.

411
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,825
Hell, no. That ain't
what I get in Detroit, man.

412
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,386
- This ain't Detroit, bitch!
- You better back up off me, bitch.

413
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,353
- Are you callin' me a bitch?
- Oh, no.

414
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,931
Hey, yo, kill that, man.

415
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,072
Nah, man, nah.

416
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:37,769
No, this your turf,
so they're your terms, a'ight?

417
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,576
- Damn straight.
- A'ight.

418
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:45,149
Look, just tell me when and where
you want the wheels, and we good.

419
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,549
What do you got?

420
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,951
Well, someone took all her lipstick.

421
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,927
A girl could never
resist free lipstick.

422
00:24:55,962 --> 00:25:00,023
I got three empty bags of cookies
and a half-eaten bag of brown sugar.

423
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,933
- Junkie girl.
- Should I check with Vic...

424
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,458
- see who's running junk on the block?
- I don't need a special team.

425
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,370
I'll do my own police work.

426
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,975
Evening.

427
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,315
Your mama know you're hanging out
in a bad neighborhood?

428
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,909
- Got me a note says it's a'ight.
- What's your name?

429
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,883
- Long John.
- The pirate gangster, huh?

430
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,755
Okay, let's empty your pockets.
Hands up.

431
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,689
We're lookin' for
one of your customers.

432
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,625
Don't got no customers.

433
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,856
And I talk to you,
I ain't got 'em no more.

434
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,060
<i>We're looking for a girl.
Probably bought last night.</i>

435
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,135
Maybe tried to trade
jewelry for rock.

436
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,899
Oh! Didn't think I could
reach that, did you?

437
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,278
Oh, my.

438
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,847
L.J., come on.

439
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,445
<i>- I walk on the rock, right?
- Depends.</i>

440
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,316
This transie, calls herself Mancy.
It was her.

441
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,396
Is Mancy a transie
or a cross-dresser?

442
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:10,056
- Is there a difference?
- Fairly large one.

443
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,430
<i>- Anything?
- No.</i>

444
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,166
No A.P.B., no sheriff's request,
no bench warrants...

445
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,706
no Department of Corrections
notifications.

446
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,573
I'm tellin' you, man.
There is no one lookin' for Gilroy.

447
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,015
- That doesn't make sense.
- Guy cut off his ankle transmitter...

448
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,416
- and bailed eight hours ago.
- Maybe it's a malfunction.

449
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,015
On the same day that Lanie's report
gets leaked to the press? It's unlikely.

450
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,954
Goddamn it.

451
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,419
There's something very wrong.

452
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,765
- I don't buy it.
- You were worried about your job.

453
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,664
You asked for answers.

454
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,602
- Make your own conclusions.
- Look, I know Vic.

455
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,909
He wouldn't do
something like this...

456
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,343
and hang me out to dry for it.
He wouldn't.

457
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,543
He wouldn't.

458
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,647
Sorry to waste your time.

459
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,689
- What's he keep saying?
- He says stop smiling.

460
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,393
- It makes you look gay.
- Just take the picture, monkey.

461
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,333
- You done?
- Yeah.

462
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:29,576
Plane ticket. Plus, we had to take
10,000 out of the 75 for expenses.

463
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:34,114
- Expenses for what?
- Coyote who's gonna give you a ride.

464
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,054
Okay, yeah, sure.

465
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,850
<i>I know you guys don't
want to talk about this...</i>

466
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,425
but the D.A.'s been
asking me about Terry.

467
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:48,225
Just been... I think they're gonna
reopen his shooting.

468
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,765
I didn't tell them how I warned you
Terry was looking to take you down...

469
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,269
but they're still
sniffing around.

470
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:59,172
There's nothing solid tying you
to his dying, right? Is there?

471
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,541
Terry got killed in the line
of duty by a drug dealer.

472
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,244
Come on, Vic. It's just us.
I'm trying to look out for you.

473
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,118
What are you doin'?
You already did...

474
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,269
Goddamn it.

475
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,208
No transmitter.
Just a tape recorder and a mike.

476
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,046
We checked him twice.

477
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,583
That's what the trip
to the bar was about, wasn't it?

478
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,314
<i>- I'm sorry, Vic.
- Son of a bitch. What'd you tell 'em?</i>

479
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,482
- Nothin'!
- What'd you tell 'em?

480
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,028
I don't believe you!
What do they know? What do they know?

481
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,891
Th-They're surveilling me
outside the building!

482
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,464
<i>They're surveilling me.</i>

483
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,431
What?

484
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,596
If anything happens to me,
they're gonna know.

485
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,214
<i>Oh, this is not good. This bastard
has guys following us?</i>

486
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,375
What do you think
they've seen? The bar?

487
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,116
The bank? Quazi?
Coyote Jack?

488
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:18,483
Even if they have,
it doesn't matter.

489
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,487
It doesn't matter.
They can't use any of it against us.

490
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,954
He asked us for our help.
It's entrapment.

491
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,063
The tape. It's the only thing
he can use against us, and we have it.

492
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,965
<i>Know what they have? They have
our asses, is what they have, man.</i>

493
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,777
- We've been harboring a fugitive.
- Not anymore we're not.

494
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,274
You're going to Mexico
just like we planned.

495
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,783
<i>- How am I gonna live?
- On the 75 grand, dipshit.</i>

496
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,487
- Tell you what. Make that 65.
- It's not gonna last me a year.

497
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:51,011
What about the hut,
the rice and the beans?

498
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,651
I wasn't really going.

499
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,420
Oh, you're going, all right.
Get up. Get dressed.

500
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,237
Oh, for Christ's sake.

501
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,969
<i>I didn't want to do it.</i>

502
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,512
<i>They made me.</i>

503
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,778
It took every drink
that I had to do it.

504
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,219
Sorry, Vic.
I'm sorry, man.

505
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,495
Ben, we need you now.

506
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,462
Listen, you pull
yourself together.

507
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,465
We can still all win here.

508
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,070
I'm just gonna need you to lose
the tail on your own now.

509
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,036
- What?
- Just gotta make sure...

510
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,709
that whoever's watching
sees us leaving without him.

511
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,870
<i>We're putting our success
in his hands? Jesus!</i>

512
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,081
<i>Relax!</i>

513
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,608
Ben's done some of his best work
soused, haven't you, Ben?

514
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:58,578
How'd I get here, Vic?
How'd I get here?

515
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,920
<i>Let's just cut our losses
right now and turn him in.</i>

516
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,695
The guy's been nothing
but poison from the start.

517
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,029
- No. He can do this.
- Vic, come on! He's tanked, man!

518
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,457
I'm not depending on this guy,
not for anything.

519
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,968
We send him back to prison.
He starts talking. He makes our lives hell.

520
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,805
He can do it.

521
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,676
He can do it.

522
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,246
<i>- Captain?
- Yeah?</i>

523
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,412
Ben Gilroy skipped bail.

524
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,989
- What?
- How do you know that?

525
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,183
He came over my house, asked me
to help him get out of the country.

526
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,921
- Just now?
- No. This morning.

527
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,655
- Why didn't you bring him in then?
- I...

528
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:47,699
I've known him for 15 years. I was
trying to get him to come in on his own.

529
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,273
He wouldn't.
I want to help the guy...

530
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,272
but I'm not gonna
commit a felony doing it.

531
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,105
Where is he now?

532
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,771
He's still at my apartment. You're gonna have
to send someone to pick him up.

533
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,748
<i>He's drunk. He's crying his eyes out.</i>

534
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,387
<i>I wasn't gonna
bring him in like that.</i>

535
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,754
I'll call it in.

536
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,054
Vic, Denon just called. He wants
to move those cars right now.

537
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:12,931
- Now?
- Yeah.

538
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,125
- Supposed to be tomorrow.
- He changed his mind.

539
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,396
- It's now or never.
- Denon, the stolen car guy?

540
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,805
- Yeah.
- He's major. Go get him.

541
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,831
Okay, round everybody up.
I'll meet you out back.

542
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,178
- Can we talk?
- I'm in a hurry. Later, okay?

543
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,715
All this shit's going down.
People could be losing their jobs...

544
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,714
especially me.

545
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,424
I'm at the top of the list
because of this Armadillo thing.

546
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,187
Look, you shouldn't have
been suspended for that.

547
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,092
<i>It was unfair, okay?</i>

548
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,754
Word is that Armadillo dying
could've been good for you.

549
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,561
- What word is that?
- Look, this is my career, goddamn it.

550
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,067
Took me six and a half years
to get here, and I'm not gonna lose it.

551
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,706
Who's been talking about me?
Claudette?

552
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,106
What happened in that cage?

553
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,679
I don't know. These guys hide things
sometimes. Sometimes cops miss them.

554
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,684
No. You know damn well
I'm not gonna miss something like that.

555
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,583
You had something
to do with this, didn't you?

556
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,391
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

557
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,827
Danny. Jesus Christ,
think about what you're saying.

558
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,365
Jesus Christ,
I know what I'm saying.

559
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,560
Goddamn it, and after all
that I have covered for you...

560
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,164
everything that
I've done for you?

561
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,607
I've never said a word to anybody
about anything, and you pull this on me?

562
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:32,440
Goddamn it, I know what I'm saying.
You stay the hell away from me.

563
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,819
Mancy!
You know where she is?

564
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,592
Where's Mancy?

565
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,810
Mancy.

566
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,244
Good Lord.

567
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,119
Let's get her to a hospital.

568
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,970
He says Gilroy's still in the apartment.
Can your men see him?

569
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,041
Where is the rest
of the surveillance team?

570
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,741
No. Just go in now.
Make sure you get the tape.

571
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,650
Everyone, listen up, please.

572
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,983
<i>Could I have your attention?</i>

573
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,221
I should have said this
12 hours ago.

574
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,031
We're a team.

575
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,761
A family.

576
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,736
And I'm gonna fight like hell...

577
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,967
to save every single job
in this building.

578
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:21,544
In the meantime, let's just
focus on what we do best.

579
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,719
Protect and serve.

580
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,832
Nice speech.

581
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,569
Could be my last.

582
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,179
So you caught the, uh,
B-and-E guy?

583
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:52,047
Yeah. He saw the body,
decided to break in.

584
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,475
He was not the cause
of the heart attack.

585
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,655
At least now you know.
Death was natural.

586
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,453
She had her time.
That's some consolation.

587
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,759
Not really.
She died alone.

588
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,063
<i>We can put you in lockup,
we can talk to a judge...</i>

589
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,694
and have you detained
till that baby is born.

590
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,341
Go ahead. Put me in County.

591
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,707
What? You don't think
there's other ways to do it?

592
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:23,411
<i>Fighting's just the way
you get the most props.</i>

593
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,277
If you don't want the kid, it's okay.
You can give him to somebody else.

594
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,113
Yeah, like who? Antonio?

595
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,022
<i>Did you talk to him?</i>

596
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,517
Yeah, we talked to him.

597
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,860
What'd he say?
Does he want me back?

598
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,901
Does he want to be
the daddy of his son?

599
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,805
<i>Look, we can find a good foster home for
your son. At least give him a chance.</i>

600
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:55,244
<i>You ever try giving away a brown baby?</i>

601
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,746
Come on, now.
Not even his daddy wants him.

602
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,916
<i>- Do you want him?
- I will do everything that I can...</i>

603
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,814
to help you find the best
possible home for your son.

604
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,285
<i>I'll take him.</i>

605
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,985
- What?
- I'll take him.

606
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:20,399
I can make this work.
I want him.

607
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,543
I ain't giving my baby to a white cop.

608
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,977
I'd rather kill him
with my bare hands.

609
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,945
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

610
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,947
<i>Get out!</i>

611
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,157
Vic! Vic!

612
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,924
Told you.

613
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,125
I made it.

614
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,669
How many wine coolers
did it take you to get here?

615
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,040
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes, it is.

616
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:58,235
- You do everything I told you to do?
- Yeah, I'm here, aren't I?

617
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,837
You took the bus, crossed the plaza,
went down to the subway station?

618
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I paid the coyote the $10,000...

619
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,679
and then he gave me this.

620
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,445
You lose the tail?

621
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,716
I know how to lose a tail, Vic.

622
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,988
Good. Everything's in place.

623
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,699
- Time to go.
- Who's this?

624
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,065
<i>Coyote who's taking you
across the border.</i>

625
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,696
- Who was the guy in the subway?
- The hit man you paid $10,000 to...

626
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:33,502
to kill you if I ever call this number
and tell him this code.

627
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,441
You made me pay
my own hit man?

628
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,240
<i>I'll bet you really
need a drink now, don't you?</i>

629
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,351
<i>You ever get caught, come back
on your own, doesn't matter.</i>

630
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,350
You're all done.

631
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,249
Vic, we were friends.

632
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,418
You were the one
who threatened my family.

633
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,793
- It was a bluff!
- This isn't.

634
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:03,568
You had the chance to pull
the trigger on me, and you couldn't.

635
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,605
You're not gonna do this either.

636
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:12,078
Maybe not, but Shane will.

637
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,917
I guess this is good-bye.

638
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,550
It better be.

639
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,165
<i>- Get in.
- Hey, Vic. Vic.</i>

640
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,994
Vic!

641
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,227
<i>I got greedy.</i>

642
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,168
<i>I lost everything.</i>

643
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,404
There's a lesson there, Vic.

644
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,741
Whatever.

645
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,456
I didn't agree to buy no stolen rides,
man. Thought they was on the up and up.

646
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,432
You got time.
Think of a better story.

647
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,466
Our stolen car ringleader?

648
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,831
- Not anymore, sir.
- Good. It's nice to have a win...

649
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,964
on a day like today.

650
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,235
Hey, Tavon.

651
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,675
- These guys treat you okay?
- Yeah.

652
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,579
Good.

653
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,147
Well, looks like
we survived the day.

654
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,188
Yeah, well, we always got tomorrow.

655
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,187
We'll survive tomorrow too.

656
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:32,695
- I wish I had your confidence.
- Yeah, a lot of people do.

657
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,563
- Gilroy's not at Vic's apartment.
- What?

658
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,531
He was there when I left,
lying passed out in a drunken stupor.

659
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,439
<i>Well, he must have sobered up
and walked away.</i>

660
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:43,202
All they found were his clothes
and a tape recorder.

661
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,904
<i>- Tape recorder?
- Unis are sweeping the neighborhood...</i>

662
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,549
but it looks like he's gone.

663
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:54,450
Well, he couldn't have gone far,
not in his condition.

664
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,503
Well, it looks like
I owe Aceveda an apology.

665
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,840
The whole time I'm thinking he's the rat...

666
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,244
<i>- when the real rodent's sitting drunk
at my apartment.
- Jesus.</i>

667
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:22,906
In 24 hours, Gilroy will be
Rio de Janeiro's problem.

668
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,676
- How did Tavon grade out?
- Flying colors, man.

669
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,443
<i>- The guy's got cojones.
- It's not having them...</i>

670
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,715
<i>- it's using them that counts.
- Tavon's cool. He's a hard worker.</i>

671
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,491
A bit of a mean streak,
but under control.

672
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,254
I think we may have
lucked out with this guy.

673
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,522
<i>Don't cream all over this guy
before you see him naked.</i>

674
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,497
He's no Ronnie,
and he's no you or me for that matter.

675
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:42,091
<i>I'm just saying he could open up
some new avenues for us...</i>

676
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,627
<i>you know, being black and all.</i>

677
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,443
Transfer papers all signed.
Just need to call my old commander...

678
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,979
let him know if I'm staying
or if I'm going back.

679
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:05,021
Tell him you're staying
a little longer. Extended trial period.

680
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,159
<i>- You got it.
- Decent start.</i>

681
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:12,856
<i>Just be ready for something a little
more difficult than auto capers.</i>

682
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,194
Can't wait to follow your lead.

683
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,697
Great.

684
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,635
<i>Hey, Danny, you were serious
about keeping that kid, weren't you?</i>

685
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,636
It was a stupid idea.

686
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,706
No, not if you really wanted to.

687
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,641
I didn't, all right?
I just thought I did.

688
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:33,249
<i>Vanessa and I are taking Randall
to dinner, then we're going to church.</i>

689
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,114
- Why don't you join us?
- You trying to convert me now?

690
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,217
<i>No. It's been a long day...</i>

691
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,856
and you don't have to be alone.

692
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,426
I haven't been to church
since I was, like, nine.

693
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,763
- God remembers you.
- Yeah, well, I forgot about him.

694
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,534
<i>I put you on the Strike
Team. I know what you guys do.</i>

695
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,334
<i>We don't take
any crap, if that's what you mean.</i>

696
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,808
<i>Vic, come on.
The law doesn't apply to you.</i>

697
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,606
<i>Look, out there,
it's not what you do.</i>

698
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,049
<i>It's what they think you'll do.</i>

699
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,813
<i>- So the beatings, frame-ups...
- Fairy tales.</i>

700
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,078
The assholes fear you,
they don't cross the line.

701
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,614
Rep's everything on the street.

702
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,423
Aceveda is right.

703
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,428
His unit is clearing cases at a better
rate than anywhere in the city.

704
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,089
You want me to bust up
that squad over crap like this?

705
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,666
There are all kinds of irregularities.

706
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,633
And Aceveda will be the one
to fall on the sword for it.

707
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:31,070
<i>- After the election, he's gone.
- Forget Aceveda.</i>

708
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,301
The Strike Team is at the center
of this shit-storm. Mackey's dirty.

709
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,140
You haven't proven that
to my satisfaction.

710
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,575
<i>I would've had all the evidence...</i>

711
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,513
<i>if someone hadn't stolen
my notes and tipped him off.</i>

712
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,448
That's between you
and the city council.

713
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,223
Turn in your official report.
This is done.

714
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:50,785
Frank, I want to see the budget
allocation numbers by 3:00 and...

715
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,593
You can go, Ms. Kellis.

716
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,133
<i>- What do you got for me, Bill?
- Chief...</i>

717
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,871
- You almost done?
- No.

718
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,240
Logging this report is the only thing
keeping me from going home.

719
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,513
Fascinating.

720
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,349
- What are you doing?
- I'm E-mailing my daughters.

721
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,253
Look, you better figure out
how much you hate me...

722
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,830
and how you're gonna
deal with that...

723
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,126
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

724
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,133
Neither am I.
