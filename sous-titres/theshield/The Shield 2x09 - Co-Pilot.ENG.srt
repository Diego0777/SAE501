1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,499
<i>Store owner says he heard the shots.
He didn't come out to take a look.</i>

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,133
<i>That make him gutless or smart?</i>

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:18,046
<i>- Probably a little of both.
- The D.M.V. says she had a '96
Ford Escort registered to her.</i>

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,312
<i>Where the hell are the tech guys?</i>

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>- A knife fight over on Stanton.
- Hurry up and wait time.</i>

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,057
<i>No, no.
I'm gonna try the gum again.</i>

7
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,725
<i>You'll be back
on the tar in a week.</i>

8
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,963
Thanks for your support.

9
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:47,770
- Christ almighty, my whole life is going by.
- Vic.

10
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,714
Huh. Gilroy's in the house.

11
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,443
Hey. What brings you
to the front line?

12
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,055
A car jacking at 2:00
in the afternoon.

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,627
Yeah, well.
Business as usual on the Farm.

14
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,926
Look, uh, I wanted
to talk to you in person.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,226
The... The command
of this new Strike Team.

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:15,234
- I'm having a hard time
selling you to the chief.
- Oh, balls!

17
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:20,175
I know the area. I know the players.
No one can do this better than me.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,510
The chief's not looking for somebody
better. He's looking for somebody more...

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,187
What? What's the problem?

20
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:28,950
He's worried about all
your run-ins with Plotkin.

21
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,858
- Aw, Plotkin was an asshole.
- He was your superior.

22
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:35,294
Yeah, and I've done my penance
for a year and a half because of him.

23
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,855
- I'm never gonna get another shot?
- Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,442
No. I need to get out
on the street, cleaning it up.

25
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:53,811
I mean,
you gotta talk to the chief again.

26
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,078
- What?
- You can make it happen.

27
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,183
Pull a favor.
Just get me the assignment.

28
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,478
<i>Get me Shane on the Strike Team.</i>

29
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,816
- That's another one with a spotty jacket.
- Shane's a good cop.

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,754
And he works well with me.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,326
You can fill the rest of the team
with whoever you like.

32
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,556
Ben, I need this.

33
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,204
I've only got one marker
to use with the chief.

34
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,037
If it use it, I need results.
I need them quick...

35
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,910
- or we're both out of a job.
- Just give me the chance.

36
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,513
The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.

37
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>- Your own team, wow.
- I just can't blow it.</i>

38
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,411
<i>- You won't.
- A lot of O. T.</i>

39
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,148
It's more money, but
it's less time with you and the kids.

40
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,723
We'll manage.
You have to do this.

41
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,556
- Ben picked you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,560
After looking
for any reason not to.

43
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,064
<i>And he couldn't find one,
so show him.</i>

44
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,335
<i>Whoa!</i>

45
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,322
Can I help you?

46
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,861
I'm Detective Mackey.
I'm running the Strike Team.

47
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,425
We're still interviewing
for that position.

48
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:59,003
I hope not. Assistant
Chief Gilroy told me I start tomorrow.

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,303
<i>I figured I'd settle in early.
Hit the ground running.</i>

50
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,540
Gilroy told you that?

51
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,640
Huh.
I'm Captain David Aceveda.

52
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,714
<i>- You said your name was Mackey, right?
- Yeah.</i>

53
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,986
I read your file.

54
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,528
We have a chance to
do something real special here.

55
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,530
Well, you let me know
how I can help.

56
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,944
I don't care how you did it in the past. But in
this house, we're gonna work together.

57
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,590
Special squads, detectives,
uniformed police officers.

58
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,285
We'll help each other and share
information however and whenever we can.

59
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,521
It's the only way that this
satellite precinct can work.

60
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,193
<i>I'd like to thank the man responsible for our
new jobs, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy.</i>

61
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,035
Thank you, Captain.

62
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,476
You all know this unit
is a trial squad.

63
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,114
An expensive one.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,220
<i>People say it's a waste
of time and tax dollars.</i>

65
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,253
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

66
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,153
Let's prove them wrong.

67
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,030
- Thanks, Big Ben.
- Good luck, Vic.

68
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,106
<i>Come on, Brent.
I remember you.</i>

69
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,871
Sofer, uh, you did your P-2
over at Central, huh?

70
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,975
- Yeah.
- Who sucked you into this hellhole?

71
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,552
I couldn't pass up the long hours
and the low pay.

72
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:54,713
<i>- You ready, boot?
- Yes, Ma'am.</i>

73
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,815
- Don't ever call me "ma'am."
- Yes, sir.

74
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,723
- Just Danny, okay?
- All right, Danny.

75
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,932
I know you two haven't worked
Farmington as much as Shane and I have...

76
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,400
so I want you to get out
on the street, cultivate C.I.s...

77
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,497
- find out who's hating, who's mating.
- Knowledge is power.

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,331
<i>Cool. When do we get started?</i>

79
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,043
Already have. I put a list together
of the neighborhood dickheads.

80
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:19,876
We're gonna make some house calls.
Let them know who's new in town.

81
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,577
This is gonna rock, man.
Thanks for letting me join the band.

82
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,447
- Might have been a mistake.
- Oh, yeah? Who let the guy
with the mustache in?

83
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,650
- The ladies love the 'stache.
- Listen, guys.

84
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,489
Trust isn't something
that happens overnight.

85
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,293
And trust me, where we're going,
we're gonna need it.

86
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,230
<i>Yeah.</i>

87
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,802
<i>Sorry.</i>

88
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,703
We... We have a drive-by,
gang-related, one fatality.

89
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,706
That's you.

90
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,342
- We're on.
- Let's do it.

91
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,017
- What happened?
- Yo, man, they killed Wanda.

92
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,786
They took Jolene off
in an ambulance.

93
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,588
- Polly's shot somewhere.
- Looks like you got off easy.

94
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,095
<i>- Who did it?
- Yo, man, I didn't see him.</i>

95
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,565
<i>- What's your name?
- Ringo.</i>

96
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,536
- Parents didn't like you enough
to name you after John or Paul?
- No, I know Ringo.

97
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,072
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Small-time pimp daddy.</i>

98
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,904
<i>Who'd you piss off?</i>

99
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,504
Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my
girls, mindin' the store. That's all.

100
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,751
I mean in the last
couple of days.

101
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,022
No one.

102
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,559
Someone's trying
to mark their territory.

103
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,634
Who's the lion?

104
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,777
See what you can
drum up out of Ringo.

105
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,211
I know one of the girls
that works for him. Owes me.

106
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,444
- I'll see if she can help.
- Okay.

107
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,086
<i>The classroom's where you learn
the rules, but 70% of the job is instinct.</i>

108
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,817
Morning, Jules. Black tea, please.
You want anything?

109
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,718
Uh, orange juice
and a breakfast burrito.

110
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,591
- I'll take care of that.
- That's okay, man. On the house.

111
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,426
I appreciate that, but I have to pay.
Regulations.

112
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,607
- Five bucks.
- There you go.

113
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,866
Oh, my God.

114
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,201
Vic.

115
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,002
Can I come in?

116
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,007
Sure, yeah.

117
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,817
- You taking care of Brian now?
- He stays with my mom most of the time.

118
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,843
Sometimes she's got this thing
like three, four hours though.

119
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,583
- And then you're alone with him?
- He's fine. I don't fix while I'm watchin' him.

120
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:26,690
<i>One of Ringo's girls was killed today.
Another one got shot.</i>

121
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,366
I heard about Wanda.

122
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,595
<i>She was okay.</i>

123
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,502
Uh, any idea
who might have done it?

124
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,871
Well, you heard it
from somewhere else?

125
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,042
Lionel Phipps or his guys.

126
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,916
<i>- Who is he?
- From the neighborhood.
Got his hands in drugs.</i>

127
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,959
Decided he wanted to get
a piece of our asses.

128
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:57,419
Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax.
Next thing you know...

129
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,560
Stay away from Ringo.

130
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,064
He's a walking target right now.

131
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,067
<i>That's my mom.</i>

132
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,569
<i>Time for me to get to work.</i>

133
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,270
If Lionel is the Lion, then what does
that make you, his wives or his cubs?

134
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,405
Who wants to tell us
about the drive-bys this morning?

135
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,450
- Stop feeling me up, faggot.
- You getting a hard-on, faggot?

136
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,916
Bitch ass!

137
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,420
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

138
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,990
<i>Against the wall!</i>

139
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,820
<i>Up against the wall!</i>

140
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,326
<i>Man, he's the asshole
who started it, man.</i>

141
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,233
<i>There's also about a dozen
citizens watching us, man.</i>

142
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,929
<i>- Just one mistake, that's all it takes.
- Look, he's the cocksucker...</i>

143
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,395
Who just put
himself on our list.

144
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,530
<i>But when the time
is right, understood?</i>

145
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,472
Yeah. I'm sorry.

146
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,339
All right. Let's wrap them up
and take them home.

147
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,949
Get your ass up!

148
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,485
<i>- Wagenbach?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch...</i>

149
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,785
- You're two hours late.
- What?

150
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,431
- At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00.
- You start here at 7:00.

151
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,229
- Yes, sir. I didn't...
- You're lucky there's a desk left.

152
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,565
That's by the kitchen
and the women's restroom.

153
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,001
- Is there anything else?
- There was at 7:00.

154
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,605
<i>Uh, you might as well
make yourself useful.</i>

155
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,745
<i>A rape victim led us back
to the vacant building she was held in.</i>

156
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,016
- Detectives Gannon and Wyms
are headed there now.
- Tom Gannon?

157
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,814
- Do you know him?
- Not personally. Everyone knows
he solved Beachwood Canyon.

158
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,787
- I hear he's great.
- He's punctual.

159
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,426
Managed to loose the ropes, punch out the
window with her bare hands to get out.

160
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,894
There have been
other women here.

161
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,296
<i>Vacant building, quiet street.</i>

162
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,236
Not much chance of witnesses.

163
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,033
Dutch Wagenbach,
Farmington Division.

164
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,096
Over here, we just call it
the Farm. Tom Gannon.

165
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,075
<i>I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher.</i>

166
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,473
- Claudette Wyms.
- Wyms?

167
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,582
- You been on the force long?
- Long enough.

168
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:59,983
- I'm sorry. I just haven't heard of you.
- Why would you?

169
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,152
I like to keep up on my colleagues.
Follow the bigger cases.

170
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,482
<i>- So, Butch...
- Dutch.</i>

171
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,495
<i>We got a Salvadorean illegal,
doesn't speak English...</i>

172
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,963
<i>won't give her name,
her parents, just her story.</i>

173
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,826
<i>- Which is?
- She was kidnapped,
held here by three cholos.</i>

174
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,272
They called somebody for ransom. Threatened
to rape her if they didn't pay.

175
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:24,868
Called back later, family didn't have the money
yet, so they went to town on her.

176
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,746
After they were done, they tied her up,
left. She managed to escape.

177
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,884
First one to roll
on Lionel gets a free pass.

178
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,949
The rest don't.

179
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,217
So who's talking?

180
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,088
You don't think I'm gonna get
Lionel with or without you?

181
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,259
Okay.

182
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,427
I'll be back in an hour.

183
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,869
<i>See who changes his mind.</i>

184
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,072
Screw you!

185
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,046
I don't think we're
looking at typical rapists.

186
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:08,051
Sexual predators are antisocial. They're
driven by inadequacy, not money.

187
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,020
Our three will have rap sheets,
but for violent crimes other than rape.

188
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,126
The sexual assault was a punishment
to them, not a proclivity.

189
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,993
Best desk in the house. Right here
by the kitchen, the men's room.

190
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,032
<i>- We lucked out.
- This isn't an isolated case.</i>

191
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,836
Seems like a lot of illegal immigrants
have been getting snatched up on the Farm.

192
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,566
- Our stats don't show that.
- The families don't report it. They just pay.

193
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:38,048
<i>Several people said I should talk
to someone named Jesus Latigo.</i>

194
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,176
<i>- Who's he?
- Well, I don't know, but I got him coming in.</i>

195
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,050
- Great.
- That's good work, Wyms, but I got you beat.

196
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:49,091
I dug up a witness, says she saw three
guys driving off from the crime scene.

197
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,195
So I'm running a partial plate.

198
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,194
I'll fill in the boss.

199
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,793
So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood,
what made you think the stepbrother?

200
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:03,709
Something just wasn't right about
that kid. His stepsister was all cut up...

201
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:07,839
but he didn't even seem worried about his
mother's safety or his two real sisters.

202
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,878
- You see, he loved them.
- Anyone know what the partner
situation is around here?

203
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:17,555
<i>- Captain's still working on it.
- Maybe we could work together.
I could learn a lot from you.</i>

204
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,084
Yeah. Well...

205
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,286
maybe it'll end up like that.

206
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,500
<i>- When I heard what had happened
to Anabel, I was sick.
- How did you know her family?</i>

207
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,763
<i>- I'm a friend.
- Well, we have to talk to them.</i>

208
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,309
<i>- See what the kidnappers said to them.
- They won't come in.</i>

209
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,240
My clients are illegals.
You know how it is.

210
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,348
- I thought you were a friend of the family.
- I am.

211
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,984
Are they also your clients?
Are you a lawyer?

212
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,154
No, no. I'm just a friend.

213
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,419
<i>Everyone I talked to said that you're the man
to see about dealing with kidnappers.</i>

214
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,188
What does that mean?

215
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,757
I've really said too much.

216
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,399
No, you haven't.

217
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,305
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it. I didn't mean that.

218
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,900
I was told this is the ladies room.
Oh, I guess it is.

219
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,544
Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit.
What are you doing?

220
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,537
Gilroy asked me to do him a favor and bring
a little credibility to this old barn.

221
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,846
Barn. I like that.

222
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,916
<i>- I heard you're running the Strike Team.
- Yeah.</i>

223
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,714
- They're giving me the shot.
- That's good.

224
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:29,293
Plotkin's probably pissing blood just thinking
about it. Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately?

225
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,964
- He's enjoying his retirement.
- I'm looking forward to it myself.

226
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:36,264
<i>These are my guys now. This is,
uh, Curtis, Shane and Ronnie.</i>

227
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,168
- Good, as always.
- Hey.

228
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,764
- What are you working on now?
- Some illegal got gang-banged.

229
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,412
The victim's more concerned
with Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S. status...

230
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,710
than catching the pricks
that spooned her.

231
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,547
- Who are you partnered up with?
- That black girl and some Dutch guy.

232
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,152
- Who?
- Come here.

233
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,118
<i>Come take a look.</i>

234
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,789
I keep hiding his chair on him.

235
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,726
<i>- You're starting already?
- Every house needs a rube.</i>

236
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,096
- And you're anointing this guy?
- Oh, yeah. I got the scoop from Sunset.

237
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,933
His wife was a big boozer, so he puts her
in A.A., thinkin' he's getting her help.

238
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,006
And she ends up getting
shtupped by her sponsor.

239
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,046
And the kicker is she finally tells him
not only is she leaving him...

240
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,648
- she's having this other guy's kid.
- Oh, no, no.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,151
Maybe we should
cut him a break then.

242
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,884
Nah.

243
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:39,760
My guy says that Dutch-boy is just
a big windbag, needs his sails trimmed.

244
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,229
- Doesn't anyone knock?
- This one's Wyms.

245
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

246
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,173
I got someone in interrogation.

247
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,471
<i>- Who?
- Why don't you come upstairs and find out?</i>

248
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,039
Yeah, I'll be right there.

249
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,046
All business. She'll
never last around here.

250
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,489
<i>- This ain't gonna work.
- What do you mean?</i>

251
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,562
There's not enough oxygen
in there for the three of us.

252
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:15,261
- Fletch, you hang back.
We'll tell you how it goes.
- Sure.

253
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,594
Mr. Latigo, this is
my partner, Tom Gannon.

254
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,237
There's just one
cage here, right?

255
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,782
- Uh, excuse me. Where did our prisoners go?
- The captain released them.

256
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,144
<i>- Why?
- Ask him.</i>

257
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,922
<i>- Captain, I have a question.
- Yes?</i>

258
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,119
Well, I was just wondering why you cut my
prisoners loose without checking with me.

259
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,599
I saw the paperwork.
It was a mess.

260
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:52,161
There was no probable cause. The D.A.
wouldn't have taken the case, so I let them go.

261
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,608
Maybe you'll remember this the next time
you turn in such sloppy paperwork.

262
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:00,408
I wasn't looking for a conviction.
I was just sweatin' them.

263
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,043
It's a holding cell,
Detective, not a sauna.

264
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,684
It's reserved for
legitimate, actual arrests.

265
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,982
- They were part of my murder investigation.
- What investigation?

266
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,218
I haven't seen anything of merit. Where
are the suspects? Where are the leads?

267
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,017
You sent them off packing.

268
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,654
Commanding the Strike Team
is a prized position.

269
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,334
<i>We had a lot of candidates
just as qualified, if not more.</i>

270
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,894
<i>So get your act together,
or I'll find someone else.</i>

271
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,634
Are we clear?

272
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,141
Yes, sir.

273
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,384
How's the first day going?

274
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,252
A few bugs,
but I'm working them out.

275
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,319
<i>Anything I should know about?</i>

276
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,155
Your guy Mackey, he's not off
to a very impressive start.

277
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:54,091
<i>- He'll get results.
- Maybe. But I'd like to put
a backup plan in place.</i>

278
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,236
Fill the last open slot
with a guy who could...

279
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,067
run the Strike Team
if Mackey flunked out.

280
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,700
Give the man a chance,
David. It's day one.

281
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,968
I've read his file,
called around.

282
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,012
A lot of people
won't work with him.

283
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,842
It's a crucial slot.
We can do better.

284
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,144
I need this experiment
to be successful.

285
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,950
<i>- So do you.
- Then we need someone who can deliver.</i>

286
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,419
He will.

287
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,389
Come up with some candidates
though, just in case.

288
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,058
I'll pick somebody personally.

289
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,237
No, come up with a few guys,
run them through my office.

290
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,967
- You shouldn't have to be bothered.
- It's too important.

291
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,438
I'm making all personnel
decisions around here.

292
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,742
Just keep an eye on things.
I'll be in touch later.

293
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,484
<i>Hey.</i>

294
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,257
Heard about your spat
with Aceveda.

295
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,795
Aw, we're just getting
used to each other.

296
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,196
No time for
a learning curve, Vic.

297
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,565
The chief gave me
everything I wanted here...

298
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,036
but I had to take on Aceveda.

299
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,510
He's not going anywhere. Now, do you
have leads on this drive-by or not?

300
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,640
Hell, yeah. We think this street thug
named Lionel is behind it.

301
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,712
<i>- Then make your case, and put
the Strike Team on the map.
- We will.</i>

302
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,182
Just might need
a little more time.

303
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:26,553
The chief's not gonna have any patience.
Which means I don't either.

304
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,058
<i>We clear?</i>

305
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,631
<i>The people I've talked to
say you're a ransom broker.</i>

306
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,467
Detaining someone is a heinous crime,
but very lucrative in Latin America.

307
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,202
- Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper.
- I'm a consultant.

308
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,176
The kidnappers demand a ransom.

309
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,884
The families hire me to broker the deal,
get their loved ones back safely.

310
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,479
<i>- And you do this out of
the goodness of your heart?
- I charge a commission.</i>

311
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,854
I have a 100% recovery rate.

312
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,949
<i>- 'Cause your buddies are
the ones doing the kidnapping.
- No.</i>

313
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,061
Because I understand how to negotiate with
these people. The Salvadoreans do not.

314
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,061
<i>Negotiate with what people?</i>

315
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,329
<i>Mexicans. They see the Salvadoreans
as lower class. They target them.</i>

316
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,273
<i>- And what are you?
- Honduran.</i>

317
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,503
So, look, where are
these kidnappers now?

318
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,705
<i>I've never met them.
We arrange a drop.</i>

319
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,804
<i>- How do you contact them?
- They page me to a pay phone.</i>

320
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,780
<i>- Next time they page you, you tell us.
- Look.</i>

321
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,521
I'm successful because the families
and the kidnappers both trust me.

322
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,581
I lead you to these men. All the others
will never work with me again.

323
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,149
<i>If there were no more brokers,
it would be harder to do business...</i>

324
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,061
<i>- and maybe the kidnappings would stop.
- Oh, no.</i>

325
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,067
There'll always be kidnappings. And the
families will hire other brokers who don't care.

326
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,433
Brokers who take
the money and keep it.

327
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,072
And the kidnappers
will kill the victims.

328
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,199
And the broker says,
"That's just the way it goes."

329
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:54,079
<i>Well, I care. I pay the money.
I get people back alive.</i>

330
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,207
<i>Look, are you gonna lead us
to these guys or not?</i>

331
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,641
I can't.

332
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:05,590
- Talk to me.
- We wait a couple of weeks.

333
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,582
<i>We wait till one of Lionel's
guys slips up on some felony.</i>

334
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,258
<i>- And then we flip him.
- We don't have a couple of weeks.</i>

335
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,198
Lem and I spoke
to Narcotics and Vice.

336
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:16,258
<i>They've been trying to make a case against
Lionel for months. They're at a dead end.</i>

337
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,399
- They have nothing for us?
- That's what they said.

338
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,164
God!

339
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,638
We gotta nail him,
like right now.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,848
Okay, so we keep at him.
We hit him long enough and hard
enough, he'll get the message.

341
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,611
<i>You an expert on making
guys long and hard?</i>

342
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,754
<i>Hey, this isn't funny.</i>

343
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:40,191
I mean, it's the goddamn first day,
and the bosses are already talking
about making changes.

344
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,117
<i>Anybody here feel like
going back to their old post?</i>

345
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,093
Huh?

346
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,670
Look, I hate
to say this, but, uh...

347
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,713
I think we need a shortcut.

348
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,780
Like what?

349
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,284
Maybe we need to squeeze a guy
in Lionel's outfit, make him produce
some evidence for us.

350
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,496
That'd speed things up a bit.

351
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,170
<i>Produce as in plant?</i>

352
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:30,039
<i>Hey, we all know that this guy's
an asshole in the first degree.</i>

353
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,303
It's for goddamn sure this isn't
the first body he's responsible for.

354
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,003
- I don't know, man.
- You just hear me out.

355
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,847
A high-profile bust gets us credibility
out on the street and with the bosses.

356
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,948
<i>Once we get our feet on solid ground,
get a couple of wins under our belt...</i>

357
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,592
we go back to doing it
the right way.

358
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,190
<i>Hey, we need this.</i>

359
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,798
Just this once.

360
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,238
Hey, where we goin'?
Ain't no police station this way.

361
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,244
Yeah, well, we a mobile unit.

362
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,017
Why you in such a hurry
to go to jail anyway?

363
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,780
Bringin' me in for
a couple of joints, man?

364
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,320
I ain't doin' time
for no three sticks of chronic.

365
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,619
With your record,
I wouldn't be too sure.

366
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,656
You're gonna help us
build a case against Lionel.

367
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,564
<i>Are you on the pipe?</i>

368
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,727
<i>- You see that?
- We had our own
tagger do some work.</i>

369
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,931
<i>We're the new king of this jungle.</i>

370
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:36,174
<i>- You think paintin'a snake
on the wall makes you top dog?
- Wanna go back for possession?</i>

371
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:39,974
You guys may be the cops,
but Lionel's the law around here.

372
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,878
You gotta bring it a lot heavier
than this to change people's minds.

373
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,015
- I don't think he's gonna cooperate.
- Give it time.

374
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,860
- If he doesn't?
- I'm thinking.

375
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,099
You know what? Screw Rondell.
We'll just try another homie.

376
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:03,329
<i>- Lionel will catch wind of it.
- Can't stake him out.</i>

377
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,499
He's smart.

378
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,607
If we bring him in for piddley shit,
Captain Ass will just kick him.

379
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:12,441
Why don't we get a warrant
based on suspicion of the shooting?
We drop the evidence ourselves.

380
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,540
Lionel will scream "setup." And that's
exactly what it will look like.

381
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,907
<i>- It can't even remotely appear
like we brought the shit in.
- No.</i>

382
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,583
No, we've gotta have
another cop find it.

383
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,948
How about planting
it in his car?

384
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,725
Crib's the best bet.
When's it empty?

385
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,923
<i>It isn't. He's got girls streaming
in and out of there day and night.</i>

386
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,991
We don't need you
to tell us when they call.

387
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,896
<i>- We'll just wait, get the page ourselves.
- No, they use a code.</i>

388
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,640
Without me, the number
won't make any sense.

389
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,142
<i>I tried to interrogate our victim again.
She still won't talk.</i>

390
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,776
They don't trust the police.
That's why they come to me for help.

391
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:53,111
I do this community a service.
It's not just about the money.

392
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,048
<i>I help families pro bono...</i>

393
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,451
Cut the champion
of the people crap.

394
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,491
<i>- So what happened?
- Mayfield Duffy...</i>

395
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,560
pushed a cart full of groceries
out of the store without paying.

396
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,526
When my husband went to
stop him, he got attacked.

397
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,063
- What did he hit you with?
- A bag of ice.

398
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,260
- Go call the paramedics.
- Mayfield is okay.

399
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,702
He just had a bad run.
No work.

400
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,539
<i>- He said he will pay for the stuff later.
- I told him we don't do that.</i>

401
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,674
No money, no groceries.

402
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,239
Look, I don't wanna get
Mayfield in no trouble.

403
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,848
I just want the money
or the groceries back.

404
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,455
Well, sir, he committed a felony.
We're gonna have to arrest him.

405
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,719
Well, then go do it.
He took perishables.

406
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:44,559
<i>- Yeah?
- Step out of the apartment, please.</i>

407
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,902
- You Mayfield Duffy?
- Yeah.

408
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,668
<i>- Step down, please, sir.
- Hands out of your pockets,
sir, and behind your head.</i>

409
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,344
- What's the beef?
- Turn around.

410
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,415
<i>- I told him I'd pay him.
- Before or after you struck him?</i>

411
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,942
- Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard.
- Yeah, he's okay.

412
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:06,120
<i>Second set of cuffs. You know there are
places where you can go for aid, sir.</i>

413
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,657
- I got aid. Then I got robbed.
- Robbed?

414
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,127
I get food stamps twice a month.
That punk gangster in 29...

415
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,960
<i>keeps breaking into the mailbox
and stealing everybody's food stamps.</i>

416
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,192
It will be days before
I can get some more.

417
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,897
Meanwhile, my family's starving.
What am I supposed to do?

418
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,200
Not commit a felony.

419
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,574
<i>- Use this purse.
- It's got a false bottom
and a remote mike inside.</i>

420
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,011
- What's that, coke?
- Crack.

421
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,014
The sentencing is more severe.
Give me your purse.

422
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,685
Come on.

423
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,593
I want you to go inside
Lionel's apartment.

424
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:44,255
<i>You tell him that you're willing
to pay a street tax...</i>

425
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,257
<i>to stay out
working and stay safe.</i>

426
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,195
<i>- I don't even know this guy.
- He knows about you.</i>

427
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,131
You hide the crack in his bathroom,
under the sink or something.

428
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,965
<i>This is the guy who shot up Wanda?
It'll be a pleasure then.</i>

429
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,236
Hey, hey. You're miked.

430
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,106
<i>We can hear everything.</i>

431
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,439
If at any time the mike fails,
we'll be in there, okay?

432
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,446
<i>- Okay.
- Listen.</i>

433
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,780
<i>This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous,
you just say the word "gringo."</i>

434
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,715
Then we come
riding to the rescue.

435
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,254
<i>- Gringo?
- Yeah.</i>

436
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,017
Right.

437
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:20,597
Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry,
you say the word.

438
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,709
<i>- You Happy Sandez?
- Yeah, that's me. What of it?</i>

439
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,777
<i>You the same Happy Sandez that's
been breaking into people's mailboxes...</i>

440
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,941
<i>- stealing their food stamps?
- Food stamps?</i>

441
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,918
<i>- I don't need no ghetto coupons.
- Happy, we got your sheet, man.</i>

442
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,890
<i>You got three priors
for theft and no job.</i>

443
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,484
Why don't you give those people
their food stamps back so they can eat?

444
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,384
I'm missing the game.

445
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,599
I tell you what, Happy.

446
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:58,000
<i>My partner and I are gonna go around
the corner for exactly two minutes.</i>

447
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,064
And when we come back...

448
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,671
either the food stamps you took
are sitting on that bottom step...

449
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,342
<i>or I'm gonna call
some detectives down here...</i>

450
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:06,105
<i>and they're gonna turn
your life upside down.</i>

451
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,603
You got it?

452
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,545
You got two minutes.

453
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,688
<i>Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you.</i>

454
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:20,089
<i>- I don't wanna get shot up.
- Smart thinkin', sweet pea.</i>

455
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,688
- So are we cool then?
- Nah, not quite.

456
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:28,231
<i>See, I like to know what I'm puttin'
on the streets. Come here. Right here.</i>

457
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,368
- He wants to taste the kitty.
- Sure.

458
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:32,666
- Just let me run to the bathroom.
- What for?

459
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,196
<i>To pop in my diaphragm.</i>

460
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,503
<i>No need, baby girl.
I ain't hitting that raw.</i>

461
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,115
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God.

462
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,718
The broker is a pipeline,
but he's decent.

463
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,618
If we talk to him
the right way, he'll talk.

464
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:56,053
That broker is a dead end. I got my witness
coming in. I think she's our best bet.

465
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,296
You know, I got
30 years experience says...

466
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:00,890
if we slap this broker
with obstruction of justice...

467
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,631
he misses one home-cooked meal,
he'll talk.

468
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:13,107
- Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead.
- The witness is here.

469
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,144
- Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming.
- Carry on.

470
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,879
So, uh, hypothetically...

471
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,488
how would you go
after the broker?

472
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,989
The boss wants to do it
Gannon's way.

473
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,993
<i>And he's going his way.
Doesn't mean we can't go ours.</i>

474
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,470
They teach you that
in the classroom?

475
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,912
Goddamn, you're tight.

476
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,816
Oh, God.

477
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,053
- You ain't gonna dis me again, right?
- No, I swear.

478
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,750
Right?

479
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,090
- I'm going in.
- Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo.

480
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,394
- I'm going.
- Hey! We don't have a warrant.

481
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,595
And we're only gonna get
one shot at this. All right?

482
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,232
I don't care.

483
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,207
Hey, god-goddamn it!

484
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,748
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man. Hey.

485
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,111
She's a pro.

486
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,811
This is what
she does for a living.

487
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,219
We gotta make this case, right?

488
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,088
<i>Right?</i>

489
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,668
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here.

490
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,750
Hey, look. We're almost there now,
right? All right?

491
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:21,628
It's in the bathroom,
under the sink.

492
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,671
God.

493
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,435
Vic, I'm okay.

494
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,384
<i>Vic.</i>

495
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,289
I need to score
before you take me home.

496
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,900
- Nice digs, David.
- Nice enough.

497
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,867
You don't sound too excited.

498
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,869
<i>No, I am.</i>

499
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,076
<i>It's just...</i>

500
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,408
Gilroy's stocked the pond
with his own fish.

501
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,036
I'm still figuring out
what waters are safe to swim in.

502
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,880
<i>I could use
a friendly face working here.</i>

503
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,454
Is this gonna be like
the time you tried to get me
to work Narcotics in the Valley?

504
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,081
<i>- It'll be different.
- How?</i>

505
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,885
You'll say yes.

506
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,121
<i>- I'm happy in Robbery.
- This is more money, more action, more fun.</i>

507
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:26,363
- So what's the job?
- Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey.

508
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:35,041
There's a spot on the team.
Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out...

509
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,679
<i>- you'll take his place.
- Run the Strike Team?</i>

510
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,580
Even if he does work out,
it's still a great gig.

511
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,883
Come on. It's a no-lose
situation for you.

512
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,155
Your boy's going down tonight.

513
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,166
The question is
are you going down with him?

514
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,806
Lionel's got drugs in his crib.

515
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:05,435
- Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib.
- I guess he got sloppy.

516
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,173
Makes me wonder.

517
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,705
<i>You ever get sloppy?</i>

518
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,349
<i>You wouldn't.</i>

519
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,351
<i>Aw, shit!</i>

520
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,151
So we busted Rondell here
on possession for distribution.

521
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,954
- He wants to deal now.
- What can you offer us?

522
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,030
<i>- My boss, Lionel.
- We think he did the drive-bys.</i>

523
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,257
<i>I made deliveries to his house.</i>

524
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,892
He's got product there.
You gotta move on him right away though.

525
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,596
<i>- And you're willing to swear
to this in an affidavit?
- Sure.</i>

526
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,764
Whatever it takes.

527
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,880
Detective Vendrell,
let's take his statement.

528
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,948
Call for a warrant.

529
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,149
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

530
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,155
Getting him to roll
on a heavy hitter...

531
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
for a misdemeanor
marijuana charge.

532
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,358
I can't take all the credit.

533
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,499
I don't think he fully grasps the distinction
between felony and misdemeanor.

534
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,626
<i>When that paperwork comes in...</i>

535
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,331
I'd like to go
on that bust with you.

536
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,907
See you in action.

537
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,305
Sure thing.

538
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,577
Your pager just went off.
I know we don't have much time.

539
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,916
<i>- Sorry. I'm bound by tradition.
- This tradition...</i>

540
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,688
<i>- does it always include multiple rape?
- No, that was wrong of them.</i>

541
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:32,023
<i>What if the kidnappers decide
the family owes them money?
They could go after her again.</i>

542
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,959
They probably will.

543
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:38,169
I see how you're being honorable.
You tell me how they're being honorable.

544
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,366
Look, if you helped us though, if you led us
to them, it would be a message to them...

545
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,135
that the brokers are not the only ones
who have to follow by the rules,
so do the kidnappers.

546
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,407
<i>Your community
would understand that.</i>

547
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,741
They could appreciate
the honor in it.

548
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,654
<i>Informant? Yo, who the hell
told you I got drugs?</i>

549
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,416
<i>That's confidential
for security reasons.</i>

550
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,425
<i>- I'm sure you understand.
- Yo, don't play me, dog.</i>

551
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,291
- I've got a right to face my accuser.
- You can mention that at trial.

552
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,728
<i>Hey, yo, man.
Take it easy over there.</i>

553
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,358
<i>Hey, you heard the man.
Respect the property.</i>

554
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,334
<i>Got something.</i>

555
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,238
<i>Whoa. How many years
of experience in this room...</i>

556
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,412
and the goddamn rookie finds
the brick on his first day.

557
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,479
- Let me see that, man.
- Nice.

558
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,480
Yeah, damn straight.
The kid's a natural.

559
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,279
- I taught him everything he knows.
- I'll bet you did.

560
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,524
<i>Yo, that ain't mine, man.
This is a stone-cold setup.</i>

561
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,049
- You put it there.
- Found it under your sink, sir.

562
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,763
<i>- Well, this is a goddamn setup, man.
- Vic, Vic.</i>

563
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,533
- Check this shit out.
- That's a TAC-9.

564
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,865
It's the same kind of gun used
in the drive-by. We plant this too?

565
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,133
Yo, look.
I didn't shoot nobody.

566
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,774
Is that what ballistics
is gonna tell us about that dead hooker?

567
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,208
I didn't think so.

568
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,034
- I have 10 minutes to get there.
- We better hurry.

569
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,643
<i>Just get in the cage.</i>

570
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:30,706
<i>- Good work, Vic. You know,
you really pulled it together.
- Thanks.</i>

571
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:35,013
The chief's happy. He wants another press
conference to trumpet the quick results.

572
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,278
- I'll do most of the talking,
but he wants you there too.
- Sure.

573
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:42,593
<i>Detective. We got a call from our
kidnappers. We set up a drop.</i>

574
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:46,359
You mind getting our backs? The captain
said we could help each other out.

575
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,365
Hey, my day's
just getting started.

576
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,038
<i>Shut up!</i>

577
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,770
Get down. Stop!

578
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,936
Get back here!
Stop, goddamn it!

579
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,982
<i>- Down. Hands behind your back.
- Where do you think you're going?</i>

580
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,846
<i>You got him cuffed?</i>

581
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,314
I said stop!

582
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,228
Goddamn it!

583
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:06,506
<i>All right, we're secure here.</i>

584
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,912
- You all right?
- I got him.

585
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,791
<i>Keep looking.</i>

586
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,101
- Th-That's them.
- Which ones?

587
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,867
Those ones.

588
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,646
Hey, what happened?

589
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,943
Latigo had a change of heart.

590
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,485
- You didn't tell me that.
- It happened quickly.

591
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,952
I've been sitting right here.

592
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,457
<i>- Those our kidnappers?
- Well, uh...</i>

593
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,926
our broker cooperated,
led us to them.

594
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,163
Well done.

595
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,469
Thanks.

596
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:15,474
- You didn't have to do that.
- Credit's overrated.

597
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,955
<i>Tangible results.
Nice goddamn job.</i>

598
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,186
Both of you, really.
I told you he'd deliver.

599
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:32,225
- I just didn't think twice on the first day.
- What did you expect?

600
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,194
The whole team
worked well together.

601
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,994
Some things could have been smoother,
but we'll get there.

602
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,231
<i>I'm sure his public defender
will have some questions.</i>

603
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:47,407
- It's just a few scratches.
- From being dragged through barbed wire.

604
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,477
I told him to stop.

605
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,880
<i>- Bet you next time he listens.
- Come on, fellas.</i>

606
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:59,215
The job's hard enough without tension
between the walls. We should be celebrating.

607
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,858
Yeah.

608
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:15,498
<i>Nathan, you gotta be kidding me.
What am I supposed to do now?</i>

609
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,631
- Use the ladies room.
- Jesus Christ.

610
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:22,940
Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to
it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too.

611
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,646
The obvious thing would
have been to go Gannon's way.

612
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:32,616
Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what
he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it.

613
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,920
Some cases you get an instinct.

614
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,825
- I don't get it.
How come I haven't heard of you?
- It's a mystery.

615
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,930
I was thinking... maybe we could
serve as partners again.

616
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:46,162
- You know, on a permanent basis.
- Wherever I'm needed.

617
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:50,964
So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him
to put us together, you wouldn't mind?

618
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,541
No, I wouldn't mind.

619
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,631
Okay, who took my chair?

620
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,643
<i>Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched.
We're gonna go get a beer.</i>

621
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,770
Start without me.
I gotta take care of something first.

622
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,445
Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them,
and they're cool about what went down.

623
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,920
- Good.
- We got Lionel.

624
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:39,356
- Got us a little breathing room.
- Yeah.

625
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:44,156
- It was easy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

626
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,559
It was a little too easy.

627
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,702
My church conducts monthly food drives
in Farmington to help feed families.

628
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,808
I don't need the gospel.
I need work.

629
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:08,045
<i>My pastor knows a lot of people.
I'll ask him if someone's hiring.</i>

630
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,855
Next time, find some help
before you do something stupid.

631
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,928
Yeah.

632
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:22,058
- What are you doing?
- I'm just letting him know where
his family could get some help.

633
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,494
If you're gonna get emotionally
involved with every collar...

634
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,534
<i>get off the streets
and into social work.</i>

635
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,508
You don't have to tell me
about the streets. I grew up on them.

636
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:33,976
Living in them and working in them
are two different things.

637
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,979
Look, I know I got a lot
to learn about police work.

638
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,876
And you've got your way
that works for you.

639
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,914
But I got a way
I wanna try for me.

640
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,848
Hey. Oh, Jesus.

641
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,683
<i>- I didn't know we're coed.
- Welcome to the experiment.</i>

642
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,893
<i>- I'll be out in a sec.
- All right. Cool.</i>

643
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,351
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
It was a good day today.

644
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,266
Hey, man.
So how was it out there?

645
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,999
Fine.

646
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,541
Yeah. There's nothing
like your first time.

647
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,826
<i>- I didn't think Gilroy
was ever gonna sign off on me.
- Don't take it personally.</i>

648
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,953
- He was just busy.
- Well, I'm glad to be here.

649
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,423
You'll like it.
Oh, the john's still broke.

650
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,962
I'm working on it.

651
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,332
<i>- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready for anything.</i>

652
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,735
Good, 'cause we get
everything down here.

653
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,173
<i>Starting to get a rep out on the street.
Bad guys don't like seeing us.</i>

654
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,335
It's starting to get fun.

655
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:46,517
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

656
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:50,681
<i>- This here is Terry.
He comes to us from Robbery.
- Robbery?</i>

657
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,546
<i>- We love you, pretty boys from Robbery.
- How you doing?</i>
