[Mackey]
Sucks / didn't bring my checkbook.

10
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,434
Laverneous'd pop a vessel, he knew
all these whiteys were scopin' out his ride.

11
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:27,095
[Monica] / put ads
in El Clasificado and the Sentinel...

12
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,105
but apparently only the Times
crowd was interested.

13
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:32,506
[Auctioneer] Who wants to go 31?
Thirty-one? Going.

Okay, now we have
lot number 611.

16
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,282
I did a little show-and-tell
for the city attorney last night.

17
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:45,948
- She sign off on the injunctions?
- [Auctioneer Continues]

18
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:48,116
One-niners are
Antwon Mitchell's foot soldiers.

19
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,286
These injunctions are gonna keep them
off the street pushin' dope.

20
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:53,694
- He's gonna feel the pressure.
- Yeah, he's already feeling it.

21
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:56,266
This is gonna...
jack up the pain.

22
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,892
[Auctioneer]
Sold, $ 17,000. Okay, next item.

23
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:03,531
Lot number 684.
Yamaha motorcycle, minimal damage.

24
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:12,775
Let's make this quick.
We gotta clock in to the boss.

25
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,977
You forget I'm your boss?

26
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,145
- What do you need?
- This address.

27
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:20,691
Chink herone dealer.
Hear a shipment came in last night.

28
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,522
And you don't like competitors.

29
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,597
You know, Bill Gates
has his hit. I got mine.

30
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:29,530
[Army]
Yeah, and bustin'dealers is ours, so sure.

31
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,727
All right, we'll pay a visit...

32
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:35,363
do our part to keep
the, uh, black tar monopoly safe.

33
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:40,308
Plus, I'm gonna need
half his inventory.

34
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,710
We're good on demand, but we're light on
supply 'cause of your intel failure last week.

35
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,615
We give you information. We don't
move product, get hung up in your shit.

36
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,743
Hey.

37
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:52,345
I'll beep you
when we got the stuff.

38
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:56,684
Bitch with a badge
doin' my bidding.

39
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:58,785
It's a wonderful day.

40
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,956
[Laughs]

41
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,369
As you all know, we had
our first auction this morning.

42
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,371
Try to keep your jaws
off the floor.

43
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:11,203
We raised over $900,000.

44
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,402
[Cheering]

45
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,411
Guess taking houses is profitable.

46
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,971
That's money out of the bad guys'hands
and back into the community.

47
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,574
Yeah, and a third comes to us.

48
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:24,416
That's not the only good news.

49
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:28,891
Officers Sofer and Lowe have done
a fantastic job documenting the One-niners.

50
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:32,429
And thanks to their hard work,
we got injunctions.

51
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,229
After we serve these, if you see two
or more One-niners together in Farmington...

52
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:39,997
that's called "congregating in groups,"
and that's jail time.

53
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:42,436
The One-niners
arejust the beginning...

54
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,508
so let's get these served
by the end of the day.

55
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,509
Match the glamour shots
to the injunctions.

56
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,239
If you have any questions,
get in touch with Danny orJulien.

57
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:52,475
- Can't find them, come to me.
- [Monica] Thanks, everyone.

58
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,317
- [Mackey] Any word on the girl?
- I talked to Angie's friends, kids at school.

59
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,785
- [Mackey] Any word on the girl?
- I talked to Angie's friends, kids at school.

60
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,912
No one's seen her, man.
She dropped off the map.

61
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,853
Her mom goes
in the ground tomorrow.

62
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:02,084
This girl checks in with me
once a week. Now nothing.

63
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,024
- Talking about Angie?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,392
You speak to the family
in Georgia?

65
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,091
- [Man] Let's go.
- [Chattering]

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,225
She, um-She hasn't been
back to her apartment.

67
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,498
Didn't pack any bags.

68
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:18,405
What if Antwon Mitchell found out
Angie gave up the cul-de-sac bust?

69
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,603
That would have to come
from here. You ran that.

70
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,078
Is there any chance
that word got out?

71
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,648
None.

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,379
Well, I'm glad to hear I.A.D.
cleared you on the shooting.

73
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,045
Yeah, thanks
for the word you put in.

74
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,884
Your C.O.'s anxious to get you back.

75
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,185
I took personal time the rest
of the week to look for Angie.

76
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,818
- Let me know what you find.
- All right.

77
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,898
- [Man] Sorry about that.
- Come here.

78
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,770
What the hell was that?

79
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,205
Shane is slipping
inside info to Antwon.

80
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:54,142
Angie goes missing the night
we take his distribution center.

81
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:57,339
She fingered, and I'm supposed
to pretend those two things aren't related?

82
00:04:57,448 --> 00:05:01,407
- Shane wouldn't give up a girl.
- He was down for planting
evidence, burning a body.

83
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,851
- We were all part of that.
- He'd have been down for a lot more...

84
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,446
if we hadn't been there
to rein in his shit.

85
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,457
On his own, we got no idea
what he would do.

86
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,550
We're keeping Shane out of trouble.

87
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,686
You makin' noises
to my boss doesn't help.

88
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:15,664
He didn't do this.
I'll look around to make sure of it.

89
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,394
You keep looking for Angie.

90
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:28,206

[Siren Chirps]

95
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,429
Oh, you knuckleheads
make it way too easy!

96
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,559
[Ronnie] Game's over.
Against the fence.

97
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,195
Get against the fence right now!
Move! Move your ass!

98
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,831
- You!
- Face me!

99
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,103
- We were just ballin'.
- Yeah?

100
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,908
Well, from now on, T-Gun, a cop sees you
so much as playin' with your own dicks...

101
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,575
in the same room,
you're going to County.

102
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,676
Oh, this one's for you, Notch.
It's called an injunction.

103
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,655
You're all documented members of
a known criminal organization.

104
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,784
Judge thinks you're
domestic terrorists, ladies.

105
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,419
- I ain't no sheet-head.
- You're just a shithead.

106
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,794
Injunctions are zero tolerance.

107
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,993
That means no associating
with known bangers-

108
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,229
No bangin'with your homies.
No riding together in cars.

109
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,238
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,241
You tryin' to say it's illegal for me
to hang out with my own brother?

111
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:35,210
- He your real brother?
- Yeah, like we came out of the same vagina.

112
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,675
Well, the court says
you're One-niners first.

113
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,377
/ mean, what y'all think?
We bangin'24-7?

114
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,510
It's not up to me.

115
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,121
All right, see who we got.

116
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:49,556
I'll tell the bartender his
One-niner clientele is banned.

117
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,120
All right, police! You know the dance!
You know the dance!

118
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,756
- Buy me a damn drink!
- Let's go.

119
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,801
- You gonna buy me a Hennessy, bitch!
- Break up!

120
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:01,497
- Break it up!
- Look, I'm D.E.A.

121
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,436
- What?
- I'm undercover.

122
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,736
You bust this place,
you're gonna screw it all up.

123
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,607
- Get off me, pig!
- Hold it right there!

124
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,772
- Don't shoot. / got him.
- Get me a Henny and Coke!

125
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,475
- Hold it right there!
- I got him.

126
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:17,611
It's okay. This is the guy that Billings
was looking for on that 211.

127
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,747
All right, come on, asshole.

128
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,348
- [Whimpering]
- Come on.

129
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:26,795
Hospital says that alkie you knocked
around barely has a bruise.

130
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,797
Drunks are like Superballs.

131
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,800
Bounce 'em off the floors,
they never get a scratch.

132
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:33,802
/'ll have to remember that one.

133
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:36,202
Credentials cleared.

134
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,434
Agent Hendricks say
what he was doing at Lucky's?

135
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,908
[Hendricks]
Couldn't tell you if / wanted to.

136
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,945
How long you been
on the One-niners?

137
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,947
A while.

138
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,074
Obviously we're tilling
the same ground.

139
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:51,518
One-niner heroin trade.
Probably Antwon Mitchell too.

140
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,522
I'm just a guy on the street.

141
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:56,320
Say / talk to the guy
in the corner office?

142
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,327
You'd have to be pretty convincing.

143
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,624
Well, give me a name.
I'll work on my sales pitch.

144
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,029
Federal investigations
take precedence.

145
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,694
We say keep away from that bar,
you better do it.

146
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,703
We can help you.

147
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,705
You don't even have working lights.

148
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:13,140
I'm bringing the place into the 21 st century-
rewiring, high-speed Internet.

149
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,303
Meanwhile, here's the low-tech version.

150
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,313
You guys're into the One-niners.
We know everything about 'em-

151
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,406
ink, homies, drug dens.

152
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,713
And the bangers know
that we're plugged into them.

153
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,584
We do the bust for you,
get the heroin off the street.

154
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,714
You get closer
to Antwon Mitchell...

155
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,055
and your agent's cover
isn't compromised.

156
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,391
You're making
a lot of assumptions.

157
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,090
The D.E.A.'s set up
on a One-niner bar.

158
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,394
One-niners are front
and center in the tar trade.

159
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,629
I'm a local, not a moron.

160
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:43,229
Antwon never sees
the light of day again.

161
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,331
I host the party.

162
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:51,679
One-niners have been trading
stolen cars for tar heroin.

163
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,580
Pipeline runs between L.A.
and El Salvador.

164
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,585
[Mackey]
Tar comes from Mexico.

165
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,848
[Agent] /t's grown there.
/mported through El Salvador.

166
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,891
Salvadoran named Spider's
the go-between with the bangers.

167
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,222
Has a garage of stolen Camrys
on Broadway.

168
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:07,320
How did the El Salvadorans get
hooked up with the One-niners?

169
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:10,400
Antwon. Back in Lompoc, he took
advantage of some bad blood.

170
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,470
He made an alliance with the Salvadorans
against the Mexicans.

171
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,199
They're still tight.
You know where he unloads the tar?

172
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,401
Four months, no clue.
Slips us every time we get close.

173
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,705
So we use my people
to bust the garage...

174
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,906
convince Spider to share
where he takes the drugs...

175
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,915
work up the chain from there.

176
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,713
I'll have some unis round up
Spider's family for leverage.

177
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,879
It's a good bet
most of them are illegals.

178
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,958
So we're clear, this is my op.
You screw it up-

179
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:37,755
Wouldn't do that to you.

180
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:40,888
Antwon was some
Iraqi National Guard general...

181
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,990
we'd wait till he was all tucked in bed,
having a real nice dream...

182
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,001
and then cluster-bomb his ass.

183
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,264
Worst thing we could do
is take a straight shot.

184
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,738
Not till we know where
he's keeping that girl's body.

185
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,832
No, we gotta be patient.

186
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:58,214
Captain's got something cookin'
with the D.E.A. Wants us all on it.

187
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,249
Fed bullshit?
No, I think we'll pass.

188
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:03,445
Captain's orders. You wanna skate,
you gotta talk to her yourself.

189
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,852
Hey, Vic, your nanny is here.

190
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:14,724
Cass? Everything okay?
You still feeling sick, kid?

191
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,993
Ay, Mr. Vic.
I'm very sorry.

192
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,934
My girl,
she's having a baby.

193
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,005
- I thought that was next month.
- Baby come early.

194
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,370
- Problems, I think. Do you understand, right?
- Sí. Sí.

195
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,807
- ¿Sí? Thank you.
- It's okay.

196
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,277
Come on, honey.

197
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,780
- [Door Buzzes]
- Go ahead.

198
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,782
- Sorry, Dad.
- /t's okay, sweetie.

199
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,284
/t's not your fault.

200
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,582
- Who's this?
- Cassidy.

201
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,782
She's feeling
a little under the weather.

202
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,791
This is my boss,
Captain Rawling.

203
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,520
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

204
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,927
Why don't you take her home?

205
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,694
- I'll have Shane take the lead on Spider.
- Oh, no, no, no.

206
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:54,032
Uh, I got it covered.
I just have to call my backup sitter.

207
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:57,266
Your dad is very dedicated.

208
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,377
Why you lettin' that bald cracker-ass
run my boys off their corners...

209
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,877
with this injunction shit, huh?

210
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,540
They ain't hardly earnin'.

211
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,140
I can only wrap my arms
around so much.

212
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,743
The injunctions
are comin'from the top.

213
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,789
Maybe a, uh-a brick
of China white will ease the pain.

214
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,416
Fresh from your Asian friends.

215
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,894
/ don't touch the stuff.

216
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:24,058
There's somethin'else. An El Salvadoran
named Spider showed up on the radar.

217
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:26,796
So you got business
with him, shut it down.

218
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:30,704
Cat named Verdice
may show up on the same radar.

219
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:33,174
Make sure you shut that down.

220
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,039
- Yeah.
- Pick up your trash.

221
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,722
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Yeah?

222
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:49,554
- [Shane On Phone] Hey, it's me.
- Where the hell have you been?

223
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,185
- Checkin'out Spider's casita.
- For the last halfhour?

224
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,196
- It takes as long as it takes.
- All right.

225
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,131
Well, Spider drove up
about 10 minutes ago.

226
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,362
- Feel like doin' some work?
- Let's tear down the web then.

227
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,666
Let's go.

228
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,411
- Hey.
- Get down.

229
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,073
- Drop the bag!
- Get down right now! Get down!

230
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,616
- [Army Shouting In Spanish]
- Don't move!

231
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,687
- Clear.
- [Ronnie] Clear.

232
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:22,191
[Mackey] Whoo. Spider's sendin'more
than just cars back to the homeland.

233
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,920
You get a shitload of tar with those.

234
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,589
El Salvador, they got AK's up the ass,
all the guerillas.

235
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:32,032
But handguns? They're like tight pussy-
rare and precious.

236
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:35,867
All right, let's pop the trunks,
see what else we can find.

237
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,737
Here.

238
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,380
Nothin'!

239
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:50,519
Hey!

240
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:56,058
Wetback's got some greenbacks.

241
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,061
Holy shit!

242
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,063
How much you think that is?

243
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,362
Hundred grand. More.

244
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,568
Let's call it in.

245
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:24,052
You know, you have to talk
to me eventually.

246
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:28,022
Victim is Raine Powell. Worked
down the street at Electronics Emporium.

247
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,992
- What's this?
- Just what it looks like.

248
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,160
Wasn't us. Talk to him.

249
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:38,598
I knew you'd want to see where
the body was, so I drew it for you.

250
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,932
Where the body was?
You moved her?

251
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,836
Yeah, the way people come speedin'
through here, she would've been a pancake.

252
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,932
Did it ever occur to you
to redirect traffic?

253
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,409
Hey, I used up
half my kid's chalk.

254
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:52,141
I don't need a "thank you,"
but how about you get up off my ass?

255
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,510
And this is?

256
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:58,144
Oh, / had to move
the pocketbook too.

257
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:05,852
You were a big help
in the community meeting last week.

258
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:07,191
I mean, a real asset.

259
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,857
/ believed in what / was saying.

260
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,764
Well, / hope you still do.

261
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,404
I've heard things.

262
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:19,875
Maybe some of the minority officers here
aren't so thrilled with my policies.

263
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,877
Maybe you're one of them.

264
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,846
Some people feel
like it all sounds good...

265
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,213
but the reality out there
seems a little bit different.

266
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:31,116
We're arresting bad guys,
just like always.

267
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:35,157
The way seizures work,
everyone is guilty until proven innocent.

268
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,025
If we take the wrong car, it's not like
people around here can afford a lawyer.

269
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,393
Well, maybe you can do
something about that.

270
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:45,400
Look into using seizure money
to start a legal fund.

271
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,103
l-I guess so. Sure.

272
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,108
/t's a work in progress.

273
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,576
This policy isn't the usual Band-Aid.

274
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,944
Your guys got a location
on Verdice's drug stash.

275
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:00,083
Grab your partner.
Come with.

276
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,107
Grab your partner.
Come with.

277
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:05,017
Did Raine have any problems
that you know of?

278
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:07,090
Man trouble?
Money trouble?

279
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,126
- No, she was a good girl, you know.
- What about boyfriends?

280
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:13,526
Just Bear. But he
wouldn't have done this.

281
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,292
- So you saw Raine last night?
- / was overseeing a shipment.

282
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,732
She was stuck behind
her computer screen, like always.

283
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,668
Type "A" personality?
Familiar.

284
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:25,435
I told her not to park down here,
but the girl was a stickler for the policy.

285
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:28,841
- The policy?
- The rules say employees
can't park at the store lot.

286
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,312
Raine's the only one
who ever listened.

287
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:35,283
She lives with Cornelius Aimes,
a.k.a. Bear, over on Palmer.

288
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,285
Check it out.

289
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,617
See? You're, uh-
You're talking to me.

290
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:43,853
To the extent necessary
to solve this case, yes.

291
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:48,055
All right, Spider says he dropped off two keys
here last night to a guy named Verdice.

292
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:51,134
Could have dogs and shooters,
so stay awake. Let's go.

293
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:58,831
- They're in position.
- Go when ready.

294
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,839
[Shouts, Grunts]

295
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,051
[Man]
Clear.

296
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:12,053
- Clear?
- Clear.

297
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,919
[Chattering]

298
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,620
Shit.

299
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,191
You sold me on this.

300
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,428
Spider gave us
the right location.

301
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:28,731
This guy Verdice
got lucky, bailed.

302
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,865
Bullshit. Somebody couldn't
keep their mouth shut...

303
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:34,068
which is why we don't work
with people like you.

304
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,873
No one here leaked anything.
We go back to Spider. We find-

305
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,507
I'm not letting you
near my guy again.

306
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:46,220
I need to borrow this asshole.

307
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,655
- All right.
- Come here!

308
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:56,598
You got about 30 seconds
to spill your guts.

309
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,534
How tough are you gonna be when your little
brother's being hacked to pieces with a machete?

310
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,468
I don't got no little brother, eh.

311
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:05,905
Oh, that must be some otherJuan Emilio
I got back at the station.

312
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,876
It's gonna be too bad when they
have to deport him down south.

313
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:13,177
You got a lot of enemies. La Colonia
doesn't get him, the Mexicans will.

314
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,342
Twenty seconds.

315
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:20,254
Tar that comes to me,
I bring it here.

316
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:23,326
Most of it Verdice gets
at the church.

317
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:26,021
- The church?
- Verdice is a believer, man.

318
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,893
Stuff comes in there.
He takes what he needs...

319
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:32,298
keeps the rest safe...
with Jesus.

320
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:36,905
/'m gonna have to scrap
the whole operation, pull my agent.

321
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:39,908
A couple of months,
put in a new face-

322
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,501
Where's my informant?

323
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:46,207
Right here, sir. Thought
he might need to stretch his legs...

324
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,284
before he took his ride.

325
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:56,993
First Angie fell off our radar, and now
this guy clears out like he's been tipped off.

326
00:17:57,094 --> 00:18:00,996
After I give my word I'm not gonna screw
this up. What the hell's going on?

327
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:04,226
Aw, maybe the wrong person
saw us nab Spider...

328
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,234
spread the word.

329
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,703
Doesn't explain Angie's disappearance.
These were both your operations.

330
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,706
Both of them were successes.

331
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:14,368
Verdice and the heroin
are still missing. So is Angie.

332
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:17,038
Lem's out looking for her.
We can still salvage this one.

333
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,240
Spider gave up
his One-niner contact.

334
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,647
Do I want to know
how you managed that?

335
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,243
We brought his family in
for leverage. I used it.

336
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,450
Look, you ask me, they probably just
packed up. Cook houses move all the time.

337
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,295
What did you get from Spider?

338
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:38,357
The El Salvadorans are shipping
their drugs through a church on Avon.

339
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:42,131
Verdice is a member. He has his guys
posin'as good, God-fearin'folk.

340
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,503
- You're kidding me!
- Sounds like Spider sold you a load.

341
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:48,169
He's not risking his family.
It's the real thing.

342
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:50,678
I'll work on a warrant.

343
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:54,148
Let's keep this contained.

344
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:58,950
The three of us, Army, Ronnie.
That's it. Just the people we trust.

345
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,683
All right.

346
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,427
Yeah, that's good.
Here, take this.

347
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,070
[Claudette]
Occurred to me to take that down.

348
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:21,440
I see Vic's humor grows
more sophisticated by the day.

349
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:25,538
Boyfriend wasn't home.
I grabbed Raine's diary.

350
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,948
Seems there were bumps
along the relationship road.

351
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,850
DetectiveJuarez in San Antonio
has got a different angle.

352
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,082
He's been tracking murders
in the L.A. area.

353
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:36,091
'Cause there aren't enough in Texas?

354
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,753
'Cause their suspect relocated
to Farmington a month ago.

355
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,989
Hey, exposed dick.
Thanks for the warning, Dutch-boy.

356
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,158
Kleavon Gardner. Questioned
in four separate homicides.

357
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:49,136
Suspected him on two murders
three days apart.

358
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:52,367
- Then nothing for six months?
- Witnesses placed him at a couple of the
scenes...

359
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:55,502
but detectives in San Antonio
weren't able to make anything stick.

360
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,842
Well, what's the connection
to our body?

361
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:01,008
All the victims are young
black women in public places.

362
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,143
Raine was killed seven blocks
from where Kleavon's sister lives.

363
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,119
Are we gonna be
like this from now on?

364
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:11,423
Juarez tried to warn somebody
in this department a few weeks ago...

365
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,758
that we had a thrill killer
on our hands.

366
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,957
Uh, thrill killers need the juice.
They take chances.

367
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,261
This guy's patient.
He's an opportunity killer.

368
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,928
No wonder San Antonio P.D.
screwed it up.

369
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,937
Get your profiles right, people.

370
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,599
Whatever he is,
I'm going to introduce myself.

371
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,973
Oh, what-
I'm not coming with?

372
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,379
Stick to your true confessions.

373
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,419
[Man]
Looks good.

374
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,285
San Antonio Police
interviewed you 11 times.

375
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,223
They got you killin'
everybody but Osama.

376
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:47,023
What I don't get is why you?
They got no D.N.A. They got no prints.

377
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,621
Any excuse to fry a brother.

378
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,667
- Justice Texas style.
- You said it.

379
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:54,236
He send you after me?

380
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:58,666
Juarez.
Got a real hard-on.

381
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:01,141
Why is that?

382
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:05,078
Might've mentioned he don't know
how to screw his wife too well.

383
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,048
[Chuckles]
Shouldn't have done that...

384
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,210
but he just got me worked up.

385
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
You get angry a lot, Kleavon?

386
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:15,290
Nah, not more than usual.

387
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,519
About how long is this gonna take?

388
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,891
Twelve hours
was the limit in Texas.

389
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:28,568
Where were you last night, Bear,
a little after midnight?

390
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:32,472
Drivin'... around, collectin'
my nighttime thoughts.

391
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:34,476
Nighttime thoughts?
About what?

392
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:37,376
Life shit.
I think better at night.

393
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,972
Found this in Raine's
underwear drawer.

394
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,052
She mentions you.

395
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:45,121
Man, she's gone.
Why do you wanna dig up-

396
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,985
"Dear Diary: This job is just
a steppingstone. I'm going places.

397
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:51,117
But /'m not sure Cornelius
is ready to go with me. '"

398
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,559
Then she talks about you
and a girl named Janelle.

399
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,631
Janelle's just some white chick.

400
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,632
Raine find out about you two?

401
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,135
Man, did you read where she talks about
the collage shit I did for her birthday?

402
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,400
What kinda grown-ass man
does collages and kills his woman?

403
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,442
- You read this?
- Man, I saw her put it away
like a hundred times.

404
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,671
What was I supposed to do, brother?

405
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,180
See, man,
/ knew this shit looked bad.

406
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,216
Where were you last night?

407
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:18,981
AtJanelle's.
But it wasn't like that.

408
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,557
We were in the bed,
but the clothes were on.

409
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,990
It was platonic.

410
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,723
You were sleeping together,
but you weren't sleeping together?

411
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:30,925
Yeah, there you go.

412
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,837
Bless this child, Father...

413
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,909
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

414
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,843
- I say Amen!
- [Congregation] Amen.

415
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,915
[Organ]

416
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:52,211
We thank you, Lord, for bringing
this child- [Continues, Indistinct]

417
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:56,156
- Reverend, I'm Captain Rawling. I need a moment.
- Oh. All right.

418
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,696
Must be some kind of problem,
they sendin' a captain.

419
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,289
Well, we believe
a few of your members...

420
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,131
are using this church
to import illegal drugs.

421
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:10,468
- That's not possible.
- Well, I'm sure it's without your knowledge.

422
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,632
Are these three boys here right now?

423
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:16,234
Muncelle's car is in your lot, and he's
known to hang out with the other two.

424
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:19,406
They were makin' sandwiches in the kitchen
about a half an hour ago.

425
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,417
Those boys volunteer.
Their criminal days are in the past.

426
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,420
They're tagged One-niners. Just being
here together is against the law.

427
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:28,423
I know about those injunctions. You find
'em out on the street, they're all yours.

428
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,584
But this here is a house of the Lord.

429
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:34,755
We have a warrant on the way. We need to
talk to the boys, do a search of the premises.

430
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:38,595
- We'll be very respectful.
- [Sighs]

431
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,863
How do you think
it's going in there?

432
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,098
I'm more worried about
what's going on over there.

433
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,871
/ mean, they snag him
and he gets caught...

434
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:51,139
I don't even wanna hear
what Antwon's gonna say.

435
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:54,614
Damn it. Here he is now.
Verdice is walking right into an arrest.

436
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,151
- Get outta here!
- [Horn Honks]

437
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,248
- Get outta here.
- Shit!

438
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,226
- That's Verdice's ride.
- You think he's coming for a pickup?

439
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:09,162
Not coming for the wine.

440
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:13,099
- [Ronnie] He's runnin
- Asshole's gonna try to split.

441
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,471
Hey, what are you doing?

442
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,738
Army! What the hell
are you doing?

443
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:25,144
Get outta the car!
Get outta the car!

444
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:27,512
[Horn Continues Honking]

445
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:30,711
Come here. You talk, Antwon'll know.
You keep your mouth shut!

446
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,186
- Maybe you'll get out of this alive.
- Hey, man, take it easy.

447
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,917
- Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Hands behind your back.
- What the hell was that?

448
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:39,119
Guy was gonna bail!

449
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,993
Stay out of my church.

450
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,259
[Shane]
Let's go. Get up.

451
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:47,967
Reading the good parts?

452
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,370
Looking for more clues.
/t's a real window into the mind.

453
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:54,568
How are things going with
your Texas chainsaw murderer?

454
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:57,942
He says he's a victim
of the good ol' boys network...

455
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:59,981
but something's off about him.

456
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,643
- Maybe you'll have a take.
- So we're back?

457
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:07,849
No, but I can put up with you long enough
to put someone like this behind bars.

458
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,122
I've been telling my partner
about how you were harassed in Texas.

459
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:19,099
Can we get you something to drink?

460
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,194
So you can stop me from going
to the can when my bladder fills up?

461
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:24,205
- No, thanks.
- [Laughing]

462
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:29,108
So, uh, witnesses spotting you near those
crime scenes was just dumb luck, huh?

463
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:32,477
I just happened by.
No law against that.

464
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:35,449
Why'd you leave
San Antonio, Kleavon?

465
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:37,782
/ just got sick of the Alamo.

466
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:41,618
Kind of feels like
we're wasting our time. His too.

467
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:45,057
Probably got somewhere you need to be.
Job? Girlfriend?

468
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,755
Like we established,
I'm new in town.

469
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:51,231
[Dutch] Must have a lot of free time.
What do you like to do?

470
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:53,302
People watch.

471
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,429
Tell us where you were last night,
and we can end this now.

472
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,906
- Oh, / was home.
- I know, but give us the rundown
of the whole night.

473
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:04,537
So you can go over my statement
50 times tryin' to trip me up? No, thanks.

474
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,241
A woman named Raine Powell
was murdered last night.

475
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,443
Bludgeoned to death.

476
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:12,851
Maybe you, uh, happened by
this crime scene too.

477
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,027
Yeah, I didn't kill her.

478
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,863
He didn't even blink
at those photos.

479
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,299
Classic sociopathic nonreaction.

480
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:29,337
I don't know. He seems pretty confident
we won't come up with something.

481
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:32,704
- He's already gotten away with at least four others.
- What else we got?

482
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:35,437
Raine's diary mentions
some beef with a coworker...

483
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:37,445
a friend she lent
her bingo winnings to.

484
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:39,447
I'll have the unis pick him up.

485
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,848
Have to admit it felt good in there-
the two of us clicking.

486
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:47,551
Dutch. Do you know where Vic is?

487
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:50,285
- No. Why?
- He's got me watching his sick kid.

488
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:53,487
- My shift ended, and the sitter never showed.
- Did you try his cell phone?

489
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,894
- No answer.
- I know the mom. She works in Mission Cross.

490
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,399
Uh, I can call her.

491
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:07,443
- How's she doin'?
- Good. Thanks again.

492
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,977
Um, you know, Vic had a uni
with her the whole time.

493
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,047
It wasn't like he left her
totally alone.

494
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:14,173
I can't believe he didn't call me.

495
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,651
Divorce is tough.
Mine was a while ago.

496
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:20,222
Anyway, thanks again.

497
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,985
- It was really nice of you.
- You're welcome.

498
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:29,860
Listen, um, do you
wanna have dinner sometime?

499
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,059
- Dinner?
- Why not?

500
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:37,873
Three kids, a job,
selling our house.

501
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:40,442
- / don't have time.
- We'll work around your schedule.

502
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:44,502
- I don't know. You work with Vic.
- We barely see each other.

503
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:48,311
I tried it with a cop once.

504
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,478
Vic and I could not be more different.

505
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:57,516
[Sighs]

506
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,528
Reverend, I have a signed search warrant.
You must open the door.

507
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:03,826
This is a house of worship.

508
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,424
There's an easier way to do this.

509
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:09,232
- There are no drugs here!
- Except for the heroin.

510
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,671
Reverend, I have
the legal right to come inside...

511
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,674
use force if I have to.

512
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,676
Neither of us wants that.

513
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,144
Then let the Lord be your judge.

514
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,147
We could pack it up,
come back tonight.

515
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,376
Yeah, and give 'em time
to flush the tar.

516
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:27,013
We already look like assholes. Go in now,
at least we have something to show for it.

517
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,614
- You believe in your intel, right?
- Oh, yeah.

518
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:33,093
Okay, people, let's go.

519
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,494
You know who we're looking for.

520
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,863
Remember that this is a church.
There are civilians inside.

521
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,562
So do your jobs,
but use extra care.

522
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,571
- Who's got the hawk?
- We do.

523
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,573
Good. Four teams.
Two in the front.

524
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:48,041
One in the side.
One in the back. Let's do it.

525
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:52,205
Captain, I'm not
breaking down a church door.

526
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:56,012
Well, just think of it as a drug warehouse,
because that's what it is today.

527
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,314
We shouldn't be going in like this.

528
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,458
Get in the back.
Both of you.

529
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:08,453
What the hell are you doing?
You're knocking us out of this?

530
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:11,397
All right, Reverend,
last chance. Open the door!

531
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,572
Do it.

532
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:22,570
Look upon this child-

533
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,170
[Reverend]
The Lord is the stronghold of my life.

534
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:28,910
Of whom, then,
should / go in dread?

535
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:33,250
When evildoers close in
on me to devour me-

536
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,848
- Hold it, Muncelle!
- My enemies themselves will stumble and fall.

537
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,417
- Don't you move! Don't move!
- Are you all right?

538
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,897
Sofer and Lowe got the other ones
comin'out the back.

539
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,265
[Reverend]
My heart does not fear.

540
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,398
Though wars are waged against me,
even then do / trust.

541
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:55,602
[Church Bells Ringing]

542
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,281
- Any drugs?
- [Julien] Nothin'here.

543
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,647
Just a.38.

544
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,415
We're gonna have to search
the whole church and everyone in it.

545
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:09,514
Just... be gentle.

546
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:26,034
Hey. Hey! All that
fast and furious shit?

547
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,770
You're sendin' smoke signals
to Vic and the captain.

548
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:30,903
What are they gonna do?
Reprimand me?

549
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:33,345
Look, we gotta find
that heroin first...

550
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,940
show him we're not
Antwon's butt buddies.

551
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:41,318
I told you.
It's temporary.

552
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:45,092
- Ow!
- You got something?

553
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,890
Yeah, botulism.
But no residue.

554
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:50,431
K-9 could do this in five minutes.

555
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,433
Yeah, if they'd ever show up.

556
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,402
Hey, just found a receipt
in the good reverend's office.

557
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:58,269
The church candles are imported
from El Salvador.

558
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:03,101
- Okay.
- Yeah.

559
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:29,733
[Reverend]
Heaven help them.

560
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:40,039
- Vic?
- Get these sinners baptized.

561
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,879
- What's up?
- I got the toxies on Angie's mom.

562
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,113
Levels indicate she had
over 500 bucks of heroin in her system.

563
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:49,123
Jesus! Even a frat boy knows
not to shoot that much poison.

564
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:52,786
Yeah, and this was a lifetime junkie who could
barely scrape enough together for a dime bag.

565
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:55,125
Somebody made sure
she copped till she dropped.

566
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:57,631
Well, I'm connecting the dots,
and all I'm seeing...

567
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,133
is a picture of Shane
with Antwon Mitchell.

568
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,466
Did Paula find you?
She was trying to call.

569
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,234
Oh, shit. I had it on
silent for the bust.

570
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:09,072
Something about Detective Wagenbach
taking your daughter to the hospital.

571
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,408
We'll do this later.

572
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:16,978
She was sick. You brought her
to a police station.

573
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:20,112
Carmen dropped a bomb on me. Backup sitter
blew a tire. What was I supposed to do?

574
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:22,123
- You should've called me.
- I had it under control.

575
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,352
Obviously not, otherwise you wouldn't
have dumped her with a uni.

576
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,258
Christ! The first time in seven months
there's been a problem.

577
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,263
Come on, Cass. Let's go.

578
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,266
Maybe / should stay with Mom.

579
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:35,337
She's gotta work, sweetie.
Genine's waiting for us. Let's go.

580
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:37,668
Go with your father.
I'll see you tomorrow.

581
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:42,936
One-time thing. That's it.

582
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,516
You were pretty broken up about
Raine earlier. How are you doing now?

583
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,814
Ah, a bunch of us
from the store set up a shrine.

584
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,787
- Teddy bears, flowers.
- That's nice.

585
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,326
You know, your boss found those
order forms you've been changing.

586
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:06,434
I sold a few DVD players,
a couple of XBoxes on the side.

587
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,799
I was gonna tell you all about it.

588
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,134
Did Raine know
about your enterprise?

589
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,141
- No way.
- Really? /n her diary it says she confronted you.

590
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:18,077
Said she was gonna go
to your manager. / know.

591
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,081
You were gonna tell me all about it.

592
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:24,516
When Raine confronted you,
what happened?

593
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,180
You probably tried
to reason with her.

594
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,351
Look, if it were up to me,
I'd pin this on a real killer...

595
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,860
some asshole
who murders for fun.

596
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:36,796
The problem is,
the unis eyeballed your car...

597
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,890
with what looks to be blood inside.

598
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:41,492
You didn't plan this.
Second-degree murder.

599
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:45,631
You can get out one day,
but we need to know the truth.

600
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,078
I offered her a cut.

601
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,774
But she pulled the moral
high ground shit on you, didn't she?

602
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:58,846
One thing I hate
is a self-righteous bitch.

603
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,514
[Dutch]
Tell me about it.

604
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:05,526
You did what you had to do.
She left you no choice.

605
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:16,027
So much for San Antonio
eating our dust.

606
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,936
- He's innocent.
- Of murdering Raine.

607
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:23,410
Guy's still a stone-cold killer,
and he just pitched a tent in our backyard.

608
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:25,980
Got a suspect and no victim.
That's new.

609
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:28,880
This is when it bites
we don't live in a dictatorship.

610
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,384
Put the guy in a hole
and forget about him.

611
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,081
There's an impulse
I can understand.

612
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,183
We can't turn Kleavon over to S./.S.
until he commits a crime in L.A.

613
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:41,161
You know, I thought I hated
being on the D.A.'s shit list...

614
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:44,630
but this is actually worse.

615
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:48,101
l-I can't believe
you're still freezing me out.

616
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:52,706
I can't believe you sold me out.

617
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,475
Officer Lowe.

618
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:08,216
I think you should stick
to desk duty the next few days.

619
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:11,191
See if you could find your way
into what we're doing here.

620
00:35:11,293 --> 00:35:14,729
/f not, / understand.

621
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,663
But you should consider
putting in for a transfer.

622
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:32,437
I wasn't gonna
break into a church.

623
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,573
There was heroin
in the holy candles.

624
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,583
This time.

625
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:40,922
[Mackey] Altar boys pin you
as the head honcho.

626
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:46,393
We can't make a deal, you're eatin'
roadkill goulash over at Lompoc.

627
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:48,395
[Scoffs]
Where my spoon then?

628
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:51,955
/f you wanna be a barrio martyr,
that's fine with me.

629
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,934
But why not serve up
Antwon instead?

630
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,301
Antwon who?

631
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:03,771
We can put you into relocation.
Keep you safe.

632
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:07,544
[Lowers Voice]
Lone Ranger and Tonto...

633
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,619
they hauled your ass outta that car,
what did they say to you?

634
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:16,488
They told me get out the car
and put my hands on my head.

635
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,823
And that's the last I'm sayin'.

636
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:28,202
Dutch-boy! Hero of the hour.

637
00:36:28,304 --> 00:36:30,397
Your daughter was sick.
She wanted her mother.

638
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:34,670
You can't take a joke, so you make me
look like a prick in front of my ex.

639
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:38,543
I'm sure your ex doesn't need any help
from me seeing what kind of prick you are.

640
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:41,172
I just saw Angie's mother's tox report.
Lem have any news on Angie?

641
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,683
- I don't know.
- Well, find him.

642
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,550
/ wanna hear what he's got.

643
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:56,629
[Antwon] Used to be bad cops
was good business.

644
00:36:56,732 --> 00:37:00,600
But now I got a stash gone, a whole crew
locked up and sellers who can't sell.

645
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:03,570
You wanna tell me how the world
got turned upside down on your watch?

646
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:07,836
Seein' as how you were misusing a house
of the Lord, I'd say divine intervention.

647
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,773
He must really hate you.

648
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,042
Only reason
he talk to me like that-

649
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,117
'cause he wants to see
y'all dead or in jail.

650
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:18,277
Vic Mackey wants you gone.

651
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,378
We're the only thing
standing in his way.

652
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,548
You think I need your ass?
You're wrong!

653
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,717
You think you don't?
You're wrong!

654
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,660
Protecting you is a full-time gig.
Plus overtime.

655
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,856
So you can either tell me
what you're into...

656
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,956
or I can keep chasin' Vic's tail.

657
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,228
Some days we'll catch it.
Some days we won't.

658
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,806
I'll think about it.

659
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:42,709
Yeah, you do that.

660
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,981
[Army] Antwon's gonna drop
the body. You know it.

661
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,678
- He's not that stupid.
- Him being stupid's not what I'm worried about.

662
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:55,951
I didn't hear you complainin' about my
leadership skills when I was gettin' you blown.

663
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:58,356
This isn't doin' favors
to get intel on bad guys.

664
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,157
You got me takin' it up the ass from Antwon
Mitchell, ramming cars to keep us out of prison.

665
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,357
I've dealt with guys
like this before.

666
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,434
You or Mackey?

667
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,368
Do you even have a clue
how we're getting out of this?

668
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,371
Look, I'm getting us close.

669
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:14,931
This guy thinks he can kill
this little girl right in front of us?

670
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,945
We're gonna find that little girl.

671
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,675
We're gonna give her a proper burial.

672
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:24,844
And when the time is right, we're gonna
shove a stick of dynamite up his ass.

673
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,089
[Monica] Dr. Alvin Bernard's
clinic has been providing...

674
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:37,461
free prenatal care to Farmington's
poor for 21 years...

675
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:41,798
which is why I'm so pleased now
to give you this check for $10,000.

676
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:44,771
[Man]
/s that money from seizures?

677
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:47,000
Part of my promise to give
a third of what we get...

678
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,839
from asset forfeitures
back to the community.

679
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:53,437
How does that community feel
about your decision to invade a church?

680
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:55,983
I wouldn't characterize it
quite that way.

681
00:38:56,085 --> 00:39:00,146
We found 12 kilos of tar heroin inside
there. /'d say they're pretty damn happy.

682
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,086
- Any plans to seize the church?
- No.

683
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:04,091
/s the reverend under arrest?

684
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:06,684
The only people under arrest
are known drug dealers...

685
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,195
with affiliations
to Farmington One-niners.

686
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:11,823
So you'd interrupt another baptism
to put away a gang member?

687
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,027
I'd interrupt
my grandmother's funeral...

688
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:18,038
if it meant taking dangerous narcotics
off the streets our children walk on.

689
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,040
But don't tell that to my grandma...

690
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:23,373
'cause she's still full
of piss and vinegar in Tarzana.

691
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:29,243
Reporters were tough today.

692
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,911
We keep storming churches,
they're gonna get tougher.

693
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,080
- You were all for it earlier.
- I was.

694
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:37,647
I am. It's just this thing
is too good to blow on-

695
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,285
Hoda Stubbs was killed.
Angie too, I'm guessing.

696
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,728
I plan on finding
the asshole who did it.

697
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:45,823
When you do, ask about the leak
at the warehouse today.

698
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:49,836
We don't know there was a leak, and even
if there was, we don't know they're related.

699
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:53,066
- Could be accidental.
- Stop bullshitting me.

700
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,905
You vouched for Shane.
What about Army?

701
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:58,036
He seems like a good kid.
I don't think-

702
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:01,048
/ don't care what you think.
What do you know?

703
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,517
Is there some reason you don't
want to dig deeper on this?

704
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,147
I'm not about witch hunts.
I've been on the other side of a few.

705
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:10,157
I chose you for this job...

706
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,750
because I needed somebody
as hungry as me to make it work.

707
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:15,056
And I'm gettin' it done.
Why are you riding me?

708
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,359
Because shit is falling
through the cracks.

709
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:20,264
Pressure on the seizure program
is only gonna get more intense.

710
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:23,099
And when it does, that shit
is gonna rise straight to the surface.

711
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:28,006
/f you can't withstand scrutiny-
about anything-

712
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,601
I need you to step aside.

713
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:37,013
I don't step aside.
I step up.

714
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,884
Which is the other reason
I chose you.

715
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,356
Find the leak.

716
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:52,656
- That's some cold-ass shit.
- You can't tell the Iraqi insurgents...

717
00:40:52,768 --> 00:40:55,430
- from the plain old Iraqi idiots.
- Yeah, and no difference here.

718
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,199
- Somebody gets in the way, we keep rollin'.
- Oh, man.

719
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:00,798
I'm just sayin', maybe that's the way
we gotta look at things.

720
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:03,377
- What's up?
- You son of a bitch. What did you do?

721
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,413
- She was 14!
- What the hell's your problem, man?

722
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:08,449
You bring Angie to
Antwon Mitchell yourself? Huh?

723
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,280
Hand her over with a goddamn bow?
Or just tell 'em where to find her?

724
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,648
- No.
- No?

725
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:15,087
- Where is she then?
- Back off! Just back off!

726
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,126
- I got it, okay?
- Where is she then, Shane?

727
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:24,860
- Where is Angie?
- What are you asking me for, man?

728
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:27,561
- You tellin' me you're not
in bed with Antwon Mitchell?
- What?

729
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:31,196
- You told him Angie gave up
that cul-de-sac bust!
- No! I would never do that.

730
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:34,298
What happened to her, Shane?
What happened to her then?

731
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,105
- l-I don't know.
- She was 14.

732
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:39,203
She just wanted
to get her mom clean.

733
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:42,215
- You tell me what you did!
- Nothing! Nothing!

734
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:45,013
Look, you know that I would never-

735
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,020
You know I would never hurt a kid.

736
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:49,181
I got one of my own now, man.

737
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,158
Yeah, I know you.
I know you're lyin'.

738
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,834
I didn't kill that girl.

739
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,531
And I didn't give
her name up to Antwon.

740
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,040
So you just stay out of my face.

741
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:10,675
I lose that one percent
of doubt I got...

742
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,747
we'll be mixing it up again.

743
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,255
Captain says she wants
to hear your opinion...

744
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:29,489
but only hers is right.

745
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:31,964
Agendas have a way
of creating tunnel vision.

746
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,967
She said I could put in for a transfer.

747
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:36,367
Sure. Stock the pond
with true believers.

748
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,372
Make implied threats
to get rid of the ones who aren't.

749
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,567
You don't think I should leave?

750
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:44,237
I think if you wanted to,
you wouldn't have called me.

751
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:50,417
I grew up in Farmington.
I don't want to see it torn more apart.

752
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,511
What is it you want me to do, Julien?

753
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:56,250
You've got power.

754
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,451
Help us to stop her.

755
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,052
Going after a police captain
is no walk in the park.

756
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,223
I should know.

757
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,793
There are other officers
of color that agree with me.

758
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:12,840
- We wouldn't be alone.
- / remember the last time
you and / went down this path.

759
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:17,037
Things got messy, and you
left me twisting in the wind.

760
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:20,012
Not this time.

761
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:22,413
Vic Mackey- He's got
a lot invested in this policy.

762
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,918
He'll come after you.
Could dredge up the past.

763
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,256
/ can handle it.
/ am a different man now.

764
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:29,451
/ can handle it.
/ am a different man now.

765
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:40,329
[Ronnie] Russian taxi king's expanded his
realm. Added three more cabs to the fleet.

766
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:44,496
Alex the Conqueror. How many
cabs you got wired so far?

767
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:48,474
Even dozen. Even managed
to get one in his personal ride.

768
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,909
Sweet.

769
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:53,243
[Curtis]
Yeah? What do you want?

770
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:55,908
What the hell do you think
you're doin' goin' after Shane?

771
00:43:56,018 --> 00:43:57,918
He ran right back
and told you, huh?

772
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,217
You got suspicions, fine. We all agreed
we'd keep 'em to ourselves.

773
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:04,952
There's a 14-year-old girl rotting out there
someplace. Are you in on that too?

774
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,722
- What?
- You keep sayin' you gotta keep Shane close.

775
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,162
Well, maybe you gotta keep me far away
because you're back to business as usual...

776
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,200
ridin' in Mitchell's pocket with Shane.

777
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:16,271
I wanna bring down Antwon
and find that girl as much as you do.

778
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:20,398
Really? Prove it. Let me back in.

779
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:32,620
It's complicated.
You gotta do things my way.

780
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:36,589
Oh, you mean I agree
to protect Shane, like always?

781
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:39,593
Right? Right?

782
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:46,127
We added another car
to the garage sting.

783
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,431
Shane didn't tell me
you came after him.

784
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:51,529
I saw it.

785
00:44:55,711 --> 00:45:00,239
Jesus Christ.
Lem's one crazy-ass white boy.

786
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:02,579
You really used to be tight?

787
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:05,919
[Shane]
Yeah.

788
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,715
A lifetime ago.

789
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,628
What does he know about us?

790
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,962
Nothing. He's just guessing.
He can't prove anything.

791
00:45:19,067 --> 00:45:21,331
I'll handle him.

792
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,173
Look, you're just
gonna have to trust me.

793
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:29,368
I'm gonna handle all this shit.

794
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,885
It's not about protecting
Shane anymore.

795
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,389
It's about stopping him.

796
