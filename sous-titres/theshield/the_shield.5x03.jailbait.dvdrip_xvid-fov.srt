Detective Terry Crowley.
Remember him?

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,664
<i>Two and a half years ago,</i>
<i>he was on your Strike Team.</i>

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,107
<i>He was undercover.</i>
<i>Part of a federal investigation.</i>

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,372
<i>He was your teammate.</i>
<i>He was a threat.</i>

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,278
<i>So he had to die.</i>

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,113
We killed a cop.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,120
Get over it
and don't bring it up again.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,454
You didn't know, did you?
Vic never told you.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,962
- Vic did not kill Terry.
- So prove it. Wear a wire.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,397
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, man. We need to talk.</i>

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,435
Don't you lie to me.
Don't lie to me.

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,197
- What are you doin'? Stop!
- [Radio Static]

14
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,795
- I need sound.
- I.A.D. Has me wired, all right?

15
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,239
<i>- What?</i>
- I just disconnected it.
They're watching us right now.

16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,541
They busted me with some heroin,
and they're talking prison if I don't do this.

17
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,241
- Why is it even a question?
- Because I think you're lying to me.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,978
You look me in the eye
and tell me the truth about Terry.

19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:57,716
- Don't buy into their bullshit.
- Then you look me in the eye,
you tell me the truth.

20
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,658
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,653
<i>[Kavanaugh]</i>
<i>What happened to your mike last night?</i>

22
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,959
It got disconnected
in the fight.

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,400
<i>- How much you get?</i>
<i>- Nothing-after you two started to mix it up.</i>

24
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,063
<i>You want to fill me in?</i>

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,576
Yeah. Well, I asked him about Terry, and he
still says it was the drug dealer who shot him.

26
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,611
How'd it get physical
with Vic?

27
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,272
<i>Guys like him, they just don't come out</i>
<i>and tell you shit.</i>

28
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,079
<i>I had to make it personal</i>
<i>to get the truth.</i>

29
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,746
<i>I can't believe I was stupid enough</i>
<i>to let you in my head.</i>

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:32,086
<i>Make me think Vic had something to do</i>
<i>with Terry dying.</i>

31
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,858
- Lift up your shirt.
<i>- Nah. You know what?</i>

32
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,695
- I'm done with that.
- Done?

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,429
<i>Let's just put a pin</i>
<i>in Terry for a minute, okay?</i>

34
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,836
I still need to get a sense
of what your team's into.

35
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,136
<i>And I got a 15-year sentence</i>
<i>hanging over your head.</i>

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,202
So, please.
Lift up your shirt.

37
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,276
And let's avoid any technical
malfunctions this time. All right?

38
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,547
<i>Yeah.</i>

39
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,316
- All right? Okay.
<i>- Got you.</i>

40
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,926
<i>Hold on, buddy. Yeah?</i>

41
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,893
Hey, what is it?

42
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,625
- When we're alone, man.
- Baby?

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,633
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Can you take him?

44
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,794
- Hey, guys.
<i>- There she is. Here's Mama.</i>

45
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,395
<i>- Come here, cutie.</i>
<i>- Gonna be just a second.</i>

46
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,907
- Okay.
- I love you.

47
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,477
Yeah? What's up?

48
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,138
Lem got picked up
by I.A.D.

49
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,375
- For what?
- They nabbed him for heroin.

50
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,646
Heroin?
We haven't busted any heroin in a while.

51
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,484
What's Lem doing with horse? He's not using.
He's running something on the side?

52
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,387
He wouldn't do anything
without telling us.

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,756
What, like burn
the money train cash?

54
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,386
I.A.D.'s got him
wearing a wire.

55
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,024
So they're
coming after us.

56
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,103
<i>We planted a gun on Doomsday</i>
<i>and dropped him off in Mexico yesterday.</i>

57
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,264
Lem wasn't even there. He was covering us
the whole time, we didn't have a clue.

58
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,434
- What do you think they're looking at us for?
- How long has this been going on?

59
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,012
I don't know. But right now we gotta
stay focused on Lem.

60
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,173
Figure out exactly what they've got on him
and how to get him out of it.

61
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,251
How we gonna do that
if he's wired?

62
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,419
Grab your laptop, sweep the clubhouse
for bugs and meet us there in a few.

63
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,550
Hey. Let's keep
our regular routine.

64
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,028
I.A.D. Gets a whiff that Lem
tipped us, it's over for him.

65
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,340
Lem asked me about
Terry last night.

66
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,467
- On tape?
- He pulled the mike out first.

67
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,274
- Well, what did you tell him?
- Nothing.

68
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,211
But he knows.

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,245
So what are
we gonna do?

70
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,017
Lem needs help right now.
We just got to back him up.

71
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,490
We'll explain everything to him
once he's out of trouble.

72
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,553
First downtown ask us for our records on Terry,
now Lem. You think he told 'em somethin'?

73
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,224
- He's got nothing to tell.
- But that's what I.A.D.'s coming after us for.

74
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,327
You and I were the only two people in that
room. Nothing that Lem or I.A.D. Can do...

75
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,406
can ever change that simple fact.

76
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,234
Just gotta stick together.

77
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,804
First one in.
Came to put the java on, when I found 'em.

78
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,407
- What time was that?
- Let the detectives handle the interviews.

79
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,782
We just need to preserve
the crime scene.

80
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,894
<i>What do you think? Heart attack,</i>
<i>then she got crushed underneath him?</i>

81
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,431
<i>Talk about</i>
<i>coitus interruptus.</i>

82
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,463
<i>What?</i>

83
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,867
- [Whimpers]
<i>- [Tina Gasps]</i>

84
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,371
<i>- She's alive.</i>
<i>- [Tina] Jesus.</i>

85
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,408
Give me a hand.
[Grunts]

86
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,101
- Jesus.
<i>- She looked dead.</i>

87

00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,022
<i>- You got no sense ofhumor, asshole.</i>
- It's just not that funny.

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,058
- It's not that funny.
- Tell me this isn't, uh-

92
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,286
<i>- Oh, for God's sake.</i>
<i>- Isn't hysterical.</i>

93
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,295
<i>- Don't tell it again.</i>
- What?

94
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,195
You got three explorers
in the Congo, right?

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,234
They get captured by natives.

96
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,634
<i>Natives tie up the three whiteys.</i>
<i>They bind and gag 'em, right?</i>

97
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,969
Chief walks up to the first explorer
and he says, uh...

98
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,977
<i>"You have two choices.</i>
<i>You can choose death or chi-chi. "</i>

99
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,070
<i>- [Curtis] Okay.</i>
- First explorer didn't want to die, right?

100
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,140
He says, "I'll take chi-chi." Twelve men
grab him, rape him, sodomize him for hours.

"You have two choices.
You can choose death or chi-chi."

105

<i>The second explorer</i>

<i>The chief goes up</i>
<i>to the last explorer, right?</i>

Possible sex crime.

Can you give that to somebody

<i>- Congratulations.</i>

133

I'll get the car.

134
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,980
Find out everything we can about
this Kavanaugh guy sweatin' Lem.

135
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,353
Yeah, what about the heroin
they got him on?

136
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,358
Could be chum
to set us in motion.

137
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,156
No, let's get a bead on this guy
before we take his bait.

138
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,754
Okay.

139
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,026
<i>[Julien] We found him on top</i>
<i>of an unknown female.</i>

<i>Guy's got a truck outside.</i>
<i>He let himself in.</i>

<i>Poppers.</i>
<i>Intensifies the orgasm.</i>

143
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,706
Guess he popped more

144
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,838
Run it.

145
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,314
The shop owner called it in.

146
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,318
<i>- [Mackey] You know this guy?</i>
- Never seen him before.

147
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,980
Really? Then why does he have keys
to your place?

148
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:45,521
It's a teamster shop.
Hey, Shane, call the local 629.

149
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,691
Tell 'em Rick here is taking
hard-earned cash out of their pockets...

150
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,996
and feeding it
to the nonunion wetbacks.

151
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,468
Rodrigo's a part-time driver.
He never made trouble before.

152
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,806
The union wages
are killing my bottom line.

153
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,471
I see the scabs
are working out nicely for you.

154
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,675
- Where's his rig parked?
- Over there.

155
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,644
You know what?
Check the cab for a purse. We need an I.D.

156
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,599
Check 'em.

157
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,765

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,314
Hey, guys?

160
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,849
<i>- Let me see that crowbar.</i>
- Here, man.

161
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,586
Here we go.

162
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,723
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

163
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,417
[Grunts]

164
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,027
- [Curtis] Shit.
- Aw, Geez.

165
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,292
<i>- Get this off!</i>
- Watch out!

166
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,530
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

167
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,839
They gone?

168
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,207
Yeah.
All three of them.

169
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,041
<i>##[Rock]</i>

<i>##[Ends]</i>

172
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,390
The guy covered up the air vents
with electric tape to keep 'em quiet.

173
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,223
Shithead
suffocated them all.

174
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,819
No I.D.'s on any of'em.

175
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,957
<i>Rodrigo did a nickel in Chino</i>
<i>for assault and rape a few years back.</i>

176
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,592
And you saw
the <i>Los Perdidos</i> ink.

177
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,297
They must have expanded
from drugs to skin trafficking.

178
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,398
Address on the license is old,
but his P.O. Gave me a new one.

179
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,510
Why don't we file for a warrant?
Gotta check out his crib, see what's there.

180
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,244
Lem and I will hit Mission Cross,
see what we can get from the victim.

181
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,190
- How she doing?
- She's sedated and severely
dehydrated, but she'll live.

182
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,784
- Any signs of sexual assault?
- There's multiple tears. It's pretty bad.

183
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,662
Tox report shows
Rohypnol in her blood.

184
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,631
- She give you a name?
- Magdalena.

185
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:08,196
Says that a "federale" in Mexico sold her and
her little brother to Mexican gangbangers.

186
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,367
<i>She's not too big on cops.</i>

187
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,536
I told her you were two
of the good guys.

188
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,715
<i>[Mackey] We found three girls</i>
<i>in the truck. We didn't find your brother.</i>

189
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,548
It's okay to talk to them.

190
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,721
They drop him off
just before we stop.

191
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,728
<i>I heard a man take him.</i>

192
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,958
<i>About 10 minutes later,</i>
<i>we stopped again.</i>

193
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:38,435
That's when the driver
took me inside.

194
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,903
Forced me.

195
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,966
Then he just died.

196
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,880
Is there anything you can tell us
about the men who sold you?

197
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,882
<i>Or who you were</i>
<i>supposed to go to?</i>

198
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,509
They tell us nothing.

199
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,264
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>My brother, Pablo.</i>

200
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,272
<i>Please find him.</i>

201
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,402
We're gonna do
everything we can.

202
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,892
<i>[Danny] Excuse me, Detectives.</i>
<i>I have an attorney here for you.</i>

203
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,296
I'm Becca Doyle.
You arrested my client, Evan Dayne...

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,891
for the cafeteria shooting
during the school riot.

205
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,404
<i>- Evan? Calls himself Every-Day?</i>
- How'd that come to your attention, counselor?

206
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,304
<i>I represented him two years ago</i>
<i>when he was guilty.</i>

207
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,401
This time he's innocent, so I
offered my services pro bono.

208
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,606
What makes you think
this guy's innocent?

209
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,310
Is there someplace
we can talk?

210
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,148
Several eyewitnesses
I.D.'d your boy.

211
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,154
I reinterviewed your witnesses.

212
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,724
Sorry to say,
pretty shoddy work.

213
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,922
[Scoffs] Mariano gave us Evan,
four others confirmed it.

214
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,555
There all Mariano's close friends.
Did you know that?

215
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,931
We're not gonna reopen this case
based on who's in what clique.

216
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,233
Mariano gave you a patsy,
and his buddies backed him up.

217
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,604
<i>You didn't look into your original witness</i>
<i>very hard, did you?</i>

218
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,973
Evan has a history
of weapons and assault.

219
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,943
And he's cleaned
himself up since.

220
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,947
He's stayed away
from guns and gangs.

221
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,677
I've checked in with him
every few months for the past two years.

222
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,015
We do our
own investigations.

223
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:40,184
Look. We all have tough jobs,
and we all make mistakes.

224
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,659
Mine's having a little too much faith
in my clients sometimes.

225
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,755
But this time
my faith is justified.

226
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,603
We'll look into it.

227
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,502
Thank you.
I'll wait.

228
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,269
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>
<i>We'll hit you up, bud. Yep.</i>

229
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,711
<i>Coroner says Rodrigo died</i>
<i>of a heart attack.</i>

230
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,511
Mixed too much party fuel.
Shane and Ronnie got the warrant.

231
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,712
<i>Call 'em back. Tell 'em we'll meet 'em there.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the car.</i>

232
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,522
Has anyone from the department come around
asking any questions?

233
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,720
What are you talking about?

234
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,229
Ah, there's a rumor flying around
that someone might be trying...

235
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,697
to make political hay
by coming after my team.

236
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,462
Could be I.A.D.

237
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,867
- And this is just a rumor?
- No, we're clean.

238
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,235
But they might come
poking around asking questions.

239
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,774
Look, the fact is that you
and I were married...

240
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,709
so spousal privilege
applies to that entire time.

241
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,839
- So you don't have to tell anyone anything.
- What do I say if they ask?

242
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,679
Just tell 'em nothing.
Call me.

243
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,585
- What?
- Is there something that
I need to hide from them?

244
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,214
Of course not.

245
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,589
Listen, thanks
for the help with Magdalena.

246
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,023
- Rodrigo's place.
- Something wrong?

247
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,763
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on, ladies. It's playtime.

248
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,896
- Police!
<i>- ##[Speakers: Spanish Rap]</i>

251
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,038
Yep.

253
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,711
in hell from now on.

254
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,618
Nothin'.

255
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,961
<i>Shitl</i>

256
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,902
No, it can't be that easy.

257
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,234
He's an ex-con from Mexico.
It damn well could be.

258
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,242
Ho.

259
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,471
<i>Rip that open.</i>

260
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,581
<i>Jackpot.</i>
<i>Let me see that.</i>

261
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,789
[Shane]
Picture of girls, a few boys.

262
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,154
Hey, it's Magdalena.

263
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,687
The other three girls
in the truck.

264
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,230
That accounts for four of them.
What about the rest of these kids?

265
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,893
<i>- Where are they?</i>
- Hey, Magdalena's brother.

266
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,234
- [Ronnie] Names, prices-
- And a passenger manifest.

267
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,240
<i>- [Mackey] It's a goddamn kiddie catalog.</i>
- Hey.

268
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,937
What's granny
doing in here?

269
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,573
Either someone's into dry pussy
or she's helping traffic these kids.

270
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,174
Fifth and Alvarado.
Let's go.

271
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,479
I just checked
with my witnesses.

272
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,556
<i>Those kids are contradicting</i>
<i>everything they told you.</i>

273
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,922
<i>They still say Mariano's innocent</i>
<i>and Every-Day did do the shooting.</i>

274
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,154
Maybe it's time
to reexamine your faith.

275
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,662
Mariano must have scared his friends
to keep their mouth shut.

276
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,460
We're trying to get
at the bottom of this.

277
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,000
You don't know anybody who would be
willing to give up Mariano?

278
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
If he did, I would have
given it to you already.

279
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,806
Look, Mariano's a bad dude.
Besides, it was a riot.

280
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,809
We were all runnin'- Maybe I was
the only one that seen him pull the gun?

281
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,813
So, right now, it's still his word
against five others, right?

282
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,884
No one said
this would be easy...

283
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,385
but someone will
tell the truth eventually.

284
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,546
Or maybe it's just
a play on your part?

285
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,150
You get us to reopen the case, that creates
the reasonable doubt you need to go to trial.

286
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,561
He's facing 12 to 25.
All I'm asking is we be sure.

287
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,298
Why are you still
playing along with her?

288
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,895
You know witness statements.
They go down quick. Maybe we got taken.

289
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,635
<i>- No, this is about something else.</i>
- No, it isn't.

290
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,303
You're pissed I called you out
about dragging your feet.

291
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,642
Now you're undermining a case
I pushed for.

292
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,875
<i>Excuse me, Detectives.</i>
<i>I'm really shorthanded.</i>

293
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,817
- Is one of you free?
- Dutch is.

294
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,050
Dutch, this is, uh, Parole Officer
Marshall Traynor. He's got a case.

295
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,682
I think it's pretty much
right up your alley.

296
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,630
<i>Loel missed his court date the other day,</i>
<i>violated his parole.</i>

297
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,996
Means he goes back
for another two years.

298
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,865
My friend Ned just did a stretch
for armed robbery.

299
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,929
Some dude was taking care of his dog,
and Ned asked me to drive him to pick it up.

300
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,239
The dude wouldn't give it back,
so we go to this guy's place.

301
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,337
<i>- [Traynor] A trailer.</i>
- Where?

302
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,916
Somewhere around here.
He doesn't remember.

303
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,977
<i>So I'm sitting in the truck, and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>Ned comes out all bloody and shit.</i>

304
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,114
Tells me the guy
wouldn't give him back the dog.

305
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,217
They fought, and Ned did him
in the head with a shotgun.

306
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,092
So you, uh, just decided to hang
around and violate your parole?

307
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,724
Ned had the gun! He made me
grab the dead body, hack the head off...

308
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,895
buried it in a field
and then chopped up the body.

309
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,939
<i>What did you do</i>
<i>with the body parts?</i>

310
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,205
There's this junkyard with,
like, a half a dozen guard dogs.

311
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,474
I was an unwilling
participant, okay?

312
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,146
- Do you buy his story?
- I believe he's telling the truth.

313
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,087
Because you've dealt
with him a lot?

314
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,592
<i>'Cause his brows were raised,</i>
<i>his lips parted and stretched.</i>

315
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,594
I've studied up
on reading faces.

316
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,664
Gotten pretty good at it.

317
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:50,257
I've read up on micro-expression
facial action units.

318
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,338
'Cause it's fascinating stuff.

Yes, fiesta time.

<i>they teach at the academy.</i>

If you want to grab a bite later,
I'll give you a quick rundown.

532
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:17,409
- Yeah, sounds good.
- You'd be surprised how
transparent people become.

533
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,415
Your partner, for instance.

534
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:23,009
- Claudette?
- Trying to hide something from you.

535
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,750
<i>Pretty obvious.</i>
<i>Something's in the closet.</i>

<i>Hold on.</i>

00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,011
I didn't have my baton,

How right you are.

Good girl. Nice work.

You don't know

00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,693
What about the rest

565
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,792
I want my lawyer.

566
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,633
Is that the first thing they teach you pricks

567
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,367
Put him in the van.

568
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,534
Hey, we take this shithead

<i>Word gets out about this bust,</i>

- Come on.
<i>- Let's go, asshole.</i>

572
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:45,122
This is a shitty day.
We only got about half those kids.

00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,323
<i>At least we get to stick the needle</i>
<i>in someone for it.</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Guttierez is gonna get five to seven max.</i>

<i>- Hey, we got three dead girls.</i>
<i>- This asshole wasn't anywhere near that.</i>

576
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,667
We got conspiracy charges, so
he's up for the murders too.

577
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,834
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

578
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,071
Well, that-
that is good news.

579
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,341
Doesn't mean he's gonna
get the death penalty, though.

580
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,247
<i>- [Mackey] Well, Calhoun is prosecuting.</i>
<i>- Wow. Good.</i>

581
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,252
So I guess
that means he will.

582
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,379
- Who's Calhoun?
<i>- [Mackey] Hey, shut up, you prickl</i>

00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,616
<i>You wanted a lawyer,</i>
<i>now we can't talk to you.</i>

584
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,694
But I ain't gettin' no death penalty

585
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,230
- I didn't even see.
<i>- Save it for your last words lying on the gurney.</i>

Whoa. You waivin'

590
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,008
Of your own

591
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,910
Yeah.

592
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,416
- But you'll help me, right?
<i>- [Mackey] Where are the rest of the girls?</i>

593
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,955
There's a house on Colquitt,
another one on Adams.

594
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,990
All right, and the boy,
Pablo, where's he at?

595
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,425
Bangkok. They flew him, the rest
of the boys out this afternoon.

00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,760

How you holdin' up?

00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,303
Good. Andy's a handful, but,
you know, it's worth it.

601
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,384
Yeah, listen. Here is my address
and phone number.

602
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,577
- Are we still on for that Friday playdate or?
- Yeah.

603
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,450
If there's a problem, I'll call you,
but I'm looking forward to this, really.

604
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,956
Okay.
Where is Andy?

605
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,995
<i>Sometimes I wonder if this extra program</i>
<i>is just an excuse to bilk me out of extra money.</i>

606
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,462
From the school, yes.
The teachers, no.

607
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,830
- You likin' the teacher, or-
- I'm blankin' on her name right now.

608
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,666
Um, remind me. What's-
It's the woman with the, uh-

609
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:38,230
Um, I thought Mr. Dunhill
taught the after-school program.

610
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,438
- He does, but I'm talking
about her aide. I mean his aide.
- Oh.

611
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,313
<i>Anyway, look,</i>
<i>I'll see you on Friday, if not sooner.</i>

612
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,683
Yeah, good. You know what? I gotta
get my kids home, but I'll see you then, okay?

613
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,949
<i>See ya.</i>

614
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,661
I just got this case
an hour ago.

615
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,232
Why is my client arrested
for second-degree murder...

616
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,233
<i>when another boy</i>
<i>was already arrested?</i>

617
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,463
<i>I'm sure you've heard Every-Day's attorney</i>
<i>is making my life hell.</i>

618
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,405
She's taken depositions
from half the high school.

619
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,068
- Depositions listing you as the shooter.
- Bullshit.

620
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,645
My friends were there.
They saw Every-Day pull that gun.

621
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,646
- What are you writing?
- Every-Day's release.

622
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,842
The D.A. Has decided to drop the case,
charging your client.

623
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,321
Based solely
on witness statements?

624
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,985
<i>Well, they also just found</i>
<i>gun residue in his locker.</i>

625

<i>[Chuckles]</i>

626
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,689
<i>- What else do you have?</i>
- D.A. Doesn't want me revealing it...

627
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,860
until we're closer to trial.

628
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,835
This does not need
to go to trial.

629
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,576
What do I have to do
to make a deal?

630
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,307
Convince your client to drop
the high school clique crap.

631
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,406
<i>School him on what it's</i>
<i>like to have this evidence...</i>

632
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:58,251
a high-priced lawyer and a very pissed-off cop
working against him.

633
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,288
Gun residue in a locker?
I'd never let you get away with that.

634
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:10,265
Cops are allowed to twist the facts to suspects.
I directed my comments to him.

635
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,166
- Evan's being released tonight.
- I know.

636
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,171
Thanks for your help.

637
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,333
I owe you one. I mean that.
Call in a favor whenever you need it.

638
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,410
<i>I will.</i>

639
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,109
<i>I, uh-I heard.</i>

640
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,017
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

641
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,555
- How's yours going?
- Uh, turns out the parolee was coerced.

642
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,386
So he won't go down for the murder
or hacking up the body.

643
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,619
<i>The other guy's</i>
<i>going away for a long time.</i>

644
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,127
And I'm, uh-
I'm sure about him.

645
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,755
<i>Good. Well, where you</i>
<i>running off to?</i>

646
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,767
Uh, dinner with Marshall.

647
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,066
I can't have
other colleagues as friends?

648
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:51,369
Marshall has quite a reputation
as a man's man...

649
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,740
<i>- if you know what I mean.</i>
- He- He's gay?

650
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,713
<i>While you were reading faces,</i>
<i>he was reading your package.</i>

651
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,807
Have fun though.

652
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,157
The cage would look a whole lot prettier
with Abuela's ugly mug in it.

653
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,324
Sure you don't want to find
the loophole in our deal?

654
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,268
I couldn't let you run roughshod
over a little old lady, much as she deserved it.

655
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,737
You lookin'
for more business?

656
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,777
I appreciate the offer, but I'm okay watching
from the sidelines while they get theirs.

657
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,312
Right now, I'd like to go home
and wash this place off me.

658
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,348
You talkin' about the cops
or the criminals?

659
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,749
See you in court
someday, Detective.

660
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,190
- [Door Buzzes]
- Vic?

661
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,820
I got something important.

662
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,227
Someone has been
asking questions.

663
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,027
<i>- Who?</i>
- This man. He's approached me a few times.

664
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,034
- Where at?
- Glenridge.

665
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,435
He, uh- He said he was
the parent of an autistic child.

666
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,303
But I've been around cops
long enough to know what they sound like.

667
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,810
Besides, I've never even
seen his kid, so-

668
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,777
That him?

669
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,748
Yeah. Why's he coming
to our school?

670
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,446
- What did he ask you?
- I'm trying to remember.

671
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,352
Something about paying the tuition
and, uh, how do we do it...

672
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,448
<i>how involved you are.</i>

673
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,121
- What did you tell him?
- I told him you gave us money
for whatever we needed.

674
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,659
<i>I was trying to sell you</i>
<i>as a good dad.</i>

675
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,371
I didn't tell him
about the cash in the bag.

676
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,069
Good. Don't tell him shit.

677
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,978
Asshole has no business talking to you
about this. It's my problem.

678
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,812
I'll take care of it.
All right?

679
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,184
[Moaning]

680
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,492
Oh, I'm gonna come.

681
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,410
Ahhh.

682
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,945
Mmm.

683
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,220
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- [Exhales]

684
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,727
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

685
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,421
Mm-hmm.

686
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,965
That was great.

687
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,468
But, uh,
you were somewhere else.

688
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,634
<i>Is it about</i>
<i>that meeting this morning?</i>

689
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,083
Yeah.

690
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,676
<i>Lem's in</i>
<i>some hot water.</i>

691
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,052
Yeah.

692
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,251
- How hot?
- We don't know yet.

693
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,062
I thought you said that you
were done with all that-

694
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,962
that you were
gonna keep clean.

695
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,126
<i>- I have been.</i>
- Yeah?

696
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,295
I swear.

697
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,533
Then why you
so worried?

698
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,973
- Hmm?
- Don't you worry.

699
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,982
Okay?

700
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,986
We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

701
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,785
"We" meaning you and Vic?

702
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,123
- Together as a team, standing behind Lem?
- No. Listen.

703
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,958
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

704
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,625
The team's one thing,
but family's another.

705
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,664
All that stuff that happened
with Antwon. You know.

706
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:47,233
- Yeah.
- I was looking at prison in the eye.

707
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,778
- I know. I know.
- Hey.

708
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,077
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to us.

709
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,152
Jackson needs his father.

710
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,557
Well, I need
the both of you.

711
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,562
Hear me?

712
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,894
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

713
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,334
Buddy in Immigration called.
He's putting the word out on Pablo.

714
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,573
<i>Spoke to an American diplomat</i>
<i>in Bangkok.</i>

715
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:28,015
- I meant what I said about not giving up on him.
- Okay. Good.

716
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:34,419
I feel like there's some unfinished
business between us.

717
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,652
What's that?

718
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,795
<i>It's this Terry thing.</i>

719
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,336
<i>You thought I was hiding something</i>
<i>from you.</i>

720
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,598
<i>Here's the truth.</i>

721
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,038
I swept through that house.

722
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,136
I cleared that bathroom.

723
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,182
At least I thought I did.

724
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,081
<i>Somehow Two-Time</i>
<i>got past me.</i>

725
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,354
<i>I left Terry exposed.</i>

726
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,762
I made a mistake.

727
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,424
<i>I never told anybody.</i>
<i>I thought it was my fault.</i>

728
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,628
That's something I've been
living with for a long time now.

729
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,808
Finally, I decided to move on.

730
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,543
Something you're gonna have
to push past too.

731
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,333
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

732
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,936
<i>- [Knocking]</i>
<i>- Hey, Vic-</i>

733
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,944
Her Majesty, Billings,
needs to see you.

734
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,446
<i>- Tell him I'll be right there.</i>
- Got it.

735
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,257
- What's up?
- Somebody here to see you.

736
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:22,298
<i>Jon Kavanaugh.</i>
<i>Internal Affairs.</i>

737
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,526
- Vic Mackey.
- Yeah.

738
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,104
Mind if I have
a moment alone, Captain?

739
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,833
<i>- Nah, not at all.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

740
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,715
What can
I do for you, Detective?

741
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,012
<i>- It's lieutenant.</i>
- Right.

742
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,087
<i>We're just cops,</i>
<i>just like you.</i>

743
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,156
I guess the, uh, good looks,
it just throws everybody off.

744
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,850
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Anyhow.</i>

745
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,257
We're making
a tour of the division.

746
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:55,423
With the budget cuts, the, uh, bosses,
they're afraid that there might be...

747
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:59,730
uh, a lot of temptation
to take shortcuts.

748
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:04,035
And I'm just here to remind everyone
that I'm still on the case...

749
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,599
<i>and there is a right way</i>
<i>to do things.</i>

750
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,044
I've been a cop for 14 years.
You guys never toured before.

751
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,378
New management.

[Chuckles]
Anyhow.

754
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,681
There is no reason why you and I should not
be on the same page.

755
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:25,421
Why you talkin' to me?

756
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,497
You run a Special Team.

757
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,964
Those get most
of the abuse allegations.

758
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,901

those people out there...

<i>they all follow your lead.</i>

760
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:40,009
Well, can't blame 'em
for having good judgment.

00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,410
Is there anything brewing I should
know about? Anything at all suspicious?
