00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,108
- [R& B]
- [Shane] Hey.

2
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,945
- Take a break.
- [Woman] Okay.

3
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,783
You ready?

4
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:14,554
Hey. Shh.

5
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:17,222
- /s Cromo strapped?
- [Man] Let's find out.

6
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,765
We'll let you take
the first round, sweetheart.

7
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:22,427
[Woman]
Yeah, he got a gun, and it's loaded.

8
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,163
How do you want
to do this, boss?

9
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,831
- Cuff'em to something outside.
- Got it.

10
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:32,978
Right here, ladies.

11
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,640
[Woman Moaning]

12
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,377
Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:40,045
- [Moaning Continues]
- [Pager Beeping]

14
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:42,645
[Man] This better be important,
stupid goddamn bitch.

15
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:45,317
[Beeping Continues]

16
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:48,088
It sure is, you stupid, goddamn bitch.
Let's go.

17
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,254
Let's go. Hands on your head.
Behind your head.

18
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:52,264
Right now. Come on, cornrow.
Let's go.

19
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,465
You okay?

20
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,764
Two minutes later, I would have
been doing a lot better.

21
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:00,500
Raping a minor- Doesn't that
break some pimp code of ethics?

22
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,576
Man, she bragged she was 18.

23
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:06,443
- You see she wanted it. It's like a Kobe thing.
- Yeah?

24
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:10,005
Well, it looks like you just lost
your endorsement deal.

25
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:12,017
Let's go, Kobe.

26
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:14,019
- What the hell happened, man?
- Oh, it's just a scrape.

27
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:17,454
I'll be okay. Hey, I miss you
and your guys coming in here.

28
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:20,652
I figured with all the free meals,
you'd be happy to get rid of us.

29
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,958
/ need a favor. Remember Cyril,
the kid that works for me?

30
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:26,761
Hasn't shown up in a couple of weeks
until this morning.

31
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,926
- He ripped off your payroll?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,561
/ tried to stop him.
He shoved me out of the way.

33
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,869
- He only got 30 bucks.
- He a rockhead?

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,810
Come on, Cal.

35
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,938
Only one thing that turns a good kid
into a thief that fast.

36
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,448
/ didn't want
to lead with that.

37
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,520
I was afraid you wouldn't want
to help if you knew about the drugs.

38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,316
- Oh, and this one I should?
- I just thought maybe you could help me...

39
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,323
put him on the straight.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,951
Excuse me.
There's a shipment here for you-

41
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,962
a bunch of Polaroid cameras.

42
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,430
Oh, uh, stack 'em
on that desk over there.

43
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,934
- Danny, right?
- Yeah. We haven't officially met.

44
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:05,005
Hi. Now we have.

45
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:08,200
- /'m Monica Rawling.
- So, can I ask what the cameras are for?

46
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,403
- David needs to push the transition meeting.
- Okay.

47
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,208
I didn't see any paperwork
for cameras.

48
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,417
You're leaving
with David, right?

49
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,453
Of course. Why?

50
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,818
No reason.

51
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,598
What are you doing
in here?

52
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,260
I'm, uh-

53
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:39,305
Uh, our- Our men's room doesn't work.
We all share this one.

54
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:43,672
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, we-we do. We ha-

55
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,978
You mean we don't share it with you.
[Chuckles]

56
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,054
Uh, there's somebody in there.

57
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:57,784
Hey, Dutch-boy's been promoted
to bathroom monitor.

58
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,918
- [Laughing]
- It's a shitty job, but someone's gotta do it.

59
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:04,020
- [Cops Laughing]
- Big man-pass these out to the unis...

60
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,031
17-year-old base chaser.

61
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,829
Anybody sees him, call me.

62
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,995
All yours.

63
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,966
I got a teenager on a drug tear-
friend of a friend.

64
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:18,510
Gonna track him down before he does
damage. I wanted to give you a heads-up.

65
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:20,512
You should tell your C.O.

66
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:23,549
- Like I said, I wanted to give you a heads-up.
- Like I said...

67
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,620
I'm not in charge yet.
Seriously, tell Aceveda.

68
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,019
All right, Social Services
is on the way...

69
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,719
sojust wait in the other room,
sweetheart.

70
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:40,131
[Groans]
Such a fine line, isn't it?

71
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,223
Amen, brother.

72
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,997
Book him with two of those
and pocket the other one.

73
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:50,873
That's currency on the street. We use
the blow to buy intel on the next asshole.

74
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,443
Hmm. You serious?

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,484
How do you think I got Night Train
to give up this place?

76
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:02,647
It's old school Vice, baby.
You use the world to bust the world.

77
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:04,951
Hmm.

78
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,290
All right.

79
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:13,162
Hey. It's all good
in the hood, brother.

80
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,098
[Chuckles]

81
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:30,006
I'm sorry, Nance.

82
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:33,086
The Mexican authorities
sent him back.

83
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:36,088
/ got the call this morning.

84
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,161
Can I help you?

85
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,753
Yeah. We're here
to I.D. Ben Gilroy.

86
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,764
You family?

87
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,925
Wife and, uh, friend.

88
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,401
Give me a minute.

89
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:03,380
How are the girls
taking it?

90
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:06,749
I haven't told them yet.

91
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:09,687
They can barely wrap their brains
around him leaving the first time.

92
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,558
- Yeah.
- [Door Opens]

93
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:16,152
Follow me, please.

94
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,731
Nance, you don't
have to see him this way.

95
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,964
[Scoffs] I just don't want
to feel sorry for the piece of shit.

96
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,578
Federales found him
with a bunch of fake Mexican I.D.'s...

97
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,979
and an expired
California driver's license.

98
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,513
Benjamin Wescott Gilroy?

99
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,590
- Shit.
- That a positive /.D.?

100
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:46,421
How did he die?

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,257
Take your pick.
Cirrhosis, malnutrition-

102
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,263
Official cause
was suffocation.

103
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,663
Aspirated on his own vomit.

104
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:57,533
Christ. This guy was the assistant
police chief? What happened?

105
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:59,868
[Sighs]
Take your pick.

106
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,704

109
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:15,847
Ha-yea. Pimp's in the barn,
and we havin'a hoedown.

110
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:17,981
- [Cops Laughing]
- Look, it's the Lord of the Vice.

111
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:21,994
Just here to brighten up your day,
you bunch of sad, little desk monkeys.

112
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,900
- Who's the cowboy?
- A guy I used to run with.

113
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:31,267
He jumped over to Vice,
Central Bureau.

114
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:34,569
Guessing by the look on your face,
it ended shit-side up.

115
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,200
Just haven't seen him
for a while.

116
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:43,076
How's that new partner
working out?

117
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:45,083
It clicks.

118
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:50,418
Well, I gotta get
back to this.

119
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:52,617
Yeah, get to it.

120
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,921
Cyril's got twoJuvie hearings pending...

121
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,762
one for crack cocaine,
and the other's for public lewdness-

122
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:03,564
getting head on a bench
in Griffith Park.

123
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,797
- The head attached to a name?
- She fled.

124
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,033
Cops got a description though.

125
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,202
Slight, blonde, piercings,
early 20s.

126
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,211
You know what?

127
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,009
I spoke
to theJesus-whacked mom.

128
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:18,209
Her address is different
than the one he gave...

129
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,218
when he got busted
in the park.

130
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,346
- Could be the blonde's place.
- Hmm.

131
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,725
[Sighs]

132
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:31,423
You know, it's strange,
the clubhouse being this way.

133
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah. Thanks for unsealing this.

134
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:39,700
/t's cool.
Hey, / heard about Gilroy. Damn.

135
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:43,072
Yeah. Burial's tomorrow.
Be great if you could make it.

136
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:46,738
I'm trying to give him
a decent send-off.

137
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,815
Is, uh, Shane going?

138
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,850

I have an update
on the garage sting...

149
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,684
that I think you two
might want to hear.

150
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,215
- Who's that with him?
- Lewis Sperling.

151
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,349
Guy we flipped
to give us the sting.

152
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,394
Other than a few busts
in the first month...

153
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,726
our cameras haven't
turned up anything.

154
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:40,561
No major deals,
no major connections.

155
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,727
I can't control
what folks say and do.

156
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,203
[Aceveda]
You played us, Lewis-

157
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:50,242
set up another corporation
in your daughter's name.

158
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:54,371
That's a violation
of the terms of your deal.

159
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,682
I got two ex-wives,
five kids.

160
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:02,983
/ can't make a living
with you guys perpetually up my ass.

161
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,082
Maybe Mackey couldn't figure out
how you were end-running us...

162
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,093
but / did.

163
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,095
You tipped off
big-fish clients.

164
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,392
They gave you seed money
to start a new company.

165
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,627
You got your income back,
and they got a new place...

166
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:17,704
- to launder cash.
- Jesus.

167
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,102

/'ll give you more names...

169
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,211
from the new business.

170
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:29,874
- Bigger guys.
- / don't think so, Lewis.

171
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:34,545
It's over-
and now you're going to jail.

172
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,216
[Sighs]

173
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:45,797
Six months and thousands
of tax dollars pissed away.

174
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,799
At least now we know why.

175
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,797
- I dropped the ball.
- Little late for the humble servant routine.

176
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:55,807
I'll set up the collars
on the ones we have.

177
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,809
Make sure
it gets done right.

178
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:59,970
Oh, and you're
the man to do it right?

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,071
Just let him
fix the problem, okay?

180
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,878
Sir, there are two people dead
at that Laundromat robbery.

181
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:08,011
- One of them's an officer-involved shooting.
- Shit.

182
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,112
- What do we know?
- Two suspects, looks like a Hispanic male...

183
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,522
and a white female.

184
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,928
- Do we have a description of the shooters?
- Just the girl.

185
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,297
She's one of the D.O.A.'s.
Blonde, pierced nose, 120 pounds.

186
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:24,802
What?

187
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:28,068
This shooting might have something
to do with the kid that I'm looking for.

188
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,268
Your wayward juvie's tied in
with a 187?

189
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,902
If you're trying
to win me over...

190
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,573
it's not working.

191
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,081
Little Bonnie and Clyde shot and killed
the manager for $11 in quarters.

192
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:44,089
The boy got away.

193
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,091
Did you pull a name
and address on the girl?

194
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:49,219
- Hope Anthony, 9246 East Olympic.
- Goddamn it!

195
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,229
Problem?

196
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,958
You got that xerox of Cyril on you?

197
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,296
- Yeah.
- Okay, run it by the witnesses.

198
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:58,803
Hey, I, uh, think the other shooter's
this kid I've been looking for.

199
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:02,238
Unbelievable. You were putting cops
at risk by running this off the grid?

200
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:04,674
- I didn't have all the facts.
- Well, at least you're consistent.

201
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,939
Give the information
on the kid to Billings...

202
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,881
- and finish closing out the garage sting.
- Come on.

203
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,419
It sounded like you had something more
you wanted to share up there.

204
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:16,421
What if I did?

205
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:18,286
- Who are you?
- Captain Rawling.

206
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:22,226
Aceveda's on his way out.
I'll be deciding what happens in the Barn.

207
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,430
Well.

208
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:28,524
I got a name will spin
your pretty little head around.

209
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:31,365
Well, my pretty little head
doesn't spin that easy.

210
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:33,371
Who is it?

211
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,941
I want my deal
back in place.

212
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,943
No jail time.

213
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,780
That deal got flushed
with your corporate switcheroo.

214
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,945
You gotta put something real
on the table...

215
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:51,752
or the D.A.
won't even take my call.

216
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,758
No deal, no name.

217
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,386
No problem then.

218
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,125
- [Phone Rings]
- There he is.
- [Mackey] Yeah?

219
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:04,135
/t's me. / just messengered you
a package.

220
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,102
- Is it ticking?
- Sort of.

221
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:09,403
It's a class action lawsuit against the
Pyren Merril Pharmaceutical Company.

222
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,409
What's that got
to do with us?

223
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:15,743
Well, it claims that the rise in autism
is due to a vaccine preservative-

224
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,249
vaccines that both Matthew and Megan
got when they were two.

225
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,513
- That was right around when-
- I know, I know. Listen.

226
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,646
There's a deadline, and we need
to sit down and talk with the lawyer.

227
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:27,818
- Okay. How about tomorrow morning
when / drop off Cassie?
- Great.

228
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,453
I'll set it up
and I will see you then. Bye.

229
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,623
Armando Renta,
this is Vic Mackey.

230
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,633
Good to meet you.

231
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,930
Army's fresh off
a 14-month roll in "shock and awe. '"

232
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:40,097
Gave those sand pigs a little taste
of the red, white and brown.

233
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:44,200
- Mission accomplished?
- That's what they told us, so it must be true.

234
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:46,370
How do you like running
with Wild Bill?

235
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,972
Beats going door to door in Baghdad.
Now it's hick and the spic.

236
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,484
That's clever.
Can you give us a minute?

237
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,290
So, uh- So what's up?

238
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:01,793
I need to know who's running crack
in Ashmore Heights these days.

239
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,557
That's hard to day. Last few weeks,
someone's flooded the market.

240
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:07,565
Every pusher in the hood's rock-heavy,
scrambling to unload product.

241
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:11,296
- Since when do you need help powder tracking?
- You hear about Gilroy?

242
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,303
What, is he back in town?

243
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:15,898
Yeah. Spilling his guts
at the morgue.

244
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,409
Drank himself to death.
They're gonna bury him tomorrow.

245
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:21,811
- You should be there.
- I wanted the guy dead.

246
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,815
Well, you got your wish.

247
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,408
It's about his wife
and kids now.

248
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,115
Are you forgetting he threatened
your family? He hung you out to I.A.D.?

249
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:32,817
Money and pussy make man
do evil shit.

250
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,027
Before all that,
he was a friend.

251
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,927
Some bodies in blue
should show respect.

252
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,601
I'll see if I can
shake myself free.

253
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,433
- So we, uh-We done?
- I, uh-

254
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,169
I got some worries about what I saw
over at Dead-Eye's the other night.

255
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,177
Well, stop worrying.

256
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,645
Dead-Eye was about to start
C./. duties for me...

257
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,683
tracking Antwon Mitchell's new game-
till someone tapped his mute button.

258
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:00,116
Now I'm watching Antwon.

259
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,245
So if you got
any kind of relationship-

260
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:04,448
I got no relationship with him.

261
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,827
Then I got no problem.

262
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,665
[Army]
Everything cool?

263
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:17,066
Yeah, it's all good.
All right?

264
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,105
Gonna take two, maybe three days
to lay a new piece of pipe.

265
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:23,574
Get started. I want
to hear flushing in 48 hours.

266
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:27,636
- What's going on?
- Having the men's room repaired.

267
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:31,444
I didn't fix the men's room 'cause it
would have chewed up 35% of our budget.

268
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,418
That's my worry now.

269
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,421
Plumbing crews, cameras-

270
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,754
Either you're completely naive
about our financial constraints-

271
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,727
which I doubt-
or you've got something planned.

272
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,097
[Sighs]

273
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,930
I'm instituting seizures-
across the board.

274
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:53,597
Cars, houses, businesses,
anything drug- or gang-related.

275
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,767
- Asset forfeiture? The chiefll never go for that.
- He's already signed on.

276
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:59,573
- Pol Com too.
- Citizens here can't afford lawyers...

277
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,876
- to fight seized assets.
- I'm not worried about pissing off dealers...

278
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:05,042
'cause we swiped
their pimp rides.

279
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,051
We're gonna target
the right people.

280
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:10,054
And you're thinking
of using Mackey for this?

281
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:15,719
I'm still deciding.
I mean, your letter made him untradable.

282
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,729
I have to use him somewhere.

283
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:20,493
Keep him parked inside.
Anything else is dangerous. Trust me.

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,500
Appreciate your input.

285
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,502
[Plumber]
/ need a signature to start the work.

286
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:28,005
- So why is this the first /'m hearing about all this?
- Oh, it happened fast.

287
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:31,407
Thanks.
Anyway, after tomorrow, it's...

288
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:34,139
mine to win or lose.

289
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,817
She was unconscious
when they brought her in.

290
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,116
Fishnets, Spandex- I don't think
she was out walking her dog.

291
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:45,089
- Hooker rape?
- The name she put on her form...

292
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,125
was Olive Martini.

293
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,957
This is the only thing
that she had on her.

294
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:52,930
- Ralphs card. That's official.
- She's in six.

295
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,627
I'll go see if she's
shaken or stirred.

296
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,569
You know what? Test results aren't
gonna be in till this afternoon.

297
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:04,371
- I usually, uh, grab a taco across the street.
- From Rullio's?

298
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:07,571
We treat at least four cases of food
poisoning a week from that place.

299
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,581
/t's got an "A '"
in the window.

300
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,311
- Stands for "acute gastritis."
- [Claudette] Did you say Room 6?

301
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,319
Olive has left the building.

302
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,389
[Dutch]
Okay.

303
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:23,318
James has got a family friend.
Thinks you two would hit it off.

304
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,398
Really?

305
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:27,466
She does public affairs work.
Smart.

306
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,899
- For some reason she likes cops.
- What's she look like?

307
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:33,598
Petite, dark-skinned,
attractive.

308
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,698
She's black?

309
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:40,377
Never mind.

310
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,573
- [Beeps]
- What?

311
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,412
I dated a black girl
in college.

312
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,646
Quarter black, but, I mean,
you could definitely tell.

313
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:52,384
Forget it. What's on
the raped hooker's grocery card?

314
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:54,960
[Stammering]
No address, bogus phone number.

315
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:57,086
Hey, ifJames thinks
we should-

316
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,631
- What hooker?
- Paramedics took her over to Mission Cross.

317
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,327
She was beaten,
sexually assaulted.

318
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:04,335
Gave a fake name
and disappeared.

319
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:06,530
Did you have hospital personnel
go through the mug books?

320
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,041
- No.
- Where did the attack happen?

321
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,043
We don't know yet.

322
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:14,204
Is there anything
you do know?

323
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:18,011
Last week she bought three gallons
of Chablis and 11 boxes of condoms.

324
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,383
/f she's pissed off a pimp,
her life could be in danger.

325
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,889
Why don't you see
if anyone's called it in to 911.

326
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,653
[Dial Tone]

327
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,827
Transport's running late.

328
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,900
You'll miss lunch call
at County.

329
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,561
You think my price
is a couple of candy bars?

330
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:41,732
Maybe you think better
on a full stomach.

331
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,741
I'm thinking fine.

332
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,743
I called the D.A.

333
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,006
They won't budge
without a name first.

334
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:52,414
- Looks like we got ourselves
an old-fashioned stalemate.
- Yeah, I guess so-

335
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,421
except I'm going home
to a warm bed tonight.

336
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,582
You go home to them.

337
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,859
[Claudette]
The 911 call came in from a pay phone...

338
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,865
- outside a Korean bakery.
- They were robbed 11 times last year.

339
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,367
They installed
state-of-the-art surveillance.

340
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,370
Cameras picked this up
early this morning.

- [Moaning]
- [Grunting]

342
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:21,910
We have the face
of our victim.

343
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,949
And the back
of a rapist's head.

344
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,881
Make some dubs of that tape.
The D.A. 's gonna need a copy.

345
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:28,954
And let me know
when you locate her.

346
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:33,855
- [Antwon Speaking, /ndistinct]
- Yo.

347
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,157
- What are you building, Antwon?
- Are you here to pitch in?

348
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,528
Forgot my tool belt at home.
Still got my cuffs though.

349
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:45,696
House was in foreclosure.
Crackheads took it over, so we took it back.

350
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,705
Help the owners
get back on their feet.

351
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:50,605
M.L.K. toJimmy Carter.
You got all your bases covered, don't you?

352
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,701
I got work to do, man.

353
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,803
Hey. We're looking
for this kid.

354
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,404
Put the word out
to your dealers.

355
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,916
Give me a heads-up
if he tries to score.

356
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,986
I run a rec center.

357
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,987
Just because you
pound some nails...

358
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,057
into some poor slob's house
doesn't mean shit to me.

359
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:08,525
We both know you run drugs,
not a rec center.

360
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,230
All right.

361
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:15,597
My next step,
I start sweating the slangers.

362
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,193
Those pussies always give up
chain of command.

363

- / want to eradicate the crack
epidemic as much as you, man.
- [Phone Rings]

364
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:24,666
- But my relationship to dealers-
- Hold that lie.

- Yeah?
- [Whispering]

366
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:31,774
Beauty. Hang on.
Lem may have a lead on Cyril's drug dealer.

367
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:35,719
That gives you 20 minutes to find me
a shortcut to this missing kid...

368
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:39,781
before I start twisting
the truth out of his dealer.

369
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,726
There he is, on the black bike.
Right there. Pull over.

00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:16,020

- Ran out the back.

378
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,731
Psst.

379
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,767
Hey, put that shit down.

380
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,428
Aw, goddamn it.
He swallowed it.

381
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,438
Shit.
Come here.

Did you? Did you?

385

Know what?
Seems a little bound up.

386
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:08,440
He bought a crumb from me a couple
hours ago. Asshole paid in quarters.

387
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:10,914
- Where is he now?
- / don't know. / never sell to him before.

388
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,917
- Bullshit.
- He ain't a regular.

389
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,987
That's the truth, man.
I swear to God, man.

390

- I swear. I swear.
- Get on your feet.

Hey. Clean up, aisle four.

392
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:27,931
You're really gonna set up
your office down here?

393
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:30,229
I feel more at home
on the floor with the grunts.

394
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,236
You know, for someone
who's supposed to be observing...

395
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,772
you sure are
awfully active.

396
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,104
I saw you chatting
with Lewis Sperling.

397
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,940
Just trying to talk some sense
into him while he's still ours.

398
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,776
I closed down
the garage sting.

399
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:45,783
You know, your instincts,
six months ago, were right.

400
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:48,115
It's got great potential.
It just took a wrong turn.

401
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,985
It's been compromised.
It's dead.

402
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,990
The A.G.C. angle, yes...

403
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:55,287
but the new business
that Lewis set up is untainted.

404
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,454
You got a good system in place.
We own the spyware.

405
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:00,191
We get the bugs in the cars,
we're back in business.

406
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,291
Yeah. You don't have
the authority yet...

407
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,893
to be interviewing suspects,
getting the goddamn toilet fixed...

408
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,700
or overturning my decisions.

409
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,573
So until you're actually
in my office...

open jums of crack.

I induced vomiting.
Saved his goddamn life.

to save lives, right?

417

day after tomorrow.

I'll mail one to you.

We can't post these
in the Barn.

421
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:41,339
Looks like the department
sanctioned people to attend the funeral.

422
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,875
It's just a flyer.

423
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,643
Cyril forged you this check
from his boss's restaurant.

424

This bounced, man.
Kid didn't even write this anyway.

425
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:58,455
It was this blonde T-girl.
She said she worked there.

426

- Is this her?
- Shit.

427
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:07,928
- That's her?
- Yeah.

- [Curtis] She's a tranny?
- She tried to blow me to cover it.

I ain't down with that
chicks-with-dicks shit, so I said no...

430
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,240

431
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:18,401
Where did he-she
score from you?

432
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:22,345

a four-page sheet, mapped with H.I.V.

495
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:56,018
Ronnie, Cyril's dealer
is a cat named, uh, Benish.

496
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:58,096
He lives above
the Quick Lube on Hauser.

497
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:00,097
Get a warrant.

498
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:04,602
- Is he making sense yet?
- He's pretty doped up. He's detoxing.

499
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:07,696
Cop downstairs said it was the other shooter
that killed the woman at the Laundromat.

500
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:10,105
- That clears Cyril, right?
- He was part of the robbery.

501
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:13,144
- Makes it his murder too.
- He didn't know what he was doing.

502
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,713
It's that shit rock. What about
the guy that sold him the crack?

503
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:17,715
I'm taking care of his dealer.

504
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,717
Look, he's gonna be asleep
for a while.

505
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:21,719
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

506
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:24,187
I want to be here
when he wakes up.

507
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:28,892
- I think you're in a lot of pain.
- I don't need pity.

508
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,895
Not pity.

509
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,056
Compassion.

510
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,963
Even if you don't think
you're worthy of it.

511
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:41,735
We're guilty
of perpetuating that-

512
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:45,072
- letting the streets take care of themselves.
- Got that right.

513
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,581
- Can you tell me what happened?
- You seen the tape.

514
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:56,587
I did.

515
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,616
And I am so sorry.

516
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:10,196
He was at the end
of an all-nighter.

517
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,203
Paid for a suck.

518
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:15,331
Got me in the back alley.

519
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:17,807
Threw the first punch...

520
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,572
before I could hit my knees.

521
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:27,946
It was all about the hurt
with this guy.

522
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:34,158
Hey.

523
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,194
I see you got
our ho basket.

524
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:38,092
[Army]
Nice addition to your stable.

525
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:40,324
Don't know if they
worth a thing.

526
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:46,036
[Coughing]

527
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:50,801
[Shane]
Let me tell you how this works.

528
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,368
You and the syphilis brigade,
you see anything, you hear anything-

529
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,381
new players, new product,
anything happens on the street-

530
00:29:57,483 --> 00:30:00,145
I'm your first call.
Got that?

531
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,081
- All right, Venus, you come with us.
- What for?

532
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:07,819
To suck his big Latin dick.
[Laughs]

533
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,499
Hey. This ain't for real.

534
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,831
It's the only way to establish dominance
with these slit-mongers.

535
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:19,598
Tail's the only currency they know.

536
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:21,605
- Then let her suck you off.
- Come on, man, I'm married.

537
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:23,641
Look, you got an E.D. thing
happening, just say so.

538
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:25,836
- Blow me.
- I'll let her. Come on, sweetheart.

539
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:28,846
Just sit back and relax, all right?
Enjoy the ride.

540
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:31,917
You getting some back-alley Clinton
is really gonna help the cause.

541
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:46,156
- Two's a mouthful, three's a crowd.
- Yeah.

542
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,607
Man, Venus is going at it like
she's taking the rust off a low-rider.

543
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,147
That's some
Boss Hogg bullshit, man.

544
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:04,978
- Let's talk percentages.
- Percentages?

545
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,052
Yeah. Keeping you
and your girls out of lockup...

546
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,053
is gonna require
additional man hours.

547
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,055
That's gonna cost you 10%.

548
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:15,787
- That wasn't part of the deal.
- Make no mistake. There's no deal here.

549
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,090
This is you doing what I say...

550
00:31:18,197 --> 00:31:20,097
or else you getting a cap
in the back of your ear...

551
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:22,667
in something we like to call
"the line of duty."

552
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:26,804
Now sit back down.

553
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,171
If you're dicking us around again,
not only won't you get your deal...

554
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,180
we'll make sure
you do your time in Solano.

555
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:39,115
Warden's a friend of mine.
You think the inmates are bad?

556
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:43,120
- Wait till you spend some happy time
with the guards.
- [Chuckling]

557
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:47,090
Alex Kozodav.

558
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:49,127
The taxi king?

559
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:51,355
[Mackey]
Old-school Russian mob.

560
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:53,489
Any other cab tries to pick up
a fare in Farmington...

561
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,796
both car and driver end up
stolen and chopped.

562
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:59,462
[Lewis] Ever since
the Armenian money train gotjacked...

563
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:02,405
the Russians have been looking
for another place to launder their cash.

564
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:06,467
And you've been more than willing
to help, for a fee.

565
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm also putting radios
in his cars.

566
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:12,107
You ever see
Taxi Cab Confessions?

567
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:15,517
Kozi cabs are the Russians' favorites.
A lot of potential marks.

568
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:20,056
I'll see if there's a deal
to be made.

569
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,423
Signed, sealed,
and deceitful.

570
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,428
Bring him in,
you can release her.

571
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,430
Bust her again,
it's attempted murder.

572
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,932
- Make sure she's clear on that.
- Got it.

573
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,935
Thanks for running
interference for us.

574
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:36,406
- My pleasure.
- Another win for Billings.

575
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,444
Okay, Olivia, let's take a look
at some of our mug shots...

576
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,945
of known sexual offenders.

577
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:44,242
He's white.
Pierced tongue.

578
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,409
Delivers pizza.

579
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,851
There's one of those Pizza Shack things
on the top of his car.

580
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,950
I just talked with Lewis.

581
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,549
Apparently his ride left
without him.

582
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,963
Lewis's name.

583
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:06,570
- "Alex Kozodav."
- L.A. boss, Russian organized crime.

584
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:09,732
This guy's on everybody's
top-ten list.

585
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:13,334
The D.A. wants to play ball.

586
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:19,480
/ think you are making decisions
to settle a grudge-

587
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:21,917
decisions /'m gonna
have to live with.

588
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:24,751
These property seizures
that you want to impose-

589
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:27,018
who's gonna have to live
with those decisions?

590
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:30,095
l-I could have let Lewis get lost
in the system for a couple of days...

591
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:32,663
taken the credit
when you were gone...

592
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:34,665
but you've earned this.

593
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:39,136
I figured we could present it
to the chief together.

594
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,608
I'll take a look at it.

595
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:50,280
- [Tires Screeching]
- Shit!

596
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:52,441
God!

597
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,452
Somebody torched
Benish's place.

598
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:59,285
God!
Hey, Chief.

599
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:03,691
- Hey, I got a warrant to search upstairs.
- Pretty hot in there right now.

600
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:06,230
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Any way of putting it down?

601
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:09,824
I doubt it.
We've already lost the top floor.

602
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:13,029
All right. Thanks.

603
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:17,131
- Hey! Who owns the bikes?
- [Man] Fat guy. He lives there.

604
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:20,769
- You sure?
- You don't forget a 300-pound dude
on a scooter.

605
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,143
Check the plates.

606
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:33,047
[Olive Screaming]

607
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,839
- Oh, man.
- [Mackey] What's the matter, fat man?

608
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,976
- You got insurance, don't you?
- Yeah, I'm in real good hands.

609
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:04,180
- Too bad about your little crack factory upstairs.
- What's that smell?

610
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:08,555
- Oh, yeah. You got smoke.
- [Laughing]

611
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:10,891
I ran the VI N numbers
on your scooters.

612
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:13,590
Stolen the same night
six other bikes got jacked.

613
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:15,826
I got grand theft.

614
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,834
Antwon Mitchell-

615
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:19,904
he the one filling
the cesspool with new rock?

616
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:24,669
Rumor is Mr. Mitchell's walking
the straight and narrow now.

617
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:29,146
Oh, it's gonna be hard
maintaining that edge in the joint...

618
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:32,081
when gen pop finds out you
the little red scooter bandit.

619
00:35:32,184 --> 00:35:34,948
- There's been a crack flood 'cause
everybody's dumping what they got.
- Why?

620
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:38,750
It's getting pushed out.
Crack's bad business.

621
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:42,554
Cluckers all crazy.
Die fast.

622
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:44,856
Strip a hood
of its potential.

623
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:47,090
Pushed out for what?

624
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,032
- Tar.
- Heroin?

625
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:56,800
Sleepers hold a job.
Less crime, less heat. Everybody wins.

626
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:59,139
Antwon the one
enforcing that mandate?

627
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:02,213
That part of his
community salvation?

628
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:04,874
- Ain't no salvation here.
- [Phone Rings]

629
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:07,178
- Yeah?
- [Shane] Looked into Ashmore.

630
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:09,049
Niners used to have
the lion's share...

631
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:10,917
but since this new product
hit town, it's real messy.

632
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:13,116
That ain't new product.
It's old.

633
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:16,717
Street's dumping all their crack
to make way for tar heroin.

634
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:20,321
- Who told you that?
- A guy with weight.

635
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:23,833
I'll see you.
Try to make it to the funeral.

636
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,427
Vic, inspector says
it started with a grease fire.

637
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:29,905
- What, engine grease?
- Cooking grease.

638
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,241
Shit.

639
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:36,245
[Mackey] How many more pictures of this kid
am / gonna find if / start opening drawers?

640
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:40,614
What are you talking about?
I care about him.

641
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,148
Guy dealing to Cyril-
his place got torched tonight.

642
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:48,693
Fire was started
with cooking grease.

643
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:55,458
You're not
a very good criminal, Cal.

644
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,764
I smell the smoke.
Please don't make me search the place.

645
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:03,102
- You screwing this kid?
- Don't say that.

646
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,108
Are you?

647
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,015
He slept here...

648
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,958
but I never laid a hand on him.

649
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:27,422
He wanted to get the operation
when he turned 18.

650
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,161
/ told him /'d pay for it.
We were-

651
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,430
We were gonna be together.

652
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,167
Jesus Christ!

653
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:38,300
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:41,703
l- I know it was wrong.

655
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:44,908
You could have hurt someone
setting that fire, Cal.

656
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:46,917
Nobody was home.

657
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:52,623
That dealer took away...

658
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:57,593
the only thing I love.

659

Thimerosal has been used...

666
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:35,464
as a vaccine preservative
since the '30s...

667
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:38,229
- even though it's 49% mercury.
- Which is extremely toxic...

668
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:40,237
especially with children
under three.

669
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:46,233
And you think this mercury
in the vaccine is the missing link?

670
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:48,245
Yeah, the increase
in the rate of autism...

671
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:50,747

in Thimerosal exposure.

672

There's no legal fees, Mr. Mackey.
We only collect if we win the case.

678
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:14,364

$10,000 to $15,000 per child.

I spoke to Chief Bankston.

690
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:56,405
He seems to be excited at the prospect
of netting Alex Kozodav...

691
00:39:56,515 --> 00:40:00,281
so the garage sting
will stay up and running.

692
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:07,792
- Did my name come up?
- Oh, / don't believe so, but Vic's name did.

693
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:11,556
Chief wants him running the project,
which keeps him on a tight leash.

about Kozodav.

He went behind my back,
got the chief pregnant on the idea.

Took credit,
covered his ass.

704
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:12,679
He also convinced the chief
that you should still run the sting.

705
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:17,057
- Means I gotta find someone else
to head up the task force.
- I can do both.

I can sell that to the chief...

is I give Internal Affairs full access
