1
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:13,070
The police department is ordering
you to disperse.

2
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,369
The men are coming under
increased attack.

3
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:47,169
It's time to pull back
or turn them loose.

4
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,369
I wish I knew.

5
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:55,891
Send them in.

6
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,669
I'm getting reports of a casualty.

7
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,269
Civilian. Female.

8
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,569
Rescue standing by outside,
affirmative.

9
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,769
- One Tango 13, respond.
- Connor and Adelaide.

10
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,769
- One Tango 13 responding.
- One Tango 19 responding also.

11
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:46,269
Hey, wait a minute. This is our call.

12
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,969
It's a crazy night out here.
You might need backup.

13
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,569
Hit the lights. Go around the park.
Don't let them beat us there.

14
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,769
- Keep them comfortable and calm.
- You got it.

15
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,069
- You mind sleeping on the couch?
- Hell, no. I've had worse.

16
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:06,269
- Cool. Just lay low until I find Gilroy.
- Okay.

17
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,269
- They're all asleep.
- Good.

18
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,869
You wanna tell me
why my children are in danger?

19
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,169
- They're not.
- Why are we living like refugees?

20
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,869
- I have to find out a few things.
- I wanna go home.

21
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,869
- We can't.
- Why not? What've you done?

22
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,569
What are you mixed up in? This doesn't
happen to other cops' families.

23
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:27,869
What are you doing that's worth
making us go into hiding?

24
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,969
I just need the four of you to stay here.
All right?

25
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,969
- We should've taken Caravelle.
- We'd still be at the park if you had.

26
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,269
- Guess we'll never know.
- Hey, was that a false alarm or what?

27
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,169
Oh, my God!

28
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,269
Officer down! One Tango 13!
Officer down! Rudy!

29
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:56,569
- Paula?
- He's dead.

30
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,169
- What?
- Up.

31
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:02,069
Come on.

32
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:04,369
Come on.

33
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,669
- Get down!
- There's more than one of them!

34
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,669
Up there!

35
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,369
They're gone.

36
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,569
Paula.

37
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:28,769
Paula.

38
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,904
- What happened?
- Someone made a bogus 911 call.

39
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,104
When the units responded,
they opened fire.

40
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,804
Thanks, Chris.

41
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,604
Who got hit?

42
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,304
Rudy's dead.

43
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:06,304
Paula's bad but has a chance. Danny
and Julien were there. They're okay.

44
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:09,204
Is this because of the dead women
who got stood up by 911?

45
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,604
- Yeah, looks like it.
- I want a shot at the SOB who did this.

46
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,204
Get in line.

47
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,804
Line starts here.

48
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,204
Hey. How you doing?

49
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,804
They killed him,
and Paula's really hurt.

50
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,704
I know.

51
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,904
We traced the 911 call to a cell phone.

52
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,204
Who's it registered to?

53
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,804
Police! On the ground, asshole!

54
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:42,804
- Hey, hey, hold up.
- Don't move!

55
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,804
Hey. All right. Nobody shoot, man!

56
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,904
- Where's your cell phone?
- I don't know. Maybe I lost it.

57
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,204
You hear about the cops
that got shot, Cyrus?

58
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,804
- Your cell was used to lure them there.
- I say I lost my cell.

59
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:56,804
Why don't you tell us for the third time
you got no idea how?

60
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,204
Don't get all surly with me.

61
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,404
Ain't a crime to lose your cell phone.

62
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,104
Hey, Dutch. You still on top
of this hit-and-run thing?

63
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,004
Yeah.

64
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:13,404
Any luck on the whereabouts
of our driver's girlfriend?

65
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,904
- You kept insisting it's a waste of time.
- What? You want me to say it?

66
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:21,104
Maybe I was wrong. What do you got?

67
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,304
Sedona Tellez used to work in
accounting for the department.

68
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,704
- What, our department?
- Yeah. Down at headquarters.

69
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:31,304
Two months into the job she's buying
up Farmington property with this...

70
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:35,304
...Cayman Island shell company.
- Did you cut through the paper trail?

71
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:39,004
All the land transactions went through
the same escrow company.

72
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:42,304
- Did you talk to them?
- Without a warrant, they won't let me.

73
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,604
How about letting me
take a shot at it?

74
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,204
Really?

75
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:50,204
I just wanna keep my fingers busy till
we find out if this guy's gonna crack.

76
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,104
Gilroy's not at home or his office.
The guy's a goddamn ghost.

77
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,004
- He's gotta be somewhere.
- Who knows where he'll be next?

78
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:02,904
Your house again? My house?
We have to find him before he finds us.

79
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,304
- Maybe he's hiding with the mistress.
- Oh, come on. He killed her.

80
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:09,204
- We don't know that.
- He threatened your family.

81
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:12,104
Brings up Terry dying.
He's taking his last breaths.

82
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,804
Will you stop making threats
and start helping me find the guy?

83
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,304
Now, dig in.

84
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,604
When did we start catching guys
by diving into financial records?

85
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:25,704
If Gilroy's gonna cash in on these
deals, he needs the girl's signature.

86
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:29,204
When we find this Sedona,
we find him.

87
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:33,004
Though I walk through
the midst of trouble...

88
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,504
...your hand will revive me.

89
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,704
- You will stretch out...
- Ready?

90
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,404
- Sorry.
- It's all right. I'm...

91
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:49,004
- You're shaking.
- No. I'm...

92
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,304
Julien, look, it's okay to be scared.

93
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:58,104
It is. I mean, you were almost
in a situation...

94
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:00,804
I almost lost my partner last night.

95
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,104
I'm just thankful.

96
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:07,704
Yeah, me too.

97
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:15,004
- This isn't the first phone you've lost.
- Excuse me?

98
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:17,404
I've talked to seven
wireless companies.

99
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,004
You've either had a phone lost or
cloned by each and every one of them.

100
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,204
- Always on the first of the month.
- Bill time.

101
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:29,304
You sell the phone to some grifter.
You wait a few days, report it missing.

102
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:32,204
Meanwhile, half of Union Station
is calling up Guatemala.

103
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:35,004
Or 911. That makes you
a felony accomplice.

104
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:39,004
Wait a minute, man. All I could tell you
is who I sell the phones to.

105
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:42,304
I wouldn't get mixed up
in no cop killings or nothing like that.

106
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,204
I mean, you guys
are the real heroes out there, right?

107
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,904
- Stop kissing ass and give us a name.
- His name is Igal.

108
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:51,304
- He's one of those Jews.
- Those Jews?

109
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:56,104
He's not American Jew. He's a real
Jew from Jerusalem or something.

110
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:58,404
- There's been another 911 shooting.
- What?

111
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,704
They got Patrick and Chris.
They're both dead.

112
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:10,204
- You see that?
- They took his badge.

113
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,404
Chris' too.

114
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,604
Jesus.

115
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:21,804
You know one of these vultures
saw something useful.

116
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,004
Wanna try the smoke-out?

117
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,804
Yeah.

118
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,904
Excuse me. Detective Vendrell.

119
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:35,004
Had reports someone
witnessed a crime or the perpetrator.

120
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,804
- What report?
- There wasn't one.

121
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:41,004
A woman was here when it
occurred. She didn't see the crime...

122
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:44,904
...but she did see another witness.
She's gonna be here in a few minutes...

123
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:48,204
...to identify you, so you may as well
come forward right now.

124
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,204
You, stop! Stop right there!

125
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,004
Stop!

126
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,704
Don't make me shoot you, asshole!

127
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:06,404
Stop!

128
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,104
- All right, you start talking!
- I didn't do nothing, man.

129
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,704
All right. Fine.

130
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:21,404
You're not a witness, then you're
an arrest, and this is just enough...

131
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,904
...to make you a trafficker.
- You can't do that.

132
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:27,704
What? Bust drug dealers?
You just made my quota for the week.

133
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,004
- Come on!
- Okay, look, man, I'll tell you.

134
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:34,304
- You just gotta get that rock off me.
- The whole truth first.

135
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:37,004
All right, look. I heard shots, man.

136
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:40,904
I see two cops go down, then someone
go over and mess with the body.

137
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:43,104
- Who?
- There's three of them, man.

138
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:46,704
- Blacks?
- Yeah. Two brothers and a sister, man.

139
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:50,104
Now, can you take the dope with you?
Please, man. Come on, man.

140
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:52,004
Have them secure the areas
before going in.

141
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:54,804
- Our artist just finished.
- How many copies did you run?

142
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:56,604
- Five thousand.
- Make it 10.

143
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,204
I'll talk to my contacts on the street.
Someone's gotta know these guys.

144
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,204
No one talks to the press but me.

145
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:06,304
I want every off-duty officer scrambled
and in this building within 45 minutes.

146
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,304
Wagenbach, why are you
sitting there?

147
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,904
I'm working a hit-and-run.

148
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:14,204
Well, stop. We got cops bleeding in
the streets. Half the district's on fire.

149
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,704
There's no other case. You and
Claudette will run the investigation.

150
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,504
- I was handling this personally.
- Not anymore.

151
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,904
Are you shitting me with this?

152
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:30,104
You had command of the riot squad
and a lady got trampled to death.

153
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:33,904
The shootings last night, I stayed out
of it, and now I got two more dead.

154
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:37,004
- I can't afford your leadership now.
- We're making progress.

155
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,704
Not enough. If you wanna cry
to the chief, give him a call.

156
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,904
But do it downstairs, because
I'm taking over your office.

157
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,904
Pete, I need the case file,
duty roster...

158
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,504
...and a cup of coffee,
not too much cream.

159
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,304
Pete, could you wait for a minute
outside, please?

160
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:01,704
Stay close in case
I need you, though.

161
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,904
- What do you want, Vic?
- You threatened my family.

162
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,404
If I wanted to hurt them, I could've.

163
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:14,504
You kept digging into Sedona and our
land deals. I was just refocusing you.

164
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:16,604
You know what you did.

165
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:20,204
- You know what I'm gonna have to do.
- You're not doing anything.

166
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:23,204
Not now. But soon.

167
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:26,504
You think I'd take you on
without insurance?

168
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,704
Trust me, I got something on you.

169
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,804
You bastard.

170
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:38,204
You hit that kid,
come begging to me for help?

171
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,704
- Call me friend?
- Stop chasing after me and Sedona.

172
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:46,304
Do what you do best.
Find these cop killers.

173
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:50,204
Okay, friend?

174
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:54,604
Pete!

175
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:57,204
Get me Donald Graham
on the phone.

176
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:01,804
I wanna get some of the Southside
boys here until we catch these pricks.

177
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,304
That's all for now.

178
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,804
Gilroy's really got you spinning, huh?

179
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,204
I mean, blame this whole mess
on you and then yank you off it.

180
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:32,604
We get these guys, he's the hero.
Either way, you're the goat.

181
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,404
Guess you can kiss that City Council
seat goodbye.

182
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:39,804
- You here to pile on?
- No. I'm here to help.

183
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:47,204
What if I told you there was a way to
flip things around, make you the hero?

184
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,404
Maybe even put your
political career on track.

185
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:57,204
- How?
- Help me take down a dirty cop.

186
00:12:57,504 --> 00:13:01,104
Gilroy diverted police units from
that part of town so crime would rise...

187
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,304
...and he could buy property
at a discount?

188
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:08,004
Led to the murder of those two women,
the riots, the cop shootings.

189
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,504
When he killed that kid
in the hit-and-run with his mistress...

190
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,104
...he was afraid it'd get out.

191
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:16,104
If that's true, why don't you
go upstairs and arrest him?

192
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:17,704
Because I can't prove it.

193
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:21,904
This land deal is a paper-trail
nightmare. I can't begin to crack it.

194
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,804
Your smarts, you could.

195
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,804
You're flattering me,
so this must be a setup.

196
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:29,404
It's not.

197
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,404
- Gilroy's bad.
- You can't get him on the hit-and-run?

198
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:35,004
He had the car fixed.

199
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:39,304
And one of the witnesses
was already killed in a gang hit.

200
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:41,704
What about the woman in the car?

201
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,704
Sedona Tellez.

202
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:48,204
Gilroy's mistress is the key. Find her,
she can give him up for the land deal...

203
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,504
...and the hit-and-run.
- Find her yourself.

204
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:54,604
- Gilroy wants me out on the street.
- And why should I do all your legwork?

205
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,604
Because when I find
these cop shooters...

206
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,904
...I'll let you bring them in.

207
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:04,004
That way you get the credit
for taking down Gilroy and them.

208
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,904
Sounds like a nice headline to me.

209
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,604
A little too nice. I don't know
what trap you've set...

210
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,404
I don't expect you to trust me.

211
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,904
But I know you're too curious...

212
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:17,404
...not to check in on it.

213
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,604
Trying to put AT&T
out of business, Igal?

214
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:27,104
No. I'm just trying to get by.

215
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:30,404
Each and every one of these phones
is either stolen or cloned.

216
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,004
I am as shocked as you are
to discover that.

217
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,304
I bet. Did you sell phones
to any of these kids?

218
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:40,804
- I don't know. What did they do?
- They killed three police officers...

219
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,204
...and put the fourth in a hospital.
- What? No.

220
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,004
- These are them?
- Yeah.

221
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,504
And they used your phones
to lure them there.

222
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:55,004
- No. This is horrible. I have no idea.
- So you did sell phones to them?

223
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,704
One each. Yesterday.

224
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,904
Please, tell me how I can help
you to catch these monsters.

225
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:03,704
- Give us the numbers of the phones.
- Of course, of course.

226
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,104
Now.

227
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:09,504
We were at Patrick's kid's party
weeks ago.

228
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,104
- I know.
- Jesus!

229
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:15,504
Let's hit south of Olympic. I'm giving
a reward to whoever ID's these three.

230
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,104
- How're my kids?
- Good. I rented them a PlayStation.

231
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,804
- Thanks.
- Hey, call Corrine. She's not thrilled.

232
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:24,904
- Okay. Call me if you find out anything.
- All right. Let's get them! Come on.

233
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:29,304
- Hey, it's me.
- When are we going home?

234
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,804
- I don't know. Hopefully a day or two.
- Day or two? Are you okay?

235
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,404
- Yes.
- Then what's going on?

236
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:39,404
I got things coming at me from every
direction. I don't need more problems.

237
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,904
What's happening to this family is the
problem, and you won't tell me why.

238
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:45,404
Just do nothing.

239
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:49,404
That's all I'm asking you to do. Just sit
there and do nothing. Is that so hard?

240
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:53,104
- I'm not your prisoner.
- Look, I'll tell you when it's safe.

241
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,104
Don't bother.

242
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,604
What's up, dog?

243
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,804
Tio! You're out early.

244
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,204
People's nerves are shot.
They need an escape.

245
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:28,504
Yeah, well, killing brain cells is fine.
Killing cops ain't. Let's go. Showtime.

246
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,004
Know anything about
these 911 shootings?

247
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:33,704
A lot of people think the cops
had it coming.

248
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:37,104
- I say we need to work with the police.
- I'm glad you feel that way.

249
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,404
- I need a line on these guys.
- I hear anything...

250
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:42,804
Not good enough. You're gonna
go out looking, be my eyes and ears.

251
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:45,304
Something happens,
you'll be my feet and hands too.

252
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,004
You'll have to get
off your corner and get involved.

253
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:52,704
- Shitheads sometimes brag about this.
- They do, we need to know.

254
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,504
- I'll get involved, see who's talking.
- You do that.

255
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:05,404
Yes. I wanted information on some
escrow accounts at your company.

256
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:08,204
Well, who can release
that information?

257
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:11,704
Good. Now, call him at home and tell
him that Capt. David Aceveda's...

258
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:15,004
...about to show up there
with 10 officers and a subpoena...

259
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:18,304
...if he isn't on the phone with me
in about 30 seconds.

260
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,904
- Yes, I'll hold.
- You got a minute, David?

261
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,204
- Yes, sir.
- Listen...

262
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,404
...I'm sorry if I was hard
on you earlier.

263
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,404
- Nerves get a bit raw at a time like this.
- Yes, they do.

264
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:32,704
And I know how bent up you are
about being pushed aside here...

265
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:35,904
...but I got something that might
help take the pain away.

266
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,104
Really?

267
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,904
You've always tried to warn me
about Vic.

268
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:43,604
But until recently,
I figured he meant well.

269
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:47,104
- Now I'm not so sure.
- What are you talking about?

270
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:50,204
There was a dead kid the other day.
Jesus something.

271
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,804
It got written down as a gang hit.

272
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,904
I've got a source, though,
says it was Mackey.

273
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,504
- What?
- I know how badly you've wanted him.

274
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:03,604
And he has a lot of friends
who don't wanna see him hang.

275
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,804
You're the only one
I can trust with this.

276
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,804
Get down!

277
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:16,404
Lock down the building!

278
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:42,704
- Hands up!
- Freeze!

279
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:45,904
Let's see some hands!
See some hands!

280
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,404
- Throw your weapons outside the car!
- You're just gonna kill us.

281
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:54,604
- I got a clean shot, captain.
- No. No shots until I give the word.

282
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,488
Copycats?

283
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,588
They're Latino, not blacks.
Everyone in the neighbourhood...

284
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:30,688
...feels like they can take a
free shot now.

285
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:32,988
Nice job.

286
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,988
That thing we were talking about.

287
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:38,388
- You interested?
- Mackey?

288
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:41,188
- Very.
- Good.

289
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:43,088
Let's talk.

290
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:51,088
Heard about some punk flashing
a cop's badge like it was a souvenir.

291
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:54,488
Talking about how he started shooting
and the cops ran like bitches.

292
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:57,788
- Know where this asshole lives?
- His old man's a heavy biter.

293
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,588
- All loused up.
- Great.

294
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:02,288
Dad's busy mainlining
and junior's a cop killer.

295
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:05,788
I doubt Mom's Betty Crocker.
Thanks for the fast info.

296
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:26,888
Police!

297
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:28,688
Don't move!

298
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:35,788
- Jesus Christ!
- What do you guys want?

299
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:39,688
- We're looking for your boy.
- Sonny? He ain't here.

300
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:43,388
- Where's your kid?
- I don't know.

301
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:49,288
Well, you better remember, or you're
gonna be visiting Jonestown.

302
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,988
In a brightly lit, cold cage.

303
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:57,688
I can get my boy down here,
but, like, what's in it for me?

304
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:03,388
I still got one vein working.

305
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,788
How much do you need, porcupine?

306
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:15,488
Two Tango 13, 911 call.
Woman caller reports she's dying.

307
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,288
8811 Lorraine.

308
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:20,288
That's three blocks from last night.

309
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:34,488
- Got yours on?
- Absolutely.

310
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:36,288
All right.

311
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,088
You call for the police?

312
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,788
In here!

313
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:01,488
Police in the house.

314
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,188
You got here!

315
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,388
What's wrong, ma'am?

316
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:09,588
Well, my daughter left
and I need to take my medicine.

317
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:12,488
- What medicine?
- For arthritis. It's over there.

318
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:14,988
You called us for your
arthritis medicine?

319
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:18,288
In the brown bottle over there.
Hand it to me.

320
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:24,688
- Ma'am, 911 is for emergencies.
- Well, this is emergency to me.

321
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:28,988
- How many?
- Two.

322
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,688
- What?
- Would it kill you to get me water?

323
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,788
Hey, boy. Where you at?

324
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:48,788
Mama's here.

325
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:52,188
Yeah. She got Jesus now.

326
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:53,788
She looks good.

327
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:56,488
She can't wait to see you.

328
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:00,288
Okay. All right, son.

329
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,988
He's on his way.

330
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:18,688
Yes sir...

331
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:24,588
One of the phones Igal sold just got
used to call an apartment in the Grove.

332
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,688
- Yes. Here we go.
- Okay, roll.

333
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,888
Mama?

334
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:37,488
What are you...?

335
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,488
Sorry, sonny. I ain't your mama.

336
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:46,488
Look what we got here.

337
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,888
Looks nice.

338
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:51,588
This what you used to kill my friends?

339
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:07,188
Oh, you cop-killing piece of shit!

340
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:11,588
- Who are the other shooters?
- Kiss my ass, man.

341
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,588
I can't tell you how much I was hoping
that's what your answer would be.

342
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:37,088
You wanna kill me, sonny?

343
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,488
Wanna kill me?

344
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,488
- Who are the other shooters?
- Dad!

345
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:55,688
- Sorry.
- What are their names?

346
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,988
- Benji and Twanya.
- Where can I find them?

347
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:04,788
We were gonna find some abandoned
building to squat in.

348
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,888
What part of town?

349
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:09,788
Near the Groves.

350
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,388
- Police! Search warrant!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

351
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:29,188
- Whoa, it's just us!
- We already got him.

352
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:31,188
What do we got?

353
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:35,388
- He's one of our cop killers.
- He was stabbing me with that badge.

354
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:37,988
Asshole.

355
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,688
You look fine to me.

356
00:25:57,988 --> 00:25:59,288
I'm listening.

357
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:02,288
First you want me to shut up,
now you want me to talk?

358
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:04,288
How many personalities
you got, lady?

359
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:07,088
Walking around
pretending to be a man.

360
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:10,188
- I know what you really are.
- You don't know nothing.

361
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,888
I know that leg's shaking.

362
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:15,988
Why'd you do it?

363
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,188
Three officers dead.

364
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:21,488
How many more lives
you plan on ruining?

365
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,088
More the merrier.

366
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:26,888
Bang.

367
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,488
It is...

368
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,288
...everything in me...

369
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:36,688
...not to slap you silly.

370
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:42,653
- Come on.
- No freebies, girl. Now, step off.

371
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:46,953
- Screw your mother in the ass, Tio.
- Already did twice this morning, bitch.

372
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:49,853
- Tio, I need another favour.
- You're as bad as her.

373
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:52,153
- How much money you got?
- A few thou.

374
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:55,853
Give it to me. I gotta grease a few
wheels. I left my play money at home.

375
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:58,553
- Come on.
- Can't say I ain't paying my dues.

376
00:26:58,753 --> 00:27:00,553
No, I can't.

377
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,653
Talk to every Boxcar Willie
and bag lady you see.

378
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:06,853
If our shooters are squatting,
I wanna know where.

379
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:11,153
- Looks like it'll be raining Jim Beam.
- Make it Thunderbird, it'll go farther.

380
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:15,353
I'm Sedona Tellez. I heard
there's a problem with the closing...

381
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:18,453
...on one of my properties.
- Actually, there's not.

382
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,353
Sedona.
I'm Capt. David Aceveda.

383
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,553
- Have we met before?
- No.

384
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,653
But I've got lots of questions.

385
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:31,853
Very nice. Quite a step up
from your place in Farmington.

386
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,653
I've done well lately.

387
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,353
Thanks to your corporation
in the Caymans.

388
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:38,753
That's quite the shell game.

389
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:42,153
If you were going to arrest me,
you would've taken me in.

390
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,353
Not back to my place.

391
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,053
Sure you don't want a drink?

392
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:50,253
How does it work,
this land scheme of yours?

393
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,353
I speculate real estate. It's no scheme
and it's not against the law.

394
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:57,253
Unless your boyfriend keeps police
resources from there...

395
00:27:57,453 --> 00:27:59,953
...so it stays a slum,
so you could buy it cheap.

396
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,853
Boyfriend?

397
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:05,253
Then he pours resources back in,
cleans it up and...

398
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:08,353
...you get to sell your properties
for a killing.

399
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,653
Wow, I should've thought of that.

400
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:16,253
I'm sure you did.
Seems a bit complicated for Gilroy.

401
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,553
I don't know a Gilroy.

402
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:22,253
You worked in his office for two
months. I bet you showed him...

403
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:26,853
...how to park pension funds into your
account to make your purchases.

404
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:31,453
Yeah.
I made a few calls this afternoon.

405
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:35,653
Now, let's talk about
your boyfriend's hit-and-run.

406
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:40,153
- I understand your anger.
- You don't know me.

407
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:44,053
Your father's a heroin addict,
your mother left when you were 9.

408
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,953
Am I missing
any of the broad strokes?

409
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:52,353
The two women who were murdered
across the street from you.

410
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,153
Did you know them?

411
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:57,653
- Saw them sometimes.
- Is that what this is all about?

412
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,753
Revenge?

413
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:03,253
- No, no.
- What, then? Just for kicks?

414
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:05,053
Deal with it.

415
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:07,653
You murdered three of my people.

416
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:17,553
Twanya knew the women good.
They looked after her.

417
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:20,853
Benji and me figured the three of us
should do something about it.

418
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,853
The police didn't kill those women.
Wally Forton did.

419
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,353
They called 911.

420
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:29,553
- You all took an hour to show up.
- So you kill three people?

421
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,253
Just cops.

422
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,053
Just like you all killed those ladies.

423
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:37,353
I don't care how right
you think you are.

424
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:42,953
I don't care what kind of bad life
you had. What you did was wrong.

425
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:47,153
It's as wrong as it gets.

426
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,453
Vic, this is Sedona Tellez.

427
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,253
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

428
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:59,753
She has a lot of interesting things
to say about our assistant chief.

429
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:01,753
So much for loyalty, huh, lady?

430
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:05,353
Ben's in love. I have a future.

431
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:11,553
Gilroy's not the only one
she implicates.

432
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:14,353
- Meaning?
- Meaning I was wondering...

433
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,453
...what your trap was and now I know.

434
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:19,053
You didn't think I'd find out
about the murder?

435
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,453
- What murder?
- Jesus Rosales.

436
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,653
The witness to Gilroy's hit-and-run.

437
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,353
- That was a gang hit.
- Are you in a gang now?

438
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,553
What, is she saying I killed Jesus?

439
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:32,153
She says a cop buddy cleaned it all up
for Gilroy. I wonder who that is.

440
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,453
- Not me.
- You wanted me to take down Gilroy...

441
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:37,553
...before he could take you down.
You're both filthy in this.

442
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,953
Hey, I had nothing to do
with killing that Rosales kid.

443
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,753
So if I checked out your place
I wouldn't find the murder weapon.

444
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:48,353
- No way in hell.
- All right. Let's find out.

445
00:30:50,053 --> 00:30:52,253
This is a search warrant
for your place.

446
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:55,053
Gilroy thinks we'll find something.

447
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:59,353
Ben...

448
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:04,453
Ben was at my house yesterday.
I thought he was there...

449
00:31:04,653 --> 00:31:06,353
He must've planted the gun there.

450
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:11,353
And why would Gilroy have a murder
weapon to an unsolved gang hit?

451
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,753
Because he killed Jesus.

452
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:23,253
- Oh, you are just full of surprises.
- I was in the room when he did it.

453
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:27,453
I found him. If I said anything,
it would've looked liked I was in on it.

454
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,153
And we all know
how squeaky clean you are.

455
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:34,153
- Gilroy had you get this warrant?
- That's right.

456
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:43,853
This warrant is six hours old.
You haven't searched my house?

457
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:47,953
I talked Gilroy into letting you
catch these cop killers first.

458
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,253
And then we're moving on you.

459
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:55,053
Yeah.

460
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,553
Hold on, hold on.

461
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:06,053
Okay, I got it.

462
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,253
Good.

463
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:10,553
That was Lem.

464
00:32:11,753 --> 00:32:14,353
They know where
the other two shooters are.

465
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,453
Now...

466
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,253
...are you gonna help
Gilroy frame me?

467
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:23,553
Or are you gonna go with me
and nail these bastards?

468
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:29,553
You sure the shooter's inside?

469
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:32,353
- Thunderbird did the trick.
- Couple squatters ID'd them.

470
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:35,353
Said the guy told them to get lost,
waved a gun around.

471
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,153
Good.

472
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:41,953
Now, stay close.

473
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:44,953
I know what I'm doing.

474
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:48,453
All right, ladies.

475
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,853
They wanna come peacefully, fine.

476
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:56,453
If not, they killed Rudy,
Patrick and Chris.

477
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,753
I ain't about the romance
I'm all about the finance

478
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,653
Hey, asshole.
One more inch and you're dead!

479
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:07,253
Now, put your hands on your head!

480
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,753
Okay.

481
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:11,653
Okay, it's cool. It's cool, it's cool.

482
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,953
Vic!

483
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,953
Don't! Get down on your knees!
Get down!

484
00:34:20,353 --> 00:34:22,753
Hands on your head!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

485
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:26,553
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah. We got it.

486
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:47,769
Great work, David.

487
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,069
You got that warrant for Vic's place?

488
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:54,869
Right here.

489
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:57,069
You ready to serve it?

490
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:00,769
He caught three cop killers, cleaned
up your mess, and you can just...

491
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,169
...stab him in the back.
- My mess?

492
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,669
I practically choked
digging through the shit.

493
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:09,969
- Mackey's just covering his ass.
- The land schemes? The hit-and-run?

494
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:13,069
You gonna try laying those
at his door too?

495
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:18,069
Don't come near this, David.
Especially without any proof.

496
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,169
Everyone's gonna know
what you did.

497
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,069
Last time.
Don't play with fire.

498
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,469
Get out of my office.

499
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,169
If you won't serve this,
I'll find someone who will.

500
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:34,169
You're fired.

501
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,169
- Anything?
- No.

502
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,269
Check the den again.

503
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,969
- Nothing in Matthew's room.
- Check the garage.

504
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:54,269
This gun is nowhere.

505
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:56,969
- I found it!
- What?

506
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:59,569
- I found it! I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

507
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:02,769
It was in the central air vent
in Cassidy's room.

508
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,269
Still loaded.

509
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:06,769
Sedona!

510
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,269
Come on, we gotta go!

511
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:14,969
Hi, Ben.

512
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:22,369
I figured you'd be at your place.

513
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,569
Looking for this, right?

514
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,169
Sit down, you prick.

515
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,169
It was just some insurance, Vic.

516
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:36,269
Yeah?

517
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,769
You should've taken out
life insurance.

518
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:43,569
Vic, please.

519
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:47,869
You planted a murder weapon
in my house.

520
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:50,869
A loaded gun in my little girl's room.

521
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:53,769
- She wouldn't have found it.
- I found it.

522
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:56,869
- Oh, you are so over, man.
- Vic...

523
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:59,469
I'm really sorry about all this.
I mean...

524
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:02,369
...there's a way out.
- Shut up, you goddamn drunk!

525
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,869
Vic, just drop me and Sedona
off across the border.

526
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:09,669
We got some money. We'll disappear.
You'll never hear from me again.

527
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:13,369
I can't let you walk away
from this, Ben.

528
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:17,069
I'd be giving up my job, my life.

529
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,169
We got a different price tag
in mind.

530
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,269
Oh, yeah?

531
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,669
- Then kill me!
- You damn right.

532
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,869
Well, come on already!

533
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:30,369
Just kill me, Vic. Go ahead.

534
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:33,069
But don't act like you're
better than me.

535
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:34,669
What things have you done?

536
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,969
What've you done,
then covered those things up?

537
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:49,169
- I'm not like you.
- Not yet.

538
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,069
Not ever.

539
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:56,969
If you really believe that,
pull the goddamn trigger!

540
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,569
Do it, man.

541
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:03,069
Come on, it's time, man. Do it.

542
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:06,069
Well, you're such a saint.

543
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:08,269
Pull the trigger.

544
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:14,569
Look, it's all right, man.

545
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,669
It's all right. You two got history.
It's not easy.

546
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,469
Okay?

547
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,469
All right. Let me do it.
Let me do this for you, Vic.

548
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:33,469
Please, Vic.

549
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:05,469
Looks like it's starting to work.

550
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,169
Us.

551
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:10,569
Yeah.

552
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,969
Of course, you never ask me
about my stuff.

553
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:18,869
I'm always trying to get you to open
up, but you never pry. Why is that?

554
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,969
You wanna talk?

555
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,069
We will.

556
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,569
I'll wait outside,
we'll walk out together?

557
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,169
Sure.

558
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:21,669
Boss, went by the hotel.
Your family's gone, man.

559
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:23,869
- What?
- They're gone!

560
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,369
Two of the shooters have been
detained, the other is dead.

561
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:43,769
Captain, can you comment on the
arrest of Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy?

562
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:47,069
The facts will show that
Assistant Chief Gilroy chose a path...

563
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,969
...that led to tragic circumstances
for the city.

564
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:53,969
Corrine!

565
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,769
Cassidy!

566
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:29,369
It's me. I'm really tired.
I don't know where we're going, but...

567
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:33,869
I know you'll
wanna find us, but...

568
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:38,269
... if you still have love for me,
you won't try...

569
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:40,569
... for a while, anyway.

570
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:43,069
I'm sorry.

571
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:53,469
I can't comment at this time
until we have more information.

572
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:56,469
- One more follow-up question.
- There you are.

573
00:41:56,669 --> 00:41:59,969
- I'm a sucker for a good show.
- Well, for us the show's over.

574
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:02,669
Husband shot his wife
because she lost his car keys.

575
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:05,669
He's already in custody. Wanna
pick up some food on the way?

576
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:08,269
Are you dragging me to that
Chinese place again?

577
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:11,569
- I got a thing for egg rolls tonight.
- You got it every night.

578
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:15,169
How about spareribs, roast beef,
anything else?

579
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,669
Oh, no.

580
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:35,369
Oh, that's okay. Okay.

581
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,669
Oh, God!

582
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:45,269
Goddamn it!

583
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:49,869
Do these arrests put you in the front-
running for the City Council elections?

584
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,469
In my experience, people hate being
told who to vote for. I wouldn't...

585
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:58,469
...declare me the winner quite yet. I've
enjoyed my underdog status up to now.

586
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:09,469
No...

587
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:13,669
But today's events can't hurt, right?

588
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:16,369
Let's focus on what today's events
really mean.

589
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,569
Three officers gave their lives
in defence of an institution...

590
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:22,069
...that their boss betrayed
for personal gain.

591
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,669
It's a scandal and an outrage.

592
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,169
The curse of corruption
has left its mark on this department.

593
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:32,069
Now we start the difficult task
of healing.

594
