00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,916
- Move.

00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,423
[Man]
What's up with my leg, man?

[Rapping]

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,190
[Groans]
My legs ain't movin, man.

6
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,599
I think that's
BettyJohnson's boy.

00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:31,370

turn that crap off?

[Helicopter Whirring]

13
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:50,622
Drive-by in the hood.
That's original.

14
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,256
Well, you know,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

15
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,267
The victims are all
decked out Spookstreet.

16
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,269
Driver was gone.
Must have fled.

17
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:59,601
We found a halfkey of
tar heroin hidden in the backseat.

18
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,369
- [Man Shouting]
- What's with him?

19
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:05,138
- Just babbling.
Paramedics say he's not gonna make it.
- Witnesses?

20
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,044
Oh, yeah.
They're just falling all over themselves.

21
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,674
See no evil, hear no evil.

22
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,656
[Rock]

23
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:30,703
- So?
- What are you hearing in
Juvie about Antwon Mitchell?

24
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:32,705
Besides, uh,
building parks...

25
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:35,776
and holdin' freedom rallies,
he's movin' tar heroin on the street.

26
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,077
Shane's been cozying up
to the guy lately.

27
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,046
- / think he might be in business with him.
- He's not my problem-

28
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:50,419
We all have a stake in making sure that
Shane stays out of I.A.D.'s headlights.

29
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:54,119
He gets in over his head, gets pinched,
we're his best chance of gettin'a deal.

30
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,526
No. Shane wouldn't.

31
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,794
He was ready to go to jail for Mara
when she almost killed Tavon.

32
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,267
He's a father now.

33
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,270
You'd be surprised what you'd do
for your kids.

34
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,237
[Curtis]
/t never goddamn ends.

35
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,901
[Ronnie]
We need to get back close to him.

36
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,478
Make sure if there's a problem
we can fix it before it's too late.

37
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,708
- I haven't talked to him since the shit went down.
- I'll deal with him one-on-one.

38
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,943
Look, I spoke to your C.O.

39
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:21,021
I want you to ride with
Danny and Julien tomorrow.

40
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:24,023
They've been assigned to
tap into the One-niners.

41
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,221
If anyone's running their mouth about Shane,
I want to hear about it before anybody else.

42
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,590
[Chattering]

43
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,758
- Carl.
- [Woman] Good morning.

44
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,632

[Chattering]

49
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,449
- Morning.
- [Man] Morning.

50
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,522
Um...

51
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:58,251
I think I've had a chance to meet
and speak with all of you...

52
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,260
but this is my first
opportunity as your captain.

53
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,331
[Applause]

54
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,664
/n the, uh- Excuse me.
[Clears Throat]

55
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,440
In the two-plus years
since this, uh, substation's inception...

56
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:20,105
the Farmington District has had
its share of successes and failures.

57
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,876
The difficulties
are well-known.

58
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:28,888
Unfortunately, the successes are mostly
known only in this house.

59
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:33,187
/ see a lot of wonderful people
determined to make a difference.

60
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:35,592
I wouldn't have taken
this job if I didn't.

61
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:40,093
[Clears Throat]

62
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:47,770
Actually, uh, I'm better one-on-one
than, uh, in front of a big crowd.

63
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,843
[Horn Honks]

64
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,378
They say you should imagine
your audience naked...

65
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,039
but, uh, with this crowd
I wouldn't suggest it.

66
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,174
[All Laughing]

67
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:59,445
- [Woman] Good one.
- Look.

68
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,855
I know what
it's like out there.

69
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,857
I worked this neighborhood.

70
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,951
You put your life
on the line every day.

71
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:11,862
The people that you protect don't
thank you enough for that.

72
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,957
So let me thank you
for them.

73
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:16,502
The problems here
aren't about personnel.

74
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:19,937
They're about policy,
and that is what /'m here to change.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,940
- [Applause]
- We-

76
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:26,240
We police a largely
minority district.

77
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:29,976
They're universally poor.
Most of them don't speak the language.

78
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:32,644
They look one direction,
see financial skyscrapers.

79
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:36,245
They look in the other direction,
they see the Hollywood sign.

80
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,951
In between is
the L.A. they know.

81
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,722
Gangs, drugs, fear.

82
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,821
We're not miracle workers.

83
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:47,833
We don't have any hidden
tricks up our sleeves.

84
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:51,371
We can't make fathers
want to stay in their kids' lives.

85
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:54,635
We can't, uh, solve poverty.

86
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:59,475
We can't take the addiction
out of heroin or cocaine.

87
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,243
Our job is to distinguish between
the criminals and the citizens.

88
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,253
/t's been too hard for the good people
and too easy for the assholes.

89
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,880
And we are gonna change that.
We are gonna turn that around.

90
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:13,516
- Yes.
- Last night- Last night...

91
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:16,960
three members of the Spookstreet Souljahs
were killed in a drive-by.

92
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:21,728
Three hours later, they struck back at
their rival gang, the Farmington One-niners.

93
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:26,033
Two more dead.
Five hours, five lives gone.

94
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,602
Uh, Steve. You're lead on the case.
What do we know?

95
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,772
Well, not much. We're currently looking for
the owner of the car, but he's AWOL.

96
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:38,340
- Witnesses?
- [Billings] None that are cooperating.

97
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,982
Starting today...

98
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:48,528
all drug- and gang-related homicides
will go through Vic Mackey.

99
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,689
/'ve posted a list of
10 detectives and 20 unis...

100
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,733
who will work
directly under Vic.

101
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:57,270
He'll be leading a task force
designed to learn everything we can...

102
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:00,534
about the roughly 50 gangs
who operate on our turf.

103
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:03,610
Their membership,
their businesses, chains of command.

104
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:07,613
Federal asset forfeiture laws
will now be enforced in Farmington.

105
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:12,618
A drug dealer uses a car to distribute drugs,
we're gonna seize that vehicle.

106
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,178
A gang sells crack out of their back room,
we're gonna take that home.

107
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,815
Stereo equipment,
plasma TV's.

108
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:23,727
Everything bought with drug money,
we're gonna take those assets, auction them off.

109
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:28,859
The D.A.'s office will get a third
to help finance further prosecutions.

110
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,631
A third will be funneled back
into the community...

111
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:36,233
for better social services, for safe playgrounds,
for after-school programs.

112
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:40,712
We want these people to know that we are about
more than just throwing their men intojail.

113
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,806
The rest of the proceeds
are gonna be used to help you.

114
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:48,149
Now, besides the, uh, grand reopening
of the men's room-

115
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:50,917
[Laughter, Applause]

116
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,353
uh, /'m gonna hire more cops.

117
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:59,160
/'m gonna authorize overtime when one of you
tells me that you need it to close a case.

118
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,167
I'm gonna purchase equipment
that actually works.

119
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:04,872
[Woman]
/t's about time.

120
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,339
[Woman]
/t's about time.

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,806
I'm going to encourage
informants to come forward...

122
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,106
by giving them a cut
of assets we seize.

123
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:15,010
Citizens whose fear and silence
the gangs depend on...

124
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,811
we are gonna make them
a better deal than the bangers.

125
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,945
/t'll sting at first. People
usually don't like change.

126
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:25,719
And I still wouldn't expect
any thank-yous...

127
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,795
but we will
make things better.

128
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,955
There's been
another retaliation.

129
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:34,057
There's one dead and two critical
on Alvarado.

130
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,971
The job is impossible.

131
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,234
I can't do it without you.

132
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,332
- So let's get started.
- [Applause]

133
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:46,379
- Thank you.
- [Cheering]

134
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:52,547

135
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:56,180
[Men, Women Chattering]

136
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,191
[Ends]

137
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:04,764
/ didn't think you could top
fixing the men's john...

138
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:07,060
but I gotta give
that speech four flushes.

139
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,067
Don't be too impressed.

140
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,137
I still haven't gotten
my voice mail to work.

141
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,706
A gang war's the last thing
/ need right now.

142
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,798
/'ll serve
all open warrants.

143
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,400
I'll double up patrols in Spookstreet
and One-niner territory...

144
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:21,345
get as many of these guys off
the street as possible.

145
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:24,315
What's the average life cycle
of days of rage in the Farm?

146
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:27,080
/'ve seen them as short as a week,
as long as a year.

147
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:31,089
Look. Dealing with these
gang beefs can take time.

148
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,591
- They're complicated.
- They're a bunch of kids shooting at each other.

149
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:36,185
Stop it, so we can move forward.

150
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:40,056
I don't know.
What do you think?

151
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,897
Sherman's march
through the hood.

152
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:46,769
Sounds like one step forward,
two steps back.

153
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:51,743
Aceveda's old office is now our command post,
courtesy of our new captain.

154
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:55,576
Uh, these all outline
all known gang turf in Farmington.

155
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,412
Each of you has been assigned
a territory to map.

156
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,750
When you're not answering 911 calls,
get to know it like home.

157
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,256
Take a Polaroid with ya.
If you see a shithead, engage him.

158
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,259
Take his picture.
Document his ink.

159
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,522
Get his name, street tag.
Bring it all back here.

160
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,090
Danny, Julien, this little sliver of milk and honey
is Farmington One-niner territory.

161
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:17,170
[Mackey] Now it's your piece of paradise.
Spookstreet and One-niners are warring.

162
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:20,069
/ want you to get in their face,
find out what they're fighting about.

Lem's gonna ride with you two today,
get you guys up to speed.

164
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,277
- Thought you were working Juvie.

00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,365
She knows he's never
held down a job.

484
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,961
Can we make a solid connection between
the house payments and drug money?

485
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,303
You gonna tell Choppa
we're taking his mom's house?

486
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,308
He's tough.
He could call our bluff.

487
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,378
What if it isn't a bluff?

488
00:28:15,014 --> 00:28:18,916
He doesn't I.D. the shooters,
help us stop this, we take the house.

489
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:20,918
I love it.

490
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,045
How old are the kids?

491
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:25,214
Young.

492
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:30,923
Could be a huge
P.R. nightmare.

493
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,521
Tossing two kids out onto
the street is not exactly...

494
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:36,193
the cleanest example
ofhow / want this to work.

495
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:38,361
Taking the house is
the only leverage we have.

496
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:42,134
This policy got a shitload of resistance
when / pitched it to Pol Com.

497
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:45,210
Chief bit because
nothing else has worked.

498
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:48,337
The last thing / want is to
give the naysayers any ammo...

499
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,644
to shut this down before
it gets a chance to take off.

500
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,949
[Mackey]
Rise and shine.

501
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:01,549
- Still playin', huh?
- Who shot at you?

502
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,526
- Last time /'m asking.
- Good.

503
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:07,087
- 'Cause I'm sick of you barking.
- Okay. Take the house.

504
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,099
- With pleasure.
- What house?

505
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:12,227
The one you bought
your mother by dealing dope.

506
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,238
Yeah, right.
You can't take shit.

507
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,831
Come with me.
/'ll show you.

508
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:18,910
[Chattering]

509
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:29,280
Do you know what
federal asset forfeiture laws are, Choppa?

510
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:31,185
Skipped that course
at Harvard, huh?

511
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,952
It means any property
bought with drug money...

512
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,790
or used to facilitate
the drug trade can be seized.

513
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,263
- I ain't falling for no bullshit.
- [Mackey] No bullshit.

514
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:44,268
Unless you prove you bought the house
legitimately, it's ours to put up for auction.

515
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,464
[Monica] We're not required to provide you
a defense either. Wanna fight this?

516
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,905
You gotta hire a lawyer
on your own dime.

517
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,137
Quit clowning.
This is America.

518
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,488
Turns out a One-niner named Puppethead
started this war.

519
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,717
Yeah. His shorty had a thing
for a Souljah's pogo stick.

520
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:09,886
- That right?
- Yeah. This is all about a jealous boyfriend.

521
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:12,623
I see my tax dollars
are being well spent.

522
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,496
- What do you want from me?
- I got the guy who started this.

523
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:18,729
I need you to keep these assholes on the street
from shooting at each other...

524
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:21,500
long enough for me to show the neighborhood
that things are changing...

525
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,939
that we got things
under control.

526
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,603
- What makes you think they'll listen to me?
- [Chuckles]

527
00:30:26,712 --> 00:30:30,910
/'ve seen you work a room. Even convinced
a few people you're on the straight and narrow.

528
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:34,611
Feel free to confess
that you're just a piece-of-shit gangster.

529
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,314
Thanks for the help.

530
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:43,694
- Detective Wyms.
- [Man] Yeah. Thanks for comin

531
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,957
- [Dutch] What happened?
- Guy bought a cup of coffee.

532
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:48,363
I opened the register to give him change,
he splashed me.

533
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,526
Grabbed my cash and ran.
I'm lucky the coffee wasn't hot.

534
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:53,298
- Your surveillance camera working?
- Got him on my cell phone.

535
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:55,374
- [Beeps]
- Didn't you talk to that guy today?

536
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:59,171
Yeah. He had
a rock solid alibi.

537
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,679
Aw, man. Aw, man.

538
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,750
- This is entrapment.
- [Claudette] How do you figure?

539
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,081
I'm a thief. He's telling me about asking
for change and then throwing coffee.

540
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:10,485
It's like giving a junkie
a syringe.

541
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:13,524
I was done robbing until
he put it back in my head.

542
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:18,156
That's our guy?

543
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:23,998
Uh, actually, we inadvertently slipped
a few details to one of our other suspects.

544
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:26,264
Kind of created a copycat.
But we got him.

545
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,704
Still working on
the original guy.

546
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:35,744
Way to go. You get assigned a simple
robbery, cause a crime wave.

547
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:39,079
Remind me never to
put you guys on a murder case.

548
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,755
Hope you're happy.

549
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:47,348
Keys. Thanks.

550
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:52,157
Hey. Called your dentist.
Paid for your choppers with cash.

551
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:55,859
- Tooth fairy wants 'em back.
- Man, I ain't giving you my fronts.

552
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:59,699
Either you take them out yourself,
or I get a pair of pliers.

553
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:06,009
Thanks, honey.

554
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,113
Vic.

555
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:11,115
What's up?

556
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:14,243
One thing we know about Antwon is
he don't like to strap his shit up.

557
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:17,789
- What'd you hear?
- Guy's fathered a dozen children
from six different mothers.

558
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,291
Even knocked up a couple from behind bars
by sneaking his sperm out.

559
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:26,524
Oh, shit. You hit up that many women,
you're bound to leave some serious scorn behind.

560
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:29,897
All right. Let's find out their names.
Anything about Shane?

561
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:32,402
- No. Not a word.
- All right. Keep listening.

562
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:35,838
Aloicious? Aloicious,
what've you got us into?

563
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:38,136
[Choppa] /t's okay, Mama.
They'rejust trying to scare me.

564
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:39,541
It ain't gonna work though.

565
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:41,636
/t's workin'on me.

566
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:44,147
/t's workin'on me, Aloicious.
Are you crazy?

567
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,275
- [Mackey] Can / help you?
- Let go of me.

568
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:49,149
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down. Who's in charge?

569
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:51,849
- Who's putting my babies on the street?
- /'m Captain Rawling.

570
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:54,858
You did this?
You're taking my house?

571
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,860
/'ve reserved shelter space
for the three of you.

572
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:59,590
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a shelter space?

573
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:03,190
The Department of Social and Human Services
can help you find permanent residence.

574
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:06,169
You wanna help?
You give me my home back.

575
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:10,402
- / can't do that.
- You got no right throwing
children out of their beds.

576
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:13,069
All your son has to do is cooperate
with our investigation.

577
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:15,738
He does that,
he will help us save a lot oflives.

578
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:18,578
My boy got shot at.
He's innocent.

579
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:21,118
Your boy bought your home
using drug money.

580
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,815
You knew where that money came from,
and you chose to look the other way.

581
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,256
You don't know what
it's like living here.

582
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,624
You think I can just pick and choose
how to go about surviving?

583
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:34,130
You don't have children,
do you?

584
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,067
[Shouts]
Do you?

585
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:40,036
'Cause if you did,
you couldn't do this.

586
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:43,631
- No mother could do this.
- Six children are dead.

587
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:46,540
- How do you think those mothers-
- You don't have kids of your own...

588
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,341
so you're throwing
mine out.

589
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:53,111
Just be glad that all you lost today
was your home and not your son.

590
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,118
Shut up!

591
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,188
You just shut up!

592
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,294
[Door Opens]

593
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,867
These are recruiters.

594
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:10,902
Newbies just got
their stripes.

595
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,437
They find the next generation
to bring in.

596
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:17,839
What's up, Lil Bull? Hey, man. I got some people
here want to take your guys's picture.

597
00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:20,639
Gonna make you all famous.
All right? Go ahead, man.

598
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,213
- Just say cheese.
- [Shutter Clicks]

599
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:24,373
[Julien]
What's your name, son?

600
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:26,246
Run, stupid. Run.

601
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:33,090
Come here. When a police officer gives you
an instruction, you listen. Understand?

602
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:36,184
- I don't want my picture taken.
- Then why are you hanging out with gangs?

603
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:38,559
- Hey.
- What are you, my mama now?

604
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:41,132
Go.

605
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:43,599
[Mackey]
Look. This lawsuit's gonna bury us financially.

606
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:45,602
But can you afford
not to sue?

607
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:49,470
The money I'm asking you
to put up for medical tests is peanuts...

608
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:53,671
compared to what two autistic kids
are gonna need over their lifetimes.

609
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:56,270
I work at a hospital.
What if I pulled some strings...

610
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:58,543
and found a way to get
the tests done there?

611
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:01,279
Well, the doctors I use
are experts.

612
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,821
They're expensive,
but their testimony carries weight.

613
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:06,789
Well, her friend Gail's
the head of pediatrics.

614
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:09,826
- That expert enough for ya?
- Talk to her.

615
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:13,830
If she's willing to testify
and can provide the credentials I need...

616
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:15,923
- / guess / can live with it.
- Good.

617
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:21,431
Can I at least
eat dinner in peace?

618
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:29,239
You know, this isn't about
right and wrong with you anymore.

619
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:31,578
/t's about pride.

620
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:35,051
Can't psychoanalyze killers anymore,
so you're giving me the once-over.

621
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:39,147
Okay. Uh, maybe it's easier to shoot yourself
in the foot and be a martyr...

622
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,351
than to be a captain
and make tough decisions.

623
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,792
You can always get
another partner, Dutch.

624
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:47,064
I don't want that.

625
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,192
What do you expect me to do?

626
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:53,396
Y-You're not
giving me any choice.

00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,650
[Knocks]

628
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,722
Hello.

629
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:13,948
I thought your shift
ended an hour ago.

630
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:17,153
/'m just finishing up
some paperwork.

631
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:20,288
Captain, / wanted to thank you
for including me in all this.

632
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,367
It feels really good
to have a mission...

633
00:36:22,468 --> 00:36:24,231
not just out answering
drunk and disorderlies.

634
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:26,361
Thank Vic.

635
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:28,406
He recommended you.

636
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:45,187
[Woman] There's no reliable evidence to prove
a causal link between thimerosal and autism.

637
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,521
/ won't do the testing
because / won't be a party to this lawsuit.

638
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:53,257
What about the 300% rise in cases
since they increased the vaccines for children?

639
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,960
Could just mean we're getting better
at diagnosing autism.

640
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,401
There aren't enough
case studies to prove anything.

641
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:02,565
They're shooting our kids up
with mercury.

642
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:05,609
You're saying that
it's a coincidence they're sick?

643

You love your children for who they are.
Just get out of the suit. Save your money.

poisoning our kids...

or you go tojail.
