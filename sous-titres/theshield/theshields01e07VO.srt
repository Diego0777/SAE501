1
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:21,899
You done already?

2
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,039
I need someone to listen to me.

3
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:42,419
- I'm busy. Maybe one of the uniforms...
- I said I need someone to listen to me.

4
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,556
Okay.

5
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:53,347
Did you wanna report a crime?

6
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:58,477
I've lost track of all the crimes.

7
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,648
- I don't understand...
- I've lived here all my life...

8
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:05,859
...keeping my complaints
to myself. But no more.

9
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:10,155
My apartment has been broken into
seven times in the last four years.

10
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,367
Seven times.
And you never catch anyone!

11
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:19,081
You have got graffiti and cuss words
on every single wall that you see!

12
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:24,253
I've got needles on my sidewalk,
beer cans on my lawn...

13
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,090
...and I stopped ducking at
the sound of gunshot years ago.

14
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:32,261
We can drop smart bombs
down chimneys half a world away.

15
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,348
But some sicko gets released from jail
because of a computer screwup...

16
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,350
...and rapes my niece.

17
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,569
How does this make sense?

18
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,368
I see yellow police tape
everywhere that I go.

19
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,873
And it's all sirens and helicopters
and searchlights.

20
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,375
You've got mothers
killing their children...

21
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,546
...children killing strangers, maniacs
flying airplanes into buildings...

22
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:11,925
...and I just want life to go back
to the way that it should have been.

23
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,685
What are you doing
to make us feel safe?

24
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:39,536
I love the action, but what
are we doing in Watts?

25
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,582
We got eight people dead.
Nine, if you count the foetus.

26
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:48,045
- Gang war on steroids.
- Chief doesn't like headlines.

27
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:51,048
If my ass is on the line,
I want my best man covering me.

28
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,008
Appreciate the compliment...

29
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:56,595
...but won't Northwest get pissed
with me and Shane on their turf?

30
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,307
- The lead detective is Carlos Zamora.
- Never heard of him.

31
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,934
He's a comer, but he's raw.

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,229
Built his reputation working with
gangs. Knows them inside out.

33
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,023
- He know how we work?
- Let him do his thing...

34
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,819
...you do your thing. I don't care,
as long as it gets cracked.

35
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:17,741
Carlos, Vic Mackey. Shane Vendrell.

36
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,077
- Thanks for helping.
- What gang were they in?

37
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:23,664
- "Toros". Biggest and baddest here.
- Cameras catch this guy?

38
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,999
Just for show.
VCRs weren't hooked up.

39
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:32,673
- Who's the mom-to-be?
- Lucy. She was Train's girl.

40
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:37,719
- Train?
- Train Guttierez. He runs the "Toros".

41
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:41,139
Well, Train's gonna
wanna retaliate bigtime.

42
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:43,684
We find who he's targeting,
we find who did this.

43
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,812
I'll talk to Train, make sure
his guys don't do anything stupid.

44
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,023
What makes you think he'll listen?

45
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:53,652
I used to be a "Toro" back in the day.

46
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,697
I've been able to keep
a pretty good lid on things.

47
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,118
Looks like the lid just got blown off.

48
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,546
The owner said there's
a high-school kid...

49
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,382
...who sweeps up at night.
Wasn't part of the body count.

50
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,010
- Kid call in sick?
- No. He should've been here.

51
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:21,305
Name is Jaime.

52
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,602
You seeing this?

53
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,105
- Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour.
- Paging Dr. Phil.

54
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,608
No wonder Gilroy called us up.

55
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:37,196
A gang war's about to explode and he's
playing grief counsellor to the soldiers.

56
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,907
You gotta let me handle this, Train,
me entiendes?

57
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,326
He's right. We'll handle it.

58
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm working this case with Carlos.
Who would wanna start a war with you?

59
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,836
- Things been peaceful, eh.
- Until tonight. So who was it?

60
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:56,507
- I told you, we've been handling things.
- Right.

61
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:01,929
- What's that bulge in your jacket?
- Yo, chill, dog.

62
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,766
Come on, man. What? What?

63
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,228
Concealed weapon.

64
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,440
- Suspicious white powder.
- Daily double.

65
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,028
So do I have to search all you guys,
or do I get some answers?

66
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:24,409
Is it the blacks, Chinese, "Los Mags"?
Who're we talking about?

67
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:30,332
The blacks. Wet Willie. He's been
making noise since he got paroled.

68
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:35,754
What do you know?
A clue.

69
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:43,637
Hey!

70
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:48,058
Why are you shaking down these guys?
They trust me.

71
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:52,896
- Yeah. I saw the circle jerk.
- You treat them like people, it works.

72
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,569
So does treating them like the killing,
dealing, thieving scumbags they are.

73
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:02,656
Mop-up boy went MIA tonight.
See if you can track him down.

74
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,911
- Where you going?
- Talk to Wet Willie.

75
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,330
I can do it. I know where
to find Wet Willie.

76
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,458
Hey, this might be your district,
but it's my world.

77
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,671
Different ZIP code, same pinheads.

78
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,216
Describe what you witnessed then.

79
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:25,846
Mackey put four bricks of cocaine into
evidence bags, two into weapons bags.

80
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,682
- Then he gave it to Shane, I think.
- You think?

81
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,187
You "think" is not "I'm sure." I called
IAD because you said you were sure.

82
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,355
- Okay.
- This is serious, Julien.

83
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,608
There's no point in doing
the right thing...

84
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:40,736
...if your testimony is vague.
- I know.

85
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,490
Now, did Mackey give Shane
the cocaine then or did it happen later?

86
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,950
- No, it happened then.
- Then say that.

87
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,036
The statement you give to Frances...

88
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,206
...Mackey's lawyers will twist
it into anything but the truth.

89
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:55,292
- Do I have to say this in open court?
- Hopefully not.

90
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,212
It won't be good publicity
for Vic or the department.

91
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,673
If it goes the way I've planned,
they'll take a plea.

92
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,926
- They'll lose their jobs?
- Oh, yeah.

93
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,335
Jail?

94
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,526
Julien.

95
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,604
Are you okay living with that?

96
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,691
What's fair for them out there
has to be fair for us in here.

97
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,374
"Facing Autism"? What's up with that?

98
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,794
That's Corrine's book.

99
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,007
A kid in Matthew's class
just got diagnosed.

100
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:49,346
Oh, man, that's tough.
Family must be devastated, huh?

101
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:54,184
Yeah. I had this cousin
who was retarded.

102
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:58,438
Autism isn't the same thing
as being retarded.

103
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:04,987
What is it, like "Rain Man", freaking out,
counting matchsticks kind of thing?

104
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:11,368
No. It's not the same thing.

105
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:17,249
You don't care to educate yourself,
why don't you keep your mouth shut?

106
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,505
Describe what you saw at that point.

107
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:26,884
Detective Mackey placed four bricks
of cocaine into two evidence bags.

108
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,970
He then took two bricks
and placed it into a weapons bag...

109
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,307
...which he immediately handed
to Detective Vendrell.

110
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,227
- Hey. I thought you were off today.
- I am.

111
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,730
- What are you doing here?
- Taking care of business.

112
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:44,860
I'm glad I caught you. I've been trying
to figure out how to handle this thing.

113
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:48,030
- And I had this idea...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

114
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,534
Julien, I'm your training officer.
You owe it to me to at least see if...

115
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:57,748
No offence, but I'm gonna go
my own way on this.

116
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,218
Okay, here's Wet Willie.

117
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,512
Take his buddy.
Keep him out of my way.

118
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,442
Go.

119
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,560
Wet Willie! Police! Stop!

120
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,605
- I said stop!
- I'll be with you in a minute.

121
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,817
Goddamn it! I said stop!

122
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:31,031
- You got the medicine?
- Right here.

123
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,956
Now, what do you want?

124
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,543
- What you sweating me for?
- I'm a cop. Slow down.

125
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,170
Slow down. Right here.
Hands behind your head.

126
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,381
- I didn't do nothing.
- Ever?

127
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,342
Or in the last 10 minutes, Kunta Kinte?

128
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,803
Suck my dick.

129
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:58,100
- What'd you say? Suck your what?
- Screw you.

130
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,602
So you've been
with your sick kid all night?

131
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,981
- He's been throwing up all over me.
- The mom can back you up?

132
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:10,487
My girlfriend, her sister, her friend,
the nurse at the free clinic. Man, why?

133
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,031
Never mind.

134
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,413
Suck your what? Suck your what?

135
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,498
- Hey. Shane!
- What's going on out there?

136
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:24,668
- Suck that, you piece of shit.
- Shane! Shane!

137
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:28,630
- What are you doing?
- Patty, call the police.

138
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,758
- Shane! Let's go!
- Call the police.

139
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,471
- What's going on out there?
- Get the licence plate!

140
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,642
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- No!

141
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,687
We're trying to prevent the war,
not start one, you stupid...

142
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:45,939
Goddamn.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

143
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:50,068
You're being a huge pain in the ass
lately. Should I take a piss on you?

144
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:55,365
- You're out of control.
- You want me out, say the word.

145
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,868
And don't think I won't!

146
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,621
You've gone over those things
10 times already.

147
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:05,709
He's a serial killer. Sally won't be
his last victim unless I catch him.

148
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:10,422
- You're obsessed.
- I'm dedicated. Hey, hey.

149
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,966
Come with me. You're too dedicated.

150
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:16,595
You need a gimme
to cleanse your palate.

151
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:22,893
- Low-priority files?
- Pick a card, any card.

152
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,479
What's the point of this?

153
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:28,315
We take half a day,
we make some citizen happy...

154
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,860
...and go back to your serial-killer
case on a winning streak.

155
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,738
- I don't have time for games.
- You're running in circles.

156
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:39,243
Now, I've got the cure. So pick a card.

157
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,961
My mother's being
robbed by a psychic.

158
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,338
- A psychic?
- Her name's Frida.

159
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,967
She's bilked my mom and her
friends out of thousands of dollars.

160
00:12:55,133 --> 00:13:00,055
What's the scam? Tainted-money con,
third-party ritual, elixir machine?

161
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,475
She claims to talk to my dead father.

162
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:06,270
My mom took out a second
mortgage on the house...

163
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:09,189
...to pay Frida for contacting
the spirit world.

164
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,316
But that's supposed
to be my house someday.

165
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:17,948
- Well, that is a problem.
- I know. What are you gonna do?

166
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,832
- Any luck with Wet Willie?
- He's not the guy.

167
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:31,044
We better find out who is before Train
makes a guess and starts shooting.

168
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,840
- Got a line on our missing mop-up boy.
- Yeah?

169
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,885
A gangbanger friend of his called
me and told me where he is.

170
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:42,014
- A banger just called you up?
- I told you, man, these guys trust me.

171
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:45,058
Jaime's bragging he saw the shooter
come out of the gun club.

172
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:49,480
- Great. Where do I find this Jaime?
- I got this one. Wanna back me up?

173
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,691
Just follow my taillights.

174
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:57,863
You sure you don't want one of these?
You look awfully tense.

175
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,324
I just testified before IAD.

176
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,620
I don't get why you'd complicate
your life by narking out another cop.

177
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,831
Because in my life,
I take personal responsibility.

178
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:10,751
You might wanna try it sometime.

179
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,017
Ouch.

180
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,010
Skipping out on restaurant bills,
outstanding warrants.

181
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:23,096
- You don't even have a job.
- I make money here and there.

182
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,266
I'm a cop. I know what
"here and there" means.

183
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:29,311
If this is what you're like,
I can't be around you.

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,980
I really think you could use a beer.

185
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,317
When this housesitting gig ends,
you won't have a place to live.

186
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:40,072
- Oh, whatever will I do?
- I'm serious. Do you even have a plan?

187
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,702
When was the last time
you even applied for a job?

188
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,790
What's your plan? To keep pretending
you're something you're not?

189
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:54,711
- It's not that easy.
- I'll try if you'll try.

190
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,761
- Jaime?
- Nah, Jaime left.

191
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:08,308
Try again, smart-ass.
Finish your drinks somewhere else.

192
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:14,398
Jaime, we hear you saw
the gun-club shooter tonight.

193
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,442
What colours was he wearing?

194
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:21,780
Stop posing for a picture
and start yapping.

195
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:25,325
- You saw the shooter, right?
- Maybe.

196
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:29,705
- What gang was the shooter in?
- You know who the shooter runs with?

197
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:31,895
No.

198
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,253
You're not blind,
and you only seem half stupid...

199
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,423
...so I bet you got a good guess
who this guy's affiliated with.

200
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,883
Tell us.

201
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,303
- You guys ain't listening.
- What gang was the shooter in?

202
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,598
The white people's gang.

203
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,642
Our shooter is white?

204
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,769
- Early to mid-30s.
- Gringo with a grudge.

205
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:56,440
- There goes our gang-war theory.
- More headlines the chief won't like.

206
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,233
The Latino community is on edge.

207
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,736
Raoul Jiminez is on his way
to hear our progress.

208
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,906
Jiminez? He run out of janitor
strikes to organize?

209
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:07,326
What pisses you off more?
That he fights the establishment...

210
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:10,162
...or that he usually wins?

211
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,998
Thanks for the new partner,
by the way.

212
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,460
- It's a hate crime.
- We don't know what it is yet.

213
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:20,964
A white man kills eight Latinos, and
you don't know if it's a hate crime?

214
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:25,761
My people are scared.
What are the police doing?

215
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:30,474
- We got a drawing of the shooter.
- Even the artist won't vouch for that.

216
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,018
Our witness didn't see much
past the white skin.

217
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,979
Release it to the press. Maybe
someone will recognize him.

218
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:40,442
It's so vague, every Anglo on the street
is gonna look like a suspect.

219
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:44,571
- Now you know how we feel every day.
- Please. Save it for the microphones.

220
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:47,908
I think it's important the public
knows who the enemy is.

221
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,744
It's a waste of time, Ben.

222
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,997
Release the sketch.

223
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:04,132
Since when do we kowtow
to the "Mexico First" crowd?

224
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:07,469
If we don't include him,
he'll make our lives hell.

225
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,137
Let him try.

226
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,307
Have you driven around the city
lately? He's the majority now.

227
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:15,310
- We're still wearing the badges.
- Yeah, for the time being.

228
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,939
How is screwing up an investigation
gonna keep Jiminez off our backs?

229
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,067
I'm counting on you not to screw it up.

230
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:25,028
Bring in this killer and we keep
our badges another day.

231
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:28,615
- Hey, no one's taking mine away.
- We're dinosaurs, Vic.

232
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:33,203
And make no mistake,
the meteor's coming.

233
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,418
Your son says you're being
swindled by this psychic.

234
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,670
Frida's not a psychic,
she's a medium.

235
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:45,048
She predicted Gene would
go to the police, didn't she?

236
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,429
Yes. She said Gene was waiting for
me to die so he could get my money.

237
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:54,391
You do know these so-called
psychics are all frauds, right?

238
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,896
Well, most of them are, but not Frida.
She brings me messages from Frank.

239
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:03,358
- Frank?
- He was my husband. Cancer got him.

240
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:07,696
How do you think Frank would feel
if you lost the house you lived in...

241
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,907
...to keep paying this medium?

242
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,161
I'd pay anything to talk to Frank.

243
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,332
- Detective Mackey? I'm with...
- IAD. Yeah, I remember.

244
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:22,920
An investigation has been initiated
into your actions on April 2nd.

245
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,882
Look over these charges and decide
if you'd like a formal interview.

246
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,929
Vic. We got five people shot dead
in a family grocer's, all Latinos.

247
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:36,433
- This one's in your district.
- I'll have to get back to you.

248
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:46,151
Here they come. Secure the front.
Don't let anybody else in, okay?

249
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:51,824
- Officer.
- Detectives.

250
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:54,326
- What happened?
- Guy came in blasting.

251
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:56,995
Killed everybody in here
except the owner in back.

252
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,749
He heard the shots, came out with
a baseball bat and ran the shooter off.

253
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:07,130
- Where's the owner now?
- He's pretty upset. This was his son.

254
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,096
- My boy.
- You were back here?

255
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,225
- Yes.
- And you grabbed the baseball bat?

256
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:22,104
That baseball bat over there?

257
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,523
Now the shooter, he was white?

258
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,777
What happened after
you chased him out?

259
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:33,657
- He got away.
- On foot? He didn't get into a car?

260
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:36,368
- No.
- Well, which way did he run?

261
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,662
I don't remember.

262
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:41,999
There's blood on this bat.
Did you hit him with it?

263
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,003
I guess. I don't remember.

264
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:50,716
Our bad guy may have ran away,
but this being L. A...

265
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:53,010
...I'm guessing he drove here.

266
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:57,097
Check the plates on these cars. Match
them up and see what stands out.

267
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,141
You want me doing grunt work?

268
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,977
Yeah. Because, A, it's important...

269
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:06,273
...and B, I don't really feel like
hearing you talk this morning.

270
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,319
I got a 10-square-block
perimeter being roped off.

271
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,988
If he's on foot and bleeding,
we'll get him.

272
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:16,617
Oh, gee, I wonder what
took them so long.

273
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,785
Can I help you?

274
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,997
We're investigating complaints
about your business practices.

275
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:25,083
I offer a money-back guarantee
to those who are unhappy.

276
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,127
Very few people request it.

277
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,421
Six hundred dollars for a candle?

278
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:32,299
Looks like the kind I get
at the 99-cent store.

279
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,343
The candle itself is ordinary.

280
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,221
It's the blessing ceremony
that makes them so valuable.

281
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,349
Blessing ceremony.
What does that entail?

282
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:43,685
Taking the price tag off,
sticking it on a shelf?

283
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,523
We'd like you to come with us,
answer a few questions.

284
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:56,740
You yearn for a young woman
who doesn't yearn after you.

285
00:20:57,866 --> 00:21:01,662
What? You see I'm not wearing a ring,
you figure a guy who shops at the...

286
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,999
...99-cent store is single and has the
hots for some woman out of his league.

287
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,336
Is now when I fork over a week's
salary for a candle, or...?

288
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,424
She's someone that you work with
or work close by.

289
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,346
Come on, let's go.

290
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:23,600
You're wasting your time
with her, you know.

291
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,436
Frances will ask about
the night you stole the truck.

292
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:29,189
And this'll clean the slate
on all my charges, right?

293
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:32,568
Right. So long as you tell the truth.

294
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,529
- So how do you want me to do it?
- Do what?

295
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,657
Tell my story. I mean, you're paying,
so you get to pick.

296
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:43,412
I can be all sweet and innocenty, like:

297
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,707
I don't know what possessed
me to steal the truck that night...

298
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:51,920
...but when I found those bags of
cocaine inside, I got so scared.

299
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:57,259
Or I can be all biker-chick,
master-thief girl.

300
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:01,346
Like: I ripped the Navigator,
was on my way to get it chopped...

301
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,765
...and I stumble across
these two keys of blow.

302
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:08,145
- How about sincere and honest?
- Not my best one.

303
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,232
- Don't get too cute with her.
- But I am cute.

304
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:17,696
- Are you involved with anyone?
- Excuse me?

305
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,782
Well, my most recent lover
just died of a drug overdose...

306
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:27,247
...thanks to high-octane stolen coke,
so I find myself sexually available.

307
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:35,547
If by involved you mean married with
a baby girl, then the answer is yes.

308
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:41,428
Damn. Think of the things I could get
away with if I was banging a captain.

309
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,682
Stay out of trouble so I don't
have to see you again.

310
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:50,646
- Oh, but you wanna see me again.
- No, I don't.

311
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:57,653
If I was 18 and single,
maybe it'd be a different story.

312
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:01,323
Oh, I would've chewed you up
and spit you out when you were 18.

313
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,952
I wouldn't be so sure.

314
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,123
The other shop owners
tell the same story.

315
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,376
They heard gunshots,
but didn't see anything.

316
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:16,046
Nobody looked out and saw
which way this guy went running?

317
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,258
- That's what they say.
- That doesn't pass the smell test.

318
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,394
Vic!

319
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:29,977
This is the only car whose owner
is unaccounted for.

320
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,146
Check it out.

321
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,068
- Spare ammo.
- Who's the car registered to?

322
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:43,532
- A George Michael Klassen.
- Nice to meet you, you sick prick.

323
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,096
All clear.

324
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:14,480
Oh, goddamn it.

325
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,940
As I was going through the truck,
I found...

326
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,862
...some guns and two bags of cocaine.

327
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:26,200
Okay, let's go back
to stealing the vehicle.

328
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:29,870
You saw Detective Vendrell
park the truck, get out...

329
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:32,498
...and go inside the building.
-Yes, ma'am.

330
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:35,542
And no one went in or out of the truck
between the time...

331
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,836
...he left it and the time you stole it.

332
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,172
No, ma'am.

333
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,134
It's always sad when the people
that you expect to enforce the law...

334
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,677
...break it themselves.

335
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:52,142
Canvass the place. Find out
if anybody saw a car pulling out.

336
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,646
We found two bodies inside.
They're George's in-laws.

337
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:58,857
- Oh, my God.
- But his wife and son, they're not here.

338
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,777
We're afraid George might have
taken them with him.

339
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:03,987
Any idea where your brother
might have gone?

340
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,656
No.

341
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:08,075
Any place he might feel
comfortable hiding?

342
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,577
- No.
- This is important.

343
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,163
We have to find him before
he does any harm to them.

344
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,291
Well, I can't imagine George
would ever hurt Myra or Brady.

345
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,920
Can you imagine him killing
15 people in cold blood?

346
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,257
Well, that's different.

347
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:27,344
I mean, you have to understand.

348
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:31,974
This used to be a nice place to live.
Clean, safe.

349
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:36,395
George just got fed up being
surrounded by all the spics.

350
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:39,273
Can you blame him?

351
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:45,237
Klassen's picture's plastered
all over the news.

352
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:48,198
He can't step outside without
somebody spotting him.

353
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,534
That doesn't help us save
his wife and boy.

354
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:53,495
I'm more concerned about what
you're doing to stop the next attack.

355
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,206
Everything we can.
We know who he is. We got his car.

356
00:25:56,373 --> 00:26:00,085
We got units on his family and
friends. We got every base covered.

357
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,672
Waiting around for him to make
his next move isn't gonna cut it.

358
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:04,923
Where you going?

359
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:11,513
Hey, as long as he's got it all covered,
I'm gonna go check on something.

360
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:30,491
Getting a nice tan?

361
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:33,494
About all I'm good for, I guess.

362
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,372
- You find any blood out here?
- Nope.

363
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,543
So there was blood on the bat
and nowhere else?

364
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:45,297
There's some blood in the store
unconnected to any of the victims.

365
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:46,590
Show me.

366
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:52,262
Shooter loses this much blood and
doesn't drip any on the pavement?

367
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:54,681
Maybe he went out the back.

368
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,727
- SID check it?
- Beats me.

369
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:08,987
Looks like somebody did
a nice little sweep job.

370
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:13,075
Yes, it does. Makes you wonder why.

371
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:17,454
You know, Houdini wanted desperately
to believe in the paranormal.

372
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:21,625
Couldn't abide the fakes and frauds.
Spent his life trying to debunk them.

373
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,502
Still held out hope, though.

374
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:29,216
Before he died, he gave his wife
Beatrice a secret password...

375
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,302
...that he promised her he'd try
to send her from the afterworld...

376
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:35,389
...so she could tell the difference
between phoneys and the real McCoys.

377
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:39,226
When he passed away,
Beatrice travelled the globe...

378
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:44,481
...met with every gypsy, psychic,
tarot-card reader she could find.

379
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:47,693
Not one of them
ever got the password right.

380
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,945
Houdini should have
had a little more faith.

381
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:54,616
- Faith?
- On Sundays they call it Christianity.

382
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,410
The afterlife's no different.

383
00:27:56,577 --> 00:28:02,082
Church only takes you for 10 percent.
You've been wringing these ladies dry.

384
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:06,253
If they refuse to press charges,
you can't touch me.

385
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,298
If I find out you still have your hooks
in these women...

386
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:12,301
...I'll find other charges to press.

387
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:15,095
- Fire code violations.
- Parking tickets.

388
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:21,602
Zoning laws. You name it, I'll find it.
How's your future looking now?

389
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,187
What do you want from me?

390
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,522
It's time to get some new marks, honey.

391
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:37,242
What the hell is he doing?

392
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:43,332
- You arrested the shop owners?
- Brought them in for questioning.

393
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:46,251
- Why?
- Their stories didn't make sense.

394
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:50,464
Leon's son died four hours ago. How
much sense is he supposed to make?

395
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,466
If he knows something, we need it.

396
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,344
You don't interrogate a grieving father!

397
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:58,680
And you don't get answers from
people by passing around hugs.

398
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,391
You don't get them
by pissing on people either.

399
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:04,561
We've got a racist madman
targeting Latinos...

400
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:07,397
...and you want to interrogate
the victim's family?!

401
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:11,527
When you trade your megaphone for a
badge, that's when I'll seek your input.

402
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,489
I insist on witnessing the interviews...

403
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:18,200
...to ensure these men and women
aren't mistreated.

404
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:20,661
- No.
- Excuse me?

405
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:22,329
I've included you as a courtesy.

406
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:25,040
It's time to give my men
the space to do their jobs.

407
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:28,210
His wife and 10-year-old son
are missing.

408
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,463
- My son's dead.
- You're not telling me the truth, Leon.

409
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,298
- Yes, I am.
- You know something.

410
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:34,550
No.

411
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:39,304
If you're lying so you can get to your
son's killer before us to get revenge...

412
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:43,142
...I can't let that happen.
- I don't know anything.

413
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,313
Then why are you and the other shop
owners all telling the same lie?

414
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,863
And why did someone sweep the path
in the back alley after the shootings?

415
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,866
Leon?

416
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:02,536
You can tell me.
What did you really see?

417
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:05,956
"Nada". I didn't see nothing.

418
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:19,136
I just talked with Frances. You've got
her looking into the Strike Team again?

419
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:20,898
Yes.

420
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:24,099
You ever plan on telling me about it?

421
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:27,227
I didn't wanna bother you with it
until things were more definitive.

422
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:29,396
I got a problem in this squad, David.

423
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:32,065
My captain and my best cop
aren't getting along.

424
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,902
We stand for different things.

425
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:40,991
Well, you better make friends,
or I'm gonna have to make a choice.

426
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:45,078
And I don't think
you're gonna like that choice.

427
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:55,255
Maybe you should read this
before you make any choices.

428
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,176
You're gonna need a signature
on this here...

429
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:03,096
I've been getting some very strong
signals at this desk.

430
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:08,310
Gee, the desk that
I work at? Spooky.

431
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,231
I'm getting an S name.
Is there a Sarah?

432
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,609
Sorry, no Sarahs.

433
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:18,737
Or a Sally.

434
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:23,200
I think there's a Sally.

435
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,412
Do you know who I'm talking about?

436
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:36,046
You going through my desk?
Reading my file on Sally?

437
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:37,256
No, I didn't.

438
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:40,342
Frida! There you are!

439
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:44,805
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

440
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,562
Yeah. Let's all talk in another room.

441
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,774
Follow me.

442
00:31:57,943 --> 00:32:00,404
She has a message for you.

443
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:07,744
There's an innocent woman and
an innocent kid in danger out there...

444
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:11,874
...and you're not telling me the truth!
- Yes, I am!

445
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:20,257
Someone's holding a gun
to their heads right now...

446
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:22,342
...and you're stopping me
from finding them.

447
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,510
I'm not.

448
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:27,055
You might as well be pulling
the trigger. Tell me the truth!

449
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:30,184
- I am!
- He doesn't know anything.

450
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,603
Yes, he does.

451
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,397
- You gonna pull the trigger on that kid?
- Vic!

452
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:41,487
What does that make you?

453
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,073
- What if it was your boy?
- My boy's dead.

454
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:48,994
That's because I couldn't stop the
racist pig from pulling that trigger.

455
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,538
Don't be like the man
who killed your son.

456
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:56,710
- I'm nothing like him.
- Then show me. Show me.

457
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:05,260
I heard the shots...

458
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:07,971
...the shots that killed Favian.

459
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:11,433
When I came outside, the man
was standing there with his...

460
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:16,313
With his back to me.
I hit him with a baseball bat.

461
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,524
Knocked him out.

462
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:20,818
What did you do with him?

463
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:23,612
My friends heard the noise.
They came over.

464
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:27,991
They dragged him out the back.
That's why we swept up afterwards.

465
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,788
- What did you do with him?
- He killed my boy.

466
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:36,834
- I know.
- So I wanted to kill him back.

467
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,168
I know.

468
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:42,422
I couldn't do it, though.
I didn't have the courage.

469
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:44,758
So, what did you do with him?

470
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:50,347
We gave him to the "Toros".
I couldn't kill him...

471
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,976
...but I knew they would.

472
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:59,898
Oh, shit. The in-laws were killed
after the grocery shootings.

473
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:04,611
- So Train or his guys killed them.
- They got the wife and kid.

474
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:07,573
God help you.

475
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,912
Look out! Heads up!

476
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,961
- Where's Train?
- Get him off me!

477
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,839
I can't do that, Lucas.
You went too far. What did you do?

478
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,925
- He had it coming.
- Did the wife and kid have it coming?

479
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,803
- We were making things better.
- We didn't start the killing.

480
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:33,182
Where's Train keeping his family?

481
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:35,726
You wanna tell me
with your teeth or without?

482
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:39,688
He's not gonna let you
beat me down. He's one of us.

483
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:44,193
Not after what you did. Now, where
do we find this guy's wife and kid?

484
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:51,158
You didn't see this coming.
You didn't see this.

485
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:54,244
- Please don't hurt him.
- What? What? You wanna kiss me?

486
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:57,623
Please, don't.
We'll do anything you want. Just... No.

487
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:01,376
- Let go. Please. George!
- Don't touch my mom!

488
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:03,170
Brady! No!

489
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,304
- Train! Don't do this, Train!
- Put it down!

490
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:17,142
- For Lucy.
- No!

491
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:28,195
He had to pay.

492
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:32,825
And who's gonna pay now?
Who's gonna pay?

493
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:36,328
We all pay, man.

494
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:41,917
He's gonna pay for the rest of his life.
You don't want to. Trust me.

495
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,562
It's okay. You're all right.

496
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,231
We've gotta get Vic Mackey
off the streets.

497
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,108
- Have you taken his statement yet?
- No.

498
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:09,945
- But you have to admit, it looks bad.
- Very bad.

499
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,990
We need to keep this thing
under control.

500
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:15,534
How can we?

501
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:21,248
The chief is gonna have a heart attack
when he hears about this.

502
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,834
If the press gets ahold of it...

503
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,712
Goddamn it.
This is the last thing I needed.

504
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:30,424
I'll talk to my people, make sure
there are no leaks on this end.

505
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,801
Yeah, me too.

506
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,762
Okay. Good.

507
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:38,640
I just need a few days to figure out
how to handle this.

508
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:53,197
- What's going to happen to them?
- What do you think?

509
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:55,949
They handed a man over
to gangbangers to be killed.

510
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:57,534
They handed over a hatemonger.

511
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,954
Their actions led to three people
being killed.

512
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:04,458
And a woman being sexually assaulted
in front of her 10-year-old son.

513
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,711
- They couldn't have foreseen that.
- They conspired to kill a man...

514
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,838
...and then tried to cover it up.

515
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:14,927
They're victims. My group won't let
this department turn them into martyrs.

516
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,596
I thought martyrs
are what brought in the donations...

517
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:19,640
...and got your name in the papers.

518
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:23,894
I'll see they don't spend
one day in jail.

519
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:27,773
They probably won't.

520
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:30,943
I should get going.

521
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:33,445
Can I give you a lift?

522
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:36,657
No, I got one.
Thanks for the offer, though.

523
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:38,617
Offer's always good.

524
00:37:56,802 --> 00:38:00,597
Sir, do you have a minute?

525
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,229
Sorry. I missed dinner.
What can I do for you?

526
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:10,774
I don't think that Julien and I are
turning out to be a good match.

527
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,985
- Really?
- I just think he might be better off...

528
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:16,530
...with a different training officer.
Finnegan's not riding with anyone.

529
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:19,908
- I could take the next candidate.
- Julien's going through a tough time.

530
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,452
He needs you now more than ever.

531
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,872
You're as good as we have.

532
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:28,500
You'll work things out.

533
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,213
- How could you do this?
- It was a mistake.

534
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:36,008
We were gonna use the coke
for an undercover bust.

535
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:38,844
I didn't do the paperwork.
When it got stolen with the truck...

536
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:42,264
- Is that what you plan on telling IAD?
- Come on, what do they have?

537
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:46,351
- A car thief as a witness? Please.
- She's convincing.

538
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:49,730
Plus, there's the officer who saw you
take the stuff in the first place.

539
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:55,611
They've established chain of custody.
From you to the truck to the OD victim.

540
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:59,114
Shane was the one in possession
of the drugs.

541
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:02,117
- He's the one that got the truck stolen.
- Ben, no!

542
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:05,662
I don't have the juice anymore
to protect all of you.

543
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:10,834
Shane had the drugs.
We lay it all on his doorstep.

544
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:16,298
It's either that or you two
can share a cell.

545
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:24,681
You don't have to like it,
but it's time to serve him up.

546
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:37,319
- I was just about to close.
- What was Sally's message?

547
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:43,617
- She says not to give up.
- I haven't.

548
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:47,955
She says you're the only one
still fighting for her.

549
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:50,499
What else did she say?

550
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,697
You have something for me?

551
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,076
An IAD file of a current investigation
my people are trying to cover up.

552
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,288
Dirty cops? Why give it to me?

553
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,876
You'll see it gets the publicity
it deserves.

554
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:41,383
And if you leak it to the press,
it'd look self-serving.

555
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,510
You want it or not?

556
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:44,845
Of course.

557
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:50,142
Don't worry, David. I'll make sure
they spell your name right.

558
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:59,026
That's my book.

559
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:06,116
The reason I have it is because
Matthew has autism.

560
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:09,286
- We found out a few weeks ago.
- Oh, Jesus.

561
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,836
- Oh, Vic. Vic, I'm sorry.
- It's been tough. Lot of work.

562
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:22,716
You know, the one thing
I've learned is...

563
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:26,303
...I goddamn love that kid
more now than ever.

564
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:31,767
Hey, he's got problems, you know...

565
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:35,854
...but I'm never giving up on him.

566
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:53,789
I'm not giving up on you either, Shane.

567
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:00,921
I'm gonna have to get a little creative
on this "past job experience" section.

568
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:03,006
Creative's cool. Just don't lie.

569
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:06,802
Though I might need a few glasses
of wine to get that creative.

570
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:09,847
Let me just skip on down here to the...

571
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:13,433
What's this? References. References.

572
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:20,315
It wouldn't hurt to have a glowing one
from a respected city police officer.

573
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,779
- What, you're not gonna help me out?
- I can't.

574
00:42:26,363 --> 00:42:28,907
Unbelievable.

575
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:31,577
Good enough to suck,
but not good enough to vouch for.

576
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:32,995
That's not it.

577
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,706
I know. You won't even come out
to my perspective employer.

578
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:39,001
- What kind of lie is that?
- I can't.

579
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:43,733
I'm just not ready to tell anyone.
The people in my life... I can't.

580
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,018
- You said you were trying.
- I am.

581
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,093
- No, you're not.
- I am.

582
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,263
Do you know what it takes for me
to keep coming back here?

583
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:56,977
I mean, I was taught...
I was told to believe things.

584
00:42:57,186 --> 00:43:01,482
In spite of those beliefs, I keep
coming back here night after night...

585
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,525
...because I care about you.

586
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:08,019
See?

587
00:43:09,406 --> 00:43:11,700
I'm trying.

588
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:15,662
Just being here is trying.

589
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:54,224
Police.

590
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,805
Tomas Motyashik?

591
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,729
You have an open warrant
for your arrest.

592
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:12,107
Let's go.

593
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,326
Don't worry.

594
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,370
Your boyfriend'll lock up.

595
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,498
Won't you, officer?

596
00:45:19,657 --> 00:45:21,472
