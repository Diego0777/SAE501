1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,302
Read the prepared statement
and then ask for questions.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,966
And expect Hanratty to ask
about the Wilkey Gardens bust.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,372
Reflect, but don't deny.

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,273
Right. You got your notes?

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,641
Don't need 'em.

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,373
Thanks for making the trip.

7
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,972
And now here's Captain David Aceveda.

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,040
Thank you, Wanda.

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,683
The Farmington district of Los Angeles...

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,588
...which I've been commanding
for the last four months...

11
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:28,684
...has traditionally been one of the most
dangerous, crime-ridden areas of the city.

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,163
Some reporters have gone
so far as to label Farmington a war zone.

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,564
Yeah, it's over at the corner!

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,750
I'm proud to announce
that murders, rapes, armed robberies...

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,054
...and many other violent crimes
have decreased dramatically here...

16
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,184
...in the last six months.

17
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,159
Under my direction,
law enforcement officers...

18
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,634
...now participate
in neighborhood outreach programs.

19
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,207
Already, the effect
is being felt by local families.

20
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,344
Mothers feel safer
as they shop for groceries.

21
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,785
Too late, G-man.

22
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:40,189
With the continued support of community
leaders and ordinary citizens...

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,667
...we can make the Farmington district
a safer home...

24
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,794
...for all of us.

25
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,531
Mother...

26
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,504
That's for running, asshole.

27
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,739
Get up.

28
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,978
What the hell, man?

29
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,151
Look at that, Booty.

30
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,192
Looks like you got
some kind of third nad going down there.

31
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,750
Let me get that for ya.
No, wait!

32
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,920
Shit!

33
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,862
I got an evidence bag
somewhere.

34
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,196
No, that's okay. I got it.
All right.

35
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,898
Come on.

36
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,274
Buenos dias.

37
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,001
Any questions?

38
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,417
Christ!

39
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,653
You do not see a pair like that every day.

40
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,192
It's called rigor.

41
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,958
Rigor or no rigor, that's a serious rack.

42
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,590
You wanna give 'em a squeeze?

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,998
How much time we got
before the M.E. shows up?

44
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,799
Victim's sister is outside.
Wants to know what happened.

45
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,238
Dutch is in charge
of all potential criers.

46
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:56,498
Thanks.

47
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,240
Are you the first one here?

48
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,938
Yeah. Me and Julien got the call.

49
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,004
Last few weeks,
dead bodies seem to follow you around.

50
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,175
Yeah, I'm a real fun-time gal.

51
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,309
Any notions on this one?

52
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:08,148
Nature of the wounds, we're looking at...

53
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,984
...an inexperienced under-achiever type.

54
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,183
Covered genitals,
feels shame for what he did.

55
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,726
Family member, boyfriend.
This one will break easy.

56
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,989
Don't! Let me go!

57
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,031
Goddamn it! Get outta my way!

58
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,328
Miss, I need you to calm down.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,265
- Who are you?
- Detective Wagenbach.

60
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,564
Is she dead?

61
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,865
There's a young woman inside.

62
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,200
We haven't identified her yet.

63
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,763
This is my sister's place.

64
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,832
Like I said, we don't know who she is yet.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,605
Long blonde hair, pretty.

66
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,145
That sounds like her. I'm sorry.

67
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,953
Ma'am.

68
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,123
Ma'am.

69
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,959
Where's Jenny?

70
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,864
Jenny?

71
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,564
Nancy's little girl. Where is she?

72
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,942
Come with me.

73
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,682
Guess what's missing?

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,791
Shit, son.
I know.

75
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,028
It just got interesting.

76
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,971
Hey, Sarge.

77
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,334
Thanks.

78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,903
I gotta hit the head.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

79
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,804
Hey, doll.
Just in time.

80
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,180
I've got some reporters here.
You feel like talking?

81
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,183
Nah.

82
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,880
You sure? Gilroy and the chief
will push this story hard.

83
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,785
Your team deserves a lot of credit.

84
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,225
Let the poster boy do his thing.

85
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,089
Talk to you.

86
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,588
Peterson, the john's still not working?

87
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,926
Plumber must have gotten lost.

88
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,398
If this city wants to thank us...

89
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,833
...for a job well done,
how's about making sure...

90
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,236
...we don't all have to all cram
into the same goddamn stall?

91
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,403
Vic, can I see you?

92
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,309
Give me a sec.
I need you now.

93
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,103
I'm taking a piss.

94
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,548
Provided a spot
in the ladies' room opens up.

95
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,346
I got my fingers crossed.

96
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,477
Now.

97
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,251
Aye, aye, Captain.

98
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,153
Great.

99
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,325
Have fun in here, bro.

100
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,423
You remember Miguel Esteana.

101
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,759
Sure.

102
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,363
Miguel's a piece-of-shit drug dealer
with the 25th Street Coronas.

103
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:42,430
This is the kind of attitude you foster
under your command?

104
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,102
- Mr. Esteana's attorney, José Garcia...
- I know José.

105
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,509
He represents a bunch
of piece-of-shit drug dealers.

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,378
What I do is ensure my clients' rights
aren't violated...

107
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:51,677
...by thugs like you.

108
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,312
Mr. Esteana claims
you used excessive force during his arrest.

109
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,582
Really?

110
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,419
Is that what you claim, Miguel?

111
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,061
Yeah, that's some hickey.
Boyfriend give you that?

112
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,121
No, you did it with some pliers.

113
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,857
I don't recall any pliers.

114
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,596
I remember the eight dime bags
of pure H we nabbed you with.

115
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,538
The search, we'll be contesting
with Judge McAllister.

116
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,476
I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank
on this whole pliers thing.

117
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,878
Feel free to ask my guys, but I doubt
they remember it that way either.

118
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,848
You're a disgrace.
That's funny.

119
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,478
I don't recall signing up for ethics class
from a scumbag drug lawyer.

120
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,751
Is that all...

121
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,849
...or can I go take that piss?

122
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,254
So Miguel is lying?

123
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:37,727
Anything to stay out of jail.

124
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,662
Fourth complaint since I came here.

125
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,499
Lucky for me you don't believe 'em.

126
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,170
Keep smiling for the cameras.

127
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,967
See what you can do
about getting the men's john fixed.

128
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,837
I stopped listening to you five minutes ago.

129
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,008
I'm just saying our un-sub's disorganized...

130
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,051
...probably a record and no violent history.

131
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,246
- "Un-sub"?
- Unidentified subject.

132
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,022
You mean the killer.

133
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,345
Yeah.

134
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,449
Then just say that! Christ!

135
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,225
You think Danny would go out with me?

136
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,355
Danny?

137
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,028
A study says over 40 percent of female
police meet their spouses on the job.

138
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,865
You wanna date again, fine.

139
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,099
But why chase after a uni-cop
in our own station?

140
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,401
That's just lazy, son.

141
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,773
Get her out of uniform,
I'll bet she's a knockout.

142
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,243
Sign up for dance classes.

143
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,576
Take out an ad. Join a book club.

144
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,638
For God's sake, show some imagination.

145
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,115
No wonder your wife left you.

146
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,721
- Lucy had intimacy issues unrelated to me.
- Right, unrelated to you.

147
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,280
Buzzer, Sarge!
Yeah!

148
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,021
You're such an expert,
how come both your husbands left you?

149
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,757
It sure as hell
wasn't for a lack of imagination.

150
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,431
You got a missing kid?

151
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,594
Jenny Reeborg, 8 years old.
We found her mother stabbed to death.

152
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,636
Any leads?

153
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,535
We're following some things up.

154
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,198
What have you got so far?

155
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,998
Her father's a crackhead.

156
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,705
Personal nature of the crime, his daughter
missing, he's gonna be our guy.

157
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,647
Also, a neighbor saw Ponyboy Harris
banging on the dead lady's door yesterday.

158
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,741
Who's Ponyboy Harris?

159
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,013
He's a local fence. Bit of a fancy.

160
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,612
Collared him three or four times personally.

161
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,347
You guys need anything run down, just ask.

162
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,852
I wanna help.

163
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,686
Thanks, Captain.

164
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,390
Since when does he get his hands dirty?

165
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,194
Can't blame a guy for trying.

166
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,131
Danny, hey!

167
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,729
How's the coffee?

168
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,037
Usual police issue?

169
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,343
Pretty much.
There's a shock.

170
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:38,449
Listen, I don't...

171
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,178
I don't know what your plans are...

172
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,912
Lookie here, Shane, it's the ladykiller!

173
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,319
Dutch boy, what's this I hear...

174
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,416
...about some dead girl's sister
blowing you at the crime scene?

175
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,154
Dutch man! Going to town!

176
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,059
You guys are sick.
Us?

177
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,500
You're the one getting your pipe smoked
by a grieving relative right by the body.

178
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,995
She was upset. I was comforting her.

179
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,063
You don't have to tell me
about the different stages of grief.

180
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,575
There's denial, anger, sucking you off.

181
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,942
If you can think of anything else,
you just call 911 and ask for Det. Blow Me.

182
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,687
Excuse me.
"Detective Blow Me."

183
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,655
Dutch, what?
Come on, don't be so sensitive.

184
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,021
That was real classy.

185
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,822
Come on. Dutch thinks he's
a notch above the rest of us.

186
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,624
I'm bringing him back down to earth.

187
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,358
That's big of you.

188
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,561
I gotta go run an errand,
but I was thinking...

189
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,399
...you and I should get a drink tonight.

190
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,665
Is your wife coming?

191
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,298
Damn, she can't make it.
Damn, neither can I.

192
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,276
Since when did you get morals?

193
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,243
Always had them.
Sometimes I just lose track.

194
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,508
Really?

195
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,081
How's about you
lose track of them tonight?

196
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,577
Yeah, I don't think so.

197
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,080
You want me to back off?

198
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:54,955
All you gotta do is tell me it wasn't great.

199
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,660
You ready?

200
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,159
Yeah.

201
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,734
- Back to the barn.
- Who was that?

202
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,826
- Back to the barn.
- Who was that?

203
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,266
Guy I know.

204
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:05,826
I went through the books.

205
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:08,588
The guy I saw Mackey talking to
is a drug dealer named...

206
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,394
Named Rondell Robinson.

207
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,593
Right.

208
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,602
You suggesting
Mackey's working for a dealer?

209
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,604
I'm suggesting
he's working for Mackey.

210
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,731
What?
Robinson's main competition...

211
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,105
...is a guy named Two-Time.

212
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,376
Mackey's been taking out all his dealers...

213
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,345
...giving Robinson a monopoly.

214
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,211
A monopoly means
profits go up for Robinson...

215
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,615
...street violence goes down for Mackey.

216
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:31,119
And I want you to help me prove it.

217
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,685
Okay.

218
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,561
- Who's he?
- Moses Hernandez.

219
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:48,270
We went to SC together.

220
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:49,896
He's in Justice.

221
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,804
Moses, this is Terry.

222
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,300
It's good to meet you.

223
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,675
I didn't agree to be a witness
in a federal case.

224
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,840
The friends Mackey has,
federal's the only way we'll nail him.

225
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:03,012
I go outside the department and rat out
another cop, my life's not worth crap in LA.

226
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:05,485
He's right.

227
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,283
It's too dangerous.

228
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,585
He can't pull it off.

229
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,024
I didn't say I that.

230
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:11,117
I know.

231
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:14,028
I just meant you need assurances
of an upside to all this.

232
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:16,361
Such as?
Such as...

233
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:19,402
...a guarantee of a job in Justice
when it's all over.

234
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:22,870
You think I want to be an errand boy
in some Alaskan outpost?

235
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
You pick the city then.

236
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:28,143
Okay. Try the home office in DC.

237
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,642
I'm gonna need moving expenses.
Sure.

238
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,547
Plus a car and a nice big fruit basket.

239
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,843
I'm giving up my life,
you gotta give me something back.

240
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,012
I can make it happen.

241
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,420
Okay, no offense, I'd like it in writing today.

242
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,014
Let's be clear here, Terry.

243
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,889
We're talking about making a case...

244
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,555
...that puts Mackey
behind bars for a long time.

245
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,598
Because if we only wound him...

246
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,031
...his friends upstairs will crush both of us.

247
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,796
Yeah, I know what I have to do.

248
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,962
Good.

249
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,732
I know what I'm getting out of this.

250
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,673
What are you getting out of this?

251
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,308
I just want a dirty cop off the street.

252
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:08,712
You wanna be mayor someday, better learn
how to lie a hell of a lot better than that.

253
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:20,787
Ponyboy!

254
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,391
Goddamn!

255
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,195
Claudette! Look what you made me do.

256
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,667
What is all this stuff?

257
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:29,433
That? That's just a big bunch of VCRs
I stole from Circuit City.

258
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,703
I don't know anything about that girl.

259
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,303
All right? Be real.
You know me. Come on.

260
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,542
Why were you
at Nancy Reeborg's house yesterday?

261
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,709
I was looking for her old man, Lonnie.

262
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,750
Lonnie's not living there anymore.

263
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,981
- I know that.
- You ever find Lonnie?

264
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,247
You know Bunny Jenkins?

265
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,726
Said he was using at this crack house
run by a guy named Monty.

266
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:55,561
I was gonna go there after I unloaded
the VCRs, which is when you showed up.

267
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,964
Okay. Good.
Good?

268
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:01,004
Now let's work out
this Circuit City misunderstanding.

269
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:02,299
Claudette?

270
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,509
Vic?
Yeah, what?

271
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:14,072
You know a crack house run
by some guy named Monty?

272
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:17,450
Yeah, sure. It's on Crescent,
just west of 7th. Why?

273
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,045
I gotta pick up a smokehound there.

274
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:20,146
No, no can do.

275
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,953
Monty gives me dirt,
I give him safe passage.

276
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:26,052
This guy might have
something to do with the missing girl.

277
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,959
All right, I'll go get him myself.

278
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,160
The cards suck anyways.
Come on, Vic.

279
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:33,224
No, I'm gonna go.

280
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,606
Shut up!

281
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,677
Vic.
Open.

282
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,514
Shut up!

283
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:59,753
Lonnie Reeborg. He here?

284
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,025
- In there. Is there a problem?
- Show me.

285
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:09,201
Okay, Lonnie. Let's go.

286
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,307
Come on. Rise and shine.

287
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,275
You stop that.
Let's go!

288
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:18,314
What'd he do?

289
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,810
You got kids here.
It's Teacher Institute Day.

290
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,819
Where's their mom?
Buying supplies.

291
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,754
Jesus Christ, Monty.
You can't have kids around this place.

292
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,656
What am I supposed to do?
Stick them in a back room.

293
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,320
- Rent The Lion King.
- Someone stole the TV.

294
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,421
Then buy them some crayons
for Christ's sake!

295
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,432
Just keep them away from this shit.

296
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,466
Think back, Lonnie.

297
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,301
You killed your wife last night.

298
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,466
Why do you keep saying that?

299
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,533
'Cause that's the God's truth, son.

300
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:49,806
- You can't lie to God.
- Or the crime lab.

301
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,677
Her blood's all over your shirt.

302
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,739
I don't even got a shirt.

303
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,148
It's evidence now.

304
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:56,544
Where's Jenny?

305
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:57,820
Jenny?

306
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,378
Where is your daughter?

307
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,980
I went there to pick her up.

308
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,288
Where is she?
I needed her.

309
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,761
You remember killing Nancy?

310
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,798
You remember the knife?

311
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:12,026
I just went there for Jenny.

312
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:16,167
Think, Lonnie.
You went over there...

313
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,764
I said that.
to get Jenny.

314
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:21,777
She's half mine.
Nancy made you angry.

315
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,477
She wouldn't let me take Jenny.

316
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,811
You didn't mean to kill her,
she made you do it.

317
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,379
I didn't kill no one.

318
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,682
Think, Lonnie. What did you do to Nancy?

319
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,652
I don't feel good.

320
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:36,214
Concentrate!
What happened to Nancy?

321
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,319
I don't...
You gotta keep trying.

322
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:40,961
I'm trying.

323
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,292
I went there to get Jenny.

324
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,327
Yeah.

325
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:51,006
Nancy tried to stop me.

326
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,405
Keep going, Lonnie.

327
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,273
She had a knife.

328
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,714
What then?

329
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,988
I took it away from her.

330
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,095
What is it?

331
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:19,597
What is it, Lonnie?

332
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,748
I killed her.

333
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,712
I killed my sweet Nancy!

334
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:42,418
And where's Jenny?

335
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,659
What did I do that for?

336
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:46,657
'Cause you like crack?

337
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:48,262
My daughter!

338
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:50,162
I told you from the start this guy did it.

339
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,294
Now where is she?

340
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,605
I sold her.

341
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,474
Sold her? You sold her to who?

342
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,713
He gave me $200.

343
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,755
Who did?
This guy.

344
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,715
He likes girls.

345
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,653
How come nobody stopped me?

346
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,668
I don't know.

347
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:33,876
Search warrant!

348
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:34,865
Search warrant!

349
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:47,179
George Sawyer.

350
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,723
Where's Jenny Reeborg?

351
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:57,965
"Sexy Schoolgirls.

352
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,795
"Jane at 15."

353
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,335
This is quite the reading list.

354
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:02,700
Where's my mother?

355
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:05,399
- It's time for her medication.
- I'll make a call.

356
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,032
Make sure she gets her meds.

357
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,669
If you wanna hold this pervert's hand,
be my guest.

358
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,940
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

359
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,123
Okay.

360
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,023
Who took my Ding Dongs?

361
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,092
Problem, Dutch Boy?

362
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,099
I had some Ding Dongs. They're gone now.

363
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,031
Ding Dongs?

364
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,569
What are you, in kindergarten?
Look.

365
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,402
I've got a suspect whose profile screams:

366
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,498
"Organized, humiliation-driven offender."

367
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,536
Which means he won't crack easy.

368
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:45,478
Which means an interrogation
that will go on all night.

369
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,674
Which means I need my Ding Dongs...

370
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,307
...and you took them. Didn't you?

371
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,146
Right.

372
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:54,154
'Cause I can't make it through the night
without one of your precious Ding Dongs.

373
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,588
Stay away from me,
and stay away from my desk.

374
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,353
We got an interview.

375
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,190
What are you all riled up about?

376
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,286
He took my Ding Dongs.

377
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:04,423
Come on, son. Fork over his Ding Dongs.

378
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,737
At my old squad,
people had respect for other people's...

379
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:13,035
Forget it!

380
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,338
How come everyone loves
this asshole so much?

381
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,708
Let's go, we've got an interview.

382
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,077
I think I saw some Twinkies
up in the break room.

383
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,775
It's not the same thing.

384
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:26,520
Here's your coffee.

385
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,182
When you gonna call about
my mom's pills?

386
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:30,849
In a minute.

387
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,991
I got nothing to hide.

388
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:34,455
I know.

389
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,165
Tell me something.

390
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,830
Think there's something wrong
with gay people?

391
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,701
Something wrong?

392
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:47,207
In the head, you know.

393
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,971
With queers, I mean,
you think they got a screw loose?

394
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:53,112
I don't know.
Not so long ago...

395
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,513
...medical community
classified homosexuality...

396
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:56,778
...as a disorder.

397
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:58,285
Called it an illness.

398
00:20:58,687 --> 00:20:59,654
Yeah?

399
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:02,849
Now scientists think maybe it's some gene
that makes people gay.

400
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:03,948
So?

401
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:06,819
For booking.

402
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,391
So if God made 'em that way...

403
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,922
...who are we to say they're wrong
for doing the things they do?

404
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,264
It got me thinking.

405
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,062
What if scientists discovered...

406
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,767
...there's a gene
that predisposes some people...

407
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,536
...to be attracted to young girls?

408
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:25,575
You think there is? In some people?

409
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,905
Why not?

410
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:31,749
And if scientists discover that gene, then...

411
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,755
Then maybe people won't think...

412
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:37,383
...it's so wrong
to have sex with underage girls.

413
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:41,025
Maybe not.

414
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,425
Forgot to call about your mom's pills.

415
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,683
How's the car running, Miguel?

416
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,082
It's leaking oil.

417
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:08,679
Yeah, these old cars
always need a lot of work.

418
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:11,521
Must be a handy guy
with these tools laying around though.

419
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:13,220
No pliers though.

420
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:14,887
Miguel's not too fond of pliers.

421
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:16,988
I can't say I blame him.

422
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:19,124
Where's your lawyer, Miguel?

423
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:21,729
I don't know.

424
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,172
Miguel Esteana's dropping his complaint
against you.

425
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,782
Told you it was bogus.

426
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:40,981
I'd like your incident report
first thing tomorrow morning.

427
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:45,049
Sure. It'll be a couple of days.
I got something on the back burner.

428
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,256
It's not a request.

429
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,223
Tomorrow morning.

430
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:53,067
You'll get my report in a couple of days.
Maybe a week.

431
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,729
You don't like the timetable,
you take it up with Gilroy.

432
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:56,828
I don't have to.

433
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:59,203
In this building, I'm in charge.

434
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,969
Maybe in your own mind, amigo.

435
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:05,905
But in the real world, I don't answer to you.

436
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:09,144
Not today, not tomorrow,
not even on Cinco de Mayo.

437
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,717
You call for the police?

438
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,623
Yeah, about two and a half hours ago.

439
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:20,718
What's the problem?

440
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:24,026
What you think the problem is?
Look at my goddamn tires!

441
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,657
Someone slashed your tires?

442
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:27,964
Was the real police busy today?

443
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:32,639
- Any idea who might have done this?
- Lamar. He's my ex.

444
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,701
I see he wasn't handling
his responsibilities as a man.

445
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:40,111
I see that, I got no choice but to step in.

446
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,649
Did you witness
this Lamar slash your tires?

447
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:45,811
Yeah, bro. I got the whole thing on tape.

448
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,989
Come on, man.
The brother dumb, but he ain't stupid.

449
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:49,191
Are you gonna go arrest him?

450
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:49,924
Are you gonna go arrest him?

451
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:51,153
We'll talk to him.

452
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:55,094
In the meantime, can you think of anyone
else who might have slashed your tires?

453
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:56,357
Like who?

454
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:58,932
Maybe a business associate?

455
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,064
Business associate?

456
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,462
What, you tryin' to imply something?

457
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:05,472
Nah. I'm just wondering...

458
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,907
...why you got a $30,000 car
with $500 tires...

459
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:11,775
...parked outside of a
$400-a-month apartment.

460
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,956
Give me the goddamn money for this...

461
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,623
You, go to work.

462
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:36,394
Dmitri. Heard you got paroled.

463
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,771
I see you got your old job back.

464
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,933
I'm just temping
for somebody who got the flu.

465
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,476
Hand it over.

466
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,204
Bankroll, too.

467
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:49,944
Come on, Mackey, man.
That's just my playing-around coin.

468
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:55,982
DMITRl: This ain't right.
Get lost.

469
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:57,319
Yes, sir.

470
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,027
What did I tell you last week?

471
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,260
No more free passes, right?

472
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,499
- I know.
- Let's go. Come on.

473
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,137
Any news on Two-Time's party?

474
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:21,307
It's definitely on
for Saturday night.

475
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:23,609
Sure?

476
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,019
'Cause I gotta be sure.

477
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:28,718
He called up Ringo...

478
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,691
...and asked for his four best girls
for Saturday night.

479
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:36,830
Guess I got left off the list.

480
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:39,626
Look like you lost some weight.
You been eating?

481
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:43,227
Sure, after business hours.

482
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:48,965
I'll give you some money. Skip a couple of
tricks, get yourself some soup.

483
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:50,739
I don't need your money, Vic.

484
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:53,406
Here. You look thin. Get some soup.

485
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,350
Don't worry about me, Vic.

486
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,114
I get by.

487
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,357
Where's your boy?

488
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:08,459
With my mom.

489
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:17,564
Yeah. Get him some soup, too.

490
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,777
- You're sweet, Vic.
- Go see your son.

491
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:33,783
I got a daughter. 14 next month.

492
00:26:35,523 --> 00:26:37,650
She's got a few friends, like to come over...

493
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:40,126
...hang out, do homework,
that kind of thing.

494
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:42,829
I don't know anything
about that missing girl.

495
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,828
You know who Britney Spears is?

496
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,335
I've seen videos.

497
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:49,995
My daughter's got these friends...

498
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,096
...who like to dress up like Britney Spears.

499
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:55,843
Tight jeans, cutoff T-shirts.

500
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,947
13 years old.

501
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:04,308
She's got this one friend.

502
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,614
Natalie.

503
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:08,546
I'm telling you...

504
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:11,422
I know I shouldn't be thinking
what I'm thinking...

505
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:14,223
...but the way this goddamn girl looks,
I mean...

506
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:17,321
She may not be a woman yet,
but you can't call her a girl either.

507
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:19,367
You know what I'm saying?

508
00:27:21,302 --> 00:27:22,894
Thirteen's a good age.

509
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,606
Yeah, I bet it is.

510
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:31,307
Can I get you some more coffee?

511
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,019
I didn't know he had a daughter.

512
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:41,988
He doesn't.

513
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,357
What's your take on Vic Mackey?

514
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:48,020
How do you mean?

515
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:49,926
You know what I mean.

516
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,789
I hear things.

517
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:56,135
But as long as he's producing on the street,
he's got friends.

518
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:58,069
Gilroy, even the chief.

519
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,801
So he's bulletproof?
From you, yeah.

520
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:04,507
I know what everybody here thinks.

521
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:07,605
I'm a test taker.
I didn't earn it on the street.

522
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:11,118
Came time to name a new captain,
I was the right color at the right time.

523
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:13,814
You think taking on Mackey's
gonna change people's minds?

524
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,515
I'm just talking.

525
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:20,588
Right now, Vic Mackey must look like
a mighty big catch to you.

526
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,226
Do the smart thing though, son.

527
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:24,560
Cut bait.

528
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,831
It doesn't bother you, the things he does?

529
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,461
- I don't judge other cops.
- Mackey's not a cop.

530
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:31,262
He's Al Capone with a badge.

531
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:34,274
Al Capone made money
by giving people what they wanted.

532
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:36,272
What people want these days...

533
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:39,245
...is to make it to their class
without getting mugged.

534
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:42,673
Come home from work,
see their stereo still there.

535
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,615
Hear about some murder in the barrio...

536
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:47,211
...find out the next day
the police caught the guy.

537
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,150
If having all that means some cop...

538
00:28:49,224 --> 00:28:51,385
...roughs up some nigger or spic
in the ghetto...

539
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,256
...as far as most people are concerned...

540
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:55,421
...it's don't ask, don't tell.

541
00:28:57,565 --> 00:28:59,863
How you figure on changing that?

542
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:14,975
Lamar Tilton?

543
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,340
Yeah?

544
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,580
We're investigating vandalism to a car
owned by your ex-girlfriend.

545
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,348
You mean the tires I slashed?

546
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:23,190
Yeah.

547
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,656
You admit to vandalizing the car?

548
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:25,714
Sure. Why not?

549
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:27,454
How about 'cause the car isn't yours?

550
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:31,020
I gave that skank $1,500
on her down payment.

551
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,866
Day after she makes the delivery,
she kicks me out...

552
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:38,701
...then gives the car to this scrawny bitch
she's been balling on the side.

553
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:42,072
- Your point being?
- My point being $1,500!

554
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,702
Shit.

555
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:46,711
The way I figure it,
that at least make the tires mine.

556
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:49,511
Look, you tell that bitch
if she got a problem with that...

557
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,346
...she know where I am.

558
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:55,280
Now this is all wrong, man.

559
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,485
Jewelry.

560
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,957
You see that new guy she's with?

561
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:01,119
Yeah, I saw him.

562
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:04,187
Then you know what kind of prick
I'm dealing with here.

563
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,230
So where's the love?

564
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,293
Bible. Galatians, chapter 7, verse 6.

565
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:13,199
"For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap."

566
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:15,868
You can stop with the sermon, Grandma.

567
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:17,439
When I'm gettin' outta here?

568
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:19,706
As soon as you arraign and you post bail.

569
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:22,909
You got anything else?

570
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:24,575
How much bail gonna be?

571
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:26,283
$200, $300.

572
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:28,878
$200? I don't got that kind of cash.

573
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:33,522
How were you able
to afford this jewelry then?

574
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,893
I don't gotta explain myself to you.

575
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,123
Lonnie knew I liked them young.

576
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,498
He needed money.
Said I could do whatever I wanted...

577
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,093
...to his girl for $200.

578
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,262
When he brought her by...

579
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,863
...it was obvious
she was like seven, eight years old.

580
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:48,101
Was that a problem?

581
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,268
I told Lonnie I like 'em 12 or 13.

582
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:52,778
Like you were talking about,
developed a little.

583
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,178
You must have been disappointed.

584
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:57,809
Yeah, but Lonnie'd
already spent the money, so...

585
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,444
Even though I didn't want her,
the girl was...

586
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,852
...you know, she was still mine.

587
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:02,911
So you got rid of her?

588
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,150
I don't hurt 'em.

589
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:07,517
I like 'em to like me. Romantic-like.

590
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,722
Things just didn't work out this time.

591
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:11,496
What'd you do with her?

592
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:12,862
I traded her.

593
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,727
You traded her?

594
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:16,360
To a doctor I met on the Internet.

595
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:17,734
He likes them 7 or 8.

596
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,397
He came right over and picked her up.

597
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:21,472
You traded her?

598
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:23,299
I was out $200.

599
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,638
What'd this doctor trade you?

600
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:27,704
A girl to be named later.

601
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:31,184
You know,
like the kind of trades ball teams make.

602
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,079
Right.

603
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,763
That's a nice boat.
Thanks.

604
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:46,129
I take the kids
up to Lake Powell every year.

605
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,633
You know, fishing and swimming.

606
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:50,135
- Sounds great.
- Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up...

607
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,535
...for a year of double shifts...

608
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,505
...but the kids really look forward to it.

609
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:54,598
How's the meat?

610
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,666
Five more minutes,
you can bring out the buns.

611
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:57,768
Great.

612
00:31:57,845 --> 00:32:00,473
Did you tell Matthew
he could keep a spider in his room?

613
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:01,947
That's for a school project.

614
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:04,109
If that thing gets loose...
It won't.

615
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,516
Yeah, it better not.

616
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:08,020
It won't.
Better not.

617
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,453
What did I tell you about jumping in the...

618
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,588
They grow up too quick.

619
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:20,162
Especially with the job we got.

620
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:22,892
Yeah, what you're doing though,
has to be done.

621
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,960
You think?

622
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,437
Absolutely.

623
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,769
My dad was a cop.
He admired guys like you.

624
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:32,505
Those were some
honest-to-goodness men back then.

625
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:36,540
Guys like Captain Aceveda,
they never understand.

626
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:39,445
What do you expect
from a damn quota baby?

627
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,151
I think I could be a lot more useful to you.

628
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:47,818
You know, do more than just drive.

629
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,253
Yeah?

630
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,821
Yeah. I know why you've been reluctant
to include me.

631
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,562
You got a team. You watch out for
each other, know how the others will move.

632
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:57,763
You'd kill to protect each other.

633
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:00,268
It's all about trust,
otherwise, you end up dead.

634
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:01,433
Yeah.

635
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:04,467
Listen.

636
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:07,207
Up till now,
Two-Time's has been impossible to nail.

637
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:09,440
Never keeps drugs at his place
until tonight.

638
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:11,143
Yeah, what's so special about tonight?

639
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:13,209
He's gearing up for a big bash
tomorrow night.

640
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:16,085
He's got a bunch of coke
he's handing out as party favors.

641
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:18,215
Our one chance to nail him with the goods.

642
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:20,783
- Lock and load, baby.
- Yeah!

643
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:23,458
This is not gonna be
any beauty pageant, ladies.

644
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,895
He's got steel-enforced doors...

645
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:28,093
...so we go through a window
and be fast before he starts flushing.

646
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:29,499
Knock, knock, who's there?

647
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,673
Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer.

648
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:36,134
And on top of that,
Terry here is losing his cherry tonight.

649
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:39,042
He's coming with us.
Terry is losing his cherry.

650
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,410
Welcome aboard. Congratulations.

651
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:45,577
Remember, the team comes first.

652
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:47,415
We take care of each other, all right?

653
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:50,554
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

654
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:55,554
We just have a few more questions.

655
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:57,620
- Dr. Grady.
- Right, Dr. Grady.

656
00:33:57,698 --> 00:33:59,290
And I have a practice to attend to...

657
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:02,563
...patients to see, so charge me
with something or release me.

658
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,263
Do you know who Jenny Reeborg is?

659
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,736
DR. No.
George Sawyer says...

660
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:08,934
...he gave Jenny to you
for the purpose of sexual intercourse.

661
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,102
I don't even know the man.

662
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:13,535
You tell us where Jenny is...

663
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,774
...we'll get the DA to make a favorable offer.

664
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,714
Charge me or release me.

665
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:20,142
We'll see what we can do.

666
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:23,019
Tell me something.

667
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,524
As a man of science, I'd like your opinion.

668
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:28,652
Is homosexuality genetic or environment?

669
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,526
The latest studies suggest it's genetic.

670
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:32,997
Really? Just the way they are?

671
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,624
Can't help themselves, huh?

672
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,635
I see where you're going with this.

673
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:38,798
Don't waste my time.

674
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,601
Or yours.

675
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:43,876
I've got plenty of time.

676
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,444
I'm bored.

677
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:48,613
Charge me or release me.

678
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:54,052
This guy is definitely
a domination-control pedophile.

679
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:55,588
Is he capable of killing her?

680
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:56,952
Fits the profile.

681
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:59,685
- Let him sit for a couple hours, try again.
- Couple hours?

682
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,957
Girl's missing since yesterday morning.
Has she got food or water?

683
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:05,520
- I can break him by the end of the day.
- Take all week.

684
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,294
There's no way this pecker's gonna talk.

685
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,562
I know what buttons to push
with this guy.

686
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:10,864
I'm smarter than he is.

687
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:13,269
This is not a quiz show, Dutch.
Lose the ego.

688
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,671
Think about Jenny Reeborg.

689
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,936
I am. You got a better plan?
Yes.

690
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:18,101
Let him go.

691
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:19,509
- Let him go?
- We tail him.

692
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:22,707
If we lose him, first thing he'll do is
kill her, dump the body.

693
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,182
Look, I can break this guy.

694
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,878
Your way will get her killed.

695
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:27,442
So will yours!

696
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:32,288
Anywhere in here.

697
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,084
What about attack dogs? I hate dogs.

698
00:35:36,163 --> 00:35:37,528
I need you.

699
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,437
And who are you?

700
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,646
DR. Who is he?

701
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:04,819
You know what you're doing, son?

702
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:12,124
What's in the bag?

703
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,611
DR. What's that stuff for?

704
00:36:27,614 --> 00:36:31,175
That's what I'm gonna use to get you
to tell me where Jenny Reeborg is.

705
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,081
Your turn to play bad cop?

706
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:37,783
No. Good cop and bad cop left for the day.

707
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,452
I'm a different kind of cop.

708
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:47,098
I'm ready to see my lawyer now.

709
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:48,429
Later.

710
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:51,831
Right now it's just you and me.

711
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:54,873
People are watching us.

712
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:59,642
I got a little girl back at home.

713
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:02,978
8-year-old daughter. Her name is Cassidy.

714
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,377
What do you say I bring her down here?

715
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:07,010
Let you stick your dick in her.

716
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:08,782
How'd you like that?

717
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,347
- What?
- You know.

718
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,959
Suck her tits a little bit maybe?

719
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:16,695
Not interested.

720
00:37:17,464 --> 00:37:20,900
So you want to have some other guy's
little girl, but not my Cassidy?

721
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,491
What's up with that, man?

722
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:25,003
I'd like to take a look
at this Jenny for myself.

723
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:28,170
See what she's got
that my Cassidy doesn't.

724
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,107
I'm sure you could arrange that.

725
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:33,439
I don't know where the girl is.

726
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,140
Her name is Jenny Reeborg.

727
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:38,913
I'm giving you one chance
to let me know where you're hiding her.

728
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:41,010
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

729
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,691
DR. You're the police!

730
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,931
He's got a basement apartment
under a fake name.

731
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,228
Jenny's there alone.

732
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:30,293
Last he knew, she was still alive.

733
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,475
You got something to say, Dutch boy?

734
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:40,243
Like, "Thanks for solving my case"?

735
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:43,680
Just glad I could help!

736
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:22,515
Jenny?

737
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:30,125
Watch out.

738
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:35,157
Come on, goddamn it. Come on!

739
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:50,105
It's okay, baby.

740
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,773
Jenny.

741
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:54,150
Jenny, you're safe now, sweetie.

742
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,113
You're safe now.

743
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:04,593
No way, man. I ain't got to listen to you.

744
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:07,592
Dutch.

745
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:09,701
Heard you found your missing girl.

746
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,900
Yeah, guy turned out to be
a domination-control sociopath.

747
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:16,340
Had her locked in this cage thing.

748
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,972
Good thing you took him out.

749
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:18,977
Yeah.

750
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:21,337
So what are you doing here?

751
00:40:21,415 --> 00:40:23,076
Your shift was over this morning.

752
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,742
As I... Right?

753
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:28,385
Wickman and Greenwalt called in sick
and me and Julien worked a double.

754
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:29,513
I hate doubles.

755
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:30,988
I'm on my way home now.

756
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:33,788
Listen, I was gonna grab a beer...

757
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,590
...with some of my old buddies
from Sunset in case...

758
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:38,858
...you wanna tag along?
- That'd be great.

759
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:41,867
- Great.
- But I'm not free...

760
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:42,833
...tonight.

761
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:45,929
I mean, my friend Betsy set me up
on this blind date.

762
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,906
It's probably gonna be a nightmare and...

763
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:49,874
No, it sounds like fun.

764
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,643
So some other time, okay?

765
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,112
I'd love to go out
with you and the guys and stuff...

766
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,206
...and hear some of the old stories.

767
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:58,717
- What's that smell?
- What?

768
00:40:58,785 --> 00:41:00,548
You don't smell that?

769
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,611
Oh, man. Yeah.

770
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:10,294
What is that?

771
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:13,564
It's dog shit. Jesus Christ.

772
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:17,433
All right. Whoever did this
better clean it up right now.

773
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:23,203
It's you, isn't it? You clean this up,
or I'm gonna shove it down your throat.

774
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,176
You got the wrong guy.

775
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,213
I promise you, I am not gonna rest...

776
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,271
...until the culprit is brought to justice.

777
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,078
Attention, everyone.

778
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,312
I'm declaring this an official crime scene.

779
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:36,652
Nobody leaves here
without providing a stool sample.

780
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:40,425
Who gets to bag the evidence?

781
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:48,660
Some prank.
Yeah.

782
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:52,904
You know,
I once heard about this old cop tradition.

783
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,605
Anytime someone in the squad
started getting a big head...

784
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,468
...some other cop
would put dog crap in his locker.

785
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:01,341
Or desk.

786
00:42:02,382 --> 00:42:04,509
Remind him he's just one guy.

787
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:06,378
Part of the team.

788
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:10,079
You heard about that?

789
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:20,918
TWO-Give me that.

790
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,183
Get up.
