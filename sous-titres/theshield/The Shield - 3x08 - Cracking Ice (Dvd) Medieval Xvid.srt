1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,532
- Move!
- Go, boy!

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,197
- Move!
- Here we go. Get him!

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:10,902
- Get outta town.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,878
- Ohh! Blast right now.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,710
That's me.

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,376
- Love ya.
- There you are.

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,887
- Ohh! Get out!
- Damn it!

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,584
Respect me, bitch

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,218
I love you too, baby.

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,924
- All right. We're goin'again.
- Everything cool with Mara?

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,400
- Yeah, why?
- I don't know. Seemed like she was
in a mood or something.

12
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,408
Shit Everything's fine

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,808
It's just that this first trimester's
like a 90-day P.M.S. ride.

14
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,346
Yeah Maybe she thinks you're not
takin' it so seriously?

15
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
- We're gettin'married, aren't we?
- What,you set a date?

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,284
- No, not yet
- What about a ring?

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,377
Bought her a Lexus
She can wear that on her finger

18
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,286
- She knows I love her
- Yeah, dude, but

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,588
a ring lets her show the rest
of the world that you love her

20
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,595
You gettin' your vagina waxed
next week? Ow!

21
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,597
- Man, you gotta stop that

22
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,633
Well, you gotta pony up
for the rock, man

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,635

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,637
- Yeah
- Hey It's me

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,537
I need you down at
the storage unit ASAP

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,234
- Where's Lem?
- He's with me.

27
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,369
- Is there a problem?
- Not on the phone

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,179
Got here as quick as I could. Figure we'd catch
another case. Who knew it would be this soon?

29
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,722
- Maybe it's a sign
- What's the situation here?

30
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,486
Actually, it's pretty quiet
Seems to be a total lack of a situation

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,323
Well, the message I got said that there
was a drug dealer working out of here

32
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,594
Oh, I may have ''over-exaggerated''
the uh, police nature of this call

33
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,560

34
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,106
And, uh, I suppose you've got

35
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,176
a key to one of
those rooms in there

36
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,943
Look. We been dancin'around
each other for a couple of years now.

37
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,541
Just wonderin'what would happen
if we, uh, ran out of excuses.

38
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,124
- I'm on duty
- I'm not.

39
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,592
You got a pager if they need ya

40
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,027
- I've got a boyfriend

41
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,259
- We already established that
- It's really not a good idea

42
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,494
You're right
You should get back

43
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,899
What am I supposed to do with Koto?

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,520
- Do you need to get that?

48
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,591
That's what voice mail's for

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,168
- That's the ''Hello'' line

52
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,498
- Quiet!

54
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,678
- Hello?
- Hi, Mama It's Toya

55
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,309
- Trish You all right?
- Nothin'Just chillin'

56
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,082
Um, listen I ain't gonna
make it by for dinner

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,320
- Can you say where you are?
- I'm gonna kick it with some friends tonight

58
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,022
Holler at Walon for me, all right?

59
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,567
I love you too, Mama

60
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,437
- Trish is in trouble Walon too

61
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,335
- No more calls
- Why? What's up, boo?

62
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,040
That white dude
you hooked us up with is a cop

63
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,049
- Ah, mm, no, no
- Undercover

64
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,051
- Oh, quit clownin'
- I just got confirmation

65
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,656
- Where you heard that?
- What do you know about him?

66
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,556
Tips good Drinks scotch

67
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,595
Shitty marriage You know

68
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,189
I thought we were comin'
here to have some fun

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,133
We could be in some shit
You included

70
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,263
Fifties can't do nothin'
You ain't even done the whack yet

71
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,240
No, but I agreed to

72
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,504
You'll stick with me

73
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,376
Till I can get this shit taken care of

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,686
A'ightJust let me check my face

75
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,586
- Who is it?

76
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,663
It's me. Open up.

77
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,338
What's goin'on?

78
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,406
There's money missing

79
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,740
- How much?
- We're seven G's short

80
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,746
I was going through the stash,
getting rid of the marked bills

81
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,839
couldn't find a few.

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,113
So I did a count.
We're missin'seven thousand.

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,120
Including some marked money

84
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,123
- You sure you counted right?
- I triple-checked.

85
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,594
- Somebody dip in before the shit hit the fan?
- I didn't take squat

86
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,032
- Don't even look at me
- If somebody did, speak up now, it's forgiven.

87
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,263
The important thing is to figure out
where the marked money was spent.

88
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,566
before Treasury gets a whiff of us

89
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,404
I'm serious.

90
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,310
We're the only people who knew it was
here, and the only people with a key

91
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,286
Last chance

92
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,515
Aw, come on!

93
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,185
We've been a team through all of this

94
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,596
Now who took it?

95
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,839
Ripped by:

96
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,002
Hound

98
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,111
Trish was able to make the call,
so let's assume

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,916
her cover's still intact,
but Walon was made for sure.

100
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,321
- What's the emergency?
- Walon and Trish

101
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,393
- Any idea where Trish was making the call?
- We're tracing it

102
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,258
I'm gonna need four units
ready to roll

103
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,765
Decoy Squad's been working undercover
on a murder-for-hire sting

104
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,301
Farmtown Twelves'been
doing contract hits...

105
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,633
makin'them look
like drive-bys.

106
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,639
Since when is
the Decoy Squad a gang detail?

107
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,107
The feeling was Trish was
our best way into the case

108
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,201
Walon's supposed to drop the money
for the hit this afternoon--

109
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,906
where, we don't know, but we've got
to get him before the Twelves do

110
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,744
- You tried his cell?
- He was worried he'd be searched

111
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,751
Which raises the question
how this happened.

112
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,378
A more important question is,
how are we getting our people back?

113
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,349
Claudette's got us on goddamn
janitor duty the last month

114
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,521
Meanwhile, Walon's out
hunting down banger trophies

115
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,531
I didn't take that money

116
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,130
Okay

117
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,672
Think there's any chance
Tavon swung with it?

118
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,334
It's not enough you and the missus
put him on life support?

119
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,276
Now you gotta call him a thief?

120
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,179
Look, if he knew about the money,
he would have come to us for a piece

121
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,342
Just so you know...

122
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,887
I'm gettin' Mara
an engagement ring

123
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,621
All right
Just don't go hog-wild

124
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,786
I'm not
I'm goin' through Taylor

125
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,296
You're usin' a fence
to buy your wife her ring?

126
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,593
He knows this guy
who sells 'em wholesale.

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,726
- It's all on the level.
- Why not just go down to theJewelry Mart?

128
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,500
'Cause Taylor's guy is cheaper
And I don't speak Farsi

129
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,209
- May I help you?
-Just gotta get my cornrows tightened

130
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,146
- What up, homegirl?

131
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,317
- Man, I'm straight with you
- I need another favor

132
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,328
Yeah, well, you're fresh out
of favors, One Time

133
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,398
You're not hearin' me
too well under there

134
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,237
Yeah, I can see why
Pretty Boy drops the cheese...

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,240
to keep his female lookin' tight

136
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,072
Think he'll still keep her laced when he hears
she's been goin'out the back door on him...

137
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,204
- with a Spooktown soldier?
- Still sleepin' with the enemy, Desiree?

138
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,306
- No
- Trick question

139
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,875
- We know you are
- I'm just tryin' to get my hair did

140
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,421
I need to know who in the Twelves
is selling contract hits

141
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,458
Pretty Boy don't talk business with me

142
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,459
Coo in his ear

143
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,359
You got a half an hour,
or I start cooin' in his

144
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,767

145
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,640
- Hands where I can see 'em. Now!
- Hands up!

146
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,714
Let's see your hands

147
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,710

148
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,787
Clear in the back!

149
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,952
- Storeroom clear
- All clear! Canvass it

150
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,963
What's goin'on?

151
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,590
The Farmtown Twelve made a call
from this phone an hour ago

152
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,669
- Where'd they go?
- Don't know

153
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,671
- What were they doing here?
- I let them use my office sometimes

154
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,402
- Why?
- Beats having them burn it down

155
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,087
- Desiree 30 seconds to spare

156
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,856
I was just about to call Pretty Boy Let him
know his number one cooch was on the loose

157
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,099
Kaliel Wilks
Street name, Li'l Psych

158
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,465
Any idea where we can find him?

159
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,562
Yeah, well you work on Pretty Boy

160
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,005
- He gives you anything, you call me
- I'm runnin' it

161
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,201
Got the address where
Walon's making the meet

162
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,803
I got the name of their guy
who runs contract hits:;Kaliel Wilks.

163
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,008
- Got a reputation as a bit of a psycho
- Ever hear of him?

164
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,950
No, but Shane's on it

165
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,922
- Have any idea how their cover got blown?
- Maybe they tailed Walon

166
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,221
Walon might stink,
but he's not sloppy

167
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,059
The rapist works in the area--
delivering pizza

168
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,032
cable TV guy, meter reader--
who knows?

169
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,729
So he uses his job as camouflage
and scopes out his next victim?

170
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,534
Exactly. Thanks for comin'out
on your own time.

171
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,836
- I'm learning tons
- Still

172
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,106
Got to be raisin' hell
with your social life

173
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,876
- Please. I kicked my social
life to the curb last week.

174
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:22,080
This guy I was seeing bought me this
tennis racket so we could hit together?

175
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,021
Then he insisted that
I leave it at his place

176
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,389
- Talk about control issues
- Cop?

177
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,792
NoJust some guy

178
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,564
- I play
- Yeah? Are you good?

179
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,864
Yes I am, actually

180
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,302
I'd say that we should
hit together sometime

181
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,308
but I'm lousy

182
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,970
Probably bore you

183
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,047
I'm not that good

184
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,672
You think I want
this goddamn ulcer?

185
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,514
- I didn't take that money
- Nobody in here took anything

186
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,522
- So you gonna ask Shane about it?
- I'd bet on his loyalty before
I'd bet on your math skills.

187
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,118
When we're done with this, I want you
to go back with Lem Count again

188
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,357
Check the lock for tampering

189
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,923
Got a picture of our homey
Kaliel Wilks, aka Li'l Psych

190
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,130
- What took so long?
- Had no rap sheet.
Had to go to his Marine Corps file.

191
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,139
- What, he's a jarhead?
- Was.

192
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,506
He duked it out with his CO
They booted him Section Eight

193
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,842
Let's see how he feels with
our size elevens up his ass

194
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,419
Plainclothes has already secured the area.
We'll roll out in 1 0 to take our positions.

195
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,922
- ID'd our trigger boy Combat trained
- Shit

196
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,322
- Copies for everyone
- Once Walon's secure,
I'll call to scoop up the Twelves

197
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,627
- What ifTrish isn't with 'em?
- Haul their asses down here
Make 'em tell us where she is

198
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,327
The captain and I will set up
in a surveillance van.

199
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,269
How long has Trish
been into this guy?

200
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,273
He just popped up a few weeks ago Walon
kept her on the sidelines until he needed her

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,209
She went to work at Polebusters,
got close to the Twelves.

202
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,473
Polebusters?
She's under as a stripper?

203
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,947
Cocktail waitress
She cozied up to the bangers

204
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,109
they bragged about their
murder-for-hire racket

205
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,483
she introduced them to Walon

206
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,556
And his murder they'll do for free

207
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,955
Tell me what I have to do
to get back in.

208
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,527
You hired a thief to break into your home.
A thief that later--

209
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,096
Nojury's gonna believe a
smokehound murderer over a cop.

210
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,166
Your sister-in-law corroborated him.

211
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,166
My lawyer says it's hearsay

212
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:20,136
DA's spinning it so the department
has no choice but to wash their hands

213
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,969
- I need you to talk to him
- Tommy, you can't come back

214
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,306
- It wasn't my fault
- I know you didn't mean for this to happen

215
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,609
And I can only imagine your pain
But I can't have you working here

216
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll do what I can to try and make sure
you don't serve any jail time

217
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,014
-Jail time?
- You have to look out for yourself, now

218
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,750
And you still have friends here

219
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:45,428
- Tommy? What are you doin'?

220
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,326
Aceveda's makin' me
clean out my locker

221
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,235
- Walon and Trish are missin'
- They fell off the grid a few hours ago

222
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,500
- Let me help. Tell me what I can do.
- Tommy--

223
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,544
Why don't you come over to the house
this weekend? We'll watch De La Hoya

224
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,512
Sure

225
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,880
- What the hell is up with that guy?

226
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,149
- Doesn't look like he's bird-watching

227
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,290
- Hang on, pal.
- What's up?

228
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,125
- You want to tell me what you're doin' back here?
-Just now?

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,257
Check the occupant
Turn around Hands behind your back

230
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,268
- Oh, I-I have permission
- Hands behind your back

231
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,106

232
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,846
Sorry to bother you, sir We just apprehended
a man looking through your window

233
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,780
Yo, girl! It's all good

234
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,783
Dude with her

235
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,514
- What's wrong?
- Honey, tell them to take these off of me.

236
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,056
- Do you know this man?
- Married to him long enough

237
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
- He's your husband
- Told ya

238
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,828
- Look, no one's breakin'the law here, Officer.
We'rejust--
- Playing

239
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,194
Right Role-playing?
On the way to work?

240
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,563
With our, uh, friend

241
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,632
Six hours out there
All we get is a practicing cuckold

242
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,198
You see something like that, you wonder if
we all shouldn't stay home and read the Bible

243
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,711
Thanks My partner
already does that

244
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,043
- How you gonna solve this one?
- Well

245
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,777
you don't hope for another victim,
but the fact is

246
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,581
this guy probably hasn't made any mistakes
that's gonna get him caught yet

247
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,623
- Sorry
- Yeah

248
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,215
Well, thanks a lot

249
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,796
See any Twelves yet? Or Walon?

250
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,200
No Nothing yet

251
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,466
Sit tight

252
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,319
Farmtown crew comin' in

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,786

254
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,824
Negative

255
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,700
Psych's not with 'em either

256
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,177
- I got Walon.
- Where?

257
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,714
- You should see him
- Shit. Trish isn't with him either.

258
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,943
- Pick up Walon
- Give Trish a few more seconds

259
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,614
They're gonna make him

260
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,520
Pick him up

261
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,560
I got it

262
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,256

263
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,999
Psst Cover's been blown

264

- Okay Ready?
- Let's move on these assholes

265
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,236

It's a setup

266
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,781
- Where is she?
- Still missing

267
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,077
- What do we know?
- Not much

268
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,516
- Stop those guys

Find out where Trish is

269
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,528
No, Li'l Psych will make her
as blowing the whistle

270
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,963
- Let these guys check in
- Walon says we should let these guys go

271
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,197
- Keep Trish's cover intact
- Trish can take care of herself

272
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,170
- Pull them

273
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,716
I think I forgot my wallet

274
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,882
Let 'em go.

275
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,157
What do you mean,
he didn't show up?

276
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,123
Well, how did he know
not to show?

277
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,167

278
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,395
I got one morejob to do.

279
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,235
I gotta grease that witness, pick up a quick
ten grand, and we can get the hell out of town

280
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,213
Just sit tight

281
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,214
- Hi

00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,216
- What you got for me, Daddy?

283
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,887
How do you say
you met this cop?

284
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,358
I didn't know he was a cop Why do
we gotta keep talking about this, boo?

285
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,554
- Ow! Ow! 

286
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,563
You know something,
better spit it now

287
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,227
He's just some white cat that I met up
in the club, wanted his business partner killed

288
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,999
Please stop Please

289
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,648
- How long you know him?
- Few months.

290
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,809
If he's a cop,
then I'm in deep shit too

291
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,683
Hear me?

292
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,815
I know

293
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,189
I'll take care of both of us

294
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,926
Yeah, I'll bet you will

295
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,701

296
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,048
Here

297
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,385
Sniff this

298
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,085
- Real power shit

299
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,526

300
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,800
No

301
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,996
I want a clear mind
our first time

302
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,541

303
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,755
We lost the Twelves in the subway.

304
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,758
Didn't you have
a surveillance detail in place?

305
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,920
Well, the plan was to take
everybody down You had us abort it

306
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,122
Look, every available unit
is in on this

307
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,860
- Who's shakin' the trees?
- We're takin'off right now.

308
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,563
- Any idea how you got made?
- Any idea?

309
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,731
- It's the mole
- What mole?

310
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,242
The mole in the system The one I told
you about Keeps warning the Twelves

311
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,246
every time a warrant or a wiretap
request is put through

312
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,942
- We never discussed a mole
- I.A.D. is trackin'it for me.

313
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,883
It's in my case notes
Last week

314
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,548
- I didn't see that!
- It's in the case notes.

315
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,557
You have people in the field
and no clue what they're doin'?

316
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,425
Hey, easy If there's a mole, it's not
Claudette's fault that you got made

317
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,796
It is if she's submitting
wiretap requests for us

318
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,995
- I sent one yesterday
- Aw,Jesus--

319
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,234
All right, I'll uh, I'll call IAD and see
if they're zeroing in on this mole

320
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,038
- What else aren't you readin'?
- You and Trish's names
were not used in the request

321
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,705
I only used the case number.
Her cover is still good.

322
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,045
- What if it's not?
- I-I must have read this quickly

323
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,177
This mole thing
just didn't register

324
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,813
I don't get her back in one piece,
I'll use every goddamn favor I've banked

325
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,950
for the last 1 4 years
to get your lazy ass fired

326
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,796

327
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,593
Come on!

328
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,864

329
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,746
Everyone seems to have heard of
Li'l Psych, but no one can locate him for us

330
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,043
- What have you got?
- IAD's preliminary look into the mole

331
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,415
- They've only had the case a week
- Lemme guess They got shit

332
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,819
Not exactly They've narrowed it down
to court offices on Hoover

333
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,086
- How many employees there?
- 26 F. T.E. 's.

334
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,458
- Give me five minutes with them,
I'll find your mole
- What does five minutes entail?

335
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,260
- A shortcut you can live with
- I'll come with you

336
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,233
- Ligature marks
- Both strangled manually

337
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,300
- Time of death?
- Off the top of my head, four hours ago

338
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,175
Oh, for Christ--
I was three blocks away then!

339
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,181
Landlord found them when
he brought the mail in.

340
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,774
Said this one's her daughter

341
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,012
Been lookin' after her mom
every day, apparently

342
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,181
- Goddamn it!
- You get this worked up over a crime scene?

343
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,759
I been after this guy for a month and a half.
Now two people are dead...

344
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,021
- because I didn't catch him
- Presence of semen...

345
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,326
- on the older victim's abdomen
- The other victim wasn't raped, obviously?

346
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,559
Have to wait for the coroner's report.

347
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,330
Three blocks Horseshit

348
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,066
It's gotta be the cuddler Daughter
came home, interrupted the rape

349
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,075
killed her, finished his business

350
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,374
- and murdered the older woman
- He's never gotten this violent

351
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,676
- What makes you so sure it's your guy?
- It's him

352
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,445
- Witness give you anything?
- What witness?

353
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,520
Saw a man leaving
the building this morning

354
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,590
Uh, excuse me, ma'am, you saw someone
leaving this house earlier?

355
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,387
Yeah, about 8:00
I-I was walkin' my dog

356
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,724
- Did you get a good luck at him?
- He walked right past me

357
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,195
I was pickin' up
after my dog at the time

358
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,427
You know, not enough people
in this neighborhood do.

359
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,402
If you hear anything about Li'l Psych,
you just buzz me pronto

360
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,133
All right?
These aren't stolen, right?

361
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,039
- I'm not givin' my fiancée stolen shit
- No, no, no, no

362
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,977
Look, it's on the level, all right? Hey
Check this one out, right?

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,278
This brother caught his fiancée bent over
pullin' a train with his groomsmen

364
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,217
Now, you can imagine his desire
to relieve himself of it

365
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,289
I'm tryin' not to
What else you got?

366
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,120
Okay. Uh-- Oh, that's
a killer piece of ice.

367
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,628
What's the backstory?

368
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,062
Diamond guy I know had a bad run
at the racetrack.

369
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,430
So he unloaded a little inventory
on me below cost

370
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,435
Yeah, it's beautiful

371
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,405
Check out the four C's:;
cut, clarity, carats and color.

372
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,169
Yeah, what about the fifth ''C''?
Cost

373
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,404
- Two grand
- Two grand.

374
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,480
But listen, you give a bitch
a rock like that

375
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,607
she will get on all fours
for you and bark like a dog

376
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,745
- She's my fiancée
- Two G's will keep her that way

377
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,086
Ruff, ruff, ruff

378
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,694
You get pounds of paperwork
comin' at you every day

379
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,926
Detective duty on top of that--
anyone could have missed it

380
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,502
Yeah

381
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,071
Your real problem was goin'
with the Decoy Squad...

382
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,902
and leaving your starters
on the bench

383
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,874
The gangs are our thing.

384
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,383
- Okay, listen up!
- Attention, please!

385
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:17,087
- Police! Everybody on your feet!
- Let's go

386
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,791
You, you, you, you back there,
and you two in the corner

387
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,198
- Come with me
- What's this about?

388
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,736
- Police business. Keep typing.
- I'm getting Judge Banks

389
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,669
Faster than that!

390
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,743
- Where are you from?
- Detroit

391
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:37,542
- Santa Monica
- Go sit down. You?

392
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,378
-Jersey City
- Compton

393
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:43,250
- You go, you stay You?
- Leimert Park.

394
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,882
- Inglewood
- Where'd you go to school?

395
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,654
Belmont.

396
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,661
- How about you?
- Wilson

397
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,357
Oh, that's bad for you.
It's not in Compton.

398
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,833
- I moved to Farmington when I was ten
- What block did you live on?

399
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,531
- Earl Street
- You two, split

400
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,671
- You know any Farmtown Twelves?
- Who didn't?

401
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,076
- You been giving them
a heads-up on our warrants?
- No.

402
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,308
Sure you did. You gave up
a wiretap yesterday.

403
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,112
- You gave up a cop!
- N-No

404
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,188
- Here come de judge
- Listen, I'm gonna have the big boy here...

405
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,814
crawl up your ass and find out
who you been hangin' with

406
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,292
How much do you want to bet
he finds gang ink on your taint?

407
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,626
Answer now or spend the next
eight to ten wishing you had

408
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,159
Raheem Parems
''Pretty Boy''

409
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,498
What the hell is goin'on here?

410
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,663
Judge Banks
We need a warrant

411
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,207
I'm gonna barely be able
to make rent this month

412
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,869
But the look on Mara's face

413
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,674
will make it all worth it.

414
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:46,012
You think there's any chance
Vic took that money?

415
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,482
What?

416
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,752
He's gettin' a divorce,
a mortgage, rent--

417
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,759
Kid with special needs

418
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,227
It's not like he hasn't taken
the money before without tellin' us

419
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,560
Just shut the hell up

420
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,593
Who's ''Nancy''?

421
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,639
- Police, open up!

422
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,072
Hey, man Ease up on my door
That's real oak

423
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,771
- Ain't that Home Center shit
- Hands against the wall, Pretty Boy

424
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,976
Ah, Desiree Spending a quiet day
at home with your man, huh?

425
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,780
- Must be love
- Turn around, honey Spread 'em

426
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,946
Go on and search
Ain't nothin' on me

427
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,650
- Sit your ass down, skidmark
- Lookin' for your boy Psych

428
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,659
and some bar skank
he's hanging with

429
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,423
- We ain't seen or spoke in weeks
- Really?

430
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,399
'Cause I got a county clerk cryin' about how
she gave you and him some police intel

431
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,968
just yesterday.

432
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,060
Just tell us where
Li'l Psych and the woman are.

433
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,969
- We'll forget we were here
- Y'all don't know nothin'

434
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,440
Aw, I know a few things.

435
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:50,345
Maybe a few that might surprise you.

436
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,576
- Wanna know what I know, Chunk?
-Just go on and tell him where Psych at, Raheem

437
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,622
- You shut your face, girl
- Look, you said yourself
he wasn't nothin' but trouble

438
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,623
Why you think
they call him Psycho?

439
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,693
Don't let that fool
bring the whole crew down

440
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,792
- Call him up
- Hell, no!

441
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,528
You know what? Forget this
I ain't messin' with no fool

442
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,196
And I damn sure ain't waitin'
around for no jailbird, neither

443
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,036
Now you call him
or I'm out the door!

444
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,539
Mm A little rounder

445
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,638
Yeah Yeah, like that
That's perfect

446
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,183
Let's see

447
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,853
- I thought you said you got a good look at him
- Yeah, that's him

448
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,426
This is an ear attached to a head

449
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:40,624
- It's a pretty good drawing
- Did he have a couple of eyes,
maybe a nose and a mouth?

450
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,395
- Don't take that tone with me
- This doesn't help us

451
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,903
He walked by quickly
As I think I mentioned

452
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,531
I was scooping poop
at the time

453
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,407
Just heard.

454
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,538
You okay?

455
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,117
Aceveda didn't
lift a finger for me.

456
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,584
What am I gonna do,
work security?

457
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,985
We all end up there
in 20 years anyway

458
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,522
Hey, Tommy You got some pretty big stuff
hangin' over your head right now

459
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,329
Hey You got him to give
you your job back

460
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,732
Different situation

461
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,828
Yeah, but you know what to say.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

462
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,307
All right

463
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,603
- You don't want to talk to him
- No.

464
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,272
- Look, I will.
- You think this was my fault

465
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,373
- No, I don't.
- You just name a night.

466
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,181
Vanessa and I will have you over for dinner.
We can talk about where you should go.

467
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,778
Oh, you mean God's plan?
Yeah, thanks

468
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,357
Appreciate it

469
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,265
Gotta do this hit
and get paid Let's go

470
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,200
I don't know why you're draggin' me into
this, Kaliel I don't wanna see that shit

471
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,431
You brought that cop in to buy a hit
That makes you just as guilty

472
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,100
- Might as well be in on the shit.

473
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,042
- Yeah!
- Li'l Psych Where you at?

474
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,444
- Goin' to that job on Doyle Street

475
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,743
- Oh, really?
- I'm about 1 0 minutes out.

476
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,719
- You know the spot, right?
- 21 30 Doyle Why?

477
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,516
- You know the spot, right?
- 21 30 Doyle Why?

478
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,522

You holler back when you finished

479
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,923
- I'll cash you out

480
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,723
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Got you an address, man

481
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,957
If I told him to stop, he'd have known
something was up

482
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,332
The mark's in there?

483
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,432
Ratted on a ''G'', so his
Christmas has been canceled

484
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,773
Look, boo, the cops are
after us

485
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,108
Maybe we shouldjust
bounce on outta here.

486
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,876
I don't get my paper
till this snitch starts leakin'

487
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,587
It's on

488
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,350
- What are you doin'?

489
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,588
- What the hell you doin'?

494
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,824
- Trish!

495
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,605
Get an ambulance!

496
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,535
- Can you talk?
- Gray Monte Carlo

497
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,581
I got the plate

498
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,081
- It says, ''To Nancy, Love Donald''
- Really?

499
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,281
I checked our computers It was
reported stolen two weeks ago

500
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,290
Yeah
That sounds about right

501
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,692
- I told you to get me a ring that wasn't hot
- But-But you gave me the code

502
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,527
- What code?
- Well, you winked
Like this was all on the hush-hush

503
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,658
- I didn't wink!
- Yes, you did

504
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:09,001
- No, I didn't
- How did you expect to get
a $1 0,000 rock for two? Huh?

505
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,167
Look, can you get me one
that's on the level or not?

506
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,837
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you
like three or four

507
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:21,314
- Well,just get me a ring that I can use
- Okay Okay

508
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:21,519

509
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,044

510
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,762
Paul and Chris spotted
the license plate number you gave us

511
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,593
I had 'em hang on,
so you could hook him up

512
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,301
Thanks

513
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,970
At least your stuff was good

514
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,783
It's a relief that you're all right

515
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,756
A little worse for the wear,
but I was never the Miss America type

516
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,157
I had to do some coke
to keep my cover

517
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,827
I'll put an injury on duty
for you

518
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,663
- Do you need to see a doctor?
- I should get checked out for STD's

519
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,967
- Get the morning after pill
- Son of a bitch!

520
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,643
Well, if you feel that
you need to talk to somebody--

521
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:25,512
I put a guy out of
the murder business I'm okay

522
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,687

523
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,922

524
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,763
- So sorry, Trish
- Oh, that's cool

525
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,029
- 'Course, that may be the coke talkin

526
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,303
You ready?

527
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,579
Hi Didn't expect
to see you so soon

528
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,052
This is Hunter,
my boyfriend

529
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,522
- Can we talk to you?
- Uh, sure

530
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,593

531
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,611
Tell him what you told me.

532
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,548
Tell him.

533
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:37,287
What happened today was a mistake
It can't happen again

534
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,357
And?

535
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,490
I'm with Hunter
Don't call me

536
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,466
Got that?

537
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:58,843
Elderly victim,
same geo-profile

538
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,744
Elderly victim,
same geo-profile

539
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,780
Apartment was visible from the street,
just like all the others

540
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,317
- It's gotta be him
- Lucas said they found semen at the crime scene

541
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,852
I thought your guy
didn't ejaculate

542
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,081
Maybe he found killing arousing

543
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,093
This guy makes the first
two killings of his life

544
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,992
and then spends
the next couple hours cuddling?

545
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,624
I thought the other rapes were in
the early evening This was early morning

546
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,669
Danny, uh,you saw me
put my gun in my locker, right?

547
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,897
- Yeah I think so
- I can't find it

548
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,806
Be right back

549
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:49,125
Tommy?
What are you doin'?

550
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,219
Walk away

551
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,396
- Okay Get out of the car
- My lawyer says I should plead out

552
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,528
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to

553
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,471
That way I'd get less than a year.
Goddamn prison.

554
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,134
- We can make sure the truth comes out.
- Truth is I deserve more

555
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,269
No, you don't Come on
We can talk about this

556
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,179
Look, man, you got people
inside who care about you

557
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,049
Julien, me We know
what you're goin' through

558
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,247
Yeah, I can see that

559
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,249

560
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,593
Let me talk to Aceveda He's got pull
He can use it if he wants to

561
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,030
I can make him
change his mind.

562
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,399
- So now you'll talk to him
- Yeah I should have done it before

563
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:39,138
Tommy, you still got family
Let us help you

564
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,144
Okay Get Aceveda

565
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:52,111
- Gimme the gun
- Let's hear what Aceveda's got to say first

566
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,628
Okay All right, good

567
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,730
Hey, officer in distress!
Outside! Officer in distress!

568
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,570
- Officer in dist--

569
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,906
- This way.
- Shot fired!

570
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,479
What's goin'on?

571
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,746
- Somebody radio for a paramedic.
- Radio for a paramedic!

572
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,857
- All right, come on. Let's go.

573
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,935
The department's providing
a counselor tonight.

574
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,033
And you two can
leave early to attend

575
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,849
- He was a coward
- He thought thejob was all he had left.

576
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,680
Yeah, and we have to clean up
his mess again.

577
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,389
The session's at 8:00
at the Fischman Center

578
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,857
Thanks I think I'll pass

579
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,595

580
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,058

581
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,535
- So?
- We're seven G's shortJust like Ronnie said

582
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,538
- And the lock?
- Not a scratch

583
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,041
Besides, who's gonna steal seven grand
and leave a fortune behind?

584
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,955
So which one of us did it?

585
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,686
Huh?

586
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,989
None of us did it

587
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,661
Look, this whole Tommy thing
has got us all a little raw

588
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,796
Ronnie reported
the money missing

589
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,807
Lem didn't even want
to steal it in the first place.

590
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,246
So when are you gonna
talk to him?

591
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:04,545
- Day from hell, huh?
- Yeah Worst on record

592
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,624
Even if they don't realize it yet,
you're the one who got 'em back safely

593
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,821
- I thought you were talkin' about Tommy
- That too.

594
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,894
What about that murder/rape?

595
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,666
At first it felt like the cuddler,
but then I threw that out.

596
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,709
Your first instinct's pretty good.
What's your gut say?

597
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,076
That the daughter showed up unexpectedly
He killed her to keep from getting caught

598
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:34,413
Murder excited him
So much so that he finally orgasmed

599
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,887
- Gets off on murder?
- Why would he cuddle for hours afterwards?

600
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,426
Witness saw a man leaving the house
well after the time of death

601
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,255
- Maybe he left and came back

602
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,829
Came back to the house.
The bodies hadn't been discovered.

603
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,527
- See what he'd done
- Show the whole world how potent he is

604
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,571
Sick. But it's plausible.

605
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,313
You gonna see that counselor?

606
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,912
There's something else
I've been putting off

607
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,222
Listen,Julien Sometimes suicide puts
thoughts in people's heads, you know?

608
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,388
Why don't you go with me?
See what that guy has to say

609
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,990
Well, I guess that's the last thing on my
mind right now I'm in a much better place

610
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,659
I've got Vanessa, Randall--

611
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,207
- We're gonna start our own family
- All right

612
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,009
- Call me if you want to talk
- Okay

613
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,315
It's pretty late, sir, and you've already
missed your last three appointments

614
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,513
I'm a cop My schedule's kind of crazy
Can you just get me in now?

615
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,386
When you're done,
place the specimen here

616
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,891
There's some visual materials
there, if you like

617
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,196
Okay

618
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,577

619
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,619
Where is she?

620
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,922
- Whoa! Take it easy, man
- Stay out of this

621
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,364
Hey! I'm with you

622
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,436
Come here

623
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:39,034
She belongs behind a desk, not messing
with what we do on the street

624
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:43,239
It doesn't mean anything She's got
Aceveda and the chief in her pocket

625
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,814
You think I give a shit about that?

626
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,509
She's been playing both of us
against each other from the jump

627
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,178
Now, we start playin' ball together--

628
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,984
She can't command
if we don't let her

629
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,355
Great minds think alike

630
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,879

631
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,108
Do you need anything?
We're closing up in five minutes.

632
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,049
I'm fine

633
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,687

634
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,655
- Yeah
- It's me

635
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,258
I'm sorry about before

636
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,031
He caught me in a lie, and
he kept wanting more details

637
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,630
- and I just didn't want to lie anymore
- How are you?

638
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,538
I have some things
I have to work out

639
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,510
- I've been with him for four years, and--
- I understand

640
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,639
- Listen, don't do anything on my account

641
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:30,209
- I know
- Sorry you got put in this position

642
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,950
- I'm not
- Okay

643
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,585
- Okay

644
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:44,824

645
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,870
You think you can buy me off?.

646
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,440
- Sit down
- I'm cleaning

647
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,203
I need you to sit down
Why don't you sit down?

648
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,044
Playing my favorite song
is not gonna work either

649
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,344

650
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:16,666
- It's for the baby
- What if it's a girl?

651
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,667
Just open it

652
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,006

653
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,309
It's incredible

654
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,095

655
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,066
I've just been such a pain
It's just that being alone and--

656
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,037
- Don't worry about it
- and dealing with my mother--

657
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,041
You're not your mother

658
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:04,775
And I'm nothing like my father
This thing's gonna work

659
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,447
Oh, baby!

660
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,250
- I love you
- I love you too

661
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,759

662
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,829
Vic?

663
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,490
Hey!
What's goin' on, man?

664
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,068
- Bad timing
- No We, uh--

665
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,297
Wejust got engaged.
Officially.

666
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,370
Look

667
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,637
- That's nice
- What's up, man?

668
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,077
It can wait.

669
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,584
- You sure?
- Yeah You celebrate, celebrate

670
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,275

671
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,237

672
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,543
Hello?

673
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,415
Uh, Detective Wyms
Sorry Can I help you?
