1
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,767
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:16,834
You're sick.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,367
Dutch, I was here
yesterday.

4
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,201
I'm here today.
I'll be here tomorrow.

5
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,967
6 months ago we found
this kilo of pure heroin

6
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,700
in the glove compartment of your car.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,501
But you never logged
it into evidence.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,000
Lem got picked up by IAD.
They got him wearing a wire.

9
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,134
Councilman,
a moment of your time!

10
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,301
He came by the office.

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,401
You have regular sit-down
meetings with him?

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,167
Just trying to figure out
which uniform you're wearing.

13
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,733
It sure as hell
isn't Mackey's.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,167
We think Kavanaugh's gonna try
to get Emolia to give you up.

15
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,434
You're not safe here
anymore.

16
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,167
I gotta move you.
Why? What happened?

17
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:45,633
Got a couple
of possible leaks.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,301
You said Vic
wouldn't find out.

19
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,767
Vic! What the hell?

20
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,501
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

21
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,067
Kavanaugh--What did
you tell him?

22
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:56,000
That I saw your guy take
the heroin-- That's it.

23
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:59,101
6 months,
you could have warned me!

24
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,967
One of my men, maybe all of us
are going to jail because of you!

25
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,934
I found you once.
I can do it again.

26
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,367
Oh, Jesus. It's you.

27
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:13,201
What are you doin' here?

28
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:19,134
I had no idea that
Vic knew about...

29
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,700
you giving up
one of his guys.

30
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:22,767
That's my fault.

31
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,437
I made a mistake. I'm sorry. But now...

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,437
we can make sure that
you and Sebastio are safe.

33
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,170
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

34
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,504
I gotta get him
to school now.

35
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,070
You need anything?
You want anything?

36
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,504
No! I'm good. Thanks.

37
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,103
Can your guy
take me back now?

38
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,337
An. Sure.

39
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,137
You know you may have to testify
against Vic and his guys in court.

40
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,903
That's part of the deal you
signed. You know that, right?

41
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,703
No. Not--Not with him
there.

42
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,703
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's, um...

43
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,303
part of the...
conditions.

44
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,836
No, you never said that.

45
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:01,303
Just get him to admit
stuff-- That's all.

46
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,036
But you haven't got him
to admit anything, Emolia.

47
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,036
<i>Tienes que hacerlo
decir algo.</i>

48
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:08,237
<i>Por favor, Emolia.
Por favor.</i>

49
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:10,903
I don't want to do this
no more.

50
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,736
He's been good to me.

51
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,769
I don't want your money.

52
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,437
Please! Take it!

53
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,370
Scott!

54
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:29,370
Scott?

55
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,570
Yeah?

56
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,703
Double security.
Take her home.

57
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,703
Other than the kid
going to school,

58
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,070
no one comes, no one goes,
no one calls, right?

59
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,170
Christ.

60
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,537
See you next time, dad.

61
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,936
I can't wait, sweetie.
Jump in.

62
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,103
Love you.

63
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,003
<i>Mi amor.</i>

64
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,036
I can't believe how much
homework these kids get.

65
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,736
Aaaaaahhhh!

66
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,036
Jesus Christ!

67
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,803
Watch her!
Hang on!

68
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,836
Help the driver!
Help the driver!

69
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:17,070
Get off!

70
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,836
Shit!

71
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,036
It's OK.
Just calm down, sir.

72
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,870
We're gonna get you
some help, all right?

73
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,669
We're gonna help you out. No problem.

74
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,370
Nice work, man.
How's Cass?

75
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:37,437
Uh, nurse's lounge.
She thought it was cool.

76
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,570
Been hanging around you
too much.

77
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,537
Hey, this was your world
this time, not mine.

78
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,504
Speaking of your world,

79
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,270
is there anything else I need to
know about that special work thing?

80
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,036
Everything's OK
with that now.

81
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,003
Corrine, good.

82
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,836
Uh, Dr. Lesser runs our
E.R. wanted to talk to you.

83
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,870
Vic Mackey.
What about?

84
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,636
The girl
who just died.

85
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:01,537
Yeah, officer said they found her
strolling down the 110 freeway.

86
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:04,537
Nothing new. She's a total
nut job. Schizophrenic. But...

87
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,470
I found
these meds on her.

88
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,870
Brother says she's been
taking them for the last month.

89
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:11,103
French label. No doctor.

90
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,669
Bad scrips?

91
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:15,270
What's on the label,
what's inside--

92
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,303
2 very different things.

93
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,437
This shit's killed
5 people in 3 months.

94
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,604
Thought you guys would have
made a dent in this by now.

95
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,337
We've been on this?

96
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:27,403
Yeah. Filled out a complaint
with your captain last month.

97
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,036
Who do I need
to bitch to?

98
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,636
Let me do the bitching
for you.

99
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,703
Where'd your sister
get her meds?

100
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,137
The drugs were supposed
to stop the psychotic breaks.

101
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,604
Where'd you get them?

102
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,437
Just... you know,
the drug store.

103
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:44,303
What kind of drug store fills a
bottle without a doctor's name?

104
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,137
Would you give us
a minute?

105
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,570
Be gentle.
His sister just died.

106
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,870
I'm oozing gentle.

107
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:02,137
Sis was screamin' about
devils before she died.

108
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:05,270
I hope she wasn't talkin'
about you feeding her bad meds.

109
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,903
I--I didn't know
they were bad.

110
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,836
You tell me where you got them,
and don't tell me rite-aid.

111
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,303
Clinica esquina.

112
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,836
The guy who runs it helps locals
with affordable prescriptions.

113
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,303
Black market blue cross.

114
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,903
Better than nothing at all.

115
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,003
Kavanaugh's gotta know we're on to
Lem's wire... us tracking down Emolia.

116
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,036
Why hasn't he
arrested Lem yet?

117
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,736
This guy doesn't follow a
script. We can't assume anything.

118
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,303
You think you convinced
Emolia? At the time.

119
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,470
But I'm sure Kavanaugh's
crawlin' inside her head.

120
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,936
Who knows where
she's at now?

121
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:35,103
So the next move is...

122
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,070
get a note to Lem,
get him up to date.

123
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,736
Everything else,
business as usual.

124
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,403
Go easy
with that, huh?

125
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,970
Hey, Billings. You remember
a doc over at Mission Cross

126
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:45,703
filing a bad scrip
complaint?

127
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,003
Yeah, sorta.

128
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,036
<i>The body count's
sorta piling up.</i>

129
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,070
The hospital board's
about to bring in the feds.

130
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,437
It's gonna make
some noise.

131
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,370
Shit. I just thought it
was some bogus viagra.

132
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:58,403
Stone was gonna get around
to it, time permitting.

133
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,237
5 dead citizens. Phillips is
gonna be crawling up your ass.

134
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:05,203
All right, look. It's
drugs. That's you guys.

135
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,403
Run with it.
Just keep me plugged in.

136
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,337
So they got to
your C.I., huh?

137
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:15,237
He's resourceful.
It won't happen again.

138
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,470
I can tap
some justice contacts.

139
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,203
Maybe we can get her
under witness protection.

140
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,604
She's protected.

141
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:21,936
Thanks, though.

142
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,437
Yeah, well,
they're on to you.

143
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,437
So when are you gonna
arrest Lemansky?

144
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:29,537
You ever get one of those,
like... big, bad feelings?

145
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,137
You can't explain it... can't
explain it at all, but...

146
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,003
can't shake it off
either.

147
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,769
I got one of those...
about you

148
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:40,203
and Mackey.

149
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,103
And I think this investigation
is going off point

150
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,636
because you're too distracted
about those bad feelings.

151
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,669
I've got Emolia
ready to testify

152
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:52,303
and one of his own men
on the edge of turning.

153
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,237
So if you are...
for whatever reason...

154
00:06:57,303 --> 00:07:00,303
maybe...

155
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,537
working on both sides
of the street here...

156
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,137
well, I appreciate the,
uh, friendly heads-up.

157
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:09,836
But I know what side
of the street I'm on.

158
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,470
Yeah?

159
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,203
Yeah.

160
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,403
Check this out.

161
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,970
What's this?

162
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:28,736
This... would be
one of my good feelings.

163
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,470
... what they told us about that
clinic selling the counterfeit scrips?

164
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,237
Most of the prescriptions came
from a French drug company.

165
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,137
They went bankrupt
2 years ago.

166
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,870
Doc was right.
Pharmacology's hit and miss.

167
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,203
Pretty much
a loaded gun.

168
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,970
Tell Billings we need a
warrant for this Esquina clinic.

169
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,303
So what? They
probably already know

170
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,636
you've
got Lem wired.

171
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:51,370
It's not just scumbags
dying, it's families.

172
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:59,970
They're sending him on another
one of those bullshit errands.

173
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:02,070
That way,
he's out of earshot.

174
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,636
The threat out of sight,

175
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:08,936
- They now feel comfortable to share.
- How's Lem feeling?

176
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:12,203
He won't go to the doctor.
I think he's puking blood again.

177
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,769
Shit. Keep
looking in on him.

178
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,703
You bugged
the Clubhouse, too.

179
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:16,870
Yeah.

180
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:20,170
Oig signed off on it.

181
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:24,370
I planted it last night at
the base of a softball trophy.

182
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,337
Did you know that they
were police league champs?

183
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,237
Make sure
all our heads are straight.

184
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,504
OK.

185
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,437
Don't worry. I got this
whole thing sealed off.

186
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,599
TROPHY

187
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,869
Hey, that's sophisticated machinery.

188
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:46,637
Dude, it's a vending
machine.

189
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,570
You put your money in,
shit comes out.

190
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,337
It's a gourmet
quick-mealer, asshole.

191
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,670
Ain't nothin'
without power.

192
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,470
Where are
the goddamn outlets?

193
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,003
Hey, this is Danny.
Leave a message.

194
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,737
I'll get back to you as
soon as I can. Thanks.

195
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,003
Sofer,
what happened

196
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,969
to the goddamn outlets
for the vending machines?

197
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:26,136
Aw, shit!

198
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,903
You were supposed to call
the electrician.

199
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,637
I'll chalk it up
to hormones,

200
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,670
but you better get
down here and fix this.

201
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:36,637
So how'd we do?

202
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:38,003
Some of it looks legit.

203
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,869
Fda seals,
valid expiration.

204
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,969
But there's over a dozen
boxes that don't have seals.

205
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,603
No record of
these being logged in.

206
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,337
We'll run 'em against
bad scrips at Mission Cross.

207
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,804
City council in the house.

208
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:50,270
How'd Aceveda
get here so quick?

209
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:51,737
You think this is the
source of the bad drugs?

210
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,470
What the hell
is Aceveda doing there?

211
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,070
I should get back.

212
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,403
Keep me posted
and so forth.

213
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,136
Bring over Dr. Feelgood. OK.

214
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:02,704
My office
got a call.

215
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,936
I want to make sure everyone's
getting the care they need.

216
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,603
It looks like half
their stock's bootleg meds.

217
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,704
I'm shutting it down.

218
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,236
Mission Cross has been
overflowing with bad scrip deaths.

219
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,503
We hear your clinic
is ground zero.

220
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,836
Our drugs aren't bad.

221
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:18,836
They're illegal.

222
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,603
Yeah,
but they're not bad.

223
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,270
Look, I make a few deals,
cut some corners.

224
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:25,003
It's not about the profit. It's
about helping these people cope.

225
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,437
These are different than
the ones we got from the E.R.

226
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,836
Real labels. American.
Where'd you get these?

227
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,270
Gruhani brothers.
Persian dudes.

228
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,270
Run a small
trucking company.

229
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,337
Got a contract with Pyren
Meryl pharmaceuticals.

230
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,003
Distribute to east L.A.

231
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,270
Gruhani skims off
their shipments.

232
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:45,903
I buy at a third
the price.

233
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,603
Take him.
Come on.

234
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,969
You know a lot of people can't
afford these drugs any other way.

235
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,637
I'm not looking
to hurt this place.

236
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,036
But I got black market scrips
poisoning the Farm.

237
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:59,103
I gotta come down on every
one till we figure it out.

238
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,537
I know, but...

239
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,670
the sooner we can get this
place up and running again...

240
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,603
I'm workin' on it.

241
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,203
Someone I want ya
to meet.

242
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,403
Who?

243
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,136
- It's that lawyer chick, right?
- Yeah.

244
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,070
You hittin' that?

245
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,836
No. I hired that.

246
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,869
You hired a lawyer? Why?

247
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:23,236
Not me. Us.

248
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:25,737
She's walkin' us through
this thing with Lem.

249
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:29,670
Collecting intel on the whole
suit and tie side of things.

250
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,570
You think we're gonna
need lawyers?

251
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:36,303
Just wanna be prepared. It's a whole
new playing field we're on right now.

252
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,070
Holy shit. A lawyer?
Should I get my own?

253
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:42,737
Shane, relax. She's
just advising. All of us.

254
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,070
Detective.

255
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,203
Counselor.

256
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,003
This is detective
shane Vendrell.

257
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,370
Hello.

258
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,903
Welcome aboard.

259
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:53,737
Someplace private
we can talk?

260
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:56,537
Sure. Let's go inside.

261
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,603
Hey, Ricky.
Park that for me?

262
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,236
Yeah, no problem.

263
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,070
This make sense?

264
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:06,303
I think it does.

265
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,836
Private in here.

266
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,704
I was just getting shane
up to speed on our arrangement.

267
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,103
The others, too?

268
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,670
Lem's still wired, so we have
to keep him in the dark for now.

269
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,403
How'd you find out
about the wire?

270
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,737
We were hoopin' in the
back, and I felt it on him.

271
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:25,503
We got him in here, scribbled a
few notes. Found out it was IAD.

272
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,437
So, uh...

273
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,704
have any luck?

274
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,403
I went digging.
The rabbit hole's deep.

275
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,770
The IAD investigation was
initiated by captain Rawlings

276
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,170
A little over
6 months ago.

277
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,603
Rawlings
set us up?

278
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,270
I don't think it was
a search and destroy.

279
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:44,170
<i>It was to prove we weren't
crooked. Cover her ass.</i>

280
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:48,470
Shit. She was trying to
warn me. I didn't listen.

281
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:51,236
When the chief's staff
saw it in play,

282
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,236
They took it
in another direction.

283
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,903
Yeah, what direction
is that?

284
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,936
The way of politics.

285
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:59,036
This new chief
wants to move past

286
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,036
The stain
of the last 5 years,

287
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:03,036
The riots, lawsuits.

288
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,136
He sees the Strike Teams as
a failure of the old regime.

289
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,869
You're a high-Profile
team leader.

290
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,236
Hanging you and your guys
puts a face on that failure.

291
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,370
The brass puts some distance
between then and now,

292
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,603
Buys them their public
cleansing ritual.

293
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,704
And we get screwed
by a history lesson.

294
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,003
What about Kavanaugh?

295
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,370
Closed book. All I found out
is he's way inside.

296
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,036
Looks like he reports
directly to the chief.

297
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,437
Goddamn it.

298
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,804
You need to shift
perception,

299
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,070
Start piling up some
wins in bigger cases.

300
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:34,403
Make internal affairs look like
they're hurting the good guys.

301
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,969
OK.

302
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,537
Yeah.

303
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,503
That's a huge help.
Thanks.

304
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,337
Looks like I'm on board.
You... you know what that means.

305
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,670
You'll need a retainer.
How much?

306
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm a one-Gal shop.
I'll need at least...

307
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,570
10 grand to get started.

308
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:54,170
If I strike early, I might be
able to make a deal for Lem.

309
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,103
Deals
are for the guilty.

310
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,303
Shit!

311
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,770
You need to know the
financial realities of this.

312
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,936
We'll talking about
legal counsel for 4.

313
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,136
That's a shitload
of man hours.

314
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,303
On cops' salaries,
you guys both have families.

315
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,869
We'll worry about that
later.

316
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,003
No compromises.

317
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,103
We all get cleared.
We all keep our badges.

318
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,637
Nothing less.

319
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,704
OK.

320
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,737
Look that over. Call if
you have any questions.

321
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:20,270
I'll be in touch.

322
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,103
Thank you.

323
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,036
Thanks.

324
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,936
What's the matter?

325
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,203
Attorney/client
privilege.

326
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,670
It's all inadmissible.

327
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,637
This quasi-Pharmaceutical
shit...

328
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:40,804
caused an aneurism in your
sister. It stroked her out.

329
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,737
When we find out any of
these drugs were illegal,

330
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:44,470
We're gonna
arrest you for manslaughter.

331
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,003
You get these
from the clinic?

332
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,303
Clinic charged 45 bucks
for her prescriptions.

333
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,370
That wasn't
cheap enough for you?

334
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:54,704
I knew they were Russian mob.
Had the same kind of drug.

335
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,704
10 bucks a bottle. I--I
was afraid to tell you.

336
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,503
Where can we find
these guys?

337
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,203
Operate out of
a strip joint on Hensley.

338
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,403
That's Popovich's place.

339
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,170
Popovich stepped in for Tretiak's.
Running the Red Clan now.

340
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,869
Sounds like a guy we
should get to know. Yeah.

341
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,770
Somebody trashed the Gruhani
brothers' trucking office.

342
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,869
Checked the brothers' homes.
Looks like they left in a hurry.

343
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,804
Both Zal and Babak
are M.I.A.

344
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:17,170
Zal and Babak?!

345
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,170
Yo, Vic!

346
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:20,570
Hey...

347
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,203
Found these
up your ass.

348
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,936
Hey,
close the door!

349
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:31,170
Ho! Is that pussy
smilin' at me?

350
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,503
Hey--

351
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,637
Oh, shit!

352
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:36,804
Come on, girls, you know this
is a patch-the-snatch zone.

353
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,537
Here's your
pink slip, ladies.

354
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:43,637
Mikula Popovich.

355
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:45,737
I hear you're
the Czar to know.

356
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,770
You have warrant
to be here?

357
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:50,570
Violation of pornography laws,
assaulting a police officer.

358
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,470
Probable cause.
Search and seizure, boys.

359
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,936
'Bout a half a dozen of
these in the supply room.

360
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,603
Not much of a supply.

361
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,903
French label. Same shit
we got from the E.R.

362
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:01,804
You sellin' hangover cures, Popovich?

363
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,903
No. I just like pussy.

364
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,537
Dancing pussy.

365
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,170
Turn around.

366
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,704
Last time I saw you,

367
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,103
you said you were
headed back to Saratov.

368
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,637
Mikula lets me strip.
Better money.

369
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,770
Safer than being whore.

370
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:25,303
Congratulations
on your promotion.

371
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,236
Your boss is selling bad
prescriptions out of this club.

372
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,637
They're killing a lot
of innocent people.

373
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,603
I need to know where
he keeps his supply.

374
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,203
I just dance. I know nothing about
drugs or gambling or anything.

375
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,936
How 'bout I share
with Popovich

376
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:44,236
How you ratted out
Tretiak?

377
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,936
Kaboom?

378
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,270
I know they have a garage
on Savanna.

379
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:52,203
Blackburn auto.

380
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,836
That's a start.

381
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:57,570
Tough shit, white cop!
I tell you nothing!

382
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,770
You go shit yourself!

383
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:01,869
Nice tough.

384
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,804
You want to wait
up there?

385
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,570
No. Paramedics are here
if I don't make it.

386
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:09,470
Fear of gates? Border flashbacks?

387
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,603
Maybe he just likes
a challenge.

388
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,337
Told us he got hit by a car,
knocked him down the hill.

389
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:16,136
Witnesses saw it different.

390
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,270
<i>Espera que ellos
te ayuden.</i>

391
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,370
Neighbor saw him jump out of
a moving car. A red Infiniti.

392
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:23,070
Gang retaliation?

393
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,969
Lots of scratches.
No ink.

394
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:27,036
<i>No, no. Estoy bien.</i>

395
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,637
<i>Tienes que ir
al hospital.</i>

396
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:32,036
<i>Aah! Estoy bien.
Gracias por la ayuda.</i>

397
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:34,070
He says he doesn't want
to go to the hospital.

398
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,804
Forearm's
gotta have a fracture.

399
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,170
<i>No ins. No migra.</i>

400
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,903
<i>Esta bien.
Necesitamos ayudarle.</i>

401
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,637
We can't force him.

402
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,936
We can. Trespassing.
Destruction of private property.

403
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:46,337
You're under arrest.

404
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:49,337
Take him. Make sure he
gets medical attention.

405
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,503
Fill him in, huh?

406
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,804
OK.

407
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,836
People are going to break
their necks on those wires.

408
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,503
Then tape 'em down.
People gotta eat.

409
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,303
Aw, shit.

410
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,370
Men's toilet's clogged.
Take care of that mess.

411
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:03,537
Tina talked to Hidalgo
down at Mission Cross.

412
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,170
He wants to tell the truth.

413
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,603
He said he jumped out of the
car because he was scared.

414
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,503
Gave us a description of the woman
driving-- Black, 40s, heavyset.

415
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,503
Picked him up for day work
at the home depot on third.

416
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,170
Drove him out to the Angeles
crest. Made him dig a hole.

417
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,503
<i>Un hueco.
¿Sabes para que?</i>

418
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,804
<i>No enterre a nadie.
Eso es una maldision.</i>

419
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:23,836
What?

420
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,537
She wanted him
to bury a body.

421
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,203
She must have seen him
getting skittish.

422
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,103
He said she threatened
to report him to the ins

423
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,737
if he didn't
finish the job.

424
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:33,403
That's when he freaked
and jumped out of the car.

425
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,804
That's really good work.

426
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,537
Both of them.

427
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:39,969
Absolutely.

428
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,670
Right.

429
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,704
<i>Equinas
cuadradas. Nivel.</i>

430
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,003
Wow. How tall are you?

431
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,670
6'4".

432
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:49,537
She asked him
to make it this big?

433
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,737
<i>¿La señora, ella lo
queria asi de largo?</i>

434
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,704
<i>Si, si, y hacerlo
mas largo.</i>

435
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,136
Yeah. She told him
to make it longer.

436
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,003
Hey! You guys done?

437
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,470
Yeah, you're done?

438
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:03,003
Uh, yeah, sorry. Good job.

439
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,670
Clear!

440
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,537
Nothin', man.

441
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,236
There's nothin'.

442
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,203
Think the whore lied?

443
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,136
You mean the stripper.

444
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,070
What the hell is that?

445
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:28,936
Hey! Jesus, over here!

446
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,036
Holy shit!

447
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,203
Who did this to you?

448
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,570
Vic.

449
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:46,437
"Zal Gruhani." One of the
brothers owns the trucking company.

450
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:49,903
Jesus Christ. This is chemo
medicine. Do you have cancer?

451
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,270
No .

452
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,903
Why?

453
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:58,136
Popovich knew this French
shit was killing people.

454
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,136
So--
He wanted our supply.

455
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:04,036
Take over...our shipments.

456
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,804
I said no.

457
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,903
He throws me...
in that hole for 2 weeks

458
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:11,136
and pumps this poison in me.

459
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:12,737
Until you changed
your mind.

460
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:13,603
Yeah.

461
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,670
Can't say you're not
committed.

462
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:17,804
Where's your brother?

463
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,136
Babak runs
our westside office.

464
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,969
But Russians
don't know him.

465
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:28,804
He's hiding at our mom's.

466
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,570
We hide the drugs
in her garage.

467
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,136
So we pick up the scrips
at the mother's,

468
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:42,003
charge Popovich
with attempted 187?

469
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,070
Yeah.

470
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,903
Hang on.

471
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:50,770
Have a seat, Ivan.

472
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,370
Mikula.

473
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:54,070
Yeah, whatever.

474
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,403
They're back.

475
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,036
What is this room?

476
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:03,136
This is the room
of endless possibilities.

477
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,603
Away from
the department's cameras.

478
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,903
We have a business opportunity
we'd like to share with you.

479
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,704
You turn it down, it's a
short walk back to the cage.

480
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,503
We know about the garage
and your "cancer" research.

481
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,370
Don't know garage.

482
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,136
Just manage club.

483
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,804
We know.
Dancing camel toe.

484
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:19,503
I can arrest you
and your guys,

485
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,136
squeeze one of 'em till we
find out where the drugs are,

486
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:24,737
but... I'm all about
diplomacy.

487
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:26,437
Raising the iron curtain.

488
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:29,537
So, uh, you're
talkin' maybe...

489
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,470
relationship?

490
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:34,370
Just like the way you guys
like to do things back in Moscow.

491
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,070
You like to help folks
who can't afford the...

492
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:39,936
high cost of medicine.
We appreciate that.

493
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,869
We just wanna make sure your
product doesn't kill anyone.

494
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,603
That's just
bad business.

495
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,503
We'll trade you that French
shit you been dealing...

496
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,737
for all-american
FDA-approved shit.

497
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:53,470
We'll give you access to
the Gruhani brothers' supply.

498
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:55,070
You give them 20%.

499
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,070
Why would Gruhani
agree to this?

500
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:59,836
If he doesn't, we'll
arrest him and his brother.

501
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,437
They'll lose everything.

502
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,170
What's in it for you?

503
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:07,370
We get bad drugs
off the street.

504
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:13,704
We also get 10%
off the top

505
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,770
for puttin' you
on the right track.

506
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,303
That's 70%
in your pocket.

507
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,003
Easy half mil a year.
You say yes,

508
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,737
you walk outta here
free and clear.

509
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:26,770
You say no
or try to burn us,

510
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:29,903
Perestroika dies.

511
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,637
I can say... yes

512
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,570
to this relationship.

513
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:35,437
Good.

514
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:38,370
You bring the bad
French scrips to the garage,

515
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,403
and I'll get Gruhani
and his brother Babak

516
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,370
to bring what he's got
in storage.

517
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:44,704
We're gonna need a piece
of our fee up front--

518
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,103
Good faith gesture.

519
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,270
$10,000.

520
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:52,370
You get
a better product.

521
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,370
We track down
the bad drugs.

522
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:56,969
Everybody gets a win. Huh?

523
00:22:57,036 --> 00:23:00,303
Who says there is never police
around when we need them?

524
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,370
Hmm?

525
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,036
Who says that?

526
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,370
Yeah, who says?

527
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,330
Faster than that, Leo.

528
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:12,363
Tell 'em it's for me.

529
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,797
What's going on?

530
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:15,630
We got Mackey making a
deal with the Russians.

531
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:18,830
Hot prescription drugs. You
know anything about that?

532
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:23,029
They closed a city-funded clinic
today for doing illegal prescriptions.

533
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:24,230
People were dying.

534
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:26,330
He didn't call you
about it,

535
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:29,263
talk to you about it in one
of his private conversations?

536
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,663
No.

537
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,230
Did you know our boy has hired
a lawyer for him and his team?

538
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:35,330
Asked around.
Sounded like her.

539
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,663
Rebecca Doyle.

540
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,996
Yeah. You know her.

541
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,029
Met her a few times.

542
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:45,330
Well, it makes sense. She knows
how to protect career criminals.

543
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,096
Another brother
of a doomed coon mother.

544
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:53,763
Fill our Persian drug boy in on
the plan. I'll wrangle the big man.

545
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,697
Yeah.

546
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,296
What the hell's going on?

547
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,129
Come on, man. Sofer told
me you released Popovich?

548
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:00,363
I thought he was the one
pushing these bad meds.

549
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,330
He is. We just don't know
where he keeps his supply.

550
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:04,497
We couldn't hold him
on the shit we found.

551
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:07,697
Phillips just drilled me a new ass channel
for my "lack of community awareness."

552
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,697
This bullshit's
gonna totally ding me.

553
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:12,163
I'm working on something that
might cool your anal burning.

554
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,129
I'll let you know.

555
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:18,730
Those 2 missing persons over
6' 4"-- Guess who reported one?

556
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:22,996
Peaches Pyman. Reported a red
Infiniti stolen this morning.

557
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,129
Puts Alex Gardling
missing may, 2004.

558
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:28,363
6' 5".

559
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,897
Perfect peg
for a very large hole.

560
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,530
You found my car?

561
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,996
Yes, we did.

562
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:37,063
There's something
I gotta sign?

563
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,096
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

564
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:41,563
Anyone else have
the keys, Peaches?

565
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,230
Not to the car.

566
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:45,263
My realtor
has the house keys.

567
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,063
Just sold my house.

568
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:49,797
Moving out of state?

569
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,830
Nope. Just outta
the hood.

570
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:55,029
Where were you this morning
when the car was taken?

571
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:56,797
Sleeping in.
I run a sports bar.

572
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,396
Didn't get to bed
till after 3:00.

573
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,163
While we have you here,

574
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,330
we also need to ask about that
missing persons report you filed.

575
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:04,463
On Alex?

576
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,497
That was over a year ago.

577
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:08,830
You just following up
on that now?

578
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:10,396
Alex your boyfriend?

579
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:12,730
He was.

580
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:16,263
He sent me an email
a few months later.

581
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,996
I should have
reported that, I guess.

582
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,563
So he's alive.

583
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,864
No. I don't think so.

584
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,263
He was terminal.

585
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,663
Some kind of
blood disorder.

586
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,930
He didn't want to
put me through that.

587
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:33,096
He moved to Panama.

588
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:37,163
Wanted to die
in his boyhood home.

589
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,597
So he emailed me
to apologize and say goodbye.

590
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,396
Had techs plant cameras
and mics in the garage.

591
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:49,096
Gives us a 360-degree view
of the whole space.

592
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:51,597
Front row seats to Mackey's
drug swap and cash infusion.

593
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,163
Hey, he's on.

594
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,563
How's our
cancer victim?

595
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,763
He's doin' OK. He's real
worried about his brother.

596
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,830
He should be.
How's your gut?

597
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:01,763
Same, I guess.

598
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,196
You should stay home
tonight, take it easy.

599
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,897
We can take care
of things.

600
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,830
OK. Um...you hear anything
else about that other thing?

601
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:13,196
No. We're gonna give our guy a
call, see if there's any movement.

602
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:14,730
All right, man.
Thanks.

603
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:17,396
I need
2. 2 more. 2 more unis.

604
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,263
Yeah?

605
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,996
CI's giving us the 20
on those bad scrips.

606
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:29,996
Thought you might
wanna be there,

607
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,129
spin it
that Aceveda way.

608
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:35,029
I'll give a call.
You bring the cameras.

609
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,730
It was Mackey.

610
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:45,363
He wants to turn picking up the
bad drugs into a media event.

611
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,663
After he makes the trade, he
takes the payoff in private.

612
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,296
Steals his cake
and eats it, too.

613
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,129
Look, I got a district
to take care of.

614
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,663
You don't mind sticking
around, do you, councilman?

615
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,930
Why?

616
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,797
Help me get rid of that
bad feeling I got.

617
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,730
You know, Prednisone's
pretty toxic stuff.

618
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,864
How'd you--

619
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,864
You looked
in my desk?

620
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,697
Your drawer was open.
I glanced over.

621
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,129
Unbelievable!

622
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:16,930
Why don't you talk to me about
this? I just want to help.

623
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,996
<i>It's not about
what you want.</i>

624
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:20,396
What's going on
here?

625
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:22,663
Who are you? I live
here! Shonda Cromwell.

626
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,163
Well, we've got a warrant
to search the house.

627
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,563
Oh, my God! What did Peaches do?

628
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,563
Detectives.

629
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,996
What is it?

630
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:33,497
You're not gonna
believe this.

631
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,063
<i>Is that a...
is that a body?</i>

632
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,063
Damn. He must have
pissed somebody off.

633
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,763
Yeah. Or maybe he was caught
rifling through their drawers.

634
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,196
Or maybe his dying wish
was "dry clean only."

635
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,096
You, uh...

636
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,463
recognize this guy?

637
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,597
Breaking up
is hard to do.

638
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,597
We found him that way.
In your garage.

639
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:06,663
Oh, my lord!

640
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,697
No! No! No! No!

641
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:13,830
Alex, baby!

642
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:17,263
Oh, no!

643
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:24,930
No!

644
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,497
No!

645
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:32,996
No! No!

646
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,129
That's not the response
of a woman

647
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:37,563
who just tried to bury
a guy in the woods.

648
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,964
No, it isn't.

649
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,330
Sit down. Someone'll get
your statement in a minute.

650
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,597
What's that about?

651
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:48,396
When ya gotta go,
ya gotta go?

652
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:51,396
Hey, I checked out that email
that Peaches said came from Panama.

653
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,396
Turns out our I.T. guys said it came
from an internet cafe in Burbank.

654
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:56,029
Long way from the canal.

655
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:58,430
Thanks. Nice catch on
that Infiniti, by the way.

656
00:28:58,497 --> 00:28:59,430
Oh, sure thing.

657
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:01,730
Oh--God!

658
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:03,029
What happened?

659
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:04,996
- Are you all right?
- Oh, shit.

660
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,263
You want a doctor?

661
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,830
No, really.
It's just stupid.

662
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:10,930
Just help me up, OK?

663
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:12,930
I'm sorry.

664
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:15,396
Are you sure you're OK?

665
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,396
No, I'm fine.

666
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:21,797
Just...

667
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:25,129
Who put
the goddamn pole there?

668
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,996
I got it.

669
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,230
How's the head?

670
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:43,296
I just gave Tina
a whole lecture

671
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:46,497
on never let 'em
see you cry.

672
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,163
Then I give everyone
a ticket to my...

673
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,897
emotional breakdown.
Christ.

674
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:54,430
When I was pregnant
with my first,

675
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:56,363
I trashed the aisle
at Ralph's

676
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,163
'cause I couldn't decide
which disposable diaper to buy.

677
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,096
I just--I don't--

678
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:07,230
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

679
00:30:07,296 --> 00:30:08,897
None of us do,
sweetheart.

680
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:12,530
They all need to mind
their own damn business.

681
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,697
You just worry about
what's in here.

682
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,663
Let the rest of us
wade through the sewer.

683
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,430
So how you gonna
handle it

684
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:41,096
if he makes the deal
with the Russian?

685
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:43,096
You gonna go in or
wait till you have more?

686
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:44,964
Gonna use shock and awe
to our advantage.

687
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,597
Take 'em into custody,
separate 'em,

688
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:48,497
full-court press...

689
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,830
one of them will turn
on the others.

690
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,096
See you later.

691
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:02,463
Good luck tonight.

692
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,263
Hidalgo was afraid
of being deported.

693
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,664
I told him we weren't
gonna do that.

694
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:21,330
What else?

695
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,564
Said sometimes people who cooperate
with the police get their green cards.

696
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,397
No wonder he was
so happy to help.

697
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,097
It's true!

698
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:30,963
Yeah, if you, like,
help bring down a cartel.

699
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,030
But it worked. He's cooperating, right?

700
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:36,930
He I.D.Ed the first black
woman you put in front of him.

701
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,930
Now their witness
is an illegal

702
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:42,896
coerced into a statement by a
false promise of citizenship.

703
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,930
Shit.

704
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:46,863
It seemed like
the right thing to do.

705
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,330
It wasn't.

706
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:53,930
It'll be OK. Dutchman's got a plan.

707
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,696
Ah, sorry
to keep you waiting.

708
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,663
So, it's OK. Is the
pregnant cop all right?

709
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:04,130
She'll be fine.
It's a crazy day.

710
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,530
No kidding!

711
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:09,530
Jeez, I mean, Peaches
killing Alex like that!

712
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,629
I just can't
believe it.

713
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,163
Well, no one can.

714
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,896
What do you mean?

715
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:22,963
We mean Peaches
didn't kill Alex.

716
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,963
She loved him.

717
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,330
You killed Alex.

718
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:28,930
And you a crazy bitch,
'cause I ain't killed no one.

719
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:30,996
Then why did you send
this man to dig a grave

720
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,996
in the Angeles Crest
this morning?

721
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:35,763
What's the going
rate for day workers?

722
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,564
You also work
2 blocks from the cafe

723
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:42,097
you emailed his dead John
letter from

724
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:43,763
so Peaches
would stop looking.

725
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,830
And your shrink-wrapping
skills preserved Alex so well,

726
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,497
we've got your DNA
all over him.

727
00:32:48,564 --> 00:32:51,796
You were trying to move the body
before Peaches sold the house.

728
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:55,297
Shit.

729
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:56,830
First rule
of hole digging--

730
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:59,596
If you're standing
in the hole, stop digging.

731
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:02,130
So tell us the truth.

732
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,464
One crazy bitch
to another.

733
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:14,497
All right.

734
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:15,729
Look...

735
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:19,163
he was with Peaches.

736
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,596
But then he came on to me.

737
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:22,629
That's
understandable.

738
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:28,030
We started having
some fun.

739
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:32,063
Then he falls all in
love with me and shit.

740
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,497
Wants to tell her
everything.

741
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,963
Peaches owned the house. She
would have kicked my ass out.

742
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,863
He wasn't worth all that.

743
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,230
What happened?

744
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,097
We had sex.

745
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:48,729
Tch. Started fighting
about Peaches.

746
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,963
I keep a bat
side of my bed.

747
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,564
Shit just happened.

748
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,596
Up against the truck.

749
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:04,830
Don't you trust us?

750
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:06,030
Sure.

751
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:08,097
What makes you think
I don't?

752
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,197
Chh, chh, chh, chh.

753
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:13,629
When we see
the drugs.

754
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:15,629
Don't you trust us?

755
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:23,963
Hey, Vic.

756
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,896
Old French Zocor.

757
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:29,263
Think I arrested him
once.

758
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:34,030
That's all of it.
Everything we have.

759
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,763
Open it up. Let's
get the real meds in here.

760
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,297
Be ready.

761
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,330
Go on my call.

762
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,464
Babak,
meet your new boss.

763
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,497
I want to see
merchandise.

764
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,996
Got just what
the doctor ordered.

765
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:18,596
Show him.

766
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:24,363
Yes...

767
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,430
you got that tingling feeling like I do?

768
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:40,863
Here's our good faith.

769
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:44,596
The 10,000.

770
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:48,263
Come on. You deserve it.
Just take it.

771
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:52,963
Yes!

772
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,363
That's bullshit!

773
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,063
He almost killed my brother!

774
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,729
He poisoned him and then
he take over business!

775
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,663
Where'd the gun
come from?

776
00:36:08,796 --> 00:36:11,729
Let it go! Hey! Hey!

777
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:12,896
Son of a bitch!

778
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,729
Kill me. Go 'head,
I don't give a shit!

779
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:16,830
Can't let
him walk out of here.

780
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:19,430
He'll give us all away.

781
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:25,963
What the hell?

782
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,629
You take care of it.

783
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:37,564
No. He's your problem.

784
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,163
He's our problem.

785
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,863
Man, come on. There's
gotta be another way.

786
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,130
No other way.

787
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:56,497
You want relationship,
huh?

788
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,830
Just not in the face.

789
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,263
Do it! Do it!

790
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,596
Go! Let's move!

791
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:05,830
Vic!

792
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:15,430
Freeze!
Freeze!

793
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,297
Let me see 'em!

794
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,130
Don't move!

795
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,430
Secure.
We're clear here.

796
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:35,729
Sir, all suspects
are accounted for.

797
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:42,430
Vic--What the hell
is goin' on?

798
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:44,763
IAD just shit
all over our sting!

799
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,097
What's this? What's this!

800
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,464
Detective Baham.

801
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,663
There were blanks
in the guns.

802
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,263
What are you running?

803
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,430
We're trying to establish a
relationship with the Russians.

804
00:37:58,497 --> 00:38:02,363
Knew Popovich wouldn't let the
Persian threat get out alive.

805
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,830
Killing the competition would
have been the blood tie that binds.

806
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,397
Prescription drugs is just
the tip of the iceberg.

807
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:10,663
This shitbag's got ties
going back to the Kremlin.

808
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,629
Would have been
a huge win for us.

809
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,530
Did you think I was makin'
a deal with the Russians?

810
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,830
That I'd actually
kill someone?

811
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,097
I don't know where you got
your intel, but it's wrong.

812
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:22,930
He ran the whole operation
by me this afternoon.

813
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:25,330
I guess IAD'll
spin any kind of fiction

814
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:28,130
to stain good cops bad.

815
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:31,564
Uncuff my men. You idiots did
enough damage for one night.

816
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:46,696
Book him
for attempted murder.

817
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,397
And illegal dancing pussy.

818
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:55,430
Won't topple the roc, but at least
it'll make a dent in the local machine.

819
00:38:58,063 --> 00:38:59,830
Councilman.

820
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,413
Gannon come out
of retirement?

821
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,880
Hey, if it ain't broke,
it ain't the Barn.

822
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:24,246
Heard about IAD.
That's bullshit.

823
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:26,513
Yeah. Typical.

824
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,646
How you feeling?

825
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:30,147
Well, a little better.

826
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:32,480
Thanks.

827
00:39:32,546 --> 00:39:35,080
Uh... can I get you
something to eat?

828
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:37,480
I sorta lost
my appetite.

829
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:39,147
Right.

830
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:42,114
Should we talk?

831
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,847
'Bout what?

832
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,013
Well, maybe I can help.

833
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,513
Looks like the dad's
not in the picture.

834
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Yeah, well,
the dad doesn't know.

835
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,047
I think it's better
that way.

836
00:39:57,114 --> 00:40:01,913
I just... I don't think that
he could handle it right now.

837
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,180
I'm gonna do this
on my own.

838
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:07,713
If you change your mind,
offer still stands.

839
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,480
All right.

840
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:12,680
Thanks.

841
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,546
I've got lupus.
I've had it for 15 years.

842
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:42,980
It's just been
flaring up lately.

843
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:45,446
15 years.

844
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:47,480
Got my girls.

845
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,214
James.

846
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,279
I've got family.

847
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:53,546
I just need you
to be you.

848
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
Little southern'll
comfort that belly.

849
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,513
I think I'll stick
with the pink.

850
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,847
I like the pink.

851
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:15,780
Billings wants us
to clean up in here,

852
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,813
make sure there's
no code violations.

853
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,013
Seems someone ratted him
out to the fire Marshall.

854
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,446
Who would do
something like that?

855
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:28,947
You know what we should do-- Get rid
of some of this shit on the locker.

856
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:31,114
It's a little too close
to this light.

857
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,580
No! Not the trophy, man.
I went 3 for 4 to win that.

858
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:35,713
You went 0 for 5,
but who's counting?

859
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,180
Aw, screw it. It's a
cheap piece of shit.

860
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,580
You know what? We'll just
beat IAD again next year.

861
00:42:02,513 --> 00:42:03,947
Hey.

862
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,747
Hey, Dutch.

863
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,313
I just wanted
to thank you.

864
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,246
You keep going
out of your way to help me,

865
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:21,646
and, well... I just
really appreciate it.

866
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:24,546
Oh, sure thing.
Any time.

867
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:25,713
See you tomorrow?

868
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,480
- Night.
- Night.

869
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:50,747
Word is IAD
stepped on a big sting

870
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:54,114
you guys were setting up
on the Russians.

871
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,379
They just keep hurting
the good guys.

872
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:59,446
Could have picked it up
on Lemansky's wire, maybe,

873
00:42:59,513 --> 00:43:02,313
thought you guys
were making some kind of deal?

874
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,313
Possibility.

875
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:06,214
There's egg
all over IAD's face.

876
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,346
If this tipped Kavanaugh off
that you're onto the wire,

877
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:11,747
he's gonna be pissed.

878
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:15,114
I have Ronnie sweep for bugs every day.

879
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,446
He found one
in the club house.

880
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,680
We knew it had to
be Kavanaugh,

881
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:22,147
so we spun it our way
just like you said.

882
00:43:22,214 --> 00:43:23,980
Jesus Christ!

883
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:26,580
You knew the place was
bugged when you talked to me?

884
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,246
You used me, too?

885
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:30,313
Any part of that
conversation is privileged--

886
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:32,513
No, you withheld information.
You lied to me.

887
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,313
No, it--
It happened fast.

888
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,513
I--

889
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,114
Look, I'm wingin'
it here.

890
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:41,580
I'm sorry.

891
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:43,980
Any move he makes
against us now

892
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:48,580
just seems like part of an
ongoing misguided vendetta.

893
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:51,114
I'd better prepare
our next move.

894
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,147
Because Kavanaugh is
going to arrest Lemansky...

895
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,747
and he's going to try to
hurt you by hurting him.

896
00:43:56,813 --> 00:43:59,080
We'll be ready
for that, too.

897
00:44:00,913 --> 00:44:06,613
You know what? We'll
just beat IAD again next year.

898
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:14,279
You want me to go back to the Barn,

899
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,346
plant another one
someplace else?

900
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:19,880
Billings wants us
to clean up in here...

901
00:44:19,947 --> 00:44:21,646
don't bother.

902
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:24,980
You know...

903
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:28,214
Farmington did beat us
in the semi-finals.

904
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,279
Could have been
talkin' about that.

905
00:44:30,346 --> 00:44:32,813
Thanks, Buzz.

906
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
You should get goin'.

907
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:37,413
No! Not the trophy, man.
I went 3 for 4 to win that.

908
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,947
More like 0 for 5,
but who's counting?

909
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,214
Aw, screw it.
It's a cheap piece of shit.

910
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:47,047
We'll just beat IAD
again next year.
