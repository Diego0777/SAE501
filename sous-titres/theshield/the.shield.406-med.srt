That guy with Hielo-
that's Ernesto.

165
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,520
He's the Byz Lat
contraband king.

166
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:44,465
I guess he's gonna have to
run his kingdom from a cell in Chino.

167
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,769
- The other Mexican- that's Garcia.
- [Chattering]

168
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,706
He's the one who works
on the /ndian reservation.

169
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:55,836
- I've been known to get
my hands on a pack or two.
- I need cartons. Lots of them.

170
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,915
- I can get 300 cartons a month.
- How much?

171
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,382
Ten thousand, in cash,
on delivery.

172
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:07,288
Got him hooked,
about to get booked.

173
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:14,264
That was quick. I hope you
didn't mind me calling your cell phone.

174
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,492
Not at all. Corrine Mackey,
this is Captain Monica Rawling.

175
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,036
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. How's the girl?

176
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:24,198
Joya's unconscious. Her esophagus is badly
burned, and there's stomach damage.

177
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:27,766
- She's been put on a ventilator.
- Where are the parents?

178
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,869
That's her foster father
over there.

179
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,880
He brought her in.

180
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:34,041
There are also signs
of a sexual assault.

181
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,051
We're waiting for the results
of the rape kit.

182
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,246
- What did she swallow?
- Some sort ofhousehold cleaner.

183
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,823
Should have killed her.
/t still might.

184
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:42,893
- Can we see her?
- [Door Opens]

185
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:59,003
- [Monica] Child Services?
- They're sending over a caseworker now.

186
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:01,077
Yeah, that'll fix everything.

187
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:04,045
- Is Joya in a private or a group home?
- [Corrine] / don't know.

188
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,982
Could be an attempt by the rapist
to destroy D.N.A. evidence.

189
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:12,545
If the sexual assault extended
to, uh, an oral nature.

190
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,420
Thanks for calling right away.

191
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:18,051
Bring the foster care father to the Barn.
Get his take on what happened.

192
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:20,323
We'll run by his house,
see what we can learn.

193
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:24,026
- You're splitting us up?
- I'm just marshaling our resources.

194
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,063
- Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.
- Captain Rawling.

195
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,141
- Claudette Wyms.
- Hi. How's Joya?

196
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,209
- She's suffered a lot of damage.
- /t's terrible.

197
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,210
These children
have so many problems.

198
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,110
- They experience violence, and they get violent.
- Hi.

199
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:41,150
- Who was home?
- All the kids. We have seven with us now.

200
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,811
Frank was here,
I was out getting groceries...

201
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:46,287
and he called me
on his way to the hospital.

202
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,585
- Hi. What's your name?
- Bibi.

203
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,683
We need to see
all the children.

204
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,887
Okay. Gather everybody.
Bring 'em back to the living room.

205
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,897
Can you show us where
your husband found Joya?

206
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,298
- Sure. This way.
- [Children Chattering]

207
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:04,265
Uh, this is the kids'bathroom.
Over here.

208
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,741
Sorry about the smell.
Joya threw up.

209
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,904
You found an empty bottle
of drain cleaner. Where is it?

210
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:13,040
I'll ask Bibi. She's the oldest.
She looks out for the younger ones.

211
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,448
These meds belong
to all the kids?

212
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:18,453
Yeah.
They're all taking something.

213
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,682
Like I said,
they have problems.

214
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,691
Why is a padlock
on this door?

215
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:26,092
Oh, the closet
is our safe place.

216
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,165
[Claudette] Safe for who?
You lock the kids up in here?

217
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,170
[Woman] Yeah. We give them
time-outs on occasion.

218
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:37,365
Most of them
have behavioral disorders.

219
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,840
This lets them calm down,
keeps the other kids safe.

220
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:43,504
You realize you've admitted
to child endangerment?

221
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:45,548
My husband says it's not.

222
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,948
/ mean, people send kids
to their rooms, right?

223
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,544
This is the only space we have.

224
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,385
Any of the kids capable
of attacking Joya?

225
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,755
- Making her drink Drano?
- Take your pick.

226
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,919
- Got an update?
- Yeah. The prelim just came back.

227
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,194
Joya wasn't raped this morning.
The healing looks to be 24 to 48 hours.

228
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,132
- What about the father?
- Definitely a control freak...

229
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:09,933
so the closet o' horrors
doesn't surprise me.

230
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,941
- Not sure he's a rapist though.
- The files from the foster care kids?

231
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,444
Yeah, Child Services just sent 'em over.
They read like the Marquis de Sade.

232
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,606
One of'em's probably
our liquid plumber.

233
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,513
So, we have six suspects.

234
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,143
- You mean seven.
- I'm not counting Joya.

235
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,188
- Neither am /.
- [Claudette] There were six kids.

236
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,818
- We met them all.
- Not according to these C.S. documents.

237
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,896
Yeah?

238
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,057
Darnell Garry, age 17.

239
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,967
Bipolar.
A history of violence.

240
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,232
So where is he?

241
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,900
Tell us about Darnell Garry.

242
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,308
He was the oldest.
Ran away about three months ago.

243
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,543
- You never called Children's Services?
- / did. Also sent an e-mail.

244
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,743
/ can print it out for you.

245
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,219
They never wrote or called
to check on his status?

246
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,381
No. Trust me, lady...

247
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,516
I've been working
for the county a long time.

248
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:06,027
- / know how to cover my ass.
- You kept cashing Darnell's checks after he left.

249
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,691
How are you gonna cover your ass
on that one?

250
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,964
My wife handles the books.
We get a lot of checks for these kids.

251
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,971
It's hard to know
the difference.

252
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:19,804
We caught the mistake last month.
Sent them an e-mail to bill us.

253
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,208
You don't seem too broken up
Darnell took off.

254
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:25,247
Darnell was uncontrollable.

255
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:28,682
Belonged in a hospital
or a prison, not my house.

256
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,785
Sounds like your closet therapy
didn't take, huh?

257
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,092
Child endangerment's a crime.

258
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,093
[Monica]
Consider your foster care license gone.

259
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,096
How hard we press charges,
that's in your court.

260
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,928
When was the last time
you saw Darnell?

261
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,002
A couple weeks ago.

262
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:49,334
Caught him in the house
when he thought Liz and I were gone...

263
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,465
stealing groceries,
other kids' prescriptions.

264
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,476
Any idea where he went
after that?

265
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:59,948
[Sighs] Try his mom. She's a junkie.
Him too, probably.

266
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,678
The only meds he didn't take were
the ones that actually might help him.

267
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,890
The dad reported Darnell Garry
left months ago.

268
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,552
How come someone didn't file
a missing persons report with us?

269
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,722
There's no record of him
being missing.

270
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,493
This is a copy
of the e-mail he sent you.

271
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,501
He's been gone for three months.

272
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:23,471
How many visits have you
had there since then?

273
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:27,442
- Two.
- And you didn't notice
one of the kids was missing?

274
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,980
The checks were never stopped.
Darnell was never flagged for a follow-up.

275
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,879
You know who ends up doing
that follow-up? My cops or the M.E.

276
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,145
Half these kids are gonna
end up in the penal system.

277
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,778
They're time bombs. We shuffle them
around from place to place...

278
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,289
Iose track of them
until they explode.

279
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,519
Look, /'m here as a courtesy.

280
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,358
If you wanna lecture about
the foster care system...

281
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,489
teach an extension class
at UCLA.

282
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,693
I understand the difficulties
and limitations.

283
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,669
I deal with my own,
but we have got to do better.

284
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,671
No, you mean I've got to do better.

285
00:15:56,773 --> 00:16:01,301
/f we got a missing teen, stop taking it
out on me and do something to find him.

286
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:04,676
In Domestic, I had to watch
you people on a daily basis.

287
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:08,308
I saw more concern for filling
federally funded beds...

288
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,318
than in helping
reunite families.

289
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,049
We've got tens of thousands
of kids to care for.

290
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,819
- This is one mistake.
- This is a kid!

291
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:20,260
So's the one in the hospital
with half a throat.

292
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:23,424
You don't like my job performance,
call my supervisor.

293
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,558
Fine. I'll explain
why you've been arrested.

294
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,467
- Hey! For what?
- Negligence, child endangerment.

295
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,097
You were assigned to that household,
so I'm holding you responsible.

296
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,574
- Officer, take him.
- What's she doing?

297
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:37,078
- [Man] Hey.
- Standing on her soapbox.

298
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,741
She, uh, have her own,
or you let her borrow yours?

299
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:45,778
[Rap]

300
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,417
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Your plates are expired, Illinois.

301
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,859
License, registration.

302
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:56,160
You boys are enjoying the party.
/ smell marijuana.

303
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,133
All right. Get out of the car.
Step out now, all of you. Move it!

304
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,329
[Man] Come on, man.
We'rejust seeing the sights.

305
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,238
- Put your hands on top
of your head and turn around.
- Let's go. Come on. Step forward.

306
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:07,708
- [Danny] You boys affiliated?
- What?

307
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:11,178
- Gang ink. You got any?
- Hey.

308
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,112
8th Street. What is that?
Your Boy Scout troop?

309
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,980
We ain't got no business here.
We're just visiting my cousin. That's it.

310
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:19,578
- Step back.
- I'll let your cousin know
when your visiting hours are.

311
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,996
Danny.

312
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:31,932
Hey, Vic, / think we got your new official
department-issue ride.

313
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,629
- [Vic] Oh.
- Chicago homeboys with too much narcotics.

314
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:39,038
You make that stick,
those tickets are all yours.

315
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,009
- Oh, leather seats!
- Fully loaded.

316
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:45,047
For you,
I'll even throw in dinner.

317
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:51,243
[Chattering]

318
00:17:56,193 --> 00:18:00,357
- What happened?
- O.C.U. sat on Kozi cabs for two hours.

319
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,398
Half the Russian mob showed,
Kozodav didn't.

320
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,024
Sullivan made the call
to go in anyway.

321
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:08,195
- Kozodav's in the wind?
- Yeah, Sullivan said he had no choice.

322
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,205
A residential building
was about to be torched.

323
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,207
He figured he'd
press the soldiers...

324
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,209
and use them to give up
Kozodav's location.

325
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,779
They're all asking for lawyers.

326
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,472
Monica got you up to speed?

327
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:21,380
- She gave me the ABC's.
- Good. We need your help.

328
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:25,251
I'll get my team together,
start digging into Kozodav's haunts.

329
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,051
- Not for fieldwork.
- What do you want my man for?

330
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,058
To help transcribe videotapes.

331
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,185
You oversaw the operation.

332
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,456
If there's any clue to Kozodav's
whereabouts, we need to know.

333
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,509
Where are you going?

334
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:51,377
Every second I stay here,
Kozodav gets further away.

335
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:55,918
My boss just gave you an order.
Follow it.

336
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,723
- You got a minute?
- A building full of people's
about ready to burn down.

337
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,560
- A minute's about all I got.
- Look, I know this church tape...

338
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,226
is a problem for you, but /
should be the one looking for this guy.

339
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:15,896
- It's O.C.U.'s case.
- Hey, we got years, Roy.

340
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:19,942
Something's up. All I'm askin' is
you shoot me straight.

341
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,776
Whatever you did to piss off
Aceveda, it worked.

342
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,007
He's got leverage with the chief,
and he's using it.

343
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:29,813
I'm keeping my nose clean.
I'm doing what I'm told. I'm delivering.

344
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,219
Yeah, you been doing good lately,
but you got a damaged jacket.

345
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:36,224
- I'm fixing that.
- Do yourself and your family a favor.

346
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,386
Whatever you need to do
to make sure Rawling succeeds, do it.

347
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:41,396
Because the shot
she's giving you...

348
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:44,365
it may be the last one
you got in this department.

349
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,206
- [Claudette] We're looking for your son.
- Darnell?

350
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,473
- You with Child Services?
- We're with the police.

351
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,378
There was an incident at Darnell's
foster home. He may be a witness.

352
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,610
Whatever it was,
he probably did it.

353
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:05,518
- Why do you say that?
- That boy is no good.

354
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,819
He comes around, steals my stuff,
sells it for drug money.

355
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,859
- Where does he score?
- All over.

356
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,861
I can tell you
how he earns his pay.

357
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,194
- [Claudette] He's got a job?
- Just blow jobs.

358
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,791
He sucks fag dick
on 4th Street.

359
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,632
Tell him I say hey.

360
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:25,037
I didn't mess with Joya
or make her drink anything.

361
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,872
We'd love to take your word for it,
but we're gonna take a D.N.A. sample...

362
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,641
compare it with the semen we
found inside her just in case.

363
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:34,114
I ain't giving you
permission for that.

364
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,685
Frank is still technically
your legal guardian.

365
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,687
- We have your permission?
- Of course.

366
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,728
I may have done some shit.
But what about him?

367
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,891
- You ain't gonna let him go free, are you?
- So you did rapeJoya?

368
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,231
[Darnell] You see what / gotta do
on the street to survive.

369
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,067
When am I gonna get me some?
When am I gonna get to bust a nut?

370
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:01,940
- She's seven.
- I hope you fry.

371
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:05,344
This is his fault-lockin'us up
in a closet and shit.

372
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:09,009
A few minutes to calm you down,
you animal.

373
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,314
- More like hours!
- Sit down.

374
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,348
[Darnell]
He called it "the hole. '"

375
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:20,395
Put the oldest one in charge
and make 'em keep order.

376
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:25,127
Little ones in there cryin'
and wailin'for hours in that closet.

377
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,462
[Sighs]

378
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,937
And as for the Drano,
that ain't me.

379
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,942
Sounds like Bibi
tryin' to keep the peace...

380
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,877
so she don't get locked up
in Frank's hole.

381
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:45,043
You need to get Ernesto to admit that he's
selling the cigarettes across state lines.

382
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:48,215
But let him say it.
Don't get overeager, tip your hat.

383
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,260
Don't worry about it, bro.
He thinks of me like a brother.

384
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,261
He won't see nothin' comin'.

385
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:57,265
Before I went away,
I banged his 14-year-old sister.

386
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:01,133
Took her virginity. [Chuckling]
Fool didn't have a clue.

387
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,762
/ told him / was helping her
with her history homework.

388
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,773
Try the history
of poppin'cherries.

389
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,105
Why don't you keep it
to yourself, man?

390
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:10,111
What's the problem, superstar?

391
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:12,147
If there's grass on the field,
you gotta play ball, right?

392
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,580
- You know what, dude?
- Hey, cut it out, man!

393
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,549
- The guy's a dick.
- Yeah, well, he's my C./.

394
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:20,453
Okay, this is my run.
So just follow my orders.

395
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,525
First one is to give him
and me a little room.

396
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,594
Okay?

397
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,232
All right.
Showtime, lover boy.

398
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,429
Garcia called with
the drop point for the goods.

399
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:41,236
[On Wire]
Doin' good, bro.

400
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:48,343
There's more where this came
from when the smokes get to St. Louis?

401
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,385
/ told you not to push it,
you skid mark.

402
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:52,682
You should've
emphasized the point.

403
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,951
Relax. Enough business.

404
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,994
[Whistles]

405
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,723
Got you a present
for all your hard work.

406
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,595
Puta's all dressed up
with no one to blow.

407
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,931
Mommy's gonna make papi happy.

408
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,971
[Mutters]

409
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:16,778
[Monica]
/ looked into the videotape.

410
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,680
The woman who shot it, her nephew works
at Antwon Mitchell's rec center.

411
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:24,276
You think Antwon edited the tape?
Sent it to the press?

412
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:26,514
I know it's not an accurate depiction
of what happened there.

413
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,392
Help me bury this.

414
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,395
/ know the press.
You can't unring this bell.

415
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,900
I'll be handing these seizure cases
over to the police committee.

416
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,630
The rest seem fine.

417
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,832
I also looked into
the crime stats.

418
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:49,674
The numbers are up because you manipulated
yours to make things look better.

419
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,304
I'm getting punished because
I reported mine accurately.

420
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,110
Sounds like now's a good time
to start formulating...

421
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,811
an exit strategy
for this seizure policy.

422
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,888
Only person who could take me
off this is the chief...

423
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:01,218
and not without one hell
of a fight from me.

424
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:04,293
Then I'd start training.
I just spoke to him.

425
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:06,885
He's still blue in the face from having
to explain to the A.C.L.U. lawyers...

426
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,693
why you put a cop like Vic in charge
of such a controversial program.

427
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,794
That's what all this is about-
Mackey.

428
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:19,033
Starting tonight,
Vic's the face of that church invasion.

429
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:22,202
Pulling him off the street
might buy you some slack.

430
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:26,248
He's working.
/ stand by my choice.

431
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:29,512
- You just won't take help, will you?
- Help from you? Sure.

432
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,678
Orders? No.

433
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:38,756
If Mackey's off the table, I'm gonna have
to set my sights on the policy in general.

434
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:46,295
- That was an illegal U-turn, right?
- [Danny] That's right.

435
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,097
/'m sorry. / don't know
this part of town too well.

436
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,672
I've been looking for the 5 Freeway
for, like, 20 minutes.

437
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:52,708
- /n the rain, it's brutal.
- Yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?

438
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,267
- Yeah, it does.
- Three blocks, make a right on Prince.

439
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:59,439
- Thank you.
- Let me see your license and registration, please.

440
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,882
- Right.
- Is that an open container?

441
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:06,422
- No. It's corked.
- /t's been opened. That's illegal.

442
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,582
It's from lunch.

443
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,716
Dude, it's a $400 bottle
of Pomerol.

444
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:12,727
/ wasn't gonna leave it
for the busboys.

445
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:14,820
Get out, please.

446
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,525
I had a glass of wine with a client,
like, three hours ago.

447
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:20,603
- Man, I'm not impaired.
- I said, out of the car, sir.

448
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,399
- l- Do l-
- You heard the officer.

449
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,474
Come on.
Get outta the car.

450
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:31,071
Step to the back of the car.

451
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,411
Step up against the car, please.

452
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,677
Bootleg DVD's.
Do you intend to sell these?

453
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:42,087
No. It's for me.
A guy on Olvera sells 'em cheap.

454
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,285
- Are you affiliated?
- What?

455
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:48,091
With a gang. / see the ink.
Pull up your shirt.

456
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:50,223
What's your deal, man?
Get your hands off-

457
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,961
Ow! God! Back off, man!
Take it easy!

458
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,766
All right. Look,
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

459
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:59,808
I'm sorry, Officer.

460
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:05,747
What the hell
are you doing?

461
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:08,374
I'm gonna document his ink.
I'm gonna tow his car in.

462
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,214
If his lawyer can't prove that he
didn't intend to sell those DVD's...

463
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,484
we'll seize his vehicle.

464
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:19,688
That's what we do, right?
Might even get me some Laker tickets.

465
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,990
Hey, Vic,
you need to see this.

466
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:24,157
- [Mackey] Later, okay?
- No. Now.

467
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,971
Lock the doors.

468
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:37,111
- [Lock Clicks]
- This surveillance tape's
from Shane's car last night.

469
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,740
- [Antwon] One more thing.
- [Shane] What?

470
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,841
How would you like to get
that little girl's body back?

471
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,120
Your bullets and all.

472
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:51,557
- How?
- Trade. A body for a body.

473
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,930
Who?

474
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,570
Vic Mackey.

475
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,201
His body for hers.

476
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:11,742
You've been telling me
he's behind all my misery.

477
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:14,783
And he ain't gonna stop
comin'after me, so-

478
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,850
- No way.
- I'm offering you a chance at liberation-

479
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,953
freedom from the shackles
that bind you.

480
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,964
You know what?
/ don't give a shit.

481
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,364

- The Russian's at this address.
- Alone or with company?

643
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:13,228
Alone. Just waiting
to get picked up.

644
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,169
Who's the informant?

645
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,104
- Hielo Gutierrez.
- No. Uh-uh.

646
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:22,568
You tell me it's Hielo,
I can't believe that.

647
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:26,303
He's like a brother to me,
all right?

648
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:30,283
He bragged he popped
your sister's cherry when she was 14.

649
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:32,946
He said it was so tight,
he thought it was her asshole.

650
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:37,617
Told you he was just helping her
with some... history homework.

651
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:48,795
You do whatever you feel
is appropriate with that info.

652
00:39:48,904 --> 00:39:52,863
- I'll make sure it doesn't blow back on you.

[Cocks Gun]

656
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:24,133
You hired an arsonist
to torch a building.

657
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,901
I need his name.
I need an address.

658
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,307
What is this?
[Groaning]

659
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,604
If the next word out of
your mouth isn't a name...

660
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:34,444
I pull the trigger.

661
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,417
Gregor, uh- Gregor Barinat.

662
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,419

- [Monitor Beeping]

664
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:56,500
I didn't think anybody'd be here
to look over her.

665
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:59,699
- Makes two of us.
- Any changes?

666
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:03,634
They say she's a little better.

667
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,648
You think I lost it
a little bit today.

668
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:16,557
We've all got burrs
under our saddle.

669
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:22,755
My, uh...

670
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:27,124
best friend growing up...

671
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,796
had a father...

672
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:35,673
who used to knock her around
pretty regularly.

673
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:37,769
/ knew what was happening...

674
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:43,014
what she was enduring,
but / couldn't-

675
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,656
I just felt helpless.

676
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,495
It feels worse now.

677
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:03,665
If you're here to take a second shift,
I've got some, uh...

678
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:07,799
seizure paperwork I've gotta prepare
for Aceveda's eyes.

679
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,474
- [Door Closes]
- Guess who's here, Alex?

680
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,487
It's Gregor.

in that apartment, huh?

- Huh?

Don't do it. Don't shoot.

687
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:10,902
[Sighs]

688
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:15,136
- [Slow Tempo]
- I'm not a great cook. I'm sorry.

689
00:43:17,112 --> 00:43:19,012
l- I thought it was terrific.

690
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:21,207
Thanks.

691
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:26,643
- You okay?
- Yeah.

692
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,382
It's, uh- It's that
little girl, Joya.

693
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:34,694
I don't know. Y-Y-

694
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:39,130
Dead bodies-You get used to them.
It doesn't affect you.

695
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:41,225
But there's something
about a kid...

696
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:43,668
hanging on, fighting.

697
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:46,332
Yeah, l- I know.

698
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:52,745
- [Laughing] Hey.
- Hey.

699
00:43:52,848 --> 00:43:54,748
You want me to read
that to you again?

700
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,818
Come here.

701
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:00,446
[Chuckling]
Oh.

702
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,523
Big Buddy Bear.

703
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,793
"Buddy was a big brown bear.

704
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,456
A bumbling, stumbling,
sweet-as-honey bear."

705
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,331
- Goddamn it!
- What's up?

706
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,700
I've been trying to get in touch
with Hielo for the last hour.

707
00:44:16,805 --> 00:44:18,705
He's not answering his cell
or at home.

708
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:21,139
He's probably getting laid.
If I spent five years in prison...

709
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:23,404
you wouldn't get my face
out of snatch for a month.

710
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:27,039
The chief already made promises to
the Bureau of Prisons to spring him early.

711
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:30,243
If this guy ghosts,
I'm gonna look like an asshole.

712
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:32,320
No worries. He'll show.

713
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:45,594
- [Monica] Kozodav?
- And the arsonist.

714
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:49,364
- How'd you track him?
- Some unis responded to a shots-fired call.

715
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:53,339
These two were there when they arrived,
cuffed and gagged.

716
00:44:55,377 --> 00:44:57,743
I'll take it any way
I can get it.
