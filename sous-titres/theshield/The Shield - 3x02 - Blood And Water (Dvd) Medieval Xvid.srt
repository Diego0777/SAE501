1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:06,232
- Jesus, between your snoring and the phone--

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,070
- Yeah?
- Rise and shine, gorgeous.
Time to go to work.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,081
- Where are you?
- About five feet from your door.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,855
- I guess we're up

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,595
Hey, man

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,359
I set up a meet with the Byz Lats.
We're gettin'those guns back tonight.

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,196
- Should I make some coffee?
- Nah No time Thanks anyway

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,568
- I was asking him
- Don't worry about it, darling.
Just go back to sleep.

12
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,870
I'll be home
in a few hours.

13
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,003
Grab your gun.
Leave the badge.

14
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,082
We're not cops tonight
We're neo-Nazis

15
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,579
- Bye, baby
- Mmm

16
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,620
All right
Ready?

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,690
Yeah

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,496
I see someone parked
a new Lexus in your parking spot.

19
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,565
Mara needed it for work
And it's pre-owned

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,261
Yeah, and I told you not to buy it for her.
We're gonna talk about this later.

21
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,969
So this Garza guy's just gonna
give us his guns? Why?

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,601
It's called commerce
Here, you carry the money

23
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,704
- Holy shit
- Army-issue MP5's don't come cheap

24
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,775
- Aceveda signed off on a wad like this?
- Not exactly

25
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,322
Look, I didn't have time to go
through the proper channels

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,392
- This is from our money train stash?
- It's for display purposes only

27
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,691
Then it goes right back where it came from
I told Kern that I'd get the guns back

28
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,992
It's gonna make our jobs
easier and safer

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,796
So you dipped into our life savings
to keep a promise to some scumbag

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,401
Aceveda wouldn't sign off on time,
so we're gonna do this one off the books

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,672
We won't even get credit for taking
these goddamn guns off the street

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,543
- We're gonna talk about this later too
- Yeah

33
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,121
You Garza?

34
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,893
You have a shipment of MP5's
They belong to our organization

35
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,456
- Which is?
- The Sword of the Creator

36
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,035
If the gats are yours,
how come I got 'em?

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,437
We put down a deposit

38
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,668
The dealer got nervous
and dumped 'em

39
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,768
Half to your crew,
other half to the niggers

40
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,542
Only the niggers got busted, which leaves
my eses with all the firepower

41
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,213
Look, it's not your fault
our deal went sideways

42
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:40,588
Which is why we're willing to compensate you
for them rather than taking them from you

43
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,493
Trust me, doing business with us
is preferable to doing battle

44
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,533
Besides, we're still gonna need somebody to
mow our lawns once this race war's over with

45
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,242
- Gracias.
- De nada.

46
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,138
Whatever you shelled out
for those guns, I'll pay double

47
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,477
Look,
you got two choices

48
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,279
Either you put some money
in your pocket

49
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,877
or Elwood here dimes you
to the ATF

50
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,047
I got a brother-in-law
over there.

51
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,921
Ever have the feds crawl
up your ass before?

52
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,257
Half the money up front

53
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,592
Then gimme half
the guns up front

54
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,792
- Meet me in an hour
- I pick the place

55
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,131
And I want
all 36 weapons

56
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,205

57
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,478
- Get him. I'll clear the car.
- Let me see your hands.

58
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,449
Let me see your hands!

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,050

60
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,061
You hurt?

61
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,027
He's dead

62
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,533
One tango four. Code six.
1 949 Coronado.

63
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,766
Two victims down. Request three additional
units and a supervisor for a crime scene.

64
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,405
- You guys set?
- We're good to go.

65
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,378
We got a 4Runner.
Driver and a passenger.

66
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,006
Extra muscle in the back
Two They're strapped

67
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,244
How'd I know this guy
was gonna bone us?

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,981
I got the guy in the hat.

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,751
- All right. Fat Boy's mine.
- Any sign of the guns?

70
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,521
- Oh,yeah.
- Okay, well, hang tight. We're 1 0 minutes out.

71
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,121
Damn How many rounds went off here?

72
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,564
Multiple shooters?

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,933
- Who's that guy?
- Passenger in the backseat.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,941
- Bawling his eyes out when we got here
- Hey.

75
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,877
Found this in the alley
back there

76
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,780
Oh! You don't need more than
one shooter,you're packing that.

77
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,985

78
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,350

79
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,028
Tell the two assholes hiding
to drop their guns

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,499
and come out with their hands
where I can see 'em

81
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,435
You been watching me, homes?

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,804
Actually, we're gonna need the money
and the guns to help with our expansion.

83
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,674

84
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,451
- Don't do something goddamn stupid here

85
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,420
What's up,yo?
Get down, man.

86
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,357
- Tell them to let him go right now, asshole!

87
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,430
I've lived five years longer
than I ever thought I would

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,943
The vatos I came up with
in the game, they gone

89
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,241
Go ahead, shoot
Make me a hero

90
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,715
But Byz Lats are walking away
with that cash

91
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,811
Your guy so much as twitches, my guy's
gonna put one in the back of your skull

92
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,758
- Shoot the prick
- No! Don't!

93
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,126
Ronnie, put it down.

94
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,501
Him first

95
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,999
Ronnie, go on.

99
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,101
Mow your own lawns, putas.

100
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,674
Ripped by:

101
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,046
Hound

103
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,559
Rough night?

104
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,288
Hey, sometimes Mommy just won't nut
no matter how hard you hit it

105
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
Shut up

106
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,636
All right

107
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,672
Here's the plan

108
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,832
We're gonna set up Garza
in a drug sting

109
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,638
and use the takedown to leverage
these guns off the Byz Lats

110
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,111
- Who's Garza?
- Their soon-to-be ex-leader

111
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,580
I need you to get with your contacts.
I'll get with mine.

112
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,243
Let's find out who's dealing
quantity to this crew.

113
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:37,288
- I already know they're getting
their skunk outta Humboldt
- I want Garza on the hard stuff

114
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,290
Tougher prison sentences
on the asshole

115
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,020
You chase the rock
I'll find out where he's getting his ''H''

116
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,619
All right.

117
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,501
So what about
our goddamn money?

118
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,173
Our priorities are guns off the street and
Garza rotting in jail knowing we put him there.

119
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,105
Our priorities are guns off the street and
Garza rotting in jail knowing we put him there.

120
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,938
Oh, ''our priorities''?
I don't remember being consulted Do you?

121
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,808
Hey, man, look It's my fault
for letting a guy get behind me

122
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,108
- But you never should've
been in that situation.
- Shane's right

123
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,144
What happened last night was an error
in judgment on my part

124
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,189
We were out of position, outmanned
It won't happen again

125
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,918
And in the meantime,you guys will
never see that hundred grand again.

126
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,087
Yeah, that's on me too So stop whining and
take the money out of my goddamn share

127
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,097
- Deal
- No Look, man

128
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,963
It's the cost of doing business, all right?
We should all take the hit

129
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,197
Shane needs the dough.
He tell ya?

130
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,365
He bought the new squeeze
a sweet new ride

131
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,375
Against my orders

132
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,377
On this job, you're the boss

133
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,937
But when it comes to the money train deal,
we are partners.

134
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,609
- And I can live my life just fine
- Then go ahead and live it

135
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,619
Count your money
and wash your Lexus

136
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,212
We can get Garza
and the guns on our own

137
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,766
Morning news is the Byz Lats jacked
some white dudes tryin'to buy guns.

138
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,098
One bald head,
the other a dirty south crackerwood

139
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,832
Save it Three Byz Lats
went down wet

140
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,204
and one of'em's not getting up
on account of your guys

141
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,504
Look, man, I can't control
every dog in the pound

142
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,774
I mean, they see the Byz Lats strapped
with goddamn MP5's? I mean, shit--

143
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,816
Your hollow-points seem to be
getting the job done all right

144
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,649
That was a tooth for a tooth My boys
gonna do some desperate shit, they got to

145
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:20,089
- They talking about capping Byz Lats'
girlfriends and kids next
- You gotta stop them

146
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:24,288
- Man, I can steer the ship,
but I can't turn it around
- I'm gonna get the MP5's

147
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,888
And I'm gonna get this
Garza asshole good

148
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,230
Tick-tock, man I'm just here to let you know
it's about to jump off in a second

149
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,566
- That's real spit
- Yeah, well, I'm here to tell you

150
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,233
any more One-niner drive-bys,
I'm holding you personally responsible

151
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,047
- Mayor's office and tell them I need a meeting--
- Chief Bankston

152
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,049
I've had trouble
getting you on the phone.

153
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,450
That's because I've been
ducking your calls, Detective

154
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,513
Uh, am I wrong, or was I not
offered the captain's job?

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:57,119
That was when thejob was open.
Captain Aceveda has a plan
for cleaning up Farmington...

156
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,756
- and he wants to see it through personally
- Yes, I know all about his plans

157
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:05,633
Look, if the promotion in Farmington
doesn't happen, put me someplace else

158
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,672
Your value's
at the Barn

159
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,038
Besides, I don't have
any positions open anywhere else

160
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,873
- Be patient
- So you're telling me...

161
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,813
that a chief has been
outpoliticked by a captain?

162
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:26,250
When Aceveda takes office,
do I have your word I'd move up?

163
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,991
You have my support

164
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:36,901
But you might try playing
a little politics yourself with him

165
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,904
Let's go.

166
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,706

167
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,778
I thought
you were working.

168
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,745
I got into something with Vic

169
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,519
- You want me to make you a sandwich?
- No, I'm not hungry.

170
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,352
- What's the problem?
- Not important.

171
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,793
Well, it must be for you
to be all torqued up like this

172
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,532
It's about me

173
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:13,970
- Me and this goddamn car
Why does he even care?
- Look, it's not that

174
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,167
Look, we can return the car

175
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,938
I-I need it for work,
but we can figure something out

176
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,412
No.
We're keeping the car.

177
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,575
This thing between me and Vic--

178
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,051
it's complicated, you know?

179
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,679
Sometimes brothers fight.

180
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,425
So why is he always making you
the little brother?

181
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,794
That's not how it is

182
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,102
Dutch?

183
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,970
- Aceveda said you had some questions for me?
- Your missing guns

184
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,476
- They're MP5's, right?
- Yeah

185
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,376
- It was an MP5 used in our shooting.
- Who were the vics?

186
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,450
Two Latino bangers
They sound like One-niners?

187
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,349
No, we disarmed them
What's the neighborhood?

188
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,014
- Coronado
- Ah, that's Byz Lat territory

189
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,318
Don't worry
I'm on it

190
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,019
- Anything on Garza's cane slanger?
- Gotcha

191
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,655
Got a description of a cat
driving a blue 7 40 on Lexanis

192
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,699
Those rims alone--
two grand a pop

193
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,268
What'd the DMV kick out?

194
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,465
Got six of those registered
in Farmington Plate numbers

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,407
Lonzo Wang

196
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,571
My guy did say that the Byz Lats'
heroin supplier is a black Asian

197
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,650
- So their heroin dealer's also their crack dealer
- Makes it easy.

198
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,742
Get me an address

199
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,117

200
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,452
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah, fine

201
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,151
I just got my new work schedule,
and I thought we could go over it

202
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,455
- Oh Not now
- Okay You know what?

203
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,827
Take a look at it
Call me at home or the hospital then

204
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,594
- Which hospital?
- I'm back at Mission Cross

205
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,761
What, in the ER?

206
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,998
That's becoming a war zone
down there

207
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,165
We respond to brawls
twice a month

208
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,142
They have a high turnover rate That's
how Heather was able to pull some strings

209
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,236
get me my old
job back

210
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,406
You've got two
night shifts a week

211
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,416
You hiring
a nanny nights too?

212
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,850
- I thought you would take the kids
- I can't--

213
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,786
- I thought you wanted to
spend more time with them
- I do, but I--

214
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,792
I spent 1 1 years working
around your schedule, Vic

215
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,193
Divorce means occasionally
working around mine

216
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,028
- Hi, Corrine. Nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you too.

217
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,001
Um, I gotta go
Call if you have questions

218
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,072
Thanks for this
I'll work it out

219
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,334
Getting back together?

220
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,875
Not exactly

221
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,676
Look, I got a tip, could put the Byz Lats'
dope supplier out of business

222
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,647
- Yeah?
- I need a warrant

223
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,687
- How good's the probable cause?
- My CI's got a stellar track record

224
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,985
- I'll see what I can do
- Look, this is time-sensitive
How long for the paperwork?

225
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,991
Depends how solid
your paperwork is

226
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,493
We could use this to pry something loose
on Dutch-boy's shooting case

227
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,359
I got it, Vic

228
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,694
There's a system in place
Feed your warrant request through it

229
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,827
- Anything else?
- Not at the moment

230
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,231
Raymond Montes--
He was the passenger, right?

231
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,775
Arrested a month ago
for possession.

232
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,742
And this Calva guy--

233
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,680
Narcotics convictions, assault--
I can't even count the DUI's

234
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,877
You, on the other hand,
graduated cum laude

235
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,886
National Merit winner
Me too

236
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,081
Wasn't easy, was it?

237
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,784
So what were you doing
with these two losers?

238
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,191
Raymond wasn't a loser

239
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,231
He was my friend
Since high school

240
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,097
He found out these guys
were beating on me

241
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,864
- stealing my stuff--
- High school can be hell

242
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,872
Yeah

243
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:39,434
Raymond made sure everybody knew
that if anybody hurt me

244
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,445
they'd get it back worse

245
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,143
A guardian angel
with a rap sheet six pages long?

246
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,680
I don't know

247
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,847
He just did what he did

248
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,761
And now he's gone

249
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,164
Sorry about your boyfriend.

250
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,998
Raymond's friends say you're making
threats against a guy named Garza.

251
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,868
You think he shot
Raymond and Calva?

252
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,902
Come on Come on

253
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,113
What's the question?

254
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,741
Calva was a Torruco, right?

255
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,513
So what? Uh

256
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,646
Garza thought Raymond was a traitor
for hanging out with him?

257
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,157
You got the 41 1
Why you sweating me?

258
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,057
All we're trying to do is catch
the killer of your boyfriend

259
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,134
Garza marked Calva's ass for leaving
the Lats and joining the Torrucos.

260
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,535
What was Raymond doing
with Calva?

261
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,903
Warning him

262
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,772
Trying to get him
to come back to the crew

263
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,871
Garza saw that as talking
with the enemy, retaliated--

264
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,110
You better get that puta
before I do.

265
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,085
We'll certainly do our best.

266
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,783
- Where the hell's Tavon?
- He'll get here when he gets here

267
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,486
If we hadn't got him involved in this,
we'd just go in there and pop this asshole

268
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,791
- Use him to get our money back
- I'm trying to put this prick Garza away

269
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,629
Which means I need a legal, solid case
against this guy to get him to cooperate

270
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,635
Well, if Aceveda's got
so much juice

271
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,138
how come he can't cut through the bullshit,
get us a warrant while I'm still in my 30s?

272
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,970
- He's on the move.
- Goddamn it.

273
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,246
He's going back inside.

274
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,909
- Come on.
- Here's Tavon. Let's go.

275
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,316
- We got the warrant.
- About time

276
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,253
Don't blame me
Judge had a Pilates class

277
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,503
Don't move

278
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,140
Can I help you?

279
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,540
Not only can you,
you're going to

280
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,916
Have a seat

281
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,652
Clear!

282
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,923
Clear.

283
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,860
Whoo! Oh, check this out.

284
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,728
My God.

285
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,563
Hey, boss!

286
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,110
Ho!

287
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,178
I hope you got something
for a headache, 'cause I'm it

288
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,309
It's a regular Rite Aid in here, Lonzo.

289
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,980
My lawyer's gonna read
this warrant.

290
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,753
If there is even
an apostrophe missing-- Poof.

291
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,352
Why don't you roll the dice on a 20-year
stretch. See how good we spell-check.

292
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,830
Or you could your ass
on the phone with Garza

293
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,460
and tell him you got new shipments of''H''
and coke you're selling at deep discounts

294
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,868
Poof

295
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,173
Garza's late

296
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:03,078
Yeah, our, uh, boy here
says he's never on time.

297
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,379
How long you gonna keep
Shane on the bench for?

298
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,385
He'll come back
when he's ready

299
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,320
Tavon, tell your girlfriend
to stop looking so nervous.

300
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,294
Relax, man

301
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,664
Here we go
Game time

302
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,501
That's our bag
from last night with our money.

303
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,704
Shit That's not our guy
It's not our guy

304
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,679
It's Diagur,
one of his lieutenants

305
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,307
Well, how we gonna bust Garza
if he's not doing the deal?

306
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,943
Tavon, give him the drugs
Tell him you'll get the money from him later

307
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,681
- What?
- Just do it.

308
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,689
- What the hell are you do--
- We let this guy skate now

309
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,021
then we take him down for the money
later on without Tavon around

310
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,396
Tell him that you think your
place is under surveillance.

311
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,262
Hey

312
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,201
Mind holding onto that
for a little while longer?

313
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,865
- We got some heat on the crib
It'll be safer that way
- Right

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,309
Besides, it's not like
we don't trust you folks.

315
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,210
All right
Ain't no problem

316
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,283
Later, dog

317
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,620
Yo
What the hell was that?

318
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,853
You're letting him leave
with the drugs and the money?

319
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,863
Vic! Vic!

320
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,030
I told you going to the chief wouldn't help

321
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,173
Look, for the last 1 0 years,
Farmington has been the place...

322
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:41,338
people come to buy their drugs,
sex, fence their stolen goods--

323
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,279
- I want to clean it up
- Spare me I'm not one of your voters

324
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,351
You had two years
to clean it up

325
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,215
And I'm finally in
the position to do it

326
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,454
Anything else?

327
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,693
I'm gonna need someone overseeing
the practical elements of my plan

328
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,095
Your plan?

329
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,068
You would have command over the
Strike Team and the new Decoy Squad.

330
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,732
- Think of it as a promotion.
- I had a promotion

331
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,741
You took it away,
remember?

332
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,414
Hands on the wheel!
Hands on the wheel now!

333
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,488
Get 'em up there!

334
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,951
You again? Damn
What's your problem?

335
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,464
I'm on a little dope hunt Why don't you
pop the trunk, see if I bagged something

336
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,691
- Damn
- Where's Garza?

337
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,963
Garza, you're only 27

338
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,234
already CEO of one
of the biggest gangs in town

339
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,675
You've taught yourself what guys spend
years in business school trying to learn

340
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,679
Leading men
Maximizing profits

341
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,249
I decide to take the Lats
public, I'll let you know

342
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,117
Let's talk about, uh,
where you were last night

343
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,451
Midnight to 1 :00

344
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,049
Candi's Lounge
I got a VIP table

345
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,890
Well,you're
a very important person.

346
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,933
You like trim?
'Cause I could get you in

347
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,502
Is that all?

348
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,072
Man, 'cause I'm missing
an appointment.

349
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,038
Uh, relax

350
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,976
The wheels of industry can turn
without you for a couple of hours

351
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,080

352
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,752
You gonna take the fall
for your boss on these drugs?

353
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:36,726
'Cause that's exactly what's gonna happen
unless you tell me where these guns are.

354
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,423
Man, I don't know nothing
about no drugs or no guns

355
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,092
- Come on, man Where do we find Garza?
- No clue

356
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,692
Look, I got nothing
against you personally

357
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,204
But I had a really beautiful plan
to take down Garza

358
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,537
and you stumbled
right in my way

359
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,304
How come we're not conversating
in a real cop house?

360
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,143
I take you in,
you're in the system

361
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,376
I lose control
of the situation

362
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,544
What happens to you gets decided
by some guy in a suit

363
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,679
who doesn't understand
how valuable you can be

364
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,282
I'll never be valuable to you

365
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,452
Oh, sure, you are

366
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,429
You just need
some convincing

367
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,797
Esteban, we've got a suspect
in the shooting.

368
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,029
I need you to look
at this lineup

369
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,935
Take your time

370
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,539
I told you. I--
I didn't see anyone.

371
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,381
Sometimes you think
you didn't see anything

372
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,116
Then you see a face,
and it all comes back to you

373
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,091
No

374
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,028
This, uh, group of guys
in my middle school

375
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,258
hated my guts

376
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,463
Every day, they'd, uh, think up
something worse to do.

377
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,769
They'd spray-paint my locker, steal my
homework, charge me 1 0 bucks to get it back.

378
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,708
That was in the Midwest

379
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,405
I can only imagine
what things are like here

380
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,744
So I understand

381
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,875
You gotta be pretty scared

382
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,215
No one in this lineup
can see you, son

383
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,149
I know you want to do this

384
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,055
For Raymond

385
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,900
I didn't hear anything
I didn't see anything

386
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,530
Okay.
We'll get there.

387
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,108
- He saw Garza do the shooting
- Yep

388
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,373
Kids growing up
in this cesspool--

389
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,074
You finally meet one
that's on his way out

390
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,244
and he ends up in the back
of a banger's car covered in blood

391
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,087
You gotta ask yourself,
what's the point?

392
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,463

393
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,871
Aah!

394
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,773

395
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,246
- You okay?

396
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,548
- Let me see your hands!

397
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,589

398
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,454
Don't fight us!

399
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,688
Give me your hands
Give me your hands

400
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,295
Sorry
for the interruption

401
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,107

402
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,336
- What the hell's he doing here?
- He's Kern

403
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:46,110
We like him Kern?
Meet the new leader of the Byz Lats

404
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,211
- Whatcha talking about, man? Garza's mi jefe.
- Garza's out of a job

405
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,222
He just doesn't know it yet

406
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm grooming you
So you two are gonna draw some lines

407
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,659
and we're all gonna
leave here happy

408
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,628
You having
a chronic moment, homey?

409
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:04,190
- I ain't trucing with no spook
- I know Taco Boy didn't just call me spook

410
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,997
There's no need
to go racial here

411
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:10,803
No one wants to settle this thing in a
locked steel container with our bare hands

412
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,002
Right, Kern?

413
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,944
So you two start talking this out,
and I'll check on you in a couple hours

414
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,379
Lem, you stay here

415
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,663
- Glad you're back
- You're the boss.

416
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,461
But my personal life
stays personal

417
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,536

418
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,440
You wanna tell me what
that little dance was about?

419
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,983
The dealer we were supposed
to take down waltzes

420
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,484
with the drugs, money,
and a stroll?

421
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,487
He's agreed
to cooperate

422
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,990
Now we're gonna set up Garza
and get those guns back

423
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,652
I had to snag a goddamn
ride here with our snitch

424
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,254
Lucky for you he drives
a Beemer with $2,000 rims

425
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,358
- Mm-hmm

426
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,733
What are you doing?

427
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,239
Figuring out how much I've got
in savings and partial pension

428
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,333
See if you can
afford to quit.

429
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,242
- You're too young to quit
- And I'm too old for this

430
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,976
Aceveda's just trying to
shore up his cop credentials

431
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,019
Another couple of months, the numbers
will turn around, the job'll be yours

432
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,588
- I wish I had your faith
- Hey

433
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,591
You're the best cop
I've ever worked with

434
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,127
Well, thank you

435
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,391
Nobody else ever came close
to keeping up with me Hold that thought

436
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,296
- Do I have to?
- Question, Vic.

437
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,301
Make it snappy, Dutch-boy.
I'm drowning in something.

438
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,463
Suspect in our shooting
heads up the Byz Lats Name's Garza

439
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,473
Wondered if you guys have
a profile on him.

440
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,476
Garza? That's the asshole
who's got our guns

441
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,479
- We've been looking for him all day
- I-I just cut him loose

442
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,846
- He was here?
- Kid wouldn't ID him, but I know he did it

443
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,045
I just need to prove his alibi's bullshit
Says he was at Candi's Lounge

444
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,782
Yeah. Yeah, I may have
heard of that place.

445
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,859
- Itjust happens to be on your way home?
- Hey, we're all about the job

446
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,452
Dutch, Crime Reconstruction
called. They're ready for us.

447
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,464
Thanks

448
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,466
Garza goes down
for a murder charge

449
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,230
we won't have to prop up
a shaky drug bust with our own cash

450
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,601
Which means it goes right back
into its hidey-hole, no questions asked

451
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,402
Let's go knock down this
asshole's alibi

452
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,309
Ah You seeing what I'm seeing?

453
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,317
Literally rained bullets

454
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,910
And not just
into the front seat

455
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,457
Okay, let's lose
the art project.

456
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,551
Are you kidding? Do you know
how many hours I've been at this?

457
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,824
Take your pictures
Then tear it down

458
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,161
First crime scene, son?

459
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,139
Hey

460
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,266
Garza's alibi checks out

461
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,573
He was at that club doing body shots
off some stripper named Poundcake

462
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,216
- Titties for everybody
- I didn't need to hear that

463
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,274
- Titties for everybody
- I didn't need to hear that

464
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,886
Hey Vic, that warrant check out--
the Byz Lat supplier?

465
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,046
Hey Vic, that warrant check out--
the Byz Lat supplier?

466
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,645
Not a goddamn thing

467
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,884
- I thought your intel was solid
- The dealer's house was clear

468
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:19,396
I had to pullJudge Davies out of Pilates class
to expedite that warrant

469
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,261
We're trying to connect Garza to the
shootings, but he's not the triggerman

470
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,302
We know He is

471
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:37,241
Sorry about this I gotta do this, uh,
witness statement thing

472
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,248
It's procedure

473
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,614
No problem

474
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,512
I talked to administration
at UC-Santa Barbara

475
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,716
They said you didn't
re-enroll for next semester

476
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,523
Moved back to LA?
Hang out?

477
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,824
I guess

478
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,264
- What are you planning on doing?
- How's it going?

479
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:00,463
Still at the friendly-chat stage,
which for Dutch might go on all day

480
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,507
- You applied anywhere?
- No, not yet.

481
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,270
Look, is this gonna take
much longer?

482
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,777
I'm sorry Um, you know,
get up, walk around

483
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,371
I know this room can feel
a little claustrophobic

484
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,715
Come on. Would you just scare the crap
out of this little shit already?

485
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,755
Think you can scare him
as much as Garza does?

486
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,020
- Actually, yeah
- Let Dutch do his thing

487
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,062
Okay, uh, I-I know
you didn't see anything

488
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,256
the night that Raymond
and Calva were killed

489
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,630
Are you sure
you didn't hear anything?

490
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,226
No I told you

491
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,034
- The music was bumping too loud
I couldn't hear anything
- Right, right, right

492
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:40,134
- So how'd you hear the shots?
- What?

493
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,375
You must've heard the first couple of shots
and hit the floor pretty damn fast, right?

494
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,315
Otherwise, we're not having
this conversation

495
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,852
Okay
Here we go

496
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:54,015
You look at the crime scene reconstruction,
it's amazing the bullets missed you

497
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,923
I mean, I know
you're skinny, but, uh--

498
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,564
Why am I even
in this room?

499
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,434
You know why
you're in this room

500
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,506
- You think I had something to do with it?
- You did

501
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,973
- Why would I kill my best friend?
- My partner and I did a test

502
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,943
From where the shooter was standing,
you can't see the passenger seat

503
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,140
- You only meant to kill Calva
- I didn't even know Calva

504
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,343
You wanted to come back to LA,
hang with Raymond, make a little money

505
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,647
Best way to do that
was to join the Byz Lats

506
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,246
No Raymond wouldn't even
let me join

507
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,257
Which is why you went
behind his back

508
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,725
Asked Garza to jump you in
Taking out Calva was your initiation

509
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,764
- No
- You did the shooting

510
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,799
then you went down to the car,
and you saw Raymond

511
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,562
You know why
he was there, by the way?

512
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,968
He wanted to give Calva
one last chance to come back

513
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,972
because he didn't want
to see any bloodshed.

514
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,067
You were right about Raymond For a banger,
he turned out to be a pretty good guy

515
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,976

516
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,242
I didn't mean to do it.

517
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,148

518
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,147
- Who gave you the gun, Esteban?
- It was an accident, man

519
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,657
The gun that killed
your best friend?

520
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,750
Garza did

521
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,827
Ohh!

522
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,361
Can you help me?
Please?

523
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,995
Not anymore.

524
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,679
It's still Esteban's word
against Garza's.

525
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,912
To convict, we're gonna need
corroboration.

526
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,252
Well, I'm Mr Corroboration

527
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,421
Don't ask

528
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,591
So? How goes
the peace process?

529
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,032
Middle East'll be a love-in
before these idiots sort their shit out

530
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,866
- What's the roadblock?
- This fool ain't offering me dick, man

531
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,099
And he ain't got
nothing to deal

532
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,608
We're the ones strapped.

533
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,974
- See what I mean?
- Shit, man.

534
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,307
Hey!

535
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,746
I'm gettin' the feeling you're not appreciating
the battlefield promotion I gave you

536
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,482
It doesn't matter to what I agree out there
Garza's the one to call the shots

537
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,617
Garza's going to jail
He's got his own guys killing each other

538
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,958
You ain't got nothing on him
He already punked you once

539
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,500
How smart was it sending
a 1 9-year-old bookworm to do the hit?

540
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,501
The college boy gave him up

541
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,696
You can't tell me
Garza's a businessman

542
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,070
I got his money, his drugs,
and his top lieutenant

543
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,939
You tell me one thing
your boss hasn't screwed up

544
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:31,072
Your choices are climbing up the ladder
or going down the drain

545
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,919
- If the vatos know I spun him out--
- Who's gonna know?

546
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,853
This is between you and me

547
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,118
I just need proof he ordered
the hit on this Calva guy

548
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,661
and the throne and the crown
are all yours

549
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,525
Look, all I know is

550
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,231
he gave Esteban a gun,
the address

551
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,399
and he printed out a map
how to get there

552
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,601
That's all I know

553
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,475
Good
Let's finish this thing

554
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,344
- Knock it off Now!

555
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,682
Sir. Sir.

556
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,654
- My appeal was at 1 1:;00 this morning.
- Give us a minute, please

557
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,657
- Where were you?
- It's been hectic here

558
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,954
You promised that you
would be there for me

559
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,428
Look, the vote's gonna be
two to one in your favor

560
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,762
I put in a call this morning
It's a done deal

561
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,861
- I got my job back?
- You'll get official word tomorrow

562
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,737
- Thanks
- You got it

563
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,335
- But I am really busy here, okay?
- Okay Sorry

564
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,414
Thanks

565
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,516
- He scared the holy hell out of them
- What was I supposed to do?

566
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,112
Hey, man, you're in church on a Monday afternoon,
your life could use a little excitement

567
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,091
Guess what?
They're bringing me back

568
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,253
- Really? Congratulations
- Thanks

569
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,695
- That's great
- They upheld your appeal? Wow.

570
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,892
What desk you have to bend over
to make that happen?

571
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:01,199
- Sure as hell wasn't yours
- A guy can dream, can't he?

572
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,172
How's he working out?

573
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,436
- He's doing good
- Made a few arrests

574
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,979
Well, I just thought
I'd give you the good news

575
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,049
- I'll talk to you later
- All right.

576
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,347
You better make sure
your people deliver on this truce

577
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,358
- And if I don't?
- Hey

578
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,520
You owe me I'm the one keeping
the One-niners from being wiped out

579
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,963
We'll see I mean, you got Garza,
but you still ain't got the guns

580
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,433
No
But I'm smelling 'em

581
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,980
Baseball cap's our signal
Garza's inside.

582
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,581
- Gave up his buddy, huh?
- What separates them from us?

583
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,025
Loyalty, that most
disposable of virtues

584
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,374
One, two, three

585
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,669
- Where's Garza?
- I got him I got him Don't move

586
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,481

587
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,517

588
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,523
- Hey!
- Goin'out the back.

589
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,718
- They're runnin' Let's go

590
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,763

591
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,562
You have about two seconds
to tell me where the guns are

592
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,195
- Suck me hard, bitch
- We got him

593
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,673
Hey.

594
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,212
- Managed to stop him before he got away
- Don't move, buddy.

595
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,305
Hey, homes! Hey!

596
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
Hey, Captain
What's up?

597
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,552
The pastor from the church
lodged a complaint against you

598
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,592
- Oh,Jesus
- What's he saying?

599
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,662
- Excessive force.
- That's crap

600
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,663
The guy was tweaking
He wouldn't go down

601
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,665
It took four of us just
to get him in the cage

602
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,758
Tommy, give us
a minute, please

603
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,064
- Come on, Captain
- Tommy, please

604
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,211
Fortunately, the pastor's a friend,
so I think the complaint will go away

605
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,978
I just want to make sure
you're all right

606
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,076
Sir?

607
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,816
How would you characterize
the incident?

608
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,786
The amount of force
was necessary to effect the arrest

609
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:44,959
- And everything's okay with you?
- Yes, sir Everything's great

610
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,437
Even if we don't get him
on the homicide

611
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,913
this should put him away
for a couple of decades

612
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,746
Call me greedy--
I still want him for the murder-for-hire

613
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,752
- Me too
- Hey, Dutch-boy

614
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,754
Might wanna grab
this prick's computer

615
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,586
- See if there's anything in there
that ties him to Esteban.
- Right.

616
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,184
Uh, bag the laptop
separately.

617
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,289
Where's my phone call?

618
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,732
We got your laptop

619
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,066
Downloaded records
of your recent online activity.

620
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,935
The porn sites
were illuminating

621
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,941
I especially liked
the map you printed out for Esteban--

622
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,034
directions from his house
to Calva's.

623
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,171
I talked to the D.A.
You turn in the remaining 35 MP5's...

624
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:35,616
she's willing to take
the death penalty off the table.

625
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,383
Put the needle right here. Now, show me
where the goddamn phone is.

626
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,487

627
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,358
We're gonna get you
a good lawyer, all right?

628
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,228
The guns!

629
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,359
Look, man, word's out
you got popped

630
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,995
Torrucos and One-niners
are coming at us hard

631
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,003
Tell me where those cohetes are at
So we can protect what's ours

632
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,041
Huh? All right

633
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,952
Get a truck Pick up the guns
Wait for my call

634
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,990
Oh, and put a few aside
for emergencies

635
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,457
How we gonna explain to Aceveda
how we got all this artillery?

636
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,653
We can't, so we won't

637
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,698
Put this with the rest
of the money train stash

638
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,199
It's 20 grand light

639
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,236
Byz Lats overhead, I guess

640
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,464
It's better than losing
the whole hundred

641
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,563
The way I figure it

642
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,200
I guess everything
worked out okay, huh?

643
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,871
Got lucky

644
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,973
- So we cool?
- Course

645
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,287
You got the Decoy Squad
for sure?

646
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,859
They start next week
Supposed to be great

647
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,758
How'd you get Griggs
to give them up?

648
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,593
Well, he hasn't yet But he's gonna
call Councilman Docknovitch

649
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,668
to get me to back off

650
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,602
Not knowing that Docknovitch is gonna need
my support next year on his zoning application

651
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:06,006
Which you'll be only
too happy to give

652
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,011
I think we need a series
of high-profile busts

653
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,742
using the Decoy Squad
to flush them out

654
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,580
and the Strike Team
to step on them.

655
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,712
In a very public way,
you change perception, you change reality

656
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,223
Does this mean
I can welcome you aboard?

657
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,158
Anything I can do to help

658
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,729
Shall I give Vic the good news,
or do you want to?

659
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,734
- Shane's not home
- I know.

660
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:44,008
I wanted to apologize for
barging in on you last night

661
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:48,575
- No big deal
- Look, seems like you and I got
off on the wrong foot here

662
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,144
- We should really get to know each other.
- Why's that?

663
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,816
Well, you're becoming
a big part of Shane's life

664
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,553
which makes you
a member of the family.

665
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,188
Never really been big on family
Or cops, really

666
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,528
Shane's the exception

667
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:08,367
Look, I'm just trying
to find a way for us to get along

668
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,532
And I've seen that same smile
on about two dozen guys

669
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,736
who thought a wink
and a three-dollar gin and tonic

670
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,109
was all that it would take
to get me to bed with them

671
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,774

672
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,784
I do something
to piss you off?

673
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,946
I don't like the way you treat Shane
But that's his problem

674
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,752
You don't understand the world
that Shane and I live in

675
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,919
Shane works for you,
but he comes home to me

676
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,429
- You've known him for two months
- I know enough

677
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,693
I'm not exactly sure
what your problem is

678
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,531
Maybe it's 'cause you couldn't hold onto
your own family that you're scared

679
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,605
- Shane's all you got left.
- Excuse me?

680
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:46,768
Whatever the reason, I got enough bullshit
seeping into my life without inviting yours in.

681
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,903
So please, don't pop in
if Shane's not here.

682
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,643
What?

683
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,882
I called Treasury to see if any of these
marked bills have shown up yet

684
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,015
- And?
- No Whoever's got 'em

685
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,492
is either sitting on 'em or spending 'em
someplace where they can't be traced

686
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,929
I wouldn't sweat it No one steals
money to sit on it their whole lives

687
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,803
I'm sorry about that

688
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,171
- Why?
- I know you had a connection

689
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,109
Just when I thought
he was a victim

690
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,205
The minute I found out he was
the shooter--just another loser.

691
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,049
So, uh, you sticking around?

692
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,588
Can't retire on cat food

693
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,955
Yeah
You'll never leave me

694
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,193
Hey.

695
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,831
- Need some help?
- No, I got it.

696
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,172
You know, I was thinking, if we both
talk to Aceveda about teaming up

697
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,076
he might put us
back together

698
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,046
What?

699
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,414
You were my training officer,
but I'm not a rookie anymore

700
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,488
Actually, I've been
bumped back to P2.

701
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,786
So officially we're equals
That's how it'd be

702
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,387
Maybe But

703
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,864
I like the way
things are for now.

704
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,401
Okay

705
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,563
Glad things are
working out for you

706
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,107

707
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,669
I need to meet with you and your guys
in the briefing room next Tuesday, 3:;00.

708
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,112
Sure
What's up?

709
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,277
David's bringing in the Decoy Squad from
Wilshire. They're gonna be working with you.

710
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,483
Oh Uh, great

711
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,685
I'm gonna be in charge
of both teams

712
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,126
I'll fill you in
on the details on Tuesday

713
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,323
3:00

714
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,928
- I just spoke to Claudette
- Good

715
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,064
Sounds like
an interesting experiment

716
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,039
It's more than
an experiment, Vic

717
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,111
It's your assignment
for the foreseeable future

718
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,111
Yeah, I thought Claudette
was taking your job

719
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,613
Well, you'll just have to stomach me
for a little bit longer

720
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,516
How much longer?
Just so I can warn my stomach

721
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,986
Maybe working under Claudette
will actually produce results.

722
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,284
I've been
producing results

723
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,291
Not today

724
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,293
You had a drug warrant
blow up in your face

725
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,454
Dutch and Claudette
beat you to a gang bust

726
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:24,364
and those 35 army rifles you've been so
hell-bent to get are still on the streets.

727
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,335
Doesn't seem like
your finest hour

728
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,338
I guess not

729
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,310

730
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,975

731
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,703
All right
Let me throw one in

732
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,043
Bon voyage
