00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:14,824
- [Mackey] The Russians are on the move.
- [Man Speaking Russian]

00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:19,996
The tall blond guy's Tretiak.

5
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,573
R.O.C. captain.

6
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:27,737
He's the asshole that Carl and Scooby
slapped with that reckless driving ticket.

Who's the girl?

- [Mackey] Oh, shit.

00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:42,516
- Oh, this guy.
- Hey.

11
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,187
We got a job to do here, okay?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,764
Yeah, smackin'a hooker around
is not gonna give us any leverage...

13
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,430
to twist this guy.

14
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:59,943
Why don't we turn over his office,
find something real to pin on him?

15
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,479
Yeah, I got it.

16
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,285
Looks like invoices for
the restaurant over here.

17
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:11,879
Go through 'em all. Show me
anything that doesn't look aboveboard.

18

We gotta find something
to hold over this guy's head.

- Check this out, man.

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,338
Looks like a lot
of their shipments...

at the Alameda rail yard.

24
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:34,876
According to this,
he has beef shipped there twice a month.

25
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,006
- So it's a steak and blow job joint.
- A warehouse is for dry goods.

26
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:42,109
Well, what kind of steak
doesn't need refrigeration?

27
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,654
I usually just order the blow job.

28
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,858
Can we talk someplace?

29
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,431
I'm good here.

30
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:01,060
The chief s made the decision
to shelf the asset forfeiture policy.

31
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:04,540
I'm sorry.
It wasn't an easy decision.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,483
You were the eyes and ears
of the chief on this project.

33
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:17,248
Who's really the one
with his finger on the kill switch?

34
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:22,315
We have two dead cops, allegations
of corruption and a community on fire.

35
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:25,089
We said from the start
it would be a trial.

36
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:27,791
Cops in other divisions
are expressing concerns-

37
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:31,130
They haven't seen firsthand
how this is working.

38
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:33,568
Look, l-

39
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,575
I called you out in front of Aceveda,
said some things I shouldn't have.

40
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,577
I apologize.

41
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,274
We know how invested
you are in this policy.

42
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:46,907
That's why we want you to draft
the department's statement...

43
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,680
explaining why
we're suspending it.

44
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,053
Sell it to the press
however you deem appropriate.

45
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,596
Well, Phillips is hoping
I'll just quit.

46

He wants you to take
one for the blue.

When are they gonna
take one for me?

49
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,206
The seizures
are making a difference.

50
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:13,175
You keep trying to make that case,
but the crime stats say otherwise.

51
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,473
Those stats
are three months behind.

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,310
I see a difference
in our caseloads every day.

53
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,852
Less violent crime,
less gang activity.

54
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:25,946
- Those numbers catch up,
they'll show that I'm right.
- Not if they shut you down now.

55
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,390
Well, it's not a done deal
until Pol Com signs off on it.

56
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:33,328
They're assuming your committee
will just rubber-stamp it.

57

you've got invested in the Barn.

60

/ also know how you'd like
the city council...

61
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,806
to have more influence
on how the department operates.

62
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,680
Us working together
is the last thing...

63
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:56,117
that downtown will suspect.

64
00:04:56,221 --> 00:05:00,624
I mean, Mitchell's in jail. We ride out
this rough spot. We keep the seizures going.

65
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,556
Crime goes down.

66
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:05,562

It's a win-win.

67
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:08,064
Farmington becomes a model
for other districts...

68

your mayoral hat on a big success.

69

And where do we stand
with the murders of Scooby and Carl?

70
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,943
Have you been able to prove
that they're not seizure-related?

71
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,946
- Not yet.
- Well, that would be helpful.

72

is our main priority.

in the Commie lunch box?

- [Mackey] Coke and a sandwich?
- Yeah, or China white.

anything you say might get you shot.

I started paying Tretiak back
in supplies- lumber, cement-

93
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,505
- Explosives.
- The Russians asked me to get C-4.

94
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:58,440
I told 'em it was too risky. The government
keeps pretty close tabs on that shit.

- The shipment comes in today.
- What are they usin' it for?

98
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,546
I don't know. They're shipping
a ton of it back to Kamchatka.

99

Oh, shit. Every one
of those countries is so worried...

100

watching what's getting shipped out.

101

it to any major terrorist organization.

recommend to the police commission...

111
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,926
We need to prove that these cop killings
aren't seizure-related.

112
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,361
That gives us a lifeline.

113

was involved in killing Carl and Scooby.

C-4's pretty harmless without a cap,
but I wouldn't wanna risk any gunplay.

118

Let them lock up the container. Have the
sharpshooters take point on the bridge.

- He's back at the restaurant.

They'll never lay off.

166
00:10:57,515 --> 00:11:00,245
Two cops are dead.
You'd think harassing me...

167
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,081
about dating Vic's wife
wouldn't be a priority.

168
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:07,248
You're the distraction keeping them from
thinking about dead cops. Forget about it.

169
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,485
[Dutch] You were tired
of the life- constant beatings...

170
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,494
embarrassment, ridicule.

171
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,032
He got out of Chino,
came home.

172
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,033
Just couldn't take it anymore.

173
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,933
[Claudette]
Sold your car last week for $8,700.

174
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:24,873
Maybe you hired someone
to stop Gill from hurting you?

175
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,511
The cash was for a fake I.D.

176
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,378
Forged reference letters.

177
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,714
He knew no school
was gonna hire him with his record.

178
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,516
Is that why he was in that part of town?
Getting a fake I.D.?

179
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,286
- Could've been.
- You didn't go with him?

180
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:47,092
No. I was at
my 6:30 A.A. meeting.

181
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:51,362
[Claudette] /s there anyone else
who knew he had the money-

182
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,562
that he was getting a fake I.D.?

183
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,005
What, dear?

184
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,443
I've been sharin' about it
in my morning meeting.

185
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:08,144
One of the newcomers,
guy in a wheelchair- Bumper-

186
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:10,277
he caught me in the parking lot
after a meeting.

187
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:13,619
Told me he-
he knew someone...

188
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:17,058
could help get Gill the /.D. 's.

189

- [Muffled Grunting]
- Relax.

190
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,761
Make that look real.
These guys know how that shit works.

191
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,999
Don't worry, Olga. We'rejust
gonna scare the borscht out of your buddy.

192
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,007
Get him a little chatty.

193
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:35,239
What's the Russian for "all wired up"?
Let's go.

194
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:48,157
You tell him he's got 30 seconds
to tell us why they hired the Nigerians...

195
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,284
and who else was involved
in killing our cops...

196
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,023
or we blow his boss
to red heaven, and then him.

199
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tell him to relax
or he's gonna flip that goddamn chair.

201
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,302

- Jesus Christ!

203
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,718
Shut up! Shut up!

204
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:21,890
- Holy shit!
- [Curtis] That was loud, brother.

205
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:25,019
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- Holy shit.

206
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,029
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

207
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,190
Get our shit. Grab the Russians.
Let's get out of here.

208
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,632
Go.

209
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,897
Move.

210
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:36,974
- Go, go, go.
- Come on! Let's go!

[Man Speaking Russian]

212
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:45,272
That's far enough!

213
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:50,650
He says he doesn't know why. Tretiak just
told him to hire Nigerians to kill police.

214
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:54,657
The black cop gave Tretiak a ticket.
Is that why he killed him and his partner?

215
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,727
[Russian]

216
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,661
He doesn't think so.
Says he was crazy, not stupid.

217
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:08,205
Oh, shit! Apparently, the only person
who knew anything just blew himself up.

218

220
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:20,108
He says there was a young black
with the Nigerians driving.

221
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:23,210
- A third black guy? Three?
- [Man Speaking Russian]

222
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,853
He says he saw him once before.
He brought language tapes to Tretiak.

223
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,591
- Get her keys to the restaurant.
Go get those tapes.
- Yeah.

224
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,530
You know someplace safe
you can go?

225

Nina, we're gonna grab some coffee
at Ivid's. Be back in a few.

226
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:43,440
- This subpoena was just delivered.
- All right.

227

What is it?

228
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:52,780
Uh, it's nothing.
Judge wants me to sign some affidavits.

229
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:54,784
I always get these.

230

- Thought you were up in Terminal Island.
- I'm in County this week.

Waiting for the judge
to consider my appeal.

235

- Appeal? On what grounds?
- [Scoffs] Innocence.

236
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,869
I didn't rob that market.

237
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:25,381
Three witnesses,
including myself, saw you.

238
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:28,350
Well, Ricky,
he went in for food.

I hear gunshots.

Ran in to see what happened.
You pointed a finger at me.

241
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:36,121
So your lawyer will actually think that
a judge will buy that bullshit story?

242
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,127
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

243
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,288
They're gonna drop the charges
when you take the stand...

244
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,060
and admit that
you forced my confession.

245
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,429
Otherwise, /'m just gonna
tell the whole courtroom...

246
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,974

247

- [Chuckling] I ain't got nothin' to lose.
- No one's gonna believe you.

the picture to prove it.

Shut up.

that / can screw you...

if you open your mouth?

254

My grandma-
she died last month.

255
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,762
Had that throat cancer.

256
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:26,900
My mom, she got tired of wipin'
rich kids' ass and moved back to Mexico.

257
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:30,403
You don't have a picture...

258
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,982
and neither
does your girlfriend.

00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:37,384
Believe what you want.
Believe what you want.

260
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:42,585
But you will get on that stand
and say you violated my rights.

261
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,355
Or you will pull some strings
and get me out of here...

00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:53,030

- We found Tretiak.
- Damn!

Must've mishandled
his merchandise.

267
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:10,119
Our best lead to these cop killers
just got blown to hell.

268
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:14,021
Well, if he was involved,
it smells like justice to me.

269
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,526
We'll go through the restaurant,
see if it gives us anything.

270
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:26,100
We traced some of these
books on tape in Tretiak's office...

271
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:29,195
to the U.C. Northridge
language library.

Dutch found a J.P. necklace in the sewer
next to Carl and Scooby's bodies.

Come on in.
Look around if you like.

282
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,931
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

283
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,032
He's an adult. Uh, road trips
to Northern California all the time.

284
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,442
Uh, college buddies.
Why are you lookin'for him?

285
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,414
He may know a couple of Nigerians
involved in a shooting.

286
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:16,043
- We need to talk to him.
- No, it doesn't sound likeJason's friends.

287
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:19,316
Oh, shit.
Hey, check this out.

00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,691
That's Jason.

This guy always show up

290
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:31,662
Antwon Mitchell,
Jason's half brother.

291
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,397
You're not Antwon's
biological father?

292
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:37,303
No, Jason and Antwon
share the same mother.

293
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,469
Antwon and I
are no relation.

294
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,709
You were a correctional officer
at Chowchilla, weren't you?

295
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:49,582
- Yeah.
- Knocked up Antwon's incarcerated mother.

296
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:51,587
Cost you your job.

297
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:55,989
Got into security work
and raised Jason on my own.

298
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,084
If you know where your son is,
you need to tell us.

299
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:05,160
Places he goes, his friends.

300
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,104
Guess I didn't ask enough questions about
where he goes and who he hangs out with.

301
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,368
I'm sorry about that.

He's been clean ever since.

306
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,724

are scooping him up now.

307
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,328
[Laughter]

308
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:39,392
Well, if the pad fits-

309
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:43,132
I packed the napkins,
forgot the sandwich.

310
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,211
Hey, uh- Hey, hey.
You find out who's pulling this shit?

311
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,512
- No, not yet.
- Did you ask around, or-

312
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,883
Look, I've been workin' an assault
that's got me spinnin'.

313
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,253
But I'm onto it.
I promise, okay?

314
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,849
You think this kid's capable
of murdering two cops?

315
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,658
Antwon's blood?
It wouldn't surprise me.

316
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,928
He could be hiding anywhere.
How do we find him?

317
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,333
/ got a C./.
who works a pawnshop.

318
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,632
He put the word out on the street
that P.D. never found the necklace-

319
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,832
that it's just
sitting there at his shop.

320
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,842
That's an expensive
piece of ice.

321
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:23,607
Mm-hmm. I'm hopin' that greed wins out
over smarts, and he comes to claim it.

322
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:26,376
Listen, man,
/'m the B.N.O.C., brother, okay?

323
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:28,452
I spread the word
from Crenshaw to Northridge.

324
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,679
If he's in town,
he got the memo.

325
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,349
The video recorders are all on. Just step
on this power strip, they'll all kick in.

326
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,518
You can'tjust sell him the necklace.
You gotta make him prove that it's his.

327
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm well versed in
the conversational arts.

328
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:42,532
Good.
Here's for your education.

329
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:46,125
- There's another hundred
if you don't screw it up.
- Come on, buddy.

330
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,940
/ call the police, / don't know exactly,
six or seven times a month.

331
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,941
I've stopped keeping track.

332
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,911
Harassment can be hard to prove.
It's random, unpredictable.

333
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:00,415
It's as if they think it's my fault,
or it's all in my head.

334
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:04,386
The phone calls, the rotten eggs
on my car, the bleach on my lawn.

335
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,048
Tell me about
the, uh, call today.

336
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,284
/t was from a man
who has called before who says...

337
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,658
I deserve to suffer
the way Will's victims suffered.

338
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,095
Said he was gonna rape you?
Kill you? He used those words?

339
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:18,327
He said he watched me come home.
He knew what / was wearing.

340
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,268
The police are not
gonna protect me.

341
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,863
I thought you could
help me get a carry permit.

342
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:26,943
For a gun?
Do you have one?

343
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,944
What choice did / have?

344
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:34,982
Listen, most of the time,
threats arejust threats.

345
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,714
Somebody trying to feel powerful
by making you afraid.

346
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:41,552
Well, it's working.

347
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:46,062
Hey, guys, we haveJoanna Faulks's
phone records from the last month.

348
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:49,098
- /t's a pretty short list.
- Thanks.

349
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,099
She received, like,
15 calls?

350
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:53,192
And 11 were from telemarketers.

351
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:55,204
So much for the
"friends and family" plan.

352
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:59,003
Aside from the 911, the numbers she dialed
mostly were pizza and Chinese places.

353
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:04,445
Shit. She left me a message
a couple months ago.

354
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:07,073
It's been a pretty rough time
around here for all of us.

355
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:11,280
Yeah. Check the names
of the callers...

356
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:13,288
against a list
of the cuddler's victims.

357
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,017
- See if there's a connection.
- Okay.

358
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,595
- That's him, buddy.
- [Line Ringing]

359
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:20,493
Horus' Trade.

360
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:23,726
- Yo, that's him.
- Come on, man. Let me check it out.

361
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:26,302
Yeah. Okay.
Will do. Bye.

362
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:29,861
What's goin' on, brother?
How you livin'?

363
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,874
Heard you got your hand
on a necklace.

364
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,876
- Initials "J.P."?
- Uh, yeah.

365
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,708
No, you know,
l-I keep it locked up, you know?

366
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:42,047
It's a real fine dog tag here, man.

367
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,086
Ah! Check it out.

368
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,284
- How much?
- Hmm.

369
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,987
You know what? I'm in a charitable mood
today, so I tell you what.

370
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:55,361
/'ll give it to you on the cheap.
Fifteen grand.

371
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:59,129
- You smokin' crack, brother?
- Nigger, that is platinum, okay,
with half carats all around.

372
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,568
The necklace is worth 10 G's.

373
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,903
So what, you the-
you the bling king now?

374
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,977
I know how much it's worth,
'cause I'm J.P.

375
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:09,807
It's mine.
My brother gave it to me.

376
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:13,781
Listen, a homeless dude came in here.
He told me that he found it in the gutter.

377
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:17,320
That's where I lost it.

378
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:21,755
- My brother's Antwon Mitchell.
You want that kind of trouble?
- Go, go, go!

379
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,123
No, I don't.

380
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,493
- Heads up!
- Listen, I have heard of Antwon, okay?

381
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:30,066
- All I'm saying is-
- Freeze. Police.

382
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:34,536
[Voices Overlapping]

383
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,367
Shut up.
Shut up.

384
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:38,498
/ have a receipt
for everything.

385
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,407
What happened?

386
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:44,037
She came home, found the back door
unlocked. Reported a break-in.

387
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,582
You know where you leave things.
Someone was in here.

388
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:50,017
Maybe it's possible that you left
the back door unlocked yourself.

389
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,556
Why, with everything that's happening to me,
would I leave the door unlocked?

390
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:56,387
- You can go, Officers. Thank you.
- Sure thing, Detective.

391
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,427
The carry permit-
I'd still like to get that.

392
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,833
Honestly, I don't, uh-
I don't think it's a good idea.

393
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,368
Uh, listen, I owe you an apology.
You left a message.

394
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:17,573
- I meant to call you back.
- When Will was arrested, I was angry...

395
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,581
at him and you.

396
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:23,714
And nothing made sense.

397
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,449
I called because
I thought perhaps...

398
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:28,718
I could cook you dinner.

399
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:31,624
My way of apologizing.

400
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:36,564
Oh. Uh, that's, uh-
that's not necessary.

401
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,867
But, um-
But thanks.

402
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:44,099
Listen, / have-
/ really have to get back.

403
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,735
I have a murder case.
I'll keep the unis comin' by, checkin' on you.

404
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:50,814
You're gonna be fine.

405
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,352
Remember me, Mr. Mayor?
Juan's girlfriend.

406
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,255
The one you kidnapped.

407
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,262
Juan says you think we're bluffing-
that we don't have the picture.

408
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,265
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.

409
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:13,097
You can't put your hands-
[Groaning]

410
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,001
What's this?

411
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:21,441
[Aceveda On Tape]
I don't know who you are.

412
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:24,742
If you really had a picture, you wouldn't
need me on this admitting one exists.

413
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:28,147
You'll see it when
Juan shows it in the court.

414
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,948
Or maybe we can
mail it to the Times.

415
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:34,990
Look. I might be able
to do something...

416
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:36,992
but it takes time.

417
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:39,494
So you need to convince
your boyfriend to be patient.

418
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:42,087
No way.
He's only in County this week...

419
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:44,497
and he's not goin' back to T.I.

420
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:47,092
You know whatJuan did to you.

421
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:51,368
And soon, everyone'll know
unless you get him out of there.

422
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,851
- [Sophia]Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

423
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:03,920
[Aurora]
Uh-huh.

424
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,585
Now let's make one
for Daddy, okay?

425
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:14,287
[Sophia]
/t's a flower without petals.

426
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,593
[Aurora Laughs]

427
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:21,604
- Here.
- /'m gonna draw a Christmas tree.

428
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,367
Okay.

429
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:27,500
I gotta go finish
some things up.

430
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:43,182
It's Antwon Mitchell's
half brother.

431
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,193
How did you miss
the connection?

432
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:47,729
[Monica] The kid's on the dean's list.
No record, no gang ties.

433
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:50,857
Doesn't seem like the type
to go 187.

434
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:53,493
Why are you here?

435
00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:56,004
Heard you got a break
on our cop killings.

436
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:58,233
Jason might be
our Antwon connection.

437
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:01,675
Which means the murders
are seizure-related.

438
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:04,303
Uh, we don't know
what it means yet.

439
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:08,751
[Door Opens]

440
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:12,185
[Monica] Nice ice.
You should've seen it when we found it...

441
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,120
covered in the blood
of two dead cops.

442
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:16,158
I lost it on
my way home from school.

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,751
Before or after
the dog ate your homework?

444
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:21,422
- That's the truth.
- [Monica]
We know you were with the Nigerians...

445
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,431
when they killed our guys.

446
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,433
We also know
you have a bright future.

447
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:27,435
No way you'd be stupid enough
to do something like this...

448
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,596
without your brother Antwon
telling you to.

449
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:31,674
I barely know Antwon.

450
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,870
These are checks for your tuition
at U.C. Northridge.

451
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,746
- That's Antwon's signature.
- So he pays some bills.
Doesn't mean it's a love fest.

452
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,751
[Mackey]
Antwon paid for your college.

453
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:47,153
You killin'two cops sounds like
the love bein'paid back in full.

454
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,626
Antwon didn't have anything
to do with that. He's a leader.

455
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:54,754
A visionary.

456
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:58,130
His incarceration is a crime against
this community and all people of color.

457
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:00,328
[Mackey]
Let's stick to your crimes.

458
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,735
You're an accomplice
to the murders of two cops.

459
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,273
We have a Nigerian in custody
who's anxious to make a deal...

460
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,502
and your bling
at the crime scene.

461
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:10,546
Covering up for Antwon
is gonna do you no good.

462
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,775
Now, if this is about
you cozying up with him at Lompoc...

463
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,852
ain't gonna happen.

464
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:26,994
I met one of the Russians
at school.

465
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,462
They knew who / was,
thought / might be willin'to help.

466
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:35,163
/ arranged the deal
with the Nigerians.

467
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:37,433
That night, I helped
communicate the plan.

468
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:43,269
I did it to prove to Antwon
that I can play in his league.

469
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,211
He didn't know anything
about it.

470
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:54,882
So it sounds like
Antwon's clean on this one.

471
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,926
You really think
the Fresh Prince in there...

472
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,190
brokered a high-power deal
between the Russians and the Nigerians?

473
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:02,731
He admitted to his part in the murders.
Antwon's already in jail.

474
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:06,735
Sometimes, you have to take
"I did it" for an answer.

475
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:14,843
That's bullshit.
This kid is Antwon's tool. You know it.

476
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:21,116
Look, / know pinning this on Antwon
puts these murders on the seizures.

477
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,550
That's a bad thing for us.
I understand.

478
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,850
/ just wanna find out
the whole truth...

479
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:28,925
wherever it leads.

480
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,998
- [Groaning]
- Jesus!

481
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:43,197
- [Dutch] Sorry. Sorry.
- Shithead!

482
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,740
Get him up.
Let's get him up. You got it?

483
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:48,834
[Straining]
Come on.

484
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:55,247
Okay. We're okay.
We're okay now.

485
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:57,252
Tell us about Nokey.

486
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:01,688
Nokey? He's an I.D. guy
I used to roll with.

487
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,885
All puns intended.

488
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:07,555
Did good work.
I gave Gill his number.

489
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:11,623
Anything in it for you?
Commissions? Kickbacks?

490
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:16,263
- Just a chance to be of service.
- You, uh, happen to have
Nokey's number handy?

491
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,136
Sorry.
I lost it.

492
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,971
We'll get it from Gill's house.

493
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:24,445
- We'll be back.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

494
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:37,192
A visitor this late at night?

495
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,194
Must be important.

496
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:43,630
I've got some friends in Justice
who might be interested in you.

497
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,224
A lot of people
interested in me.

498
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:49,305
These friends can offer you
witness protection.

499
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:51,306
You're monitored,
but you're free.

500
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:53,308
I ain't a rat.

501
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:57,210
You got loyalties
to the Salvadorans?

502
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:03,075
The D.E.A. can't make their case,
and they're looking for any help they can get.

503
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:06,815
Well, if the feds want my love,
why the hell am I talkin' to you?

504
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:09,653
They know the havoc
you left in Farmington.

505
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,526
They won't push this through
without some local cover, and that's me.

506
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:18,863
- Now, / can go tell Justice you're interested-
- If what?

507
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:23,201
If you're willing to give some
serious intel on the Salvadorans.

508
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:26,400
Now you gotta give 'em
the names at the top, names that matter.

509
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,774
All the locals in charge.

510
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:32,042
People in Central America
that they answer to.

511
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,777
That's a tall order, man.

512
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:37,217
Well, that's the only way
this works.

513
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:43,854
And I assume there's some sort of...
broker's fee for you?

514
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,488
Uh-uh.
Nothing for me.

515
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:53,035
Huh.
CallJustice.

516
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,664
Tell 'em I'm interested.

517
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:01,476
I will.

518
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:13,115
In the meantime,
there's an inmate here in County.

519
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,123
Name's Juan Lozano.

520
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,560
He's due to testify
this week.

521
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:22,291
It could upset a case
that the D.E.A.'s working on.

522
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,426
This could be your chance
to show that you're a team player.

523
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:30,097
ConvinceJuan
to miss his court date.

524
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,044
I'll see what I can do.

525
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,781
I'll callJustice.

526
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,483
You do that.

527
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,459
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- [Door Opens]

528
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,463
237. Got it. Thanks.
I'll get back to you.

529
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,828
- [Laughter]
- [Claudette] Are you okay?

530
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,283
They're- They're bringing in Nokey.
Let's talk to him.

531
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,478
Dutch. Come on.

532
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,819
We found Nokey.
/ don't think he likes you anymore.

533
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,592
He confessed to making
the fake I.D.'s.

534
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:33,829
He said Gill was supposed to come by and
pick 'em up, pay off the $6,500 balance.

535
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,768
Claims he didn't murder him though.

536
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:39,899
We believe him. Blowing off
a guy's nads and stealing his money-

537
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,910
that's just bad business.

538
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:45,175
You knew Gill had the cash.
You took him down a quiet alley...

539
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:47,648
put two rounds
of buckshot in his privates.

540
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,151
/n that chair, you'd have been
face-to-balls with the guy.

541
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,551
And then rolled away
with the cash.

542
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,420
[Sighs]
That's pretty ambitious for a cripple.

543
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,891
You mean a person
with a disability?

544
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:02,528
I'm a goddamn cripple.
I own that.

545
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:07,160
You also own
a brand-new handicap ramp.

546
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,602
The contractor just
e-mailed me the work order.

547
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:14,075
$6,000.
You paid cash this afternoon.

548
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,840
/f / test those wheels, /'m gonna find
shotgun residue and Gill's blood.

549
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,017
I should probably
get a lawyer.

550
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,919
I didn't threaten to rape anyone.
I have a wife and two kids.

551
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:31,722
But how do you explain the calls made
from your house toJoanna Faulks's?

552
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,988
Maybe one of my kids
dialed the wrong number.

553
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,330
Her husband was convicted of raping
and killing several women last year.

554
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:42,462
Your mother lives two doors down
from one of the victims- Dory Smythe.

555
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,472
Police interviewed her
at the time of the crime.

556
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,474
And my mom's still scared
shitless because of it.

557
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,601
What does that have
to do with me?

558
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,341
Okay, this asshole did it,
but he's just not gonna confess.

559
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,680
He's actually trying
to pawn it off on his sons.

560
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:58,413
Uh, take the recording over
toJoanna's house in the morning.

561
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:01,422
See if she can, uh,
I.D. the voice.

562
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:05,157
All right, sure.

563
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,624
/ covered your ass last week.
/ ask you for a simple favor.

564
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,032
- Not only do you not help me out, you pile on.
- You gotta unwind a little bit.

565
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,434
All I see is you laughing
right along with everybody else.

566
00:35:15,538 --> 00:35:17,597
Maybe I ought to set an example,
starting with you.

567
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:20,267
- You don't wanna get into this.
- It's not so funny now? Huh?

568
00:35:20,377 --> 00:35:22,572
What are you gonna do, turn off
the hose and hide behind your car?

569
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,881
Check it out-
Billings and Dutch.

570
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:27,472
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

571
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:32,586
- Oh.
- Get him, Dutch-boy.

572
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,653
- I got 20 on the geek!
- That's even money, brother.

573
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,694
Get him around.
Get him around, baby.

574
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:41,787
[Shouting Continues]

575
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,472
[All Gasping]

576
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:52,837
How many slap fests
do I have to break up today?

577
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:56,077
Goddamn it!
[Yells]

578
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:01,213
Come on.
Let's just finish this.

579
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:04,411
Come on, asshole.
Let's go! Yeah, you, Vic!

580
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:07,046
Come on! You too!
You wanna keep ridin' me?

581
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,751
You wanna mess with my chair?
Yeah, let's finish this!

582
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,317
Two of our own are dead.

583
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,744
- [Door Slams Shut]
- [Monica] Rise and shine.

584
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:40,152
You have to give us
another name.

585
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:44,590
Apparently, Antwon's lawyer thinks
helping you is a conflict of interest.

586
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:47,254
- / don't understand.
- It means your big brother doesn't give a shit...

587
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:49,263
about where you end up,
which makes me wonder...

588
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,333
why you're trying so hard
to protect him.

589
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:53,334
Antwon's just
lookin' out for me.

590
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:56,872
Then why'd he make such a big show
about that custom necklace he got for ya?

591
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,407
A couple of his boys
picked it up in a robbery.

592
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,342
The original owner has confirmed
that it was stolen.

593
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:06,779
Antwon's always got my back,
ever since I was a shorty.

594
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:10,751
Helps with groceries, covers the mortgage
when my dad's out of work.

595
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:15,991
Y'all arejust tryin'
to screw me 'cause /'m tired...

596
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:17,992
get me
to say somethin'stupid.

597
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:21,325
I'm sure Antwon's briefed you about
the Farmington asset forfeiture policy.

598
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:26,198
Him being a known drug dealer,
that statement means...

599
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:29,738
we can get a warrant,
look into your father's finances.

600
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,933
The statement before the one
about you sayin'somethin'stupid.

601
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,840
The mortgage payments
made with drug proceeds?

602
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:40,473
- We can take your father's house.
- Or you can tell the truth.

603
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,518
Keep your daddy
from movin' into a shelter.

604
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,316
Nobody touches my dad's house.

605
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:57,363
I don't wanna go
someplace far away.

606
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,401
We can connect you
to the murder of two cops.

607
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:02,130
You go wherever
we say you go.

608
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,706
Or / can talk to the D. A...

609
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,241
get the death penalty
off the table.

610
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:10,141
Make sure they put you
into protective custody.

611
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,977
You stay alive:
Dad still enjoys retirement...

612
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,313
rocking on the front porch.

613
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,590
I need to see
the deal on paper.

614
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:25,752
Then I'll tell you
how it went down.

615
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,691
- This is all your stuff.
- Thanks.

616
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:36,568
Could we just, uh,
for a minute-

617
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:38,573
The kids are getting ready
for school...

618
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:42,873
and, um, I don't want them
to see your face like that.

619
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:48,542
Listen. When I said before
this started because of Vic...

620
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:50,551
that's not the only reason.

621
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,678
It's the only one that matters.

622
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,814
See, no, it isn't...

623
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:57,154
because there's something here.

624
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,195
/ know you wanna
believe that now...

625
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,925
but Vic got under your skin,
and I was a way to get back at him.

626
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,763
Maybe he's still under
your skin?

627
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:12,329
Maybe you even thought you-
you could get back at him a little?

628
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:15,036
- Show him you've moved on?
- Men have time for pissing contests.

629
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,339
Mothers don't.

630
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,179
You want me to forgive you?

631
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:23,718
You're forgiven.

632
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,948
[Chuckles]
Listen, l-I didn't tell you about Vic...

633
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,547
because I was afraid
you wouldn't go out with me.

634
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,753
And then I was afraid to tell you
because things were going so well.

635
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:35,729
- Being afraid ruined it.
- Yeah, it did.

636
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,164
Well, I'm not afraid anymore.

637
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,565
So at some point...

638
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,197
Iook past my bad start,
give me another chance.

639
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:47,003
Let me know.

640
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,502
[Door Opens]

641
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:02,515
Antwon saw
the coming tide.

642
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,525
Black and whites' days
are numbered.

643
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:07,187
It's all about making peace
with the red, yellow and brown.

644
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:10,595
He paid for your education,
made sure someone in his organization...

645
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,328
could speak the languages,
so he wouldn't be left behind.

646
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:17,202
A goodwill ambassador,
only instead ofbrokering peace...

647
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:20,673
you brokered drug deals,
gang alliances.

648
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:25,237
How did Antwon get the Russians
and the Nigerians together?

649
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:28,909
- The Russians had a beef with P.D.
- 'Cause we took down Kozodav?

650
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,785
Antwon was plugged
into that.

651
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,415
He offered Tretiak
the Nigerians as hired help.

652
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:40,018
Why were officers
Haimes and Miller targeted?

653
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:42,029
Tretiak's idea.

654
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:44,565
The black cop
pissed him off...

655
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,897
gave him a speeding ticket.

656
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:49,198
And you?

657
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:53,332
I translated, drove...

658
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:56,640
made sure the Nigerians had
what they needed to get thejob done.

659
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,714
Antwon's emissary.

660
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:02,182
[Jason]
Russians have an international pipeline.

661
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,845
Need 'em in your corner
if you wanna play outside the States.

662
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,818
Killin' the cops was a handshake.
Antwon knew if they did this, they'd be tied.

663
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,828
There'd be trust.

664
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,228
An oath in blood.

665
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,603
- [Knocking]
- Police.

666
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:24,696
- Miss Faulks?
- I hear a TV.

667
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:27,173
[TV, /ndistinct]

668
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,337
Shit. She said the intruder
came through the back the last time.

669
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:57,930
Miss Faulks, the police!
You in there?

670
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,238
- [Gunshot]
- One-Tango-13. Shots fired.

671
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:03,778
- Officer down.
- [Groans]

672
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,749
Oh, God!

673
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,943
Let me see your hands.
Put that gun down.

674
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:12,850
- Put the gun down. Drop it.
- / thought you were-

675
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:15,924
- Put it down! Down!
- I didn't know! I'm so sorry! l-

676
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:18,016
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands on your head!

677
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:20,027
- I heard something outside.
I thought you were-
- Oh, God.

678
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:22,188
Step down!
Move, now!

679
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:23,560
- /'m so sorry.
- [Groaning]

680
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,429
Give us a minute, now.

681
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:30,768
The D.E.A. just requested all
departmental files on Antwon Mitchell.

682
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:33,239
Shit. Are they thinking
of making a deal?

683
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,572
Witness protection, immunity.
I hear it's done.

684
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,010
What? We've gotta
get it off the table.

685
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:40,173
- We just linked him to the two cop murders.
- How?

686
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:42,183
His half brother gave him up.

687
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:45,083
- Antwon's gonna walk.
You and your boy really did it.
- Me?

688
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,520
And Aceveda.
I know all about the dance...

689
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:49,682
you two are planning
for the Pol Com session.

690
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,692
You help him navigate
this Mitchell deal?

691
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:54,490
What the hell
are you talking about?

692
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:59,125
Aceveda brokered the deal
between Mitchell and D.E.A.?

693
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:03,296
A woman like you- I figured you'd get to know
your bedmates before you lay down with them.

694
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:05,738
Oh, shit!

695
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:12,046
- The deal is off!
- What?

696
00:43:12,148 --> 00:43:14,616
Big brother struck a better one,
which leaves you shit out of luck!

697
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,947
- You can't do that!
- You're gonna take a lethal injection...

698
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,147
for the killing of two cops...

699
00:43:20,256 --> 00:43:22,417
and I'm gonna
be there to watch!

700
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:30,961
- Put him back in the cage.
- What the hell happened?

701
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,901
Aceveda shit all over us.
Brokered Antwon to the D.E.A.

702
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:37,165
- Witness protection.
- They're lettin' him go?

703
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:41,201
Excuse me. The councilman's busy.
You can't go in there-

704
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,835
Where the hell do you get off
cutting a deal for Antwon Mitchell?

705
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:47,143
Hey, it's the D.E.A. 's deal.
They asked me to approach him.

706
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,844
Antwon ordered the hit
on our cops.

707
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:52,546
His half brother
just gave him up.

708
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,418
You just set a cop killer free,
you dick!

709
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:58,482
- The kid said he acted alone.
- That family has a little bit
of trouble with the truth.

710
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,655
- He lied!
- Call the deal off.

711
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,201
I can't. It's in
the D.E.A.'s hands now.

712
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,401
Carl and Scooby were stabbed
over and over again...

713
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,998
probably alive long enough
to feel most of it.

714
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,511
I was there when the bodies were
carried out. I'm the one who found them!

715
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,877
- I'm still a cop!
- Bullshit!

716
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:23,247
Cops want only one thing-
Antwon executed for what he did.

717
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:26,253
The D.E.A. cannot make a case
against the Salvadoran cartel.

718
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:30,189
Mitchell is willing to give up the entire
pipeline, all right? This is huge.

719
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,727
You mean your council buddies
get a few favors from Sacramento.

720
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:35,729
Do you think I care
about a D.E.A. win?

721
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:38,664
- Carl and Scooby were my men!
- You're the one who came crawling
to me asking for a lifeline!

722
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:41,828
- And I was an asshole
to think you were an option!
- Watch it. You still need me.

723
00:44:41,938 --> 00:44:45,032
I need shit from you!

724
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:48,668
You can take your backroom handshakes,
your D.E.A. cronies...

725
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:52,839
and your self-serving,
cop-killer deals...

726
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:55,645
and you can
shove them up your ass.

727
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:05,388
You're not a cop.
You never were.

728
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:21,736
