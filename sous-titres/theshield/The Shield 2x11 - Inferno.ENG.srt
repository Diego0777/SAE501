1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,409
One-Tango-13 in pursuit
of car jackers...

2
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,572
<i>eastbound on Campo,
approaching Melrose.</i>

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,339
<i>Oh, shit. They're bailing.</i>

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,080
<i>One-tango-13. My partner's on foot pursuit.</i>

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,388
<i>- 1300 block of Pico.
Additional backup requested.</i>

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,156
Suspects are armed.

7
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,704
I've got 'im. Go.

8
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,271
One-Tango-13.
We have the child. He's unharmed.

9
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,941
Stop!

10
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,157
He's in there.

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,974
Freeze!

12
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,906
Stop!

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,882
Stay down.
Hands behind your back.

14
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,619
You're under arrest.

15
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,092
They took the skin from his ass.

16
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,027
Left cheek and upper thigh.

17
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,633
Those jokes just write themselves.

18
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,667
I'm ready to come back.

19
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,739
- You should take some more time.
- All I can think about...

20
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,470
is ripping off these Armenians.

21
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,842
- You up to work and the money train?
- I need this.

22
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,246
He's come up
with a new way inside.

23
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,181
It's a little late
for changes in the game plan.

24
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,514
<i>I went two nights ago,
scoped out the whole location again.</i>

25
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,014
The one thing we've never been able
to figure out is the bottleneck problem.

26
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>All four of us going in together...</i>

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,427
if just one of those Armenians
isn't where we expect him to be...

28
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,328
- Yeah, we're toast.
- Ronnie noticed this
garbage pickup at the site.

29
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,832
It's Armenian.
They just wave it in.

30
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:20,802
We get ahold of the garbage truck,
deposit two of us on the inside...

31
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,307
a few hours before
the money train arrives.

32
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,770
<i>Me and Shane,
we climb inside a Dumpster...</i>

33
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,506
- Why am I in the garbage?
- Two inside, two outside.

34
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,574
We triangulate.
Sounds like a real possibility.

35
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,151
Have to figure out how to get our hands
on one of those garbage trucks.

36
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,450
We're already on it.

37
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,083
We only have two weeks
to master a new plan.

38
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,459
Let me think about it.

39
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,030
Goddamn it.

40
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,498
You're not talking about me, I hope.

41
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,070
- What do you want?
- Everything okay?

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,177
<i>The Times is gonna endorse
Karen Mitchell for city council primary.</i>

43
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:00,544
- So? Don't you have some big lead?
- Not anymore.

44
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,843
And with Lanie's official report due
a week before the election...

45
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,553
Yeah, well...

46
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:09,647
I was thinking about some ways
to take the sting out of that report.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,321
Enlighten me.

48
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,027
One big, high-profile bust...

49
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:17,019
something the chief...
not even Lanie... can deny us.

50
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,926
- And I suppose you have a candidate.
- Fresh off the Teletype.

51
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,935
Dante Fell. He was a major gangbanger
when I was in the blues.

52
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,110
He went national,
went off my radar.

53
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,671
F.B.I., D.E.A., State, County,
they all want him bad.

54
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,743
How sweet would it be
if we dragged his ass in?

55
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,477
Scored one for the home team?

56
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,519
Federal authorities
believe Dante Fell...

57
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,989
may be on his way to Farmington
or already here.

58
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,255
Dante is a founding member
of the Compton Crowns street gang.

59
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,958
<i>He spent the last four years of his life
franchising his gang to other places...</i>

60
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,296
<i>like Wichita, San Antonio
and Oklahoma City...</i>

61
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,336
supplying them
with drugs and weapons.

62
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,101
Pick up a flyer
and be on the lookout for him.

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,403
- Think you can get him before the feds?
- Absolutely.

64
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,142
- Listen, I gotta bring Ronnie back.
- Sure he's ready?

65
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,821
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I'm not.

66
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,255
Tavon's still learning.
I need a full team.

67
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,448
This guy Dante isn't
gonna be an easy catch.

68
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,957
Fine. I don't want you
to have any excuses.

69
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,926
I won't need any.

70
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,842
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

71
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,707
Read about that civilian
auditor's report.

72
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,408
- It was pretty rough.
- What's up?

73
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,550
- When you had me running
that protective detail on Corrine?
- Yeah?

74
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,711
I saw my guy's surveillance notes,
and he followed her...

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,021
to some law firm on Ventura,
so I looked into it.

76
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,293
She went to see
a divorce lawyer. Twice.

77
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:56,524
- And you're just telling me this now?
- I didn't confirm it until now.

78
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,768
Divorce lawyer.

79
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,532
<i>- We're not anywhere near that.
- I'm just telling you, Vic.</i>

80
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,104
It's a mistake I'll always regret,
not seeing the writing on the wall.

81
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,341
We're supposed to be
in a holding pattern
till we figure things out.

82
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,546
She's already seen
this lawyer twice.

83
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,879
She's scheduled to see him again
Tuesday, 4 p.m.

84
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,484
- She wouldn't do this to me, not right now.
- I bet you didn't think...

85
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,979
she was capable of packing up and running out
with your kids, and she did.

86
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,527
Listen, please, just do me a favor.

87
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:30,655
- Talk to this guy of mine.
- Divorce guy?

88
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,062
He's one of the best.

89
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,932
I really appreciate the heads-up
on this, but it's unnecessary.

90
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,508
- Tavon Garris, right?
- That's me.

91
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,842
I'm Lanie Kellis.

92
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,451
Oh, sure, your, uh...

93
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,681
Your report's causing quite a stir
around here.

94
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,549
<i>That was a mistake.
Someone leaked my notes.</i>

95
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,286
My official report
comes out next week.

96
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,126
Being new, I'm probably the only person in the
building not sweating it, huh?

97
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,663
<i>Well, I know everybody here
sees me as the bogeyman...</i>

98
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,735
but if you ask me,
I'm misunderstood.

99
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,069
<i>I've been meaning
to talk to you actually.</i>

100
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,078
<i>- Yeah? What about?
- Vic Mackey.</i>

101
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,717
<i>Mmm, look at the patch man.</i>

102
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,048
Back in the saddle, baby.

103
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,523
<i>Listen, you get ahold of that thing
we were talking about?</i>

104
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,123
<i>I'm open to the new plan.</i>

105
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,429
<i>- Get going, then.
- All right.</i>

106
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,395
Call in with updates
and keep 'em open.

107
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,705
Hey. You seen Tavon around?

108
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,171
Not in the last half hour. Why?

109
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>I saw him chatting up with Lanie
in the kitchen earlier.</i>

110
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,141
<i>- What were they saying?
- I couldn't hear...</i>

111
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,116
but they looked awful cozy.

112
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,983
Now, the last thing we need
is another guy we can't trust.

113
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,121
Yo.

114
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,988
Hey, I saw you talking
to our civilian auditor.

115
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah.
What's up with her?

116
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:10,624
She's a bitch.
What were you two talking about?

117
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,524
<i>- Nothing, really.
- Keep it that way.</i>

118
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,261
Let's get started on finding
this Dante prick.

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
Come on.
It's a needle in a haystack.

120
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:22,135
I mean, according to the Teletype,
the guy might be in town?

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,503
For reasons either the feds don't know
or don't want to reveal, it's a jerk-off.

122
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,780
What?
You giving up already?

123
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,281
Actually, we do have a bona fide tip
that the feds don't have.

124
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,657
- Yeah, what's that?
- One of Dante's old homies is Kern Little.

125
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,421
<i>- The hip-hop guy?
- Yeah, they got picked up
a few times together.</i>

126
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,828
Knowing Kern,
he stays in touch.

127
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,022
What makes you think
Kern's gonna help us?

128
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,935
Kern's a friend.

129
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,234
Grab your shit.
You're riding with us today.

130
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,671
Looks like I'm moving up
in the world.

131
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,028
<i>Hey.</i>

132
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,366
A'ight. I see you're adding
a little color to the team.

133
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,005
<i>- Tavon, man. It's good to meet you.
- We're here for a favor.</i>

134
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,404
<i>- Funny. I need one from you.
- Mine first. Dante Fell.</i>

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,239
I hear he's in town.
What can you tell me?

136
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,310
Man, I ain't seen
Dante in, like, forever.

137
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,383
- But you know who he hangs with, right?
- When we getting to my favor?

138
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,678
Soon.

139
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,417
All right. If he's in L.A. ...

140
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,226
you want to be
talking to Frogger.

141
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,059
Real name Freddy Germaine,
Dante's quarter brother.

142
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,993
<i>Quarter brother? That some
kind of new ghetto math?</i>

143
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,895
<i>Nah, man. It means Dante's moms was
shacked up with Froggy's pops.</i>

144
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,028
Pops took off.
Dante's moms kept Froggy.

145
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,666
- So you know, they're not
blood brothers, they're...
- Quarter brothers.

146
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,173
Exactly. So, what's up
with my favor?

147
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,274
<i>- You like that studio stuff, huh?
- It's hot, man.</i>

148
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,817
Why don't you give him
a tour of the place, baby?

149
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,181
Sure. Let me
show you around.

150
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,568
So here's the deal, man.

151
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,935
I'm trying to get back into the drug game.
I need y'all on my team, though.

152
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,362
Same deal you had
with Rondell and Tio.

153
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,238
That wasn't working out for us
the way we'd hoped. I can't help you.

154
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,277
Being kind of cold
for someone who owes me.

155
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,244
- Owe you for what?
- I was getting a cut from Rondell.

156
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,452
Y'all wanted him out.
I went along with it.

157
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,215
Y'all was supposed to
be protecting Tio.

158
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,886
He goes up in smoke.
Suddenly, my cut dries up.

159
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,424
Look, I didn't come to y'all for lost wages,
but y'all know I could've.

160
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,789
Well, it looks like
you're scraping by.

161
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,397
Well, I'm not.
Man, I got lawsuits...

162
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,829
cheating accountants,
hungry crew.

163
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,630
You're broke?

164
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,136
Not if I could fill the powder void
in Farmington. I need y'all, though.

165
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,367
We got pressures
of our own right now.

166
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,311
It'd make it impossible
for us to do what you ask.

167
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,745
<i>I appreciate
the Frogger tip...</i>

168
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,785
but I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to make it up to you.

169
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,389
- That's it?
- That's it. Tavon!

170
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,461
Good work.
Keep it up.

171
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,465
Two for one, man.
Unbelievable.

172
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,093
Yeah. Store owner says
we're gonna lose Julien to the NFL.

173
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,674
<i>Julien, isn't that your...</i>

174
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,337
<i>Yeah. I got it.</i>

175
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,246
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,886
I'm out on parole.
I wanted to see you as soon as I...

177
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,614
Now is not a great time.

178
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,849
Okay, well, when would
be a good time then?

179
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,293
Things have changed, Tomas.
Everything has changed.

180
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,494
You've gotta leave.

181
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,430
Look, I really need your help right now.
I got no one else...

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,662
Look, I cannot
do this right now.

183
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,570
Maybe later.

184
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,045
Oh, goddamn it.
We've got a tail.

185
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,681
<i>Don't look.</i>

186
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,545
- You sure?
- Green sedan about three cars back.

187
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,880
<i>Saw it on the way to Kern's.
He's still on our ass.</i>

188
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,582
- Who'd stick a tail on us?
- That's what you're gonna find out.

189
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,192
<i>All right.
Get ready to bail.</i>

190
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,296
<i>Go, go.</i>

191
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,261
- May I help you?
- My daughter Evette, she was raped.

192
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,297
I'm sorry.
Has she seen a doctor yet?

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,960
No. Uh, it happened a couple of days ago.
I just found out about it.

194
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,804
Her boss had her close the store late with him,
so he could get her alone.

195
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,556
<i>- You get the tag?
- Yeah.</i>

196
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,897
- Write it down.
- It's cool, man. I got it right here.

197
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,728
Unless you're the world
concentration champion...

198
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,465
<i>just write down the damn tag number,
man, it's important.</i>

199
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,795
Whoever he is,
he's still back there.

200
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,040
Why do I have
to have these tests?

201
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,442
Well, it may still give us a chance
to get a sample of his D.N.A.

202
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,482
He wore a condom.

203
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,609
<i>Well, it also proves
that intercourse took place.</i>

204
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,881
Won't take long.
You're a brave girl to come forward.

205
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,588
What is it?

206
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,225
I have a boyfriend...
and we...

207
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,702
- You had intercourse with your boyfriend?
- Mama doesn't know.

208
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,574
When was the last time
you had sex?

209
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,271
A few days ago.
Will that show up on the test?

210
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,173
Let's just wait for the results.

211
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,339
It's gonna be okay.

212
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,722
<i>I'm the manager.</i>

213
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:47,214
Hey, darling.
Uh, we're looking for Freddy.

214
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,830
- Frogger?
- Yeah. Can you help us?

215
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,697
<i>Ain't seen him today.
Why? Did he do something?</i>

216
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,597
Well, have you seen this guy
hanging around lately?

217
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,403
- No.
- Is there anything you can
tell us about Frogger?

218
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,407
Always pays his rent late.
Not late enough to kick him out...

219
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,205
<i>but late enough to make me take
an extra trip to the bank every month.</i>

220
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,713
<i>- Has he paid up this month?
- Not yet. Four days late.</i>

221
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,287
<i>- I hope he's okay in there.
- What do you mean?</i>

222
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,585
Well, maybe he's sick
in there or something.

223
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,656
Can't get to the phone.

224
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,195
And as the manager, you could let us in,
just to see if he's okay.

225
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,698
I mean, if you're worried
about him or anything.

226
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,766
Should I be?

227
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,103
Let me get my keys.

228
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,572
- Leo wants to take a few shots for
the paper, then get a short interview.
- Great.

229
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:47,014
- Actually, he just wants Julien.
- Sure.

230
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,017
<i>- Here we go, smile.
- Julien, I really need to talk to you.</i>

231
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,217
- I'm busy right now.
- It'll just take a second.

232
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,023
Um, this is Tomas.
He's a friend.

233
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,095
Heard about our hero, huh?

234
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,392
Oh, yeah.
I knew him when.

235
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,731
- Um, this is Vanessa, my wife.
- Hi.

236
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,967
<i>- Ah. Congratulations.
- Thank you.</i>

237
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,509
Please?

238
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,874
Make it quick.

239
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,485
- What are you doing?
- You said talk to you later. It's later.

240
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,159
- Your wife looks incredible.
- What?

241
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,458
Almost fooled me. Wait a minute.
You really married a woman?

242
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,160
Watch your mouth.

243
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,460
Wait, look, look. Julien.

244
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,900
I got no place to stay, all right.
Can you help me out here?

245
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,868
Look, I'm married now.
You can't stay with me.

246
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,576
Married? Julien,
what about what we had?

247
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,272
That's not who I am anymore.
I've said good-bye to that part of my life.

248
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610
Now I have to say
good-bye to you.

249
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,512
Look, if you don't help me...

250
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,145
you know what I'm gonna
have to do to survive?

251
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,724
Is that what
you want for me?

252
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,626
<i>- Julien, the photographer's ready for you.
- All right.</i>

253
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,990
- You should go.
- I'll be there in a minute.

254
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,571
If you don't want
to see me anymore, fine.

255
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,869
But don't tell me you can't help me out,
because I know you can.

256
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,042
Look!

257
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,307
Get a hotel for
a few nights on me. Here.

258
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,079
What kind of place takes cash?

259
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,977
I need a credit card
if I'm gonna get a room.

260
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,053
Here.

261
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,052
All right, I'll bring
this back when I'm done.

262
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,817
<i>Just go, please.</i>

263
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,561
He's not dead in there, is he?

264
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,528
No, ma'am.

265
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,671
You have one saved message.

266
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,171
<i>Hey, yo, Frogger, this Kern Little.
I'm boys with Dante.</i>

267
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,800
<i>Yo, listen, bro, cops is looking for him.
They think you the key, man.</i>

268
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,844
<i>They on their way over there.
You there?</i>

269
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,107
<i>You better move your ass,
and don't tell 'em I told you.</i>

270
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,287
- So what else was I supposed to do, man?
- Hey, look, I... I...

271
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,312
I don't blame you.
You feel like we screwed you.

272
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,122
- So you screwed us right back.
- Man!

273
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,918
Listen, let's see if we can't
start all over again.

274
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,899
I'm here, listening.

275
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:18,632
All right. In our earlier conversation,
what I was trying to get at...

276
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,395
is we made a mistake
in our previous business model.

277
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,301
<i>We got in too deep.
Now, I just don't wanna...</i>

278
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,967
make the same mistake
a second time.

279
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,011
We both learning
from our mistakes.

280
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,285
I can't do the same things I did for Rondell,
but I can provide some intel...

281
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,981
eliminate some competition,
do some favors.

282
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:40,315
- That's all I'm asking.
- I won't have the same room to maneuver...

283
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,155
unless I double my arrest quota.

284
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,830
I gotta get the big fish.

285
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,368
Look, I put my ass on the line with my boss.
I told him I'd get Dante.

286
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,599
We can help each other out,
but it's gotta start with you.

287
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,137
I've always been straight with you,
Kern, every time.

288
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,740
Yeah, I know.

289
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,646
All right, man.

290
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,683
I'll make some calls.

291
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,210
I'll find out what pad
the Frogger landed on.

292
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,285
I appreciate it.

293
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,789
Why do you think
she'd accuse you?

294
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,995
I don't know.

295
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,123
I had to put Evette on notice last week.
It was her second warning.

296
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,501
<i>- About what?
- Well, take your pick.</i>

297
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,526
She's late all the time.
She, uh, could give...

298
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,667
a rat's ass about
customer service.

299
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,507
<i>Not exactly employee
of the month.</i>

300
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:32,671
It's these girls. They take the job for the
discount and leave after six weeks.

301
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,942
<i>As God is my witness,
I didn't touch her.</i>

302
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,313
She says you told her she had to stay late
the other night.

303
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,416
<i>Yeah, to... to help close up.
It's a two-person job.</i>

304
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,022
So it was just
the two of you, then.

305
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,628
We totaled the receipts and took out the trash
and locked up and left.

306
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,923
I even walked her to her car.

307
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,762
So, got any dish
on Lanie's report?

308
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,436
No. What have you heard?

309
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,038
Nothing.
Just major cuts are coming.

310
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,265
Don't have to be psychic
to know that.

311
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,842
You'll, uh, put in a good word
for me, right?

312
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,445
<i>- With who?
- Lanie.</i>

313
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,411
You better
put that one in yourself.

314
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,846
- Come on. I've seen you two talking.
- Who's that?

315
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,321
Can I help you?

316
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,528
Uh, yes.
Um, an officer called me...

317
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,553
about my husband,
asked me to come down here.

318
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,397
- And your husband is...
- Bruce Rosen. What's going on?

319
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,365
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
This is Detective Wyms.

320
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,502
Why don't you take a seat?

321
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,696
<i>- No. Just tell me, is my husband all right?
- Mrs. Rosen...</i>

322
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:40,303
your husband's been accused of
allegedly raping one of his employees.

323
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,315
<i>What? That's ridiculous.</i>

324
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,613
There been accusations
like that in the past?

325
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,520
Of what, rape?

326
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,080
Of course not. He's never
been arrested in his life.

327
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,287
<i>- Do you have a daughter?
- Yes.</i>

328
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,727
- How old is she?
- Fourteen.

329
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,161
- We're gonna need to talk to her.
- Why?

330
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,564
The alleged victim's 16. If your husband did
have forcible sex with her...

331
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,999
- sometimes there's a pattern
that extends to the family.
- That's sick.

332
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,208
- It's procedure in these cases.
- Yeah, what's procedure?

333
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:13,406
To lock up an innocent man
and attack his family?

334
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,680
I want to see Bruce now.

335
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,856
Okay. Little man's asleep.

336
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,151
What's that?

337
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,955
Uh, from Matthew's teacher.

338
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,600
Progress report.
He's struggling.

339
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,262
- He seems the same to me.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

340
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,797
Oh, the roofer's coming Tuesday afternoon.
He's gonna give us a bid.

341
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,568
Um, Tuesday's not good.
I have a school thing for Cassidy.

342
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,075
School thing?

343
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,147
Yeah, um, room mother meeting.

344
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,943
Okay. I'll reschedule.

345
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,361
She said she had a school meeting
on Tuesday. She lied.

346
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,988
<i>That's not the only thing
she's lying about.</i>

347
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,962
If you file first, then the settlement
proceeds on your terms.

348
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,094
You get a much better shot
at more time with your kids...

349
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,168
<i>maybe joint custody...</i>

350
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,375
<i>makes you look like
the wronged party.</i>

351
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,570
<i>- Wronged party?
- I gave him some of your details.</i>

352
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,774
She took your kids without telling
you where she was going.

353
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,983
<i>- She was scared.
- You call it scared. I call it kidnapping.</i>

354
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,679
<i>Gordon Jr. was 20 months
when my wife split.</i>

355
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:32,021
You know what he calls
the asshole she married? Daddy.

356
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,419
<i>- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, really?</i>

357
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,322
<i>You don't move fast in this business,
you're gonna get run over.</i>

358
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,092
<i>- I don't know.
- In California, there's
a six-month holding period...</i>

359
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,029
before a divorce becomes legal.

360
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,533
<i>You two patch things up
before then...</i>

361
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,604
<i>you can withdraw the petition.</i>

362
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,503
If you want to protect yourself,
you gotta move now.

363
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,914
Detective...

364
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,786
your kit's back.

365
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,084
Shouldn't you be out
doing something heroic?

366
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,888
Figured I'd give
someone else a chance.

367
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,960
Well, there was
bruising on her breast...

368
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,297
slight tearing
around the vagina.

369
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,561
<i>- Consistent with her statement.
- Try not to look so happy...</i>

370
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,063
<i>- when reading rape kit results.
- Huh.</i>

371
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,400
<i>There's a lot of semen.</i>

372
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,065
<i>- She said Rosen wore a condom.
- Exactly.</i>

373
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,303
Not only that,
most of the sperm was still alive.

374
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,176
<i>Means it was less
than 24 hours old...</i>

375
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,681
which means she had sex
the day after her rape.

376
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,720
That's not what she told me.

377
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,621
All right, I checked the plates
of those dudes following us.

378
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,527
The car belongs
to Trent's Auto Body.

379
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,596
T.A.B.
Tommy Aaron Bankston.

380
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,823
<i>- The chief?
- It's code for the dummy shop...</i>

381
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,265
North Hollywood created
to cover surveillance.

382
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,803
It means the guys tailing us
aren't Justice. They're us.

383
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,837
There's a department
budget code.

384
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,908
- Listed as I.A.
- I.A.D.?

385
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,170
You're way off.
I.A.D. only runs out of downtown.

386
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,975
It's gotta be another part
of the department.

387
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,583
Independent auditor.

388
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,884
Shit, those clowns
are on loan to Lanie Kellis.

389
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,653
She's had her little goons
up our asses.

390
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,889
<i>Well, if she wants
to waste her time, let her.</i>

391
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,398
<i>Wait until she sees us bring in Dante.</i>

392
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,369
- What up?
- Yo, Vic, I got a bead on Frog.

393
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,402
- Where at?
- Collin Greens.

394
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,842
I need a warrant fast.

395
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,710
You got a location on Dante?

396
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,783
No. Buddy of his named Frogger.
We think he knows where Dante is though.

397
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,284
Well, Dante's wanted federally.
If this guy's a material witness...

398
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:47,125
the fastest way is to get
a warrant from the feds.

399
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,889
If we want all the credit on this,
we gotta do the heavy lifting.

400
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,559
Where's this Frogger hiding?

401
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,833
- Collin Greens.
- That place is a zoo.

402
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,731
<i>- We'll have to go in heavy.
- Can't.</i>

403
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,364
<i>Frogger's just a guy
who can lead us to Dante.</i>

404
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,307
We go in full force,
Dante'll hightail it across 13 states.

405
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,968
- It's gotta be just me and my guys.
- This lead's solid?

406
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,109
Because if it's not
and this blows up in our faces...

407
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,881
<i>- Lanie's got even more ammo.
- It's solid.</i>

408
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,452
All right.
I'll call Judge Arias right now.

409
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,528
All right, listen. This place is the
tribal council for the Compton Crowns.

410
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,467
<i>Best way up's gonna be the first stairwell
on the right. It's unmarked.</i>

411
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,840
- They all are.
- Crowns making it hard for us to do our job?

412
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,933
Always. Only the people who live here
know which place is which.

413
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,478
<i>- Well, how'd you find out?
- I got contacts here.</i>

414
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,378
- Decent folks who hate living in a cell block.
- When did you talk to 'em?

415
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,076
4 a.m. I've been sitting on this place all night,
making sure Frogger didn't hop away.

416
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,049
That's great work.
Everybody ready?

417
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,815
<i>Detective Mackey!</i>

418
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,553
<i>- Who the hell are you?
- Special Agent Vulpio, F.B.I.</i>

419
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,820
We understand you're executing
a warrant involving Dante Fell.

420
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,761
<i>- Who told you that?
- He's a federal fugitive.</i>

421
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,767
We have jurisdiction in this case.

422
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:07,466
We're gonna go get our guy nice and quiet.
Then we can figure out who he belongs to.

423
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,008
<i>You don't understand, Detective!</i>

424
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,679
- You're not making any arrest
without us present!
- Shut up!

425
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,884
<i>- Five-oh!
- Goddamn it, we gotta go right now!</i>

426
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,909
- Which one is he in?
- It's that one! There!

427
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,284
<i>All right, grab cover.</i>

428
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,253
Goddamn it, grab some cover
and watch our backs.

429
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,620
Shane, let's go!

430
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,831
<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!</i>

431
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,668
- Where the hell is it coming from?
- I don't know!

432
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,537
Somebody call for backup!

433
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,245
On the ground!
On your knees right now!

434
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,075
Hands on your head right now!

435
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,553
- Are we clear?
- Clear!

436
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,316
All right, which one of you
is Frogger?

437
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,187
<i>Huh? Which one?</i>

438
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,455
<i>Better question:
How the hell are we getting out of here?</i>

439
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,792
<i>We're having a problem
making this case.</i>

440
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,935
Your daughter said that
Mr. Rosen wore a condom...

441
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,063
but the rape kit shows
the presence of semen.

442
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,034
My daughter was a virgin
before she was raped.

443
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,209
<i>Well, the results also prove that she had
intercourse after the rape.</i>

444
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,574
<i>Did you know she was sexually active
with her boyfriend Miguel?</i>

445
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,184
- That's not true.
- Maybe she thought you'd
find out she was having sex...

446
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,484
and made up a story
about her boss raping her.

447
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,057
No. It's not a story.

448
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,254
It's the truth.

449
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,262
I had sex with Miguel
two nights ago.

450
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,766
Girls who get raped on Friday night
don't usually have sex on Saturday.

451
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,365
He didn't rape you, did he?

452
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,669
<i>What was it, Evette?
He...</i>

453
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,179
He threatened to fire you,
so you fired back?

454
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,909
He raped me.

455
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,956
You say you fought him
to get away.

456
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:13,325
No bruises on your arms.
No skin under your nails.

457
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:21,600
Your story doesn't wash.
I don't believe you.

458
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,337
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

459
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,947
Mr. Rosen's bigger than you.
It seems odd he wouldn't leave a mark.

460
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,777
He did leave a mark.

461
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:41,423
Here... and here.

462
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,328
Why can't you believe that?

463
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,475
What? I saw you looking.

464
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,775
- You're mistaken.
- Where are you going?

465
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,840
I think we know what happened
in that store. Nothing.

466
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,483
This case is over.

467
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,622
No, it's not! He raped me!
He needs to pay.

468
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:13,056
If you don't help me,
I'll tell people that you just grabbed me.

469
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,323
You just did.

470
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,221
Now the whole world knows
you're a liar.

471
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,695
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

472
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,579
All right, that's the room right up there, okay?
Secure the perimeter.

473
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:38,015
<i>- Somebody already took
a couple of potshots at us.</i>

474
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,452
- I ain't going out there!
- Don't worry. We got you covered.

475
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,046
Somebody takes a shot at you,
they might hit me by mistake!

476
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,656
Then tell me where Dante is.

477
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,198
- Let's go.
- Let's go. On your feet.

478
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,142
<i>Get him in.</i>

479
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,380
<i>You take your own car.</i>

480
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,158
Bring him upstairs to two.

481
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,025
What happened?
Is everyone okay?

482
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,566
Someone tipped off the feds about our bust.
One guess who.

483
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,228
- This is a federal case.
They had every right to know.
- They blew our covert entry...

484
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,170
put each one of my men in extreme danger,
you sanctimonious little bitch.

485
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,513
- I'll be sure to include that quote in my report.
- Include whatever you like.

486
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:45,745
Tell those amateurs you got following me
they might as well take the rest of the day off!

487
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,092
<i>What are you,
about a buck thirty soaking wet, Froggy?</i>

488
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,562
<i>- Buck sixty.
- Hardly Compton Crown material.</i>

489
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,532
Thank God your quarter bro
pushed through your membership.

490
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,329
<i>- I earned my rep.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

491
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,632
We'll see. Where's Dante?

492
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,072
- Don't know.
- Why's he in town?

493
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,269
- Don't know.
- Oh, so he is in town?

494
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,312
Didn't say that.

495
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,106
Christ, this is gonna be easy.

496
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,808
Yes, it is.

497
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,976
<i>Yeah?</i>

498
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,001
You were right about Mackey.

499
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,034
He's not on the level.

500
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,240
You wanted me
to find some dirt on him.

501
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,974
I may have found something.

502
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,309
You have my word
your name will not be mentioned.

503
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:58,352
Today I saw him
committing a 225-02VC.

504
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,092
What is that?

505
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,754
He parked more than
six inches away from the curb.

506
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:11,399
- Excuse me?
- Look, if you want something
more than that, lady...

507
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,800
you're gonna have
to do it on your own.

508
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,108
- We've got proof.
- What proof?

509
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,589
It's what he used.

510
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:35,753
I'm gonna sue that man
and his store for everything.

511
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,793
- How'd you get that?
- I went through the trash
at the back of the store.

512
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,826
You went through three days
of store garbage to find this?

513
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,333
It was the only way
to make you believe me.

514
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,904
I was a virgin before he raped me.

515
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,479
What the hell's this?

516
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,103
<i>Stop showing me those.</i>

517
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,777
You know what really
makes me sick about these?

518
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:28,905
It's that your quarter bro
is responsible for all these deaths.

519
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,411
They're Crown casualties
from all his franchised cities.

520
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,178
And these are
just the innocents!

521
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,721
- What?
- These are three cops from San Antonio.

522
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,233
Where's Dante?

523
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,708
You're obstructing justice.

524
00:32:56,743 --> 00:33:00,144
One of you's going to jail for this,
and you're not built for it.

525
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,170
But he is.

526
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:08,081
- I swear to God, if I see one more...
- He's at Mission Cross!

527
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,881
One of his girls is having a baby.

528
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,121
He's here for the birth
of his child?

529
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,624
<i>It's his first son.</i>

530
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,356
He kept it secret from everyone
except me he was a dad.

531
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,733
Ursula went into labor
last night.

532
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,734
Of course she did.

533
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,770
I'll let the chief know.

534
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,710
You can let him know after we
bring the suspect into custody.

535
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,283
We earned this, and no one
is beating us to this arrest.

536
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:54,158
- Ursula Hayes. What's her room number?
- Room 607.

537
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,227
Okay, you guys go through here.
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,501
You.

539
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,458
What are you doing?

540
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,332
Dante, put the baby down.

541
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,900
You need to put the baby down
right now and come with us.

542
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,833
Don't give us any trouble.

543
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,805
I won't.
Just give me a minute.

544
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,445
He's my boy.

545
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,018
Hey. It's okay, boy.

546
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,315
- I thought this was all over?
- Yeah, um...

547
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,517
they brought in
a used condom...

548
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,391
<i>- and we have to handle it as evidence.
- A condom?</i>

549
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,122
- She fished it out of the trash
in the back of the store.
- She what?

550
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,200
So how do we get this
cleared up?

551
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,495
We do a D.N.A. test
to rule you out.

552
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,539
<i>- Great.
- We can have the nurse draw
blood within the hour...</i>

553
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,301
- if we get your permission.
- Great.

554
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,709
What if I don't give
my permission?

555
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,920
Well, uh...

556
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,684
with probable cause,
we can get a warrant to draw the blood.

557
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,893
Bruce?

558
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:38,032
<i>What did you do?
Did you...</i>

559
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,404
It wasn't rape.

560
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,406
What do you mean?

561
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:56,451
She came on to me,
and I couldn't, uh, help myself.

562
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:02,360
<i>The next day, um,
they blackmailed me.</i>

563
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:05,921
She and her mom came,
said if I didn't pay 'em $5,000...

564
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,189
they'd go to the head office
and... and report me.

565
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,401
<i>We don't have that kind of money.
I di...</i>

566
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,062
<i>I-I didn't rape her.</i>

567
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,300
It was consensual.
I mean, I-I...

568
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,276
I even walked her
to her car afterwards.

569
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,916
You slept with a child!

570
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,382
Okay. All right.

571
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,116
You will never see
our daughter again!

572
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,192
- Okay.
- Never!

573
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:48,461
<i>Another win for me
right before the final bell.</i>

574
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,402
Maybe I won't need
your help to keep my job.

575
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,008
Listen.

576
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,579
I put in a good word for you.

577
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,117
- Thank you.
- Not because you're my partner.

578
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,290
Because you're a good detective.

579
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,748
And because you don't want to see
the partnership broken up, right?

580
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,754
<i>Come with me, miss.</i>

581
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,201
Yo, wassup?
How do this sound to you?

582
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,276
- Great.
- Great?

583
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,278
Man, she gonna knock
Lauryn Hill on her ass.

584
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,507
Couple of more scores,
bring in some more players...

585
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,148
get on tour,
build up the hype.

586
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,617
But, yo, I got word
on a couple of operations.

587
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,687
Think it might be
our best way back in.

588
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,592
Listen, Kern, uh,
we're not gonna be getting back in.

589
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,729
<i>- What do you mean?
- I lied.</i>

590
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,061
- What?
- I had to.

591
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,830
To get Dante.
It was important.

592
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,208
Lied to me?

593
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,870
<i>Listen, me and my guys aren't
going down that road again.</i>

594
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,278
We're out of the drug trade.

595
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,142
<i>If you're smart,
you'll stay out too.</i>

596
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,648
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
come after you just like anybody else.

597
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,721
Stay out?
I called in my old crew.

598
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,687
I borrowed off
future transactions.

599
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,020
I don't got no more money coming in!

600
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,289
I came here to tell you straight up
what the deal was.

601
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,921
I owed you at least that much.

602
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,828
Man, you owe me
a shitload more than that!

603
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,698
I risked my ass on the line
to get you Frogger! You promised...

604
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,165
Hey, he broke his promise, all right?
So just get over it.

605
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,876
We can let this stand,
get past it.

606
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:35,972
I can make it up to you in some other way or...
you can start something.

607
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,913
<i>- This is wrong, man.
- I know.</i>

608
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:45,681
But you came up from nothing once before.
You can do it again.

609
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,247
- Can you drive it or not?
- Yeah.

610
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,782
Jesus!

611
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,754
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Nothing... I got it. I got it.

612
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,772
<i>- You guys all right?
- Yeah, why?</i>

613
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:38,333
Well, I heard a garbage truck
sideswiped two parked cars.

614
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,507
- You heard about that?
- It was all over the police radio.

615
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,977
- Well, it took a little while
to figure out the controls.
- Jesus, come on!

616
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,479
This is supposed to be
a quiet operation.

617
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,915
We fumble like this during the actual
money train, we'll all end up in jail!

618
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,781
Sorry.

619
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,856
How long do we get to
keep the truck here?

620
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,588
<i>- Property sweeps aren't
for another three weeks.
- Good.</i>

621
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,962
Yeah.

622
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,765
We're really doing this,
aren't we?

623
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,739
Yeah, looks that way.

624
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,153
I want my credit card back.

625
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,860
Somebody canceled it anyway.

626
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,570
You're taking this stuff back.

627
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,404
No. I'm gonna sell it.
I need the money.

628
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,602
You're taking it back.

629
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,443
Take me back.

630
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,932
Keep away from me.

631
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,539
Keep away from my wife.

632
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,077
- I'm leaving.
- Good-bye.

633
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,654
When my report
comes out next week...

634
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,621
it will hit like an earthquake.

635
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,193
- So we'll all be buried in the rubble?
- Not you.

636
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,662
I'm recommending that you be
elevated to captain, take over here...

637
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,233
and run things the way
they should be.

638
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,172
You have integrity.
You tell the truth.

639
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:52,006
The truth is your report
is only gonna cause a few tremors.

640
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,808
<i>You're not the first civilian auditor
this department has had...</i>

641
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,210
<i>and in the end,
cops will protect cops.</i>

642
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,851
Outrage will turn to apathy...

643
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,251
turn to, "Didn't something
happen there once?"

644
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,713
And it all goes back
to the way it was.

645
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,450
Maybe with someone like you in charge,
things might change.

646
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,752
I wouldn't want the job.

647
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,430
One officer saves a kid
from some car jackers.

648
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,938
My team hauls in a guy
the feds have been after for two years.

649
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,074
I really hope you got a plan
to fix things up around here.

650
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,035
<i>I talked to the guy at the desk.
I know you're in here.</i>

651
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,102
<i>Vic!</i>

652
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:11,984
<i>Vic, I know you're in here!</i>

653
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,984
<i>Open the door!
Come on!</i>

654
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,695
You have some stranger come
to the house at night and give me this?

655
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,230
- You're walking out on us?
- I'm not walking out on my kids.

656
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,871
- I'm protecting myself from you.
- From me?

657
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,373
From divorcing me.
From keeping them from me.

658
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:35,012
- You think I'm divorcing you?
- You're seeing a lawyer.

659
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,742
A friend of mine made me talk to him.
It doesn't mean that I'm filing.

660
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,274
Oh, that's bullshit.
You're seeing him again on Tuesday.

661
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,615
Jesus Christ, I have to sign some papers
to get my deposit back.

662
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,454
You said that we were trying to figure
things out. That... That's what you said.

663
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:57,566
You're just buying time...
to spring this on me.

664
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,463
N-No.

665
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,688
Don't touch me!

666
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,963
I can make you miserable too.
