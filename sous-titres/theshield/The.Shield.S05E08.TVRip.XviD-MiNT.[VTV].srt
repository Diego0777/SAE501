1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,767
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:05,234
She fainted. She was
out before she fell.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,434
Vic gave me some cash
in a bag.

4
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,434
How much?

5
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:10,568
$65,000.

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:11,967
I need that money back.

7
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,034
I was talking
to Kavanaugh.

8
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:14,101
He was wearing
a wedding ring.

9
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,167
He's been divorced
about two years.

10
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,434
Heard of a guy
named Antwon Mitchell?

11
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,067
I know Mackey
and his guys

12
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:21,900
have some connection
with Antwon Mitchell.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,067
Her body shows up
with bullets in it.

14
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:30,468
You'll be doing time
for a long, long time.

15
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,034
Waste your time with
these conspiracy theories

16
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,767
and you'll be more lost
than you are now.

17
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,134
About 6 months ago,
we found this kilo.

18
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,234
Pure heroin, in the glove
compartment of your car,

19
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,367
but you never logged it
into evidence.

20
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,934
Why hasn't he arrested
Lem yet?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,700
You think Kavanaugh's going to
try to get Emolia to give you up?

22
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,401
You're not safe.
We got to move you.

23
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:48,600
Why? What happened?

24
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,501
Possible leaks.

25
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,267
You said Vic
wouldn't find out.

26
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,600
Vic, what the hell?

27
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,434
You didn't return
my calls.

28
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,468
Kavanaugh,
what did you tell him?

29
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,967
That I saw your guy
take the heroin.

30
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:02,034
Six months you could
have warned me!

31
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,301
One of my men,
maybe all of us,

32
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,568
are going to jail
because of you.

33
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,733
Without you,
IAD's case goes away.

34
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,134
Jesus, it's you.

35
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,257
Antwon Mitchell.

36
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,757
Well,
you're the right color.

37
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,723
For some reason,
I feel that, uh,

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,524
you're working on the
wrong side, brother.

39
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:29,191
Jon Kavanaugh,
Internal Affairs,

40
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:30,257
Los Angeles.

41
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,524
Really? What part?

42
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:33,624
Lately I've been
based in Farmington.

43
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,324
Don't tell me
you have officers

44
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,491
stealing ghetto kids'
bicycles

45
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,890
and taking their candy.

46
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,491
Come on,
say it ain't so, Joe.

47
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:44,790
You recognize these gentlemen, I know.

48
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,924
I need to know everything
you know about these men.

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,224
You want everything.

50
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,357
I just need something.

51
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:53,291
The pope himself couldn't
get you mercy time

52
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,624
on those
two cop killings.

53
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,024
Let's just say I'm trying
to keep hope alive, then.

54
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,324
I can see what I can do about your
accommodations and privileges here.

55
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,524
I run
this goddamn place.

56
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:07,291
What is it you think
I'm not getting up in here?

57
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:09,057
Pussy?

58
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:11,357
I tore some of that shit up
this morning,

59
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,690
and I'm not talking
about the cellmate kind.

60
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,424
You're obviously
no friend of cops.

61
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,257
Here's your chance
to put four of them

62
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,457
in a dark, dark corner.

63
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:22,457
See, now you're venturing
into an interesting area.

64
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:25,491
But I can't feed my peeps
with no moral victories.

65
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:28,224
How do I know you have
shit on these guys?

66
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,191
Shane vendrell.

67
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:35,558
I could bury this
banjo-playing asshole.

68
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:38,491
Bitch likes to talk...
the walk,

69
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,890
but if you put
a boot on his throat,

70
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:44,291
his eyes tear up

71
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,291
like a little bitch.

72
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:49,857
And bitches, they give up their buddies.

73
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,090
That's what
makes them bitches.

74
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,457
The price is simple.

75
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,057
I help you put away
these four fine young men,

76
00:03:57,124 --> 00:04:02,057
you make sure you put
them away right here.

77
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,424
You want them
to spend their time

78
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,024
here?

79
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,857
That way, every morning

80
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,357
I can see
their smiling faces

81
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,024
when I'm eating
my oatmeal.

82
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,191
So you can kill them.

83
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,990
You got me
all wrong, mister.

84
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,424
Scout's honor.

85
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,658
No deal.

86
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,324
You know my name.

87
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,690
If your brain clears up,

88
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:23,723
give me a collect call.

89
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,823
Sorry you wasted a drive,
Jon.

90
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,723
What was it...
3, 4 hours?

91
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,591
You forget...
time's on my side.

92
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,057
That's where you're wrong.

93
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,191
You see, me...

94
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:39,790
I'm just living
one real long day.

95
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:42,124
You're the one who has the
ticking clock in his ear.

96
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,823
Otherwise,
you wouldn't be here

97
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,324
talking to a man like me.

98
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:53,157
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

99
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:59,857
<i>Handle code 3,
1-Tango-10,</i>

100
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,291
<i>roger that.</i>

101
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:05,524
<i>6-Paul-11 to control, I'm
code 6 at 5029 King Drive.</i>

102
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,224
<i>We're going to need
additional units</i>

103
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,990
<i>for evacuation
and a bomb squad.</i>

104
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,524
<i>You're not going
to believe this,</i>

105
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,658
<i>but someone tossed a bunch of
grenades into a backyard barbecue.</i>

106
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:14,924
<i>Did you say grenades?</i>

107
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,090
<i>Yeah, live grenades.</i>

108
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,823
Hey, what up?

109
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,790
You here
on IAD business,

110
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,424
or you just visiting
the front?

111
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:39,924
Just tell me what happened,
all right?

112
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,658
Backyard barbecue.

113
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:44,857
Somebody tossed 4 or 5
grenades over the fence.

114
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,558
M-26. Vietnam era,
time delay.

115
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:48,624
That one's a dud.

116
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,790
All clear.

117
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,723
Vic, let's go.

118
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,057
Victims?

119
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:05,124
Spookstreet Soldiers.

120
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:07,491
A local black set.

121
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,157
Friends, girlfriends.

122
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,191
Kids.

123
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:11,757
Hey, I, uh...

124
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,723
found this
in the house.

125
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,690
Already cut, bagged, and weighed.

126
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,690
It's a Spookstreet
distribution crib.

127
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:21,424
Gang retaliation?

128
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,491
If Spookstreet was beefing
with someone, we'd have heard of that.

129
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:26,757
Local sets round here don't carry
this kind of heavy artillery.

130
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,491
You might want
to stand back.

131
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:30,491
There's some real police
work going on around here.

132
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,957
Take this around front?

133
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,024
Sure.

134
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:43,890
Kyle, thanks, man.

135
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:45,191
No problem, Jon.

136
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,124
You said you got a call, last week,
from an old salvadorian contact.

137
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,090
Offered you a job
assembling grenades?

138
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:57,024
Last week you said
I was a liar.

139
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,157
You've been feeding me a lot
of bullshit stories lately,

140
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,658
trying to get out of
testifying against Mackey.

141
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,690
Cut this for her.

142
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:10,524
Bunch of grenades
went off today.

143
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,558
Maybe now
you'll listen to me.

144
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,924
I need you to tell me
what's going on.

145
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,823
You want information?

146
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,257
Then promise me
I won't have to testify

147
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,723
against Vic or his guys.

148
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,924
We've been
over this already.

149
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,257
You not testifying
against Mackey,

150
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,723
it's not going
to happen.

151
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,690
You're cutting
the pieces too big.

152
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,857
The only thing
keeping you out of jail

153
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:33,658
and Sebastio out of a
foster home is my good grace.

154
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,424
You tell me what you
know about those grenades

155
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:38,124
or the next person
cutting this food

156
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,291
is going to be
a social worker.

157
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,990
Owner of the Spookstreet
house that got bombed...

158
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,157
name is Latasha Dunn.

159
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:46,424
Son's name
is Marcus Dunn.

160
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,024
Street name's
Mc Dunn-Good.

161
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,357
Dunn-Good's
a Spookstreet lieutenant.

162
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,890
You and Ronnie go
scoop him up. All right.

163
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:53,723
Vic.

164
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,090
My CI has intel.

165
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:57,624
It's the salvadorians.

166
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,723
I think she can help.

167
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,291
Emolia's friend Maria
contacted her last week.

168
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,424
Salvadorians
were looking for girls

169
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,591
to assemble a large
shipment of grenades.

170
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,558
You heard about this
and didn't share it with anyone?

171
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:17,658
We've all seen his nose
for quality intel

172
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,124
is not exactly reliable.

173
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,291
She gave me tips
before.

174
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,391
Most of them
were bogus.

175
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,291
Your main witness against Lem
is unreliable?

176
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:24,957
That's good to know.

177
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,857
All right,
so what now?

178
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,057
My team will set up a meeting
between Emolia and Maria.

179
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,424
We'll work backward
to the grenade tossers.

180
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,457
You're not putting her
in the field.

181
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:33,757
It's too dangerous.

182
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:36,291
She just told us there's
another shipment coming in.

183
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:39,257
You want every night here
to be the 4th of july?

184
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,857
All right.

185
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:44,457
Your team can run
the investigation.

186
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,024
But any decisions
involving Emolia,

187
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,357
I have the final word.

188
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,124
I make all the calls.

189
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,957
Neither Vic nor his team will
have any unsupervised contact

190
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,191
with Emolia.

191
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:57,957
They do anything on the sly
to threaten or coerce her,

192
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,391
I'll pull her immediately.

193
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,291
Either myself
or agent Erwin

194
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:02,591
will be with her
at all times.

195
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,558
All right?

196
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,624
Do it.

197
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,385
KAVANAUGH

198
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,891
Look, we can deal
with other stuff tomorrow.

199
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:32,791
What's important today is that
we track down these grenades.

200
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:37,424
Your safety... that's
my number one priority.

201
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,590
You may have
all worked out a deal,

202
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:40,857
but I haven't.

203
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:42,223
You want my help,

204
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,490
I want to know
what's in it for me?

205
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:45,791
What we talked about.

206
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:47,724
I need $20,000.

207
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,991
For Sebastio
to get help.

208
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,991
Like Vic's kid gets.

209
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,058
Let's talk
about this later.

210
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,824
No... now.

211
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,257
This department's
always looked out for you.

212
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:00,557
You help us crack this,

213
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:03,924
there'll be something
there for you.

214
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,624
Maria says the bosses are
shipping grenades into L.A.

215
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,257
They assemble them here,

216
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,924
otherwise they could
explode during shipping.

217
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,624
They're looking
for cutters,

218
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,323
help put them
back together.

219
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,223
Nimble-fingered girls
they can trust.

220
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,757
Why do the salvadorians
need grenades?

221
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,691
They're making a play
to get back into

222
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,024
the drug protection
business.

223
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,457
The colombians
control the drugs.

224
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:31,657
They use the mexicans
to mule it from Bogota

225
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,590
into the black dealers'
hands in L.A.

226
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,957
The salvadorians
used to protect all of it...

227
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,624
mules, routes,
distribution centers...

228
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:40,624
until we busted a
general Bonilla last year.

229
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,824
Crippled their
L.A. power base.

230
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:43,957
Colombians exporting blow
figured

231
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,891
if the salvadorians
couldn't protect themselves,

232
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,290
why pay them
to protect their product?

233
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,891
So they're finding a way
back into the business.

234
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,657
Extortion.

235
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,124
Right.

236
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,190
Hope it's not too late
for you to get that job.

237
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,124
No.

238
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,590
But I need
to call Maria.

239
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:07,190
Let's set up a meeting.

240
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,891
Lieutenant.

241
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,857
How's your partner?

242
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,190
Getting better.

243
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:18,624
Getting back soon.

244
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,091
Glad to hear it.

245
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:28,390
You, uh, finding anything
on the strike team?

246
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:31,557
Their investigation's
on-going.

247
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,824
You checking into
their finances?

248
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:34,824
Their money?

249
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,991
If you're not looking,
you should be.

250
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,390
What will I find?

251
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,724
Not here. Later.

252
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,624
And don't talk to me out there
like we're friendly.

253
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,058
Kyle, what's...

254
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:00,991
<i>What's going on?
Why's Emolia moving?</i>

255
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,691
Emolia's contact made
a last-minute change,

256
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,724
moved the meeting.

257
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,724
Ok, follow her.

258
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,757
Mackey disagrees.

259
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:09,757
<i>Thinks the contact might
have eyes out for a tail.</i>

260
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,124
Think I care
what he thinks.

261
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,223
She's wired up. She's got
GPS tracking on her cell.

262
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,924
She's got eyes and ears
<i>on her at all times.</i>

263
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:21,724
I never authorized
the use of a wire.

264
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,891
I know how much
you love them.

265
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,058
Figured I'd try one
for a change.

266
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,190
Give them
a 5-minute head start.

267
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:28,590
<i>Then we follow.</i>

268
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,657
Oh, great.
Kavanaugh's coming.

269
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,657
Nothing like a large
black man wearing a suit

270
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,924
jumping in your van
to maintain your cover.

271
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,024
Is she ok?

272
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:53,891
No reason why
she wouldn't be.

273
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,190
<i>This the place
we do the work?</i>

274
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,357
<i>Not yet.</i>

275
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,290
<i>There's someone who
needs to meet you first.</i>

276
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,924
Tejado runs security,

277
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,991
Guardo is in charge.

278
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:05,424
Come on.

279
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,223
Guardo...

280
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,691
Ready?

281
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:15,757
<i>Hmm, venga abentro chiquita.
Dejame verte. ¿Eres buena o mala?</i>

282
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,857
I don't use.

283
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,490
I check
every girl I hire.

284
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:26,091
This isn't the same
as H-cutting.

285
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,657
<i>You need cojones,
quick fingers.</i>

286
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:32,757
<i>One mistake,
your face is blown off.</i>

287
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,190
First, you reset
the striker.

288
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:35,724
Then the fuse head.

289
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,058
Attach this spoon.

290
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,657
He's assembling
a live one.

291
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,590
<i>Put the striker
in place,</i>

292
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:43,824
<i>inserting
the safety pin.</i>

293
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,824
Once you remove the pin

294
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,824
and the handle's released,

295
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:52,257
you have 5 seconds to put
the spoon and the pin back

296
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:54,323
before it explodes.

297
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,824
There's a live
grenade in there?

298
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,524
Catch.

299
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,624
Jon, it's ok.

300
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,124
He's bluffing.

301
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,357
That grenade wasn't armed.

302
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,657
<i>You never lost your nerve.</i>

303
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:29,924
Tejado will call you
with instructions.

304
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:32,058
Let you know when and
where to start working.

305
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:34,991
Come on. Let's go.

306
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:36,357
How did you know
he was bluffing?

307
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:38,024
Because once
you've pulled the pin,

308
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,691
there's no turning back.

309
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:41,323
He knew it wasn't live.

310
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,357
Let's move,
make the bust.

311
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,757
It's too early,
we bust them now,

312
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,590
we only got a couple of
players off the street.

313
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,757
There'll still be
grenades out there.

314
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,791
We squeeze Tejado
and Guardo

315
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,257
and then
they give it up.

316
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,490
Fresh off the boat,
salvadorians rarely rat.

317
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,190
They'll take a needle
before they talk to cops.

318
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:57,624
We follow Guardo.

319
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,724
Let him lead us
to the grenades.

320
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,290
They must be parked
out back.

321
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,657
Hey, hey...
Emolia's still up there.

322
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,058
If I don't move now,
I'll lose them.

323
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:07,257
Let's go.

324
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,691
We're not leaving
Emolia here.

325
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:09,857
All right, all right.

326
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,490
Make sure Emolia's
all right.

327
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,891
We'll find Guardo
on the street.

328
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,490
Vic, how'd it go?

329
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:20,624
They bought her cover.

330
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:24,924
You'll talk to police.
Wait up in observation.

331
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,957
Marcus Dunn,
aka Mc Dunn-Good.

332
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,857
His mother's house
was hit this morning.

333
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,557
Found a drug store
in his bedroom closet.

334
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:34,190
Hit the street. Find out
what you can about Guardo.

335
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:36,657
We'll take
Mc Dumbshit upstairs

336
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,290
and have a little chat.

337
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:39,557
Let's go.

338
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,857
Lieutenant, you got
a telephone call.

339
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,223
Take a message
for me, please.

340
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,857
They said it's urgent.

341
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,058
Who said?

342
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,691
Says her name's Sadie.

343
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,058
Excuse me.

344
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:03,757
Sadie?

345
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:06,824
Detective, I need you
to give me a ride

346
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,390
to the 300 block
of Forestry Street.

347
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:11,457
What's there?

348
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,824
Crime scene.
You'll be the primary.

349
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,524
I've got work, and you don't
hand out my assignments.

350
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,891
Do I have to remind you
how many rungs

351
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,323
detective falls
before lieutenant

352
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,524
on the department ladder?

353
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,924
You get your ass
out of that chair

354
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:24,091
and you meet me
in the motor pool

355
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:26,091
before I open an
insubordination file on you

356
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,757
and put your picture
up on my wall.

357
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,624
Come on!

358
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:42,657
I was only making sure

359
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,957
I wasn't too friendly to you
on the floor.

360
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,024
Come on, man.

361
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,424
I was just maintaining
your cop cred

362
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,223
with the other IAD haters.

363
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,058
You should be thanking me.

364
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:55,290
Next time I'd prefer
the silent treatment.

365
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:02,091
So...
Mackey's finances.

366
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:05,424
Ever hear of
an armenian money train?

367
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,058
It's a money laundering
operation

368
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,457
in the armenian mob.

369
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:11,557
I think the strike team
ripped them off.

370
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,024
Dangerous enemies to make.

371
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,091
Not if you
get away with it.

372
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,557
I think we're talking about
a lot of money.

373
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:20,757
Mackey gave his ex
65 grand in cash

374
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:21,957
they can't account for.

375
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,223
Corrine had nothing to do
with anything illegal.

376
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,957
This is all Vic.

377
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,891
Can I take a look
at your notes?

378
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,524
Sure.

379
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,290
Thanks.

380
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,524
So, what's this case?

381
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,190
I got a call
from my ex... Sadie.

382
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:44,490
She was just raped.

383
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:57,357
Breathe normally.

384
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,691
Jon...

385
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,124
Are you all right?

386
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,390
I don't know.

387
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:10,058
She was attacked.

388
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,190
Got out of the car, dragged to
the other side of the vehicle,

389
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,058
out of sight
of anyone passing by.

390
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:16,490
And no witnesses,
either.

391
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:17,824
We need to get her
to a hospital.

392
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,024
Right away.

393
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:20,824
I socked him.

394
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,457
I socked him
in the middle.

395
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,424
I fought back
like you taught me.

396
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,590
I hit him...
and I hit him...

397
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:30,590
and I hit him until he
got off me, and he ran.

398
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,557
I refused to be...

399
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,424
a victim... I know.

400
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,424
That's good.

401
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,624
This is detective Wagenbach.

402
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,257
He's going to be handling
this investigation, ok?

403
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,991
We'll take good care
of you, ma'am.

404
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:47,091
Did you get a good look
at your attacker?

405
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,691
Mexican.

406
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:52,158
Mid-30s,

407
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,857
dark eyes.

408
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,257
And a mole...
right here.

409
00:18:57,323 --> 00:19:00,457
I took a picture of him
in my head

410
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:02,724
when I was fighting him.

411
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,557
I know, I know.
You did great.

412
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,290
You did great.

413
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,024
These officers here are going
to take you to the hospital,

414
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,590
and they're going
to do some tests

415
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:17,691
to preserve evidence,
ok?

416
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:22,924
You're going
to be with me, right?

417
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,590
I'm going to ride with you
to the hospital,

418
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:27,957
then I got to check
on a few things.

419
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,824
Stay with me.

420
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:33,891
You need privacy.
You do.

421
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,490
Don't leave me.

422
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,357
Jon...

423
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:43,024
I'm going to be right back
after the tests are done, ok?

424
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,557
Ok?

425
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:47,390
You let me
take care of everything.

426
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,857
Look, we can
sit here all day, Marcus,

427
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,590
but that's not going
to change the fact

428
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:54,857
that you got
a big problem.

429
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,691
Yeah, I know.

430
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,158
The salvadorians
want back in

431
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,524
on the drug
protection business.

432
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,657
<i>Now tell me some shit
I don't know.</i>

433
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:04,190
<i>Spookstreet's just
gonna sit on their hands</i>

434
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:05,590
<i>while they blow up
all your drug cribs?</i>

435
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:06,891
It's time
to make peace.

436
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,724
I told you,
the bosses in Bogota

437
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,124
ain't going
to go for that.

438
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,857
The bosses aren't having
grenades shoved up their asses.

439
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:15,490
Colombians control the
product. They make the rules.

440
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,024
<i>Ain't shit I can do
about that.</i>

441
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,024
<i>Give me the address</i>
of the other drug cribs

442
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,091
so I can stop them
myself.

443
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,691
Right. How stupid do y'all think I am?

444
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,590
<i>Don't ask a question</i>
you don't want the answer to.

445
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:30,223
Y'all can keep sending
in the clowns all day,

446
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,791
it won't change shit.

447
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,691
Only one player in this room
has got any juice.

448
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:35,991
Hmmph.

449
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,457
How'd you get caught
this time, son?

450
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:39,924
It really matter?

451
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,891
Internal Affairs. It does
if I believe you.

452
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:45,390
You the one and only man.

453
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,390
Prove it.

454
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,190
District attorney
Eric Zuckerman.

455
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,457
<i>Hello?</i>

456
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:56,424
Eric, Jon Kavanaugh.

457
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,924
<i>What's up, Johnny?</i>

458
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,424
You hear about that house on
Farmington got hit by grenades?

459
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,390
<i>Yeah, that's pretty
freaky shit, man.</i>

460
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,924
Looks like salvadorian bangers
are planning to hit more.

461
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:07,290
<i>That's not good.</i>

462
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,457
I got a perp looking at a
possession with intent rap

463
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:12,991
willing to trade us
addresses and targets.

464
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:14,590
You let him skate
with just possession?

465
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,024
<i>Write it up.
Send it to my office.</i>

466
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,657
- Do you need any more?
- <i>I trust you.</i>

467
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:18,757
I'll talk to you later.

468
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:19,924
<i>I'll be here, Johnny.</i>

469
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,657
My nigga.

470
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:22,857
Give up the addresses.

471
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,524
Those cribs get busted
off my tip,

472
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,124
you might as well
stick a needle in me.

473
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,323
We'll give you half-hour
to call your homies,

474
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,457
get the merchandise out
before the cavalry arrives.

475
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,190
I use your phone?

476
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,200
Lieutenant.

477
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,134
Mrs. Mackey?

478
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,833
Jon, I helped Sadie
take a rape kit.

479
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,867
And?

480
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,034
Minor tearing and trauma.

481
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Skin under her fingernails?

482
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:55,967
No, she said she punched
and didn't scratch.

483
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:57,301
DNA?

484
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,401
She fought him off
pretty quickly.

485
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,634
It's almost like...

486
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,734
Isn't a rape because it
didn't last that long?

487
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,534
No, this guy got
more than he bargained for.

488
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:05,900
She's a fighter.

489
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,134
Is she ok to come down
to the barn?

490
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,167
I'll have to ask
her doctor,

491
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,334
but I think so.

492
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:12,833
That way.

493
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,768
No, he had a mole
right here on his cheek.

494
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,200
You're doing good.

495
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,134
Just keep looking.

496
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,501
Yeah, don't worry.
Take your time.

497
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:26,833
Keep looking.

498
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,768
Hi.

499
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,933
Hi.
How's it going?

500
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,367
We've been showing her
sexual assault regulars.

501
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,301
Nothing yet.

502
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,267
Can you excuse me
a second?

503
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,734
Just a second.

504
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm trying.

505
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,534
You know what?

506
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:46,634
I'm going to get you
some clean clothes,

507
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,200
and I'm going to take you
to where I work, ok?

508
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:55,900
To get, you know...
cleaned up and everything.

509
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,567
Sadie, you know
I'm here for you, right?

510
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,034
Where's Emolia?

511
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,267
Inside.

512
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,768
There you are.

513
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,034
Why'd you
bring her here?

514
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,768
Uniforms pulled over a
salvadorian a block away

515
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,267
who fit Guardo's description.

516
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,900
Mackey wanted her here
to make a quick I.D.

517
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,034
She could have been
compromised!

518
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,367
You were off the grid, so
I made a command decision.

519
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:27,401
To get her killed?

520
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,267
That'd be great for you, wouldn't it?

521
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,634
You with her
every second?

522
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,567
Yeah.

523
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,634
He didn't try
to talk to her?

524
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:33,634
No.

525
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:36,301
So, what happened?

526
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:40,134
Four grenades were thrown through
four windows simultaneously.

527
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,067
The house was hit
on all sides.

528
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:44,967
A gas pipe exploded
in the kitchen.

529
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,267
Whoever tossed them
wanted to make sure

530
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,668
no one made it out
alive.

531
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,501
This isn't an address
Marcus Dunn gave us.

532
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,567
No, it isn't.

533
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:52,867
George and Maddie Jackson.

534
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,134
Retired school teachers.

535
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,134
So, it's not a Spookstreet drug crib.

536
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Only drug we found
was metamucil.

537
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,301
Must have been napping when
the grenades came knocking.

538
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:06,067
So it looks like
killers went by a list?

539
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:09,034
An old list. We busted
this place last year.

540
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,134
Spookstreeter named Gat
used to bunk here

541
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,734
until Rawlings seized
and put her up for auction.

542
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,067
The salvadorians were protecting
Spookstreet product last year.

543
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:18,668
They'd know this place.

544
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,501
This is
an old drug crib.

545
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,267
Last year's.

546
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:26,334
Yeah. Salvadorians are
working on an out-of-date list.

547
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,434
How old a list
we talking about?

548
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,634
About a year.

549
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:33,634
Maybe two.

550
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,634
Make out as many
as you can remember.

551
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,800
I ain't got
a memory for this.

552
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,501
You can take him.

553
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,601
Sadie id'd a suspect out of
a mug book... Emmanuel Olivo.

554
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,234
Got him
in interrogation.

555
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,234
You seem to be unclear
on the concept

556
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,900
of parole, Emmanuel.

557
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,301
We give you
an early chance at freedom,

558
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,668
you return the favor
by not raping anyone.

559
00:24:58,734 --> 00:24:59,734
Who's he?

560
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,100
Where were you
this morning at 10:00?

561
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,100
Filling out
job applications.

562
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,134
Where?

563
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,634
All around.
It's not that easy.

564
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,000
Got to report my status.

565
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:09,100
As a registered
sex offender.

566
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,833
Sure you didn't take a
break between references

567
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,467
to rape a woman
in a parking lot

568
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:13,668
off Forestry Street...

569
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,100
Hell, no.

570
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,933
Remember where you filled out
those applications?

571
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,100
Not the names.

572
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,800
It would help you
with an alibi.

573
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,401
Yeah, but I don't got it.

574
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,833
He's lying.
Can't you see that?

575
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, but a couple things
bother me.

576
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,134
His previous sexual assaults
were against teenage girls,

577
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,534
not adult women.

578
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:32,634
That we know about.

579
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:36,967
Also, Sadie referenced
a mole a couple times.

580
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:38,601
Olivo doesn't have one.

581
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,000
He's one detail off.

582
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,800
You'll put him in front
of Sadie to make sure?

583
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:45,900
Yeah, I already
brought her down here.

584
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,768
Listen, about Sadie...

585
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,200
You ready, Vic?

586
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:55,401
What the... Shit!

587
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,334
Sadie,
I'll be right back.

588
00:25:58,401 --> 00:25:59,567
Get her started,
all right?

589
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:01,301
Hey, hey!

590
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,567
Hey!

591
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,867
Hey! Hey! Hey!

592
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,234
Where are you going?

593
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,067
Emolia's contact
just called us.

594
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,000
They're assembling grenades
above a furniture store.

595
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,301
I used to cut H there.

596
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,634
They want me right away.

597
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:15,100
We'll drop her off, let
Guardo make the pickup,

598
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,634
then we'll sweep in
and bust this crew.

599
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,768
The list of Spookstreet
drug cribs

600
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,833
Marcus Dunn gave us...

601
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
You got that done
already?

602
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,034
Billings
is sending units

603
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,833
to clear out the tenants
that live there

604
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,000
and post cops
in front of each one.

605
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:31,634
Guardo won't be making
that pickup for hours.

606
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,200
Make sure Emolia
gets in safely.

607
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,234
And give me a call
if anything changes.

608
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:37,301
Yes, sir.

609
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:40,467
Someplace important
you need to be?

610
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:51,234
How are we doing?

611
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,734
Better.

612
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,267
Sadie positively identified
Emmanuel Olivo

613
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,267
as her attacker.

614
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:59,601
I'm proud of you.

615
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,634
You're so strong.

616
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,567
Can I, uh...

617
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:06,434
Yeah, excuse me.

618
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:12,734
Come home tonight.

619
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,833
No.

620
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,000
It's time to come home.

621
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,768
Our bed misses you.

622
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,567
Let me take care of you,
all right?

623
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,701
You got to stop
wearing that.

624
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,200
It doesn't feel
right.

625
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,867
Sadie...

626
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:31,434
Sadie.

627
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,668
Come home.

628
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,567
Don't keep asking.

629
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:41,234
'Cause at some point, I'm
going to say yes, and...

630
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:43,800
you know what kind of
trouble we'll be in.

631
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:47,067
Lieutenant?

632
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:48,467
Lieutenant?

633
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,601
Lieutenant Kavanaugh?

634
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,200
Excuse me for a second.

635
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,267
Can you give me
a minute?

636
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:01,900
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,067
Is she ok?

638
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

639
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,933
She's great.

640
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,034
Thank you.

641
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,301
Really.

642
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,067
I appreciate you
closing this up for me.

643
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:13,634
Um...

644
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:15,367
You don't know
how much I appreciate this.

645
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,501
It's not really closed.

646
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:22,567
Why didn't you tell me Sadie
has a history of mental illness?

647
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,367
You've been digging up
dirt on her?

648
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,933
Ok, ok. I've been investigating
the claims of a witness.

649
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,034
A victim!

650
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,900
A victim...
right, right.

651
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,601
But we have
no physical evidence.

652
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:39,833
Because she fought him off.

653
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,933
Ok, ok.

654
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,734
Right...
and we are...

655
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,501
we are all grateful
for that.

656
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,367
But it presents problems
if the case goes to trial.

657
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:50,833
You see?

658
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,000
She's our sole witness and she's
got a history of mental illness.

659
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,134
It's all in the past.

660
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,634
Ok.

661
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:02,234
How bad was it?

662
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,933
Years ago.
Had a rough patch.

663
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,701
She, uh...

664
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:10,134
Paranoia, psychosis.
Depression.

665
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,967
We're talking depression.

666
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:14,401
Dementia? Difficulty
understanding reality?

667
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,334
She always knew
who she was and where she was.

668
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,367
She just...

669
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,534
She just became...
different.

670
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,234
And now?

671
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:26,501
We got divorced
and she found some doctors,

672
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:27,367
they treated her.

673
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,200
She's fine.
She's back.

674
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:31,434
She's reliable?

675
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,067
Yes.
That's what I'm told.

676
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:34,167
She saw him?

677
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,334
Yes.

678
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,634
We don't have any
corroborating evidence.

679
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,867
Then why don't you get back
to the goddamn crime scene

680
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,100
with some extra hands

681
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,100
and find the evidence
that you require

682
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:46,867
to put the man that
raped my wife behind bars?

683
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:55,901
I have to stay?

684
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,167
Just a little longer.

685
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:01,968
Go upstairs. There's a
couch where you can lie down.

686
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,534
Go upstairs and lie down,
all right?

687
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,133
First door on your left.

688
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,834
I'll check on you
in a minute.

689
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,868
I'll be there
in a minute, ok?

690
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,267
Mrs. Mackey?

691
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:21,200
How is she?

692
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:22,334
She's fine.

693
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,734
Good. This is my attorney Sydney Driber.

694
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,467
Lieutenant Kavanaugh.

695
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:32,234
I made a promise to return
it, and it's all there.

696
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,234
File this into evidence
for me, please.

697
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,601
My client wishes to cooperate
fully with the investigation.

698
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,067
She never engaged
in criminal behavior.

699
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,601
She seeks immunity
against any prosecution

700
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,367
in exchange for what she knows
about her ex-husband's past.

701
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:49,100
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

702
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,133
Yes, yes.

703
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,133
Assuming an arrangement
can be made.

704
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:58,601
Did detective Wagenbach
arrange or suggest for you

705
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,534
to be the attending nurse
for Sadie tonight?

706
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:05,868
Either you're telling
the truth or you're not.

707
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,133
He suggested it. Ok?

708
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,133
He said if I helped her, it
might earn goodwill with you.

709
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,167
There is
nothing illegal

710
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,167
about
a registered nurse

711
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,067
caring
for a patient.

712
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,834
No. It's wrong.

713
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:19,334
Dutch didn't do
anything wrong.

714
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,534
He was trying
to help me out.

715
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:24,033
I don't have time
to discuss any deal,

716
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,267
even if I was
amenable to one,

717
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,634
which I will have to take
under consideration.

718
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:30,567
But I do thank you for
bringing in the money.

719
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:32,934
Kavanaugh. Yeah.

720
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,334
Guardo showed up early.

721
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,601
He's moving the girls
and the grenades.

722
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:36,868
<i>Where's Emolia now?</i>

723
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:38,767
<i>Tracking her GPS.
We're all over her.</i>

724
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,100
I want her
out of there.

725
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,467
Turned west on Stanley.
They're stopping.

726
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,400
We bust them now,

727
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,801
they'll tip
the other location.

728
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:46,234
This is a black hole
we're sending her into.

729
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,467
We know nothing!

730
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:49,400
<i>Emolia knows how
to take care of herself.</i>

731
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,434
She fooled me
for 6 months.

732
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,400
<i>Are you trying</i>
to get her killed? Huh?

733
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:57,868
Great. Glad we're
on the same page.

734
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:03,901
We might have to move in
quick and quiet.

735
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:06,067
Everyone turn off
their cell phones.

736
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,601
Where's S.W.A.T.?

737
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,467
You said S.W.A.T.
Was going to be here.

738
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,100
Should be here
any minute.

739
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,033
They got MP-5s.
At least two dozen.

740
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Looks like they're planning
to set up shop permanently.

741
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,334
It's a goddamn armory
in there.

742
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
How long before back-up
and S.W.A.T. arrive?

743
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,200
10, 15 minutes tops.

744
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:45,434
<i>Guardo,
we're short a grenade.</i>

745
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,968
<i>Are you sure?</i>

746
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:47,968
I counted twice.

747
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,367
Stop... stop!

748
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,767
Search her.

749
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:17,200
Guardo.

750
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,534
I only was going
to sell it for money.

751
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,934
There's so many,
I didn't think you'd care.

752
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:35,634
What's going on?

753
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,467
It's hard to tell.

754
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:39,234
<i>Check the others.</i>

755
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,534
They're going
to find the wire.

756
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,801
Go, go! Get out.

757
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,968
This one's
wearing a wire.

758
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:49,968
You told me
I could trust...

759
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,067
Help me!

760
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:20,767
Grenade!

761
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:30,701
Where do you think
you're going?

762
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,100
Ok?

763
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,467
Yeah,
we're all clear.

764
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,501
Clear.

765
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:36,901
Clear!

766
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:40,534
Clear!

767
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:45,968
Emolia!

768
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:46,968
Clear!

769
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,234
Kyle, where is she?

770
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,834
I don't see her.

771
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:56,133
Emolia!

772
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,701
Mackey!

773
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,734
Emolia!

774
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,667
What did you just
say to her?

775
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,334
I just told her what a good job she did.

776
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,167
What is she doing
back here?

777
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,067
I was getting her
out of harm's way.

778
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,133
Hey, Guardo's gone.

779
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:26,267
Grab Lem and Ronnie
and set up a perimeter.

780
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,901
Let's scoop him up.

781
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,467
There's no sign
of Guardo anywhere?

782
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:34,767
My guys
will squeeze his soldiers,

783
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,734
find out
where he likes to hide.

784
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,968
Captain, somebody ripped off
the vending machines again.

785
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:43,400
Goddamn it. These things
cost a fortune to fix.

786
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,501
Jon.

787
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,634
One of these guys
gets away with murder,

788
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:48,734
and the captain's
more concerned

789
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:51,334
with the sandwich machine.

790
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,133
Pick up her son
and her mother.

791
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Don't let anyone know
where she is.

792
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,934
Anyone.

793
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,601
Ok.

794
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,634
Same ol' shit.

795
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,801
Obviously you have
some good cop in you.

796
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:25,000
You got me out, man.

797
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:28,334
Let me return
the favor to you.

798
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,601
Quit chasing me and Vic.
Let us do our jobs.

799
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,467
Do you really want
to go to jail for that guy?

800
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,567
Do you think that he would
have picked up that grenade

801
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:37,801
and saved me?

802
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,100
And save you?

803
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,100
Look,
Vic is a great cop.

804
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,534
He's a great cop,
all right?

805
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,200
A real cop
would see that.

806
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:45,133
Hear me out, please.

807
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I've giving you
one last chance.

808
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,100
Give me Vic.

809
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,167
Don't throw
your life away for...

810
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,267
What's going on here?

811
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:54,567
This guy
won't back off, man.

812
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:57,567
He's threatening
to send me to jail.

813
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,634
This man saves your life,

814
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:03,033
and you show him
your gratitude

815
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,534
by offering him
jail time?

816
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:07,367
It's not wonder
you're IAD's MVP.

817
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:23,133
10 square blocks around
Sadie's crime scene

818
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,934
are plastered with
flyers like that one,

819
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,801
warning the community about a
registered sex crime offender

820
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:29,801
in their neighborhood.

821
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,067
Note the mole
on his cheek.

822
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,968
At least, it appears to
be a mole at first glance.

823
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,968
It's really an ink stain.

824
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,400
It's on all the flyers.

825
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:39,667
She id'd him off that,
not because he attacked her.

826
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:42,567
She works in the neighborhood,
probably saw the flyer.

827
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:44,334
When he raped her,
the memory came back.

828
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,334
This doesn't change
what happened.

829
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,033
I went back to Olivo, told him
about the rape hanging over his head,

830
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,234
and he came clean.

831
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,701
He wasn't filling out
job applications,

832
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,100
he was at
a local high school

833
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,567
watching the girls' cross
country team run laps.

834
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:58,634
He didn't tell us before
because it violates his parole.

835
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:01,100
Of course he admits to that
before admitting to rape.

836
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:04,100
Coach saw him
hanging around.

837
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:14,000
We found this bottle
in the nearest trash can

838
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,300
near Sadie's parking lot.

839
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:19,467
There's vaginal residue,
pubic hair,

840
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:22,000
all over the mouth
and outside the bottle.

841
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe it was used
in the attack,

842
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,667
but she never
mentioned it,

843
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,634
and she's pointing a finger
at a perverted,

844
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,834
but innocent guy.

845
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:37,100
Where is she?

846
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,601
Wonder what
that's all about?

847
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:47,767
I don't know.

848
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:48,900
Whoever the woman is,

849
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,234
she's got him
pretty shook up.

850
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:03,800
How long
until I can leave?

851
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:06,467
Not long.

852
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,800
I'm meeting someone tonight.

853
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:11,467
How you feeling,
Sadie?

854
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:12,634
You ok?

855
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,100
Yeah,
I've been good.

856
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,167
Been real good.

857
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:21,067
I made a life
for myself.

858
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:23,467
I know you didn't think
I could do that on my own.

859
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,100
The medication
has helped.

860
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,601
Same dosages?

861
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:27,634
Jon...

862
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
Just want to know

863
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,601
which Sadie
I'm talking to right now.

864
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,034
Ask me to come back again.

865
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,167
I'm asking you
for the truth, Sadie.

866
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,934
<i>The truth is,</i>

867
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,167
<i>you've lost some weight.</i>

868
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,434
<i>Haven't you?</i>

869
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,000
Why doesn't it
look healthy though, Jon?

870
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:54,000
What's going on with you?

871
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:58,434
You been missing me?

872
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:00,234
Ex-wife.

873
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:02,267
But he keeps wearing
the wedding ring.

874
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,167
Sometimes you just got
to let the pussy go.

875
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:10,000
<i>I just wanted the truth</i>
about this morning.

876
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:12,067
About the rape.

877
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:14,234
I want you to kill him
for doing it.

878
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:16,568
Kill what?
The soda bottle?

879
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:22,134
I just want to come home...
Jon.

880
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:25,733
I said yes, I am ready to
come home to our bed now.

881
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,967
I am.

882
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:32,967
Please, just ask.

883
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,767
You're going
to be charged

884
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,034
for filing
a false police report.

885
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,134
And you're going to be
remanded for psychiatric care.

886
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:44,800
That's what
I have to do.

887
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:47,167
I-I-I'm not sick

888
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,000
like I used to be.

889
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,367
<i>I've been taking
my medication.</i>

890
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,134
<i>Now I'm fine.</i>

891
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,634
<i>You took a soda bottle</i>

892
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,634
and you shoved it
up your...

893
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,067
But I knew...
I knew what I was doing.

894
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,601
Listen...
it was wrong.

895
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,568
But I knew...

896
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,367
I wasn't confused.

897
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:13,367
I just didn't know
how else to talk to you.

898
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,100
Pick up
the damn phone.

899
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,634
You just call me
on the phone.

900
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,367
But I wanted you
to be able to save me.

901
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,501
See, I did it
because I knew...

902
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:28,100
you wanted to save me.

903
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:33,434
Jon...
d-d-deserve me again.

904
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:35,833
Because I want
to come home now, Jon.

905
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,967
I'm ready
to come home now.

906
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:42,234
So, just...

907
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,900
Oh, God,
just ask me already.

908
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:48,134
Come on.

909
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:22,401
You're going
to be charged...

910
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,800
for filing
a false police report.

911
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:30,568
You're going to be remanded
for psychiatric care.

912
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,301
<i>No... that detective...</i>

913
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,534
he's done everything
you've asked him to do,

914
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:41,034
so just tell him
that it is a mistake.

915
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,201
I can't.

916
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,301
Yeah, you can.

917
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,367
I won't.

918
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:47,700
You going to abandon me
again, Jon?

919
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,167
No.

920
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,733
Like the last time...

921
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,034
you're going to leave me alone again.

922
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,334
I'm going to help you.

923
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,267
Take me home.

924
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,668
I can't.

925
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,167
There are rules.

926
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:01,267
Then break one.

927
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:04,467
What I do is stop cops
from breaking the rules.

928
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:06,534
I can't stop them
if I can't stop myself.

929
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:09,134
Then try bending one
just once.

930
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm an Internal Affairs
lieutenant.

931
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,000
That's who I am.

932
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:15,034
And I am
your goddamn wife.

933
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,534
And when I got sick
you left me alone, Jon!

934
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,568
You shit all over me!

935
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,934
And the rest of the world
shit all over me!

936
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,301
I couldn't
take care of you.

937
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,067
You tell the truth!

938
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:32,733
You didn't want to!

939
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I was tired.

940
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:39,601
Of taking care
of your wife.

941
00:43:39,668 --> 00:43:41,067
So you left.

942
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:43,067
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,501
You can shove sorry

944
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:47,334
right up there
with the pop bottle.

945
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:48,301
Don't say that, ok?

946
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:51,167
I wasn't worth
taking care of,

947
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,100
and now
I'm not worth shit!

948
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:56,201
No! I want to go home!

949
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,900
I want to go home...

950
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:02,267
Jon... please.

951
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:03,401
Please...

952
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,034
Holy shit.

953
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,668
At least we found
his weak spot.

954
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,867
<i>I...</i>

955
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,700
<i>want to go home...</i>

956
00:44:21,301 --> 00:44:24,767
Everyone sees what I am.

957
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:29,733
Everyone sees me...

958
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,267
They all see me.

959
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,334
Oh, Jon!

960
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,934
Shit, go!

961
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,334
Don't leave me!

962
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:44,234
Hey! Hey...

963
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:53,967
You!

964
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,301
You're under arrest...

965
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:59,367
for possession of heroin
with intent to distribute.

966
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:01,234
You're going
to arrest me today?

967
00:45:01,301 --> 00:45:02,201
Give me your badge
and your gun.

968
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,367
You're kidding me.

969
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,934
Give me your badge
and your gun.

970
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,668
No.
Get off me, man.

971
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:08,934
Get your hands
off him!

972
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,034
Don't talk to me!

973
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,201
You're going to jail!

974
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:15,467
Hey, Curtis!
Don't be stupid, Curtis!

975
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:16,668
Give me your badge
and your gun!

976
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:21,568
Captain Billings, you
take his badge and his gun

977
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:22,867
now!

978
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:25,501
Now.

979
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,501
Sorry, man.

980
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,134
Officers,
arrest that man.

981
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,434
You arrest him
or lose your jobs.

982
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,867
Let's go...

983
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:13,234
let's go, let's go!

984
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:19,934
Get him printed.

985
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,867
We're out of ink.

986
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:23,800
You stick him in the cage
until you're ready.

987
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:26,668
He's a cop.
You don't put him in there.

988
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,000
Clean out
one of the other cages.

989
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:30,034
Go in there,
right now!

990
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,334
Let's go!

991
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:35,234
Officer, come over here,
uncuff him,

992
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,134
stick him in the cage.

993
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:40,134
Let's go!

994
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,767
Yeah, come on
and have a seat.

995
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:23,568
Here you go, Mitchell.
Inside.

996
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:30,367
You woke me up
out of my beauty sleep, man.

997
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,668
I can see that.

998
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,467
I need a second
with him.

999
00:47:39,434 --> 00:47:42,134
I need you
to tell me everything.

1000
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:44,634
Everything
that you know

1001
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,267
about Mackey
and his strike team.

1002
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:48,301
Like I told you before,

1003
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:51,401
no deal, no info.

1004
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:53,467
Get me back to my cell.

1005
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:55,634
You got your deal.

1006
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:02,167
As long as you give me
what I need to know.
