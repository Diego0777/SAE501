And he's a coward
for not coming himself.

- Shit.
<i>- [Julien] No.</i>

167
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:21,011
<i>There's a rattrap in one of the stalls.</i>
<i>I was real careful not to disturb the crime scene.</i>

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,453
Good thinking. You wanna get that on ice.
Send it with him to the hospital.

<i>get him stabilized. We need to move.</i>

Let's get a canvass going.

171
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,492
The same M.O. As that attack
a couple of weeks ago.

172
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,566
Suspect was male,
Caucasian, 30s.

173
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,567
Well, let's not rule
anyone out yet.

174

176
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,503
This is a lot more gothic than
the last glory hole attack.

177
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,636
- Did you, uh, talk to the hospital?
- The victim's still unconscious.

178
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,308
He sustained a head injury when he passed out.
He's in pretty rough shape.

179
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,647
So we have no way
of knowing if and when...

180
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,017
- he'll be able to communicate.
<i>- Canvass turn up anything?</i>

181
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,751
- Nothing so far.
<i>- So we got dick. Which is more</i>
<i>than I can say for the victim.</i>

182
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,724

184
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,591
Uh, we need to reinterview the victim
in the first glory hole attack.

185
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,432
- What was his name?
- He gave us everything that he had.

186
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,507
- He never talked to a detective.
- It's Alarico Trujillo.

187
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,237
- I'll write his address down.
- This Trujillo guy, he's married, kids.

188
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,714
I told him I'd keep his name out of it
if he cooperated. He held up his end.

189
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,684
This has escalated way beyond a twisted prank.
He's our only conscious witness.

190
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,278

- Okay.

By acknowledging you failed to clear
the room when Terry was shot...

237
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,693
Kavanaugh's trying to characterize
your earlier statements...

as false and misleading.

239
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,329
That's bullshit.
I've told the truth since day one.

240
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,102
Nothing I've said has changed
because the facts haven't.

<i>of twisting your words.</i>

It's not inconceivable that he could
cost you your retirement.

243
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,245
- Where'd you hear that?
- Your case was referred to the police
committee for review.

00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,622
You let him try
to take my pension.

245

- I wouldn't be so sure.

00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,155
You know, Kavanaugh could get this
as a face-saving way to end his investigation.

Never mind prying a cop with a sketchy jacket
off the taxpayers' tit.

<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

250
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,369

around here about me?

<i>- [Police Chatter On Radio]</i>

468
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,346
[Shane]
What the hell is he doing here?

469
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,815
- [Mackey] Pretending to be a cop.
- [Billings] You call this in?

470
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,614
Yeah. We got a tip
the One-niners were hittin' this place.

471
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,986
We got stuck in the van on a stakeout,
couldn't make it back here in time.

472
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,992
- What's the damage?
- Looks like the guard took out one of'em...

473
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,994
before he got
his head blown off.

474
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,326
Detective Mackey,
do you know him?

475
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,602
It's Kern Little.
Old-school One-niner.

476
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:06,803
Went back to the street game
once his hip-hop career hit the skids.

477
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,575
Why don't you inventory what's missing,
and we'll start turning over One-niner rocks.

478
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,208
Familiar scenario, this.

479
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,287
[Chuckles]
How so?

480
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,287
Come on.
You don't see it?

481
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,223
A dead cop killed by the gun
of a dead bad guy.

482
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,488
You two,
innocent bystanders.

483
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,826
We were on the other side
of Farmington, asshole.

484
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,661
- Anybody see you?
<i>- Wouldn't have been much</i>
<i>of a stakeout if they had.</i>

485
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,236
<i>You know what? You should</i>
<i>start eating again, man.</i>

486
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,897
Malnourishment's startin'
to screw with your logic.

487
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,372
<i>[Kavanaugh] Lemansky's going to prison.</i>
<i>You need to protect him.</i>

488
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,375
<i>You reach out</i>
<i>to Antwon Mitchell.</i>

489
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,911
<i>For some reason, he needs</i>
<i>his, uh, crew leader dead.</i>

490
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,243
Bad blood, internal beef,
whatever.

491
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,512
So you kill him-
your end of the deal.

492
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,715
<i>He keeps Lem alive-</i>
<i>his end of the deal.</i>

493
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,018
How's that logic
sound to you?

494
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:04,162
Let me remind you
of a few things you seem to have forgotten.

495
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,931
I didn't kill Terry.

496
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,973
You've lost your leverage
with Lem.

497
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,237
And your ex-wife's pussy...

498
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,312
tastes like sweet butter.

499
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,622
What do you want?

500
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,921
- Sadie, you gonna let me in?
- I'm in the middle of something.

501
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,832
I just need to know if you, uh-
You seen this guy?

502
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,301
Yeah, he came through.

503
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,238
Are you okay?

504
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,867
- What do you care?
- Sadie, did he hurt you?

505
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,913
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>who ever hurts me, Jon.</i>

506
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,982
That's not gonna
happen again.

507
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:59,021
I just- Can you just...
tell me what he did.

508
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,614
Just tell me what happened.
Just what did he do?

509
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:05,560
What'd he do?
Um, he made me come.

510
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,200
<i>That's what he did.</i>

511
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,563
[Chuckles]

512
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,105
- No, he didn't.
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

513
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,607
Twice.

514
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,475
Do you know who-

515
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,245
who this guy is,
Sadie?

516
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,378
<i>Your friend...</i>

517
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:34,288
<i>who you sent</i>
<i>to check up on me.</i>

518
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,360
Well, he did.

519
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,654
What is wrong with you?

520
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,664
Huh?

521
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,631
You need to go.

522
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,367
Move your arm
from the door, Jon.

523
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,908
Now.

524
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,978
Or I will call the police.

525
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,588
What's up?

526
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:13,562
- What are you doin' here?
- The chief's office just signed off on the deal.

527
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,395
<i>Look, I report for processing</i>
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

528
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,761
It's okay, man.
It's over.

529
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,508
<i>It's over.</i>

530
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,410
[Sighs]

531
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,947
Thank you, man.

532
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,779
[Curtis]
It's all right. It's okay.

533
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,785
- Yeah.
<i>- [Ronnie] We got your back.</i>

534
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,118
All right.
I know. I know. I know.

535
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,161
- You're gonna be taken care of. You understand?
- Right.

536
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,788
I had nothing
to do with this.

537
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,333
If you're asking if I think these perverts
deserve to be punished-

538
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,902
Look what they're
doin' to our country.

539
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,598
Yeah, seducing our kids, spreading Al DS.
You gave us your spiel.

540
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,732
A moment of your time.

541
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,340
- Where are we with this freak?
- He's guilty, just not prosecutable at the moment.

542
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,146
The problem is the evidence is circumstantial
and threadbare at best.

543
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,152
He matches the witness's
description.

544
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,121
There's no way the D.A.'s gonna indict
off a wife beater's say so.

545
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,285
<i>Well, let's put him on the tour. Lose him</i>
<i>in the system for a couple days, buy some time.</i>

546
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,421
With I.A.D. Bivouacked in my colon?
You out of your mind?

547
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,557
If you can't close him,
lose him.

548
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,331
Oh, uh, Claudette, chief's here.
He wants to see you.

549
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:31,841
Hey, I tried to keep it
copacetic with you and Phillips.

550
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:36,607
<i>Detective Wyms, I got a preliminary report</i>
<i>back from the city physician.</i>

551
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:40,309
- You are medically fit to resume your duties.
- I could have told you that.

552
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,581
<i>- You'll be required to have quarterly checkups.</i>
- Your nickel.

553
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,283
<i>Understand you unloaded</i>
<i>with both barrels on my number two here.</i>

554
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,690
Sometimes happens I see red.

555
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:53,560
Changes have to be made. For starters,
I've decided to appoint you captain.

556
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,995
What makes you think I want
that revolving door?

557
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,937
You know this place better
than anybody in the department.

558
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,407
Which is why you don't see me
jumping at the offer.

559
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,413
<i>My predecessor made a mistake slapping</i>
<i>you down with that D.A. Nonsense.</i>

560
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,507
But you and I can find a way
to work together, right?

561
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:25,553
For starters, I would need a guarantee
that I would run the Barn.

562
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,360
Not in theory.
In fact.

563
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,435
No one can do
the job with-

564
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:38,573
<i>Sorry to interrupt, but I just confirmed</i>
<i>some very disturbing news.</i>

565
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,908
Did you- Did you sign off
on a deal with Lemansky?

566
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:49,976
- I did.
- I thought we agreed, no deals.

567
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,852
The only way to get Mackey
is to leverage his guys.

568
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,448
- We're in the middle
of something here, Lieutenant.
<i>- So am I.</i>

569
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,120
And it just got derailed
because you guys backed down.

570
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,129
<i>It's over, Jon.</i>

571
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,758
Sending Lemansky to jail sends a message.
We all move on now.

572
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,132
And Mackey skates clean.

573
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,229
[Chuckling]

574
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,209
This guy-This guy is just pissing-
just pissing all over us...

575
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,940
- and we just smile and lick it up?
<i>- [Phillips] That's enough.</i>

576
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,682
Vic Mackey kills cops!

577
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,517
He- He deals drugs!

578
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,591
He beats suspects!

579
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,351
<i>You know what</i>
<i>he did yesterday?</i>

580
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,030
He-
He screwed my ex-wife...

581
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,833
<i>with the sole purpose...</i>

582
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:46,842
of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

583
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,038
He may have assassinated
a gang leader.

584
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,641
And that's just
all in one day.

585
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,846
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>he's gonna do today.</i>

586
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,086
I wonder what
he's gonna do tomorrow.

587
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,822
<i>This guyl</i>
<i>This guy is just pissingl</i>

588
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,160
He's pissing all over us!
He's pissing on you!

589
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,359
What-
What does it taste like?

590
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,495
<i>Chief, what does it taste like?</i>
<i>'Cause, you know what? It tastes like piss to mel</i>

591
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,404
You have 48 hours to
tie up the loose ends.

592
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,705
And find someplace else
to do the paperwork.

593
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,542
<i>Captain Wyms</i>
<i>needs her office.</i>

594
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,524
<i>[Door Opens, Slams Shut]</i>

595
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,088
We'll sneak the whole cow
in to you, man.

596
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,757
Hey, Lem, I'm sorry.
I'm glad it's over though.

597
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,893
That's okay.
Thanks. Thank you.

598
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,995
Hey, you'll be a little thinner
the next time I see you.

599
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,199
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

600
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,211
<i>Thanks. Hey, I gotta get some things in order.</i>
<i>I'll see you guys at the party.</i>

601
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,213
- All right, man.
- Here you go.

602
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,512
- What's that?
- That's the paperwork for the 211
you called in last night.

603
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,746
<i>E.M. T.'s found a ton of jewelry in the pocket</i>
<i>of the dead banger.</i>

604
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,290
Shitheads shot an innocent guy
and walked away with almost nothing.

605
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,719
- Which means-
- The goddamn safe was empty?

606
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,627
So Antwon's not getting
his money.

607
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,326
- That's gonna screw the whole deal.
- Holy shit.

608
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,403
I gotta talk to Antwon.

609
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,169
These fags who choose a life of sin
and suffering get what they deserve...

610
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,336
but I'm the one in handcuffs.

611
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,318
- Hey.
- Stand up.

612
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,884
Does his family deserve to have their lives
ruined because of what you did to him?

613
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,120
<i>- Men's room on Alvarado.</i>
- Look, I've never seen that guy before.

614
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,527
But if he's bein' punished for his wickedness,
then it's God's will.

615
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,862
- You're his spokesman now?
- That's right there in the Book.

616
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,834
"You shall not lie with a male
as one lies with a female."

617
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,837
It's an abomination.
I mean, come on.

618
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,839
- Hey, hey!
- Leviticus 18:22.

619
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,739
- What are you doing? I don't have to talk to you.
- I know.

620
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,244
Hey, hey!

621
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,246
<i>Where do you go to church?</i>

622
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,283
Christ Bethany.
What is this?

623
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,321
<i>So then you know thatJesus</i>
<i>lived a perfect life of truth...</i>

624
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,390
and he was crucified for it.

625
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,654
What do you suppose happens to
someone who lies in his name?

626
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,829
Who passes judgment on other
people in his name?

<i>Psalm 71, Verse 4.</i>

628
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,635
- "Deliver me, O my God,
out of the hand of the wicked.
- Hey, stop!

629
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,676
Out of the hand of the
unrighteous and the cruel man."

630
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,042
- Stop!
- You wanted to look at a man down there.

631
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,810
You wanted to touch it. Thought about it
for a long time, maybe all your life.

632
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,375
You just never did it 'cause
you knew that it was wrong.

633
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,217
No, no, no!
[Yelps]

634
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,849
So you convinced yourself
that you were doing God's will...

635
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,451
gave yourself an excuse to find out
what another man's penis feels like.

636
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:56,659
<i>No. I would never do something</i>
<i>so repulsive and disgusting.</i>

637
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,758
You're no different
than the men you prey on.

638
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,837
- You're a homosexual.
- No, no, no.

639
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,031
Homosexual.

640
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,837
<i>- No.</i>
- You're just too weak and afraid to admit it.

641
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,139
That's a lie!
That is a lie.

642
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,407
I am a Christian,
and they are vermin.

643
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,574
I did it because
they are vermin.

644
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,175
Why would any man want
to touch another man down there?

645

That's all it was.
It was just a threat.

652

You threw me in County.
You arrested me.

653

I knew you'd make bail,
just not so soon.

654
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,147
It was just a strategy, man.
A wedge to get you to turn.

That's bullshit.
He's jerkin' us off.

He can't get to you in here.

No, but he can touch
everyone around me.

681

That crazy-ass nigga, he initiated a full-scale
D.O.C. Investigation of this place.

682

The heat is on. And soon I won't be feelin'
