your way out of,press two.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,514
- It's great, isn't it?
- If you'd shut up and let us listen.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,183
If you're shirtless and threatening
your girlfriend with a knife...

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,056
but don't want one of our officers
interfering with true love...

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,630
- press three.
- Priceless

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,199

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,860

- fatherless children, press five.
- I need you

15
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,413
All right.
Let's all get back to work.

16
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,505
What's the status
on the custom car sting?

17
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,584
AGC? Ronnie's running
down the warrants

18
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,209
- I can see that
- As soon as the judge signs off

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,517
we'll start placing cameras and bugs
in all the high-end rides

20
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,058
- Prospects?
- Money laundering, drug running

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,119
There's even a studio guy who's selling
bootleg DVDs of his own movies

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,824
- How's your surveillance equipment?
- It's on loan from the feds

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,562
State of the art Ronnie's like
a kid with his first titty magazine

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,638
Good

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,777
- What's going on?
- Rodriguez has been working
with the chief s task force

26
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,777
to reduce violent crime
in Koreatown

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,904
I need your team to serve
a high-risk warrant

28
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,609
That's Charlie Kim
He's an enforcer for the K-town Killers

29
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,447
Oh, the prick who firebombed
a motel last year

30
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,454
when the manager started
hassling their hookers

31
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,820
Three people burned to death
Task force also thinks

32
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,416
that Kim is the triggerman
in four other homicides

33
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,758
They caught a break when
the owner of the motel agreed to testify

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,332
I want to show the Korean
community that helping us works

35
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,334
Just 'cause they call you ''the sheriff'
doesn't mean they think you're the law.

36
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,597
Convicting him with
a Korean eyewitness is a start

37
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,605
But I need this asshole
brought in alive

38
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,403
I'll do my best
Where is he now?

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,947
- He was spotted in an apartment
complex on Alexandria.
- Can we trust the tip?

40
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,881
Yes, but he doesn't stay in one spot
for long, so we gotta move now.

41
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,043

42
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,418
- You're late.
- I was at the hospital

43
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,924
- Tavon keeps getting better
- Oh, that's great.

44
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,728
He's got some body movement
Opens his eyes

45
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,857
- That's good news
- Yeah

46
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,599
Wait-- Is that--
Is that a wedding ring?

47
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,237
Yeah Yeah, viva Las Vegas

48
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,749
We, uh,just did it Sunday,
you know

49
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,945
- Wejust figured why wait?

50
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,579

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,920

52
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,429
Congratulations
Any more surprises?

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,727
Okay, then let's hand out one
or two of our own

54
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,447
Two original Thaeron-designed chairs were stolen
from a moving truck yesterday near Echo Park

55
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,984
Sara Dagit bought the chairs
at an estate auction

56
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,985
Her husband, Nick,
sits on the police commission

57
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,817
- Ten thousand dollars for a chair
- It's a felony

58
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,051
And my detectives are busy
Can you track them down?

59
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,389
Dagit's got friends
on the budget committee.

60
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,486
The last thing we need
are more cuts around here

61
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,259
A lot of these robberies
are inside jobs

62
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,459
Just find them

63
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,007
He's in Apartment 6 Kim rides
a riceburner, so watch the garage

64
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,668
Somebody get these kids on
the other side of the street right now!

65
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,009
- Go, go, go
- Across the street, honey, right now

66
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,242
Hurry Run
Go Come on Inside

67
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,477

68
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,783
Go!

69
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,361
- Go!
- Get down! Get down on the ground right now!

70
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,693
- You, down!

71
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,599
It's not him
Where's Charlie Kim?

72
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,403
Knock on some doors in case
he's in another apartment! Let's go!

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,240
Quick! Move!

74
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,214

75
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,774
Hey Hey, he's running!
Let's go!

76
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,190

77
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,096
- How'd he get behind us?
- Son of a bitch

78
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,328
- Hey, call it in.
Get a chopper on this guy.

79
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,530

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,871
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Let's go. Come on.

81
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,036

82
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,944
She's breathing
She's still breathing

83
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,212
- Hey, let's get an ambulance in here!
- You kill him!

84
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,810
- He was the only one shooting--
- Shane

85
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,389
- Get these people back!

86
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,027
Come on

87
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,322
Ripped by:

88
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,733
Hound

89
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,738


90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,944
Jesus Christ, Vic.
What the hell happened here?

91
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,676
Kim was in an apartment
in the building next door

92
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,218
He had a perfect sight line
into the unit that we stormed

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,788
- Who screwed up?
- I just saw two kids get shot

94
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,916
- Who didn't screw up?
- Who was in Kim's apartment?

95
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,291
Tourists A Korean couple
on their honeymoon

96
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,296
Do you at least know
who owned the building?

97
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,629
John Cho We're running
him down right now

98
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,635
Are you talking
to these people?

99
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,728
Yes, but they're not
talking back

100
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,366
If you're gonna get murdered,
it might as well be by your own kind

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,372
Hey, Vic

102
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,851
- Hey. We're looking for Charlie Kim.

103
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,015
- He just shot two kids
in front of one of your buildings

104
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,116
English, asshole.
We know you're American.

105
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,195
Why was he staying in one
of your apartments rent free?

106
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,663
These kids were seven and eight
One of'em's dead That matter to you?

107
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,864
It matters to me, asshole
Let's go Get your ass in the car

108
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,576
- What?
- Um, you're smiling

109
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,708
- I try it occasionally
- You had another date with James

110
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,753
- Detective Wagenbach

111
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,187
- That's what, like, three times this week?
- You look tired

112
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,190
That cat still
keeping you up all night?

113
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,226
No

114
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,694
Uh, yeah, give it to me
Thanks

115
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,857
- Armed robbery, 87 Cents Store

116
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,768
- Is there a profit in that?
- Eighty-seven cents here,
eighty-seven cents there

117
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,772
Pretty soon you're talking
about real money

118
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,366
- So is this getting serious?
- Oh,just stick to the case

119
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,469
Oh, it's serious
You can't even hide it

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,571
She wasn't your typical
stickup gal

121
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,343
- How's that?
- I've been robbed before

122
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,784
She was real nervous
Like it was her first time

123
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,379
You know how a woman is
her first time

124
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,981
- Not as well as I'd like to

125
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,085
I never thought she'd really shoot me,
but who wants to take the chance?

126
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,959
- Was she working alone?
- It was just her

127
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,191
She walked right up
and put a snub-nose in my face

128
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,758
- You get a good look at her?
- She was white, with a baseball cap

129
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,930
and sunglasses, so I didn't
see much of her face

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,634
- You're sure she was a woman?
- Oh

131
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,576
Surveillance cameras
caught the action

132
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,409
Could I get a copy of that?
I got robbed at gunpoint.

133
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,779
I'd like to show my wife

134
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,479
I heard Moses got promoted
over atJustice again

135
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,955
Yeah Not bad for a few guys
who couldn't even get into a frat, huh?

136
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,186

137
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,093
- So this is about the shootings
- We're looking for Charlie Kim

138
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,167
- People are blaming the department
for what happened
- Kim fired those shots

139
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,395
- I hope you catch him
- If he wasn't being protected, we would have

140
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,598
- What am I supposed to do?
- The people in the apartment
complex aren't cooperating.

141
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,039
Neither is the owner
I need to get through

142
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,634
There's a dead boy and a girl
in critical condition.

143
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,576
Come on, David.
You know Korean customs.

144
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,775
You don't trust the police
You don't trust anybody but your own kind

145
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,715
- Including the gangs?
- They serve a purpose

146
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,310
They create order, and they keep the black
and Latino bangers out

147
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,950
- Can your department do that?
- That is the old way of thinking It's gotta change

148
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,930
My advice to you
is to let things settle

149
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,398
Pick Kim up later, without
the threat of more violence

150
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,802
If the community blames us and we don't
handle this now, things will only get worse.

151
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,501
I need Kim I need your help

152
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,377
- I need a contact
- Okay, look I got life shit going on Okay?

153
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,749
I can't be
at y'all disposal 2 4-7

154
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,152
I drop this confession of
your third strike to the D.A....

155
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,157
and your schedule
clears up real fast

156
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,320
- You do business with Koreans?
- Yeah, if the yellows can bring the green--

157
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,592
I need a name-- someone who's
into something I can lean on

158
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,724
But they have to be tapped
into that community

159
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,168
There is this slant I do business with.
The chick is into I.D. theft.

160
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,435
- Where?
- She got a shop up off of Western

161
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,840
Look, do you feel like taking
your hand outta my ass now?

162
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,469
No And if this tip is a washout,
I'm gonna make a fist

163
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,071

164
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,743
Hey, listen, Aceveda's got us
tracking down these stolen chairs

165
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,687
We're running out of options You guys know
anybody plugged into the street trade?

166
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,191
- Meet Taylor
- How y'all doing?

167
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,661
- Married, huh?
- Yeah

168
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,672
Yeah, I can hardly
believe it myself

169
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,106
I'm sorry I missed that

170
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,937
Look, you sure you know
what you're doing?

171
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,981
I know what I want

172
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,850
Just--

173
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,425
Just don't make
the same mistakes I made.

174
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,892
You'll be fine

175
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,158

176
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,761
- People buy this shit?
- I'll believe that when I see it

177
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,567
- Can I help you?
- Tracy Pak?

178
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,838
- Yeah
- I understand you applied for a
confidential informant position

179
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,913
- No
- Yeah

180
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,845
- We're here for the interview
- Are you the cops?

181
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,679
- We'll talk in your office
- You can't go back there!

182
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,454
The Bank of Tracy.

183
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,051
- Nice setup.
- Pretty good interest rate on these?

184
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,654
- What is this?
- Let me run down the rules for you

185
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,633
There's no set number of tips
you have to provide us

186
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,330
but trust me,
I know if someone's sliding

187
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,066
You start sliding,
you get shut down

188
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,335
become the feds' problem

189
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,106
I judge my CIs by the quality
of their work, not the quantity

190
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:52,617
- Yeah, but quantity's good too
- If things don't get violent,
I'll let this operation slide

191
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,154
I'll even provide tips of police activity
that might be bad for business

192
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,780
Yeah, but you gotta
earn your way in first.

193
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,984
What?

194
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,585
- Charlie Kim
- I only know about 1 5 Charlie Kims

195
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,632
- You know the one I'm looking for
- I'm the wrong girl!

196
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,633
Really?

197
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,295
Are you the Tracy Pak that's about
to spend the next eight years

198
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,169
in federal prison
for credit card fraud?

199
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,300

200
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,606
Yeah, you're the right girl

201
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,715
So you got a knack
for finding things, huh?

202
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,341
Yes, I do And we can start
by finding your smile

203
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:31,822
- How about we find these?
- Damn, these some ugly-ass chairs!

204
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,621
They were stolen from a truck
in front of Burrito Castle on 6th.

205
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,492
They're worth about
$1 0,000 apiece

206
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,727
- Not to no black people, they're not
- I gotta agree

207
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:48,774
Looks like the 87 Cents Store
paid that much for their video camera

208
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,933
- Crosby Nell called
- The Treasury guy?

209
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,343
They picked up a suspect in the Armenian
money train robbery depositing marked bills

210
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,814
Looks like I still might solve
that double murder.

211
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,409
- Let's focus on our double robbery first
- Double?

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,784
A woman fitting our description
did a grab-and-dash...

213
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,380
at a nearby convenience store
this morning

214
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,426
Witness saw the suspect
get into a blue Civic

215
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,961
- Got a partial plate
- DMV's running it now

216
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,123
So she wasn't a virgin,
criminally speaking

217
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,758
We're already on a list
for an OT for Matthew

218
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,337
Now with Megan diagnosed,
we're in trouble

219
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,531
Sorry Thanks for waiting

220
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,737
We already assigned Matthew a therapist,
and he left because--

221
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,948
He had to take
a job out of town.

222
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,042
I wish I had
more therapists available

223
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,713
- But you do have some, right?
- A few.

224
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,019
We try to steer them to situations
with a high likelihood of success.

225
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,219
Megan's autism
isn't as bad as Matthew's

226
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,425
Her doctor said that treatment at
an early age can be quite effective

227
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,596
- You're separated?
- I spend as much time with the children as I can

228
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,037
You work full time
She's doing 30 hours a week

229
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,166
Private therapists
are expensive

230
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,712
Our workshops are designed for after-session
exercises with the children.

231
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,907
If you're both working, who's there
to do them with the children?

232
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,314
- We have several different babysitters
- We can't rely on babysitters

233
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,251
We'll take care of things at home
We'll figure out how to pay for it

234
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,255
Just find us someone, okay?

235
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,120

236
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,862
Later Hmm?

237
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,864
Okay

238
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,060
- ThatJames?
- Is that the partial plates?

239
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,161
You know,
if this is getting serious...

240
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,173
I can provide valuable insight
into the male psyche

241
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:33,177
- Pony up the DMV reports
- You'll let me know if I can help?

242
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,578
Three registered possibilities
in the area-- Donna Talic

243
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,311
Carl Grossey,
Henry and Angie Deitze

244
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,387
- Angie fits
- I ran them through N.C.I.C.

245
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,422
She's clean

246
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,616
But Hank is a whole
different animal

247
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,491
Looks like he's turning wife beating
into an Olympic sport

248
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,030
Multiple assault and batteries,
spousal abuse...

249
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,100
a couple of misdemeanor thefts
in his teens.

250
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,667
- Interesting
- I also ran a firearms background check

251
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,402
- He owns a 38 snub-nose
- Very interesting

252
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,310
- Got any insights on his psyche?
- I'd say he's just an asshole

253
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,382

254
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,278
- You got your boy helping you, huh?
- He wants what we want.

255
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,755
Well, all I want is another shot
at this Kim prick

256
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,296
- Detective, meet Neil O'Brien.
- A pleasure Right in here

257
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,973
Guess who Dutch-boy and his
Treasury bitch just brought in?

258
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,876
- O'Brien?
- No way

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,574
- Way
- Yes!

260
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:48,119
Those marked bills that we dropped on him
must've hit the banks.

261
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,657
Which means that
we're free and clear.

262
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,553
It feels good

263
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,234

264
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,270

265
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,668
Neil O'Brien Career criminal

266
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,804
Not associated with the Irish mob
or any other organization we know of

267
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,577
Last week, O'Brien deposited
$1 7,000 cash

268
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,016
into three LA bank accounts
all on the same day

269
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,953
- Some of that cash was on our marked bill list?
- All of it was on the list.

270
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,787
O'Brien's family is also from Indio,
where the money first got flagged.

271
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,862
Tie him to the two murders
and find out who his accomplices were

272
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,692

273
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,857
So this guy steals from the mob,
kills two of'em

274
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,901
just to get away with
a bunch of marked money?

275
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,368
I thought the Irish
were supposed to be lucky.

276
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,170
So Cho is afraid of Kim
He's afraid of what he might do to his tenants

277
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,178
So he pays him every month, and then lets Kim
move around to his different buildings

278
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,908
- How much contact did he have with Kim?
- Minimal

279
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,415
These are the addresses of other apartments
that Kim has access to

280
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,582
- He might be at one of them
- Stay sharp

281
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,759
- This is weird
- All the curtains are closed

282
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,666
- A setup?
- Watch our backs

283
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,311
This is it

284
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,409
- Go!


285
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,488
Shit

286
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,758
- Clear
- Clear

287
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,124
Clear Shit

288
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,063
- It's cold
- Kim's probably on an underground
rickshaw to Seoul by now.

289
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,125
Damn it All right Knock on some doors,
not that it'll do any good

290
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,907

291
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,969
- Yeah, this is Detective Mackey Get me Aceveda
- Vic! Vic!

292
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,038
Get over here Our car, man
Our car Shit!

293
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,756

294
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,527
You better flag down
that rickshaw

295
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,164

296
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,866
Somebody wants us out ofhere.

297
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,167
Come on. Julien and I were already here.

298
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,401
The owner said
he never saw the chairs

299
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,843
Well, membership
has its privileges.

300
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,744
- Hey, Leroy! What's up? What's up?

301
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,317
Hey, no, no. They're cool, man.
They'rejust my ride.

302
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,185
Listen, did, uh-- Did anybody
come in here trying to flip these?

303
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,693
Skinny-ass, yeah He popped in
this morning, around 1 1 :00

304
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,285
So you lied to us?

305
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,523
Right pawnshop You just came
with the wrong brother

306
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,659
The clown wanted $200 for 'em.
I sent him packin

307
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,671
- You have any idea where he
might try to sell them next?
- Somebody looking for firewood

308
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,641
- Two hundred dollars
- They's some ugly-ass chairs, ain't they?

309
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,248
Thanks for the lift

310
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,946
- You all right?
- Yeah The car's a little overheated though

311
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:13,184
- So what do we have?
- If this was any other gang, I'd have him already

312
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,352
So we just sit and wait
for a break? No

313
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,625
- Can you think of anything we're missing?
- Sorry

314
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,928
Don't worry.
I'm not letting Kim win this.

315
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,270
You made some rather large
cash deposits recently, didn't you, Neil?

316
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,534
If you know,
why are you asking?

317
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,769
Seventeen thousand
to three different banks

318
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,312
- Where'd you get the money?
- I pinched my pennies

319
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,247
- That's a pretty big piggy bank
- Yeah, it's huge

320
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,944
- You're going to have to do better than that
- A friend owed it to me.

321
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,181
- Paid it back in a lump sum
- A good friend What's his name?

322
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,486
We'll need it
to verify your story

323
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,857
All right
I won it in Vegas

324
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,453
- I got hot What can I say?
- Which casino?

325
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,260
- A few different ones
- They have to report winnings to the IRS

326
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,961
- I never won that much at any one place
- They all have cameras.

327
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,231
Tell us which casinos,
we'll check it out.

328
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,776
- I forgot.
- You remember a pyramid? A pirate ship, maybe?

329
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,672
We've got time.
Think about it.

330
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,455
- Ronnie, we clear in here?
- Yeah, I swept it.

331
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,888
So, what's up?

332
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,758
Uh, Megan
was diagnosed with autism

333
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:30,198
It's not as severe as Matthew's,
but the quicker she gets care...

334
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,429
the better off she'll be

335
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,999
Okay

336
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:40,067
To get a therapist
for her and Matthew...

337
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,079
Corrine's gonna need
to stay home

338
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,274
I have to pick up
the financial slack.

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,716
I figured since the feds
are onto O'Brien

340
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,723
and off of Mara and Stella,
I could dip into the money train cash

341
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:58,524
Not a lot.Just enough to supplement
the weekly payments...

342
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,030
get them the help they need.

343
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,863
- What about the plan?
- That's why I'm asking

344
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,566
You guys discuss it

345
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:15,307
Whatever you decide,
I'll respect it

346
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,285
- All right
- All right?

347
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,670
Well, Vic needs this

348
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,739
Well, I say no.

349
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,934
Jesus, Lem. Come on.
These are his kids.

350
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,204
How good's it gonna be
for his kids if Vic's in jail?

351
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,873
- The feds are with O'Brien
right now They're off of us
- We don't know that for sure

352
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,178
He had the rest of the marked money.
We're in the clear.

353
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:58,018
Look, every time we spend a dime of that money,
some new shit storm smacks us in the face.

354
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,092
- I'm not going down on this
- Vic knows the score

355
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,161
He'll play it smart

356
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,631
Look, if we can't use the money
for something like this

357
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,101
then why the hell did we
steal it in the first place?

358
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:09,999
then why the hell did we
steal it in the first place?

359
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,468
We said we wouldn't make the same
mistakes as the dumbasses we catch

360
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,301
We're not. We're not.

361
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,205
Vic's not thinking about
the big picture, all right?

362
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,210
He needs us to do it for him

363
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,516
- Well, what about you?
- I don't know

364
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,960
That 1 7 thou you stole?
It was marked by the U.S. Treasury.

365
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,360
- So?
- We were investigating the Armenian mob.

366
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,366
- That's who you stole it from
- They were marked so they could be traced

367
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,266
and the footprints
led right back to you, Neil.

368
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,271
There were at least three
other men involved in that robbery

369
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,898
You give us their names,
you get the best deal of the bunch

370
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,379
You're serious

371
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,639
I found the money on the street

372
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,411
- I did.
- Where? On the Yellow Brick Road?

373
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,852
Outside a bar off Pico.
I walked out to the parking lot.

374
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,685
It was in a bank bag on the ground,
so I took it I didn't steal it

375
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,056
- I swear to God.
- I've seen your sheet.

376
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,857
I've heard about a half dozen lies
come out of your mouth already.

377
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,830
You're in some serious shit

378
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:21,230
He was here Wanted a hundred bucks
for these torture racks

379
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,309
- He's lowering his prices
- You have any idea where he went?

380
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,207
Try the S&M club

381
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,507
Can you find my smile now?

382
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,879
I'm gonna talk to the other store owners
around here, see if they know anything.

383
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,509
He did leave a number,
just in case I change my mind.

384
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,748
I think I tossed it.

385
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:43,487
Uh, my man, my man, my man, is--
is she hooked up with anybody?

386
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:47,326
- I don't know
- Huh You know, man, I never,
ever hit a cop before

387
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,799
You think she takes charge in bed, or you figure
I'll have to break her down a little bit?

388
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:54,668
- She's my partner Shut up
- So what you saying? I'm not good enough?

389
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,968
- That's exactly what I'm saying
- Huh Okay

390
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,238
Well, we'll see
what she says, okay?

391
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,176
- Fine
- Yeah 
392
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,807
Here it is It's one of these

393
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,087
Thank you

394
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,261
I thought you
had today off

395
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,992
Uh, yeah, I decided to catch up
on my paperwork

396
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,500
Computer systems down
over at Wilshire?

397
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,504
- The scenery's nicer over here
- You know, we keep meeting this way

398
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,804
one of these detectives might think
that we actually like each other

399
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,113
I'm speaking at a dog training seminar
next weekend in San Diego

400
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:43,483
and Hunter has to stay here

401
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,783
Do you feel like
going out of town?

402
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,882
We won't have to
look over our shoulders

403
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,291
I might be able
to free up my schedule

404
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,489
- Don't leave without saying good-bye
- Okay

405
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,931

406
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,162
- Mackey
- It's Tracy

407
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,467
There's a PC arcade
down on Vermont

408
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,735
One of those places where
the geeks play all day

409
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:09,780
- I know what it is
- A girl I know says Kim's there playing online

410
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:15,046
- I really don't like doing this
- Don't worry It gets easier

411
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,087
Kim's at a PC arcade
on Vermont

412
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,885
- There might be more children there
- We'll be careful

413
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,170

414
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,761
- Get down!
- Sir, don't move.

415
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,109
- Hands up!
- Hands up right now! Nobody move!

416
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,545
- Get your hands up. Get 'em up!
- Don't see him.

417
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,445
Not here

418
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,384
Ronnie

419
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,318
You see the guy
who was sitting here?

420
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,657
Was it Charlie Kim?
Hey, man, I'm talking to you

421
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,696
Left in a hurry.
Didn't even log out.

422
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,062
- How long ago?
- Six minutes.

423
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,625
- This is bullshit, man.
- I'm getting sick of this game

424
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,570
- Yeah, me too.


425
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,237
- You told Kim we were coming!
- No, I didn't!

426
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,008
- Nobody else knew we were on his ass!
- I told you where he was

427
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,949
- It's not my fault if you didn't find him
- Back room Grab everything

428
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,544
- It's evidence I'm throwing
someone's ass in jail today
- Oh, no! Please don't!

429
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,057
- Shut your face! I can't trust you
- I'm telling you the truth!

430
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,289
I saw a kid get killed today
That means no more second chances

431
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,661
I did what you told me

432
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,791
Look, I haven't had to pay
any protection money yet

433
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,961
but the K-town Killers will
get around to me

434
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,561
You're a better deal than
I'll ever get with Kim's boys

435
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,971
You got me

436
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,213
What are you doing?

437
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,984
She's right
She's not the only one who knew

438
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,192
- Sit down, Hank
- Slipped disk

439
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:09,131
Hurts like a bitch to stand back up
Besides, I can't stay long

440
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,998
- Where's your gun?
- At my house. Why?

441
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,731
- You sure it's not with your wife?
- She knows not to touch it

442
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,467
Then why was she sticking it
in a store clerk's face this morning?

443
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,740
You put a gun in her hand, she'd shake
too much to point it at anyone.

444
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,974
- Where is she now then?
- Temping

445
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,280
- Where?
- I don't know That's why they call it temping

446
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,854
Call me when you get things
straightened out

447
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,787
- We're not done here yet

448
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,191
My back!

449
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,694
Jesus Christ!

450
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,027
I want my lawyer

451
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,999
Now!

452
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,093

453
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,696
- Come here, school chum!

454
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,606
- Vic!
- He'll call you back

455
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,202
- Vic!
- Get in here

456
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,948
You want to make another call?
Have Kim come down here and meet us?

457
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,417
Huh? Come here!

458
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,855
- Vic! Vic, what are you doing?
- I found out why Kim's always
one step ahead of us

459
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,724
- Your friend here's been tipping him off
- He just assaulted me

460
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,700
- You're a witness
- Kim murdered a child, and you're protecting him?

461
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,067
- I can check your phone records
- I've discussed the situation
with community leaders

462
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,072
If they've chosen to warn him,
there's nothing I can do

463
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,335
- So they make the call for you instead!
- That's conspiracy

464
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,207
We don't want cops like him
intruding into our lives

465
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,248
- Look,just give us Kim
- I won't do that.

466
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,374

467
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,088
Then you'll get more cops,
not less

468
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,715
Grab every uni you can.
Turn their shops upside down.

469
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,760
I want every inch
of Koreatown smothered

470
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,830
Like white on rice

471
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,763
Gear up Time to tear
Koreatown a new one

472
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,034
What?

473
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,441
Oh, you voted

474
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,043
- Look, it's not that we don't wanna help you--
- It's okay.

475
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,123
It's probably the smart thing

476
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,528
Let's go We got a job to do

477
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,782
- Let's go!

478
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,046
All right We're looking
for Charlie Kim

479
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,384
He's a banger
with the K-town Killers

480
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,390
That makes today
''meet your local cop''day.

481
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:51,155
You see any violations,you write a ticket.
You see anything illegal,you bust it.

482
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,423
Anyone smarts off, you pop 'em

483
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:57,228
Any questions?
Then let's protect and serve

484
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:01,032

485
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:01,239
How'd it go with O'Brien?

486
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,173
How'd it go with O'Brien?

487
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,243
The guy just set the world
record for speed-lying

488
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,575
The unis are passing out these photos
of Angie to all the local stores

489
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,310
- Hank's lawyer here yet?
-Just arrived Guess which bozo it is

490
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,443
- Who?
- Arreyo Gonzalez

491
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,546
The ambulance chaser
who's on all the city buses?

492
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,854
Mmm Greed knows no racial
nor ethnic boundaries

493
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,395
Can you say ''accidentes''?

494
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,694
Hey, y-you saw that I just
barely touched that guy, right?

495
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,195
Is that the officer
that assaulted you?

496
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,604
- That's him.
- We'll see you in civil court.

497
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,609
We'll see him
in criminal court.

498
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,645
The question we're trying
to answer is why a quiet...

499
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,306
mild-mannered housewife is
holding up convenience stores

500
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,282
- She's not.
- That's your forte, not your wife's

501
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,013
I was a kid. I lifted
a couple cases of suds.

502
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,579
Your landlord says you're three months
past due with the rent

503
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,751
- My disability ran out.
- So, you get stressed when you owe money?

504
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,728
No It makes me feel like I'm
lying on the beach drinking mai tais

505
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,232
- Next question
- You know the old joke,
''Do you still beat your wife?''

506
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,393
Well, do you?

507
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,439
- Next question.
- You've been bullying Angie for years

508
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,635
She's running around
knocking off stores in your car

509
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,144
- with your gun, and you
don't know nothing about it?
- No

510
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,773
You bought three boxes
of.38 slugs at Big Five last week.

511
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:23,047
- Why'd you buy the bullets?
- My neighborhood's turned to shit

512
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,122
I got a right to protect myself

513
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,760
We've got unis
outside your house

514
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,423
When Angie comes home, she's gonna
tell us that you put her up to it

515
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,467
She won't say it,
'cause I didn't do it.

516
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,106
She's afraid
of another beating

517
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,541
so he scares her into committing robberies
to put food on the table

518
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,544
She could be acting alone

519
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,638
Joanna Faulks had no idea her husband
was a rapist and a murderer

520
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,747
She's a battered woman
She's living under a bully's thumb

521
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,882
Everything we know
about this woman's thirdhand

522
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:05,326
Come on Everything we know tells us
that armed robbery isn't in her nature

523
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,330
We don't know what's in
her heart or mind

524
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,425
If I told you the worst five things I've done
in my life, I'll bet a few'd surprise you

525
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:16,701
- Something you want to confess?
- No Is there anything you want to tell me?

526
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:21,677
- I'm just saying, who knows
what secrets Angie's keeping?

527
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,407
Right?

528
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,547
- Surprise inspection
- We can find the kitchen.

529
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,089


530
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,594
- You ever heard of a refrigerator?
- Is clean

531
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,669
- Very safe We get ''A''
- So I see.

532
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,864
We know the wink-wink deal your
councilman has with the inspectors

533
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,032
No more grade fixing

534
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,509
Tell your customers to go home
You're shut down

535
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,978
You wanna keep us
out of your backyard?

536
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,050
You give us Charlie Kim
And tell your friends

537
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,119
I'll take this one

538
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,881
So, uh--
So you into music?

539
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,757
It's just that you look like
a woman that appreciates a live show

540
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,263
'Cause I'm the guy who can get you
anywhere you want Front row, dead center

541
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,493
So close you'd be able to lick
the sweat off the tip of Snoop's nose

542
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,366
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I don't think so

543
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,439
What is it? You don't date
black guys, is that it?

544
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,271
I dated a black guy once
I wasn't that impressed

545
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,277
Then you need to give me
that bitch's number

546
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,711
so I can go kick his ass for
killing it for the rest of us

547
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,783
I'm not joking

548
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,853

549
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,048
Put a stop to this,
before you can't fix the damage

550
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,593
- Give me Kim
- This is who we are.

551
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,459
- It's not perfect Are you?
- You used to rebel against that culture

552
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,158
I'm a businessman now
I'm going to be a leader someday

553
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,633
-Just like you, I have to make choices
- You made the wrong one

554
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,638
You say that now But when you're on city council
and you have to answer to your people--

555
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,504
- You lied to me
- Are you gonna tear your culture down then?

556
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,577
If they protected
a child killer,yes, I would.

557
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,913
What if they want to
speak Spanish in school?

558
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,010
What if they want
a driver's license?

559
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,952
Are you gonna be the same poli sci major
who used to talk about changing things?

560
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,087
My people are not gonna leave
Koreatown without Charlie Kim

561
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:19,721
You want us out,
you know what you need to do.

562
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,568

563
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,674

564
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,747
Yeah?

565
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,214
I think we have something
628 Bennet Street

566
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,376
A local businessman
is hiding Kim in his house.

567
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,011
Hey, drop it
We're on the move

568
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,885
Hey! Option one is
we take him alive

569
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,122
But feel free
to consider option two

570
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,699
Lemon, rush it! Rush it!

571
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,109
Go this way!

572
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,276
Get 'em up!

573
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,544
We're clear in here.

574
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,506
Pussy

575
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,951
We got your number
from Angie Deitze's landlord.

576
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,954
He said
you two were friends

577
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,547
Thanks to Hank,
I'm her only friend

578
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,719
- Did that bastard hit her again?
- No Angie's got his gun

579
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,729
She's out there committing
armed robbery

580
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,662
Angie'd never do that.

581
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,734
Even to avoid another beating?

582
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,730
- We think Hank's making her do it
- No

583
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,173
Angie's a good person
She just wanted to--

584
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,779
- What?
- Nothing

585
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,646
She's running around with a gun

586
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,878
You need to tell us
before she hurts someone

587
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,214
She wanted to start a new life

588
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,819
Said if she got $4,000, $5,000,
it might get her away from Hank

589
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,456
- Why 5,000?
- Half for her and the rest for his rent

590
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,730
She didn't want him to get
tossed out on the street.

591
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,465
Angie has a good heart.

592
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,708
You're free to go

593
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,711
I'm still waiting
for an apology

594
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,078
Your wife's out there robbing places
so she can leave you

595
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,583
- You've lost her.
- Okay Yeah

596
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,855
We spoke to her friend, Ginnie

597
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,788
Apparently she'd rather
risk a lifetime in jail...

598
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,860
than spend another
single day with you

599
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,090
- And who can blame her?
- Not me

600
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:11,100
- Shut up!
- Your, uh-- Your back feeling better?

601
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,763
Sit down.
Don't aggravate your injury.

602
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,273
Sit somewhere else.
I want you out of my house.

603
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,283
I don't see it. It's not on the--

604
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,986
It's right here It's to the left I'm sorry
It's right there, right there, right there

605
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,271
- Afternoon
- Ain't no trouble out here

606
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,272
Except you forgot
your bishop was pinned

607
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,401
- Your bitch is mine
- Are these your chairs, gentlemen?

608
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,640
- Why? You wanna buy them?
- They're stolen property.

609
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:01,445
- You wanna tell us where you got 'em?
- We get our 1 0 bucks back?

610
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,319
Yeah, we can get you
your 1 0 bucks back

611
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,362
Damn

612
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,167
She finally
got away from Hank.

613
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,801
I saw that police flyer. I recognized
the bitch the second she walked in.

614
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,745
She started pulling out her gun.
I guess mine was a little faster.

615
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,783
We're gonna need to
take an official statement.

616
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:37,547
Okay. How long to
wheel her out ofhere?

617
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,614
- Excuse me?
- So I can reopen my store

618
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,770
Make yourself at home

619
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,741
- Not a scratch on him
- Against my better judgment

620
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,609
Now we can get our trial, and Koreatown
can see what we're trying to do

621
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,739
Might've lost
a few votes there today

622
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,614
I can afford to lose a few

623
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,187
Hey, listen

624
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,189

625
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,692
I'm gonna need some OT
About 1 5, 20 hours a week

626
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,388
I don't have any to give
Certainly not that much

627
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,591
My little one
has autism too

628
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,965
My boy and her are gonna
need private therapists

629
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,596
It's expensive

630
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,902
- I'm not sure what I can do
- If things come up--

631
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,911
security details, film jobs,
after-hours clubs--

632
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:39,744
If these things come up,
if you can think of me first?

633
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,841
You'll be spreading yourself
pretty thin

634
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:46,355
Look, this AGC sting operation's
important to me, the chief

635
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,858
- You can't afford to get sloppy once--
- I'm not gonna get sloppy

636
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,132
I'll see what I can do

637
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:05,003
- You're releasing him?
- He's sticking with his
''I found it on the street''story.

638
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,476
We'll look into his finances,
tap his phones, see who he calls

639
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,810
He's scared Stir things up,
see what drifts to the top

640
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,692

641
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,799

Are you okay?

642
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,803
You were quiet in there.

643
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,808
Yeah

644
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,835
- Work?

645
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,914
What happened today?

646
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,681
Nothing I'm fine

647
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,204
You told me not to leave
without saying good-bye.

648
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,900
That was four hours ago.

649
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,572
Let me see if I can make it
worth your while

650
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,790
This is so high school

651
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,193
I can get my sleeping bag

652
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,558
Meet me underneath
the grandstands later

653
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,626
- How's the schedule?
- You know what?

654
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,705
I'm gonna be in San Diego
next weekend

655
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,642
- Mm-hmm

656
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,309
- I'll call you when I can
- Okay

657
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,491
Sorry

658
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,691

659
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,028
That wasn't too unpleasant, huh?

660
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,035
Thanks for your help

661
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,129
And look-- look, I was--
I was serious about the concert, you know?

662
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,208
What kind of music
are you into?

663
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,377
Come on Listen-- Listen,
I get it, okay?

664
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,743
You're scared of getting
hooked up with a player, right?

665
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,816
But I'm not like that
I'd just-- No, listen

666
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,781
I would just like a chance
to get to know you

667
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,854
Are you serious,
or is this all part of the act?

668
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:35,551
I can't even believe
you'd ask me that I can't

669
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,628
Thanks again for your help

670
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,629
Okay

671
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,636

672
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,773
Come in
I'll buy you a drink

673
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,505
I didn't know there was
a reason to celebrate

674
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,215
To Matt and Megan
getting a therapist

675
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,678
Larry called They can have
someone here as soon as two weeks

676
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,257
That's great news

677
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,152
One of us is gonna need
to be here a lot more though

678
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,366
So, what are we gonna do?

679
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,774
How soon can you give notice?

680
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,738
Go ahead, say it
You expect it to be me

681
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,509
One of us
has to pay the bills

682
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,380
With overtime, I make plenty.
So why aren't you quitting?

683
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,823
Look, we gotta
get together on this

684
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,983
How does it feel
to get to be selfish?

685
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:47,291
Or don't you know because you're
''with the children as much as you can be''?

686
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,009
We both know you're
the best person to do this

687
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,885
Yeah

688
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,954
I know

689
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,885
Hey, man, where'd you go?

690
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,860
Took care of
some personal stuff

691
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:29,370
Uh, Vic, we just wanna explain
why we voted the way we did

692
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:33,773
- There's no need
- It's not like your kids aren't worth it. It's just--

693
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,971
I told you I'd respect
anything you guys decided

694
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,444
Besides, I've made other plans

695
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:49,788
Uh, hey, how about we grab
a beer then? I'm buying.

696
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:56,332
- Yeah? With your own money?
- Yeah, with my own money

697
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,028
I'm sorry I got some paperwork
I've gotta finish on Kim

698
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,740
See you tomorrow

699
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,841
How about you guys?

700
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,742
I got a wife
I gotta get back to

701
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,421
I hope you two are happy

702
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,563
We did the right thing

703
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,402
We did the right thing
