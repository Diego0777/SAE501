1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,698
What,you didn't hear, dude?
Shane's getting married!

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:11,467
Smokes for everyone
Get 'em while they're hot

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,514
- Dutch.
- This mean you're coming off the market?

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,711
He's a family man now
He's gonna be stuck at home with a rug rat

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,447
- You're having a kid?
I didn't know you were married
- I'm not.

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,455
Must've been
an immaculate conception.

8
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,117
Congratulations. Who is she?

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,855
- She your cousin?

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,763
- Vic.
- Amazing thing is she's not a stripper.

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,564
- How's Mara feeling?
- She's got morning sickness already

12
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,539
It's crazy, isn't it, man?
I'm gonna be a daddy

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,576
- Yeah

14
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,613
Listen, we haven't talked plans
I don't know We may just elope

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,808
But whatever we do,
I want you there

16
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,283
Absolutely

17
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,725
- Someone call for a detective?
- That was me

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,822
Mrs Mackey? I didn't
know you worked here

19
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,958
- I just started Corrine Mackey
- Oh.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,402
- Dutch Wagenbach You're Vic's wife, right?
- Yeah, technically

21
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,632
Dr. Genty asked me to call you.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,505
- Hi
- Hi
- Doctor

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,942
Patient came in with
a bad case of food poisoning

24
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,514
- It's his third time this month
- Fast food'll kill ya

25
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,381
- Especially when it's laced with thallium.
- Thallium. What's that?

26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,786
Poison-- odorless, colorless,
almost impossible to detect.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,757
Maybe someone's messing
with things at my grocery store

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,158
We'll look into that
We can check with the other hospitals

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,287
See if they have people
with similar symptoms

30
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,993
We'll need to go through your house, make
sure none of the packages were tampered with

31
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,003
Maybe it's a mix-up at the lab?
I mean, I feel better now

32
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,007
- We ran two different samples
- We have to ask, uh, but

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,100
did you try to poison yourself?

34
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,111
- God, no

35
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,737
- No cell phones here, please
- Okay

36
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,214
- Where did you eat today?
- Hello.

37
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,548
Home.
My brother stopped by. We had breakfast.

38
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,917
What about the other times
you got sick?

39
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,490
- Home, I think
- Your brother stop by then too?

40
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:10,393
Yeah He feels awful I give him shit
for being such a terrible cook

41
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,989
That was Aceveda.
You're on your own.

42
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,032
What's up?

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,073
I'm thinkin'
of transferring off the team

44
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,472
Why?

45
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,101
It's not as much fun
as I thought it'd be

46
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,012
- I'm not fitting in the way that I wanted
- You're wanted

47
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,584
- I know we're a tight bunch--
- There's no hard feelings

48
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,779
You're cool, but, uh--

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,250
Shane

50
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,658
- I need to be somewhere
where I can be the go-to guy
- Detective?

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,198
Just sit tight, okay?
I've got plans for you Trust me

52
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,462
Captain Aceveda and Detective Wyms
need to see you right away.

53
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,937
- 10-4, Mary-Queen 31--

54
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,238
Victim's Karen Rivas,
the homeless advocate.

55
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,281
She and her child were
apparently carjacked after a robbery

56
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,578
Fortunately, the baby's fine.

57
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,177
The owner and his son-- that's
three dead, including a public figure.

58
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,417
This is Claudette's case
Both teams will take her lead

59
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,221
Why both? We've knocked down
cases like this before

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,764
- So have they
- Don't worry, Mac-man
You can back us up at the arrest

61
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,356
We'll huddle in five.
You'll get your marching orders.

62
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,528
Random crime. No video.
Media attention.

63
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,039
- Lucky we're here
- Look, the boss ma'am's waiting

64
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,475
What do you say we, uh,
put down a few notes on this?

65
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,446
- First team to bring in the shooter wins
- Who needs money?

66
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,881
Why don't we put up something
that really counts, like your pride

67
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,715
All right, you guys lose,
Sasquatch here has to take a bath

68
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,619
- Better yet, how 'bout this?

69
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,592
- The losing team streaks through the Barn
- Very 1 97 4 of you

70
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,822
- You okay with that, Daddy?
- What sort ofbet is that?

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,091
- Put some money up
- Yeah, be a man

72
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,327
- Yeah.
- Real man puts his dignity on the line

73
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,996
What, afraid your boys
will fall short?

74
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,472
Look,you guys have ladies.
I got to be a gentleman, offer you an out.

75
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,100
Only ladies I see
are you pussies afraid to take this bet.

76
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,942
- Ooh! 
- All right You're on

77
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,017
- Oh, and yours are gonna be off
- Yeah, we'll see

78
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,712
Ripped by:

79
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,086
Hound

81
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,093
Rivas was driving a 1 999
white Mercedes S-420

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,168
Vic, put your guys on finding it

83
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,464
Get the license plate and VI N number
Put out an APB

84
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,766
- You got it
- Unis combed the crowd.

85
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,900
Of course, no one seems to have seen anything
Walon, you find somebody who has

86
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,979
Annie, hit this crowd up again
Trish, across the street

87
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,070
- Eddie, hit the neighboring stores
- Male Hispanic.

88
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,776
Two of the cases inside were cleared out
Maybe the shooter was
looking for something special

89
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,150
Or maybe he couldn't get into the cash
register, took something so it wasn't a bust.

90
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,691
- Check the records See if something's missing
- Ronnie, you play bookworm

91
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,192
I know a fence who'll buy anything
Maybe the stuffll end up there

92
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,889
Good Find out what's missing
and then take Shane

93
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,488
Better yet, I'll get out there right now,
start hitting the fences

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,229
- Ronnie, call me with the info
- I'll come with you Let us know

95
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,498
Good luck

96
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,574
If the killer dumped the car,
it'll turn up.

97
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,439
Since he didn't get the till,
maybe he flipped it for a few bucks

98
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,741
- Let's hit the chop shops, see what breaks
- Good Report anything to me

99
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,213
- 'Kay.

100
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,512
Already got a witness

101
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,816
It was horrible
I-I heard shots

102
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,686
and then I saw this white guy
and this black girl run out

103
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,354
And they jacked this lady's car, shot her
dead, and threw her baby to the curb

104
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:36,060
And all I could do was scream
for somebody to call 9 1 1.

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,262

106
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,931
How come you didn't report
what you saw to us immediately?

107
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,270
I went home to change first,
put some makeup on

108
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,278
- Why?
- I saw all the cameras I need the tape

109
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,712
I been out here for six months
with nothing to show for it

110
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,410
- You can't land a gig without tape
- You're an actress?

111
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,315
You have any idea how tough it is?

112
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,888
Aren't you worried these killers
now know you can identify them?

113
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,480
- They don't know my name
- It's on the news, right?

114
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,028
- But they won't know where I live
- Are you in the phone book?

115
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,732
Y'all are gonna
protect me, right?

116
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,068
- Edixon?
- All right

117
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,835
Yo, Ronnie says the Decoy Squad
brought in some other witnesses

118
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,639
Aceveda's definitely
auditioning them to replace us

119
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,579
- Yeah, won't let it happen, man
- Damn straight Edixon!

120
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,843
Hey!

121
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,146
Edixon!

122
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,153
Hey, it's getting harder
to find you.

123
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,520
Took me all of two phone calls
today to track you down

124
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,356

125
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,092

126
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,269
- No lo visto.
- ¿No lo visto?

127
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,203
- No

128
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,207
- No Mercedes, huh?
- No, no Mercedes, no

129
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,539
- Nada

130
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,614
¿Nada?

131
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,377
Awww!
Not another chop shop, Edixon

132
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,384
Who's stealing for you?
Evil churro vendor?

133
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,546
- Policia! Now!
- Now

134
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,090
Hey, hey, bro.

135
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,820
- If I find Mercedes, I call, okay?
- Not good enough

136
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,362
You're gonna tell everyone that
you're looking to buy Pay top dollar

137
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,030
- ¿Claro?

138
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,034

139
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,863
- Yo
- Tavon, yo

140
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,577
- This is my partner, Shane
- What up?

141
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,943
Listen,
we're looking for some things

142
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,449
- They were taken from Ling's over on Fifth
- Mm, saw it on the news

143
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,249
Can't say I'm sorry
Those rat slants always did outbid me

144
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,518
Still, that's a rough way
to go out ofbusiness.

145
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,957
- Haven't seen any of it
- You sure?

146
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,621
'Cause if you already shelled out cash
for it, maybe you wouldn't want to say

147
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,925
Yeah, I'm sure

148
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,831
- What you doing back there?
- Like my partner says

149
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,268
just looking for a little
stolen bling-bling--

150
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,101
- stuff involved in a triple murder
- And I don't have it

151
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,042
- Yeah, what do you have?
- Yo, man, what's up with partner-boy?

152
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,876
Hey, Shane, Meaty's cool
If he says it ain't here, it ain't

153
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,677
- Shit!
- Got a license to sell these?

154
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,348
Serial numbers filed off
There's four in the box

155
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,324
Look, asshole,
I said I didn't see your shit.

156
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,692
- Now, leave mine alone
- Oh,yeah? You're under arrest.

157
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,255
- Turn around, skinny Let's go
- Hey, hey, Shane Come on What are you doing?

158
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,234
- Being an asshole
- Come on If it turns up, he'll call

159
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,170
- Not anymore
- See?

160
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,207
You gonna stand there?
Can I get a help, please?

161
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,904
Your cuffs, man
One pair just isn't doing it for this cat

162
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,306
Don't worry. There's thousands more.

163
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,011
Can we finish this later?
My 1 5 minutes are ticking away

164
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,256
- Sit down
- The truth is, I saw the sister good

165
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,020
But the white guy with her, they all
sort of-- It's hard to differentiate

166
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,722
- You know what I'm saying?
- Keep looking

167
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,699
- City just posted a $5,000 reward
- Reward?

168
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,772
We got a few chop shops
paying top dollar for '99 Benzes

169
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,933
If our shooters dump it,
my CI's will call

170
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,943
What about
the missing pawn items?

171
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,036
Ronnie just went through
the robbery victim's ledger

172
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,138
Turns out all the missing
items were jewelry

173
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,412
pawned by the same guy--
Dean Warrison

174
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,215
Maybe he came back for his stuff

175
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,554
Yeah, we went by his place,
but he moved out months ago.
Trying to track down his new crib.

176
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,754
We're also trying to figure out
who the Bonnie is to his Clyde

177
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,990
Robbery, breaking and entering,
drug possession

178
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,226
- That the man?
- Mmm

179
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,235
He's white Could be

180
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,501
He feels good I'm going to release the make
and model of the car to the press

181
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,803
let them know
we have two suspects

182
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,073
How's the Decoy Squad doing?

183
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,014
Rivas's AmEx card was used
about an hour ago at a gas station

184
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,051
Walon's talking
to the station clerk now

185
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,918
Kevin, you're here because
someone's trying to kill your brother.

186
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,654
We found traces of a deadly poison,
thallium, in Robert's stomach

187
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,424
Uh, that doesn't sound right

188
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,764
Especially since this is the third time
this month he's been hospitalized for it

189
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,635
Y-You-You think
he's trying to kill himself?

190
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,538
That's an interesting theory
Let's think it through

191
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,373
Robert's got a decent-paying job
He's been there for 1 2 years

192
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,846
He owns his house: seems to have
a lot of friends: no trouble dating:

193
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,544
- healthy--
- Besides the food poisoning

194
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,451
Besides the food poisoning
So

195
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,820
why would a guy like that
try to kill himself?

196
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,695
Depression?

197
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,764
Let's consider my theory

198
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,892
You're unemployed: been to rehab:
you're broke--

199
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,131
You really don't have a lot going on

200
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,174
But Robert made you
his insurance beneficiary

201
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,402
Then he suffers a rash of poisonings...

202
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,139
all after you come over
to cook food for him.

203
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,115
- A-A guy can't cook his brother breakfast
- Look at the facts, Kevin

204
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,482
You cook He gets poisoned

205
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,714
It's a little perspicuous,
don't you think?

206
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,883
You don't know what
''perspicuous'' means, do you?

207
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,759
You think you're smart enough to lie to me?

208
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,198
You think you're smart enough to convince
me you had nothing to do with this?

209
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,871
''Perspicuous'' means obvious

210
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,876
Oh, well, it's obvious you're a dick.

211
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,582

212
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,981
Talked to one of Dean Warrison's
drug buddies

213
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,553
Hadn't seen him for a while but
heard he moved in with some black girl

214
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,646
- Our Bonnie? What's the address?
- Still working on it

215
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,419
Well, work harder.
Our killer's running around out there...

216
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,291
and I don't wanna be running
around in here buck naked

217
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,694
Hell, I got nothin'
to be embarrassed about

218
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,666
- If I'd known, I'd have waxed my back
- I've seen you in the shower

219
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,363
- It's not your back you need to be worried about
- We gotta ID the girl

220
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,440
His jacket said that he was in rehab

221
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,566
- Run that down Maybe they met there
- All right

222
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,577
I've been fielding calls from chop shops all day
Nothing so far

223
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,910
Take the mug shot around to local motels
See if he's holed up somewhere

224
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:01,248
- Yeah, that's a good idea Whose mug shot?
- Nobody

225
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,811
- Oh, that's cold
- Not as cold as you're gonna be

226
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,758
I'm gonna crank up the AC
in the clubhouse so your sac shrinks

227
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,697
I'll shrink your sac

228
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,994
Detective? You know Carlos

229
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,299
Ah, Daily News?

230
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,102
Carlos is going to be covering our investigation
for a piece in the Sunday magazine

231
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,268
He's to have unlimited access

232
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,040
- How'd you get that assignment?
- It was your captain's idea

233
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,877
Sir, chief of police is on the phone.

234
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,120
Tell him I'll call him back

235
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,290
Have a seat

236
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,291
We'll get you started in a minute.

237
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,457
- I know you like the limelight--
- It's not about me

238
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,900
A Good Samaritan gets killed
while running errands?

239
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,701
It feeds into everyone's
bad perceptions about Farmington

240
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,641
And how's his piece gonna read
if this case doesn't get solved?

241
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,510
- We have a suspect We're going to solve this
- It's never a slam dunk

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,016
You said you have everything
you need to crack this

243
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,451
So let's turn
this press coverage into a positive.

244
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,951
See about getting you three square meals

245
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,994
- Vic.
- What's up?

246
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,588
Shane arrested my CI
He ruined a five-year relationship

247
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,964
- and he's trying to make me look like a punk
- All right, all right, all right

248
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,061
- What's goin' on?
- Caught Fatboy Slim here

249
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,300
filing serial numbers
off a few handguns

250
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,903
- What's this have to do with our triple homicide?
- Nothing!

251
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,879
He's got his head up his ass,
and I told him-- back off

252
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,449
Hey,you don't tell me anything. I tell you.

253
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,510
- When Vic's not around, I am in charge
- My lead My guy

254
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,714
You believe this?

255
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,122
- Kick him
- Kick him?

256
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,026
I don't have time for bullshit! We're trying
to catch a killer before the Decoy Squad does.

257
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,657
- Sorry, brother.
- No need You ain't the bitch

258
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,962
Hey, I just did you a favor!

259
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,061
You open your mouth one more time,
you'll be begging me to only lock you up

260
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,164
Now get out! Get out!
Take your shit!

261
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:17,078
- What was that about?
- Passionate people having a difference of opinion

262
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,089
Trust me, it works

263
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,055
Can I speak to you?

264
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,429
Guess I'll take advantage
of that unlimited access

265
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,872
I, uh-- I went a little too far
with the poisoning victim's brother

266
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,966
- How'd you do that?
- Because you were down here
with your photo shoot

267
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,978
- and I was up there by myself
- Oh, so it's my fault?

268
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,447
Well, I-- I was trying something new.

269
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,179
Tryin' a, you know,
a curve ball to my fastball

270
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,152
Don't tell me you played bad cop

271
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,248
- You weren't up there to stop me!
- I knew you could handle this

272
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,384
Ninety percent of the time,yes.

273
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,691
But 1 0 percent, there's a connection

274
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,163
We-- It's like you--

275
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,998
Please, don't say I complete you

276
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,068
Go up there and give it
one more shot

277
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,167
- You go to a doctor!

278
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,443
- You coming?
- Yeah

279
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,076
- It's Julien's house

280
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,423
We got a call about a disturbance
Can we come in?

281
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,699
Sure

282
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,875
- Hey,Julien
- How you doin'?

283
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,484
- Maybe we should go?
- No! No, it's okay.

284
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,179
It was just verbal
I didn't realize it had gotten that loud

285
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,156
- Actually, the call came from this address
- What?

286
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,827
- Randall
- Ra--

287
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,463
Randall? Randall

288
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,203
Did you call 9 1 1, honey?

289
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,899
Baby, I'm sorry!
We didn't mean to scare you.

290
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,500
Mind if I speak to the boy, ma'am?

291
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,478
- Go ahead.
- I'm gonna have to talk to Vanessa

292
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,722
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

293
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,122
Are you feeling
threatened or unsafe?

294
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,126
Lord, no No

295
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,727
Look, everything is fine.

296
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,357
He has been through so much,
and it's hard on him.

297
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,096
The shame, the stress,
the surgery just--

298
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,799
- Surgery?
- For-For his back, after the beating.

299
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,432
He's already had one,
and it still hurts him.

300
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,977
He might need another one.

301
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,513
- I didn't know

302
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,574
Randall just got scared That's all

303
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,813
We're all right

304
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,987
The Decoy Squad got a call
from a motel clerk who saw the car

305
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,824
- They're talking with him now
- I got one better

306
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,058
Got an ID on Dean Warrison's
roommate The black female?

307
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,727
- Her name is Danielle Riggs
- You show the picture to the witness?

308
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,101
Positively ID'd her
as one of the carjackers

309
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,004
- Nice work
- Thanks More to do

310
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,943
- What was that before? Tavon and Shane?
- It's just two dogs humping

311
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,538
Well, if you can't pry them loose,
I can get my hose out

312
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,107
- I can handle it
- Because the Decoy Squad is working very well

313
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,653
I don't want any worries
with your team

314
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,759
Who's there? What, man, what?

315
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,324

316
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,833

317
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,241
You know they ain't in there!

318
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,370
I saw 'em both leave early
this morning

319
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,512
Check it out

320
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,622
Is this Danielle?
That her?

321
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,659
Yeah, that's her
She left with the white boy

322
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,854
- Damn it!
- All clear.

323
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,404
Here you go

324
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,633
Robert's gonna stay
in the hospital overnight

325
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,904
Just for observation,
it's nothing to worry about

326
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,948
So, uh, listen

327
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,348
I spoke to him again

328
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,183
He, uh--
He really cares about you

329
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,258
Practically threw me out ofhis room
when he found out we were talking to you.

330
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,591
- Hmm
- I can see there's a real bond there.

331
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,257
He says, uh, you've really
been trying hard lately

332
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,766
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

333
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,930
- You've blown a few opportunities in the past.

334
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,939
He's needed to bail you out.

335
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,669
He says it's added up
to 1 5 grand over the years

336
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,405
It's only 1 4 If the other investors
hadn't gotten cold feet

337
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,982
and pulled out, then, you know--

338
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,108
So you're, what,
one of these guys who, uh

339
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,187
it doesn't work out,
you just blame someone else? 

340
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,987
And you're one of these guys who's always
just a dick? 

341
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,754
I saw you and Lucas responded
to a domestic atJulien's

342
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,765
- How did you know about that?
- New policy

343
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,930
Any 91 1 call at an officer's
home address is flagged

344
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,602
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it was nothing

345
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,703
Then why didn't you
put in the report?

346
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,476
I brought you back
to be straight with me

347
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,984
I thought our deal
was if I saw anything

348
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,782
All I saw was
a husband-wife argument

349
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,983
and a kid who got scared
and called 91 1

350
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,992
No special treatment

351
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:03,030
There's a complaint againstJulien
for excessive force and now this

352
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:07,196
- Should I be worried for him?
- I'll talk to him I'll let you know

353
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,467
Lem and Tavon
are sitting on the apartment.

354
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,736
Shane and Ronnie are
running down the girl's family

355
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:16,610
- If they're still in town, we're gonna nail 'em
- You won't have to look far

356
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,242
- We got him.
- Interrogation one

357
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,688
- You brought in our guy?
- Looks that way

358
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,657
- How'd you find him?
- Claudette gave us his sheet
I saw the drug possessions bust

359
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,496
We followed up, discovered
a treatment program he attended

360
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,697
We sat on
a few methadone clinics and bingo

361
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,872
- You busted him based on my tip
- Yeah

362
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:49,038
Oh, speaking of tips, uh,
give us a little preview-- cut or uncut?

363
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,186
Heard about the shooting
at the pawnshop, Dean?

364
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,882
Not really, no

365
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,050
Three people dead, shooter runs out
with a bunch of jewelry--

366
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,184
chains, rings, bracelets

367
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,195
All stuff you hocked

368
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,289
Just put him at the scene already

369
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,235
Got a witness
who saw you run out the store

370
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,397
- I wasn't there
- Sure you were

371
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,407
You and Danielle

372
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,680
I didn't go in that shop

373
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,115
It was Danielle
and my friend, Crazyhouse

374
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,245
- ''Crazyhouse''
- Danielle's boyfriend.

375
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,222
Got out of prison a couple months ago

376
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,259
He shot those people
Not me

377
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,388
Make me believe.

378
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,057
- I drove them there,
but I stayed in the car.
- He's not the shooter

379
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,100
Yeah, I believe him
Start stripping

380
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,432
I been staying with Danielle
Haven't been hitting her though

381
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,768
Needed some cash,
so I hocked a few things

382
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,399
- She didn't even miss 'em
- Get to it

383
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,138
Crazyhouse gets out, starts asking
about the jewelry he gave her

384
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,714
I fessed up He freaked out

385
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,750
Made me drive them to the shop
I stayed in the car

386
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,718
- When I heard shots, I jumped, man
- Damn!

387
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,449
Man, he must've jacked
that car after I split

388
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,126
And I didn't know
he was gonna kill no one.

389
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,529
- He's not the shooter.
- He's an accomplice.

390
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,691
- We said the shooter
- I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

391
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,532
We've got the killer's
name and his girl Find them

392
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,404
- You're welshing?
- The bet was who'd find the shooter first

393
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,976
That guy's the driver
Are you welshing?

394
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,878
- Okay Bet's still on

395
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,483
Yeah

396
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,577
Yeah

397
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,453
Oh, got a little tip
about the missing car See ya

398
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,652
Eddie, it's half now,
halflater. That's always been our deal.

399
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,059
Police Hands up Up

400
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,998
Lookin' for someone?

401
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
I hear you're
lookin' to ditch a '99 Benz

402
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,936
Uh-- Uh, sorry
Can't help you Right, Eddie?

403
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,473
Don't shoot.
Who are you?

404
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,237
Oh, God.
Cut the crap. You set me up.

405
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,539
You're making an awful mistake

406
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,547
I don't think so.
I know who you are.

407
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,643
Long-lost friend
Tryin' to dump off Rivas's car

408
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,417
She might be able to lead
us to the shooters

409
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,617
How come you never called?

410
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,360
Hey, Vic.

411
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,696
- Thought you forgot my name.

412
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,929
- Welcome back
- Yeah

413
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,267
- How's it goin'?
- It's good

414
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,273
I hear you're mentoring
Julien, sort of

415
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,001
- What's going on?
- Nothin'

416
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,741
- You looking out for him?
- I just told Julien to stand up for himself

417
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,374
You mean like with Carlson
and his broken arm

418
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,750
I don't know how
Carlson broke his arm

419
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,982
I just know that no one's
gonna be giving Julien

420
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,821
another blanket party anytime soon

421
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,991
So, I hear you're going
to the city council

422
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,761
I just won the primary

423
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,859
The general election
isn't for a few months

424
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,134
Oh, yeah, but you're
running unopposed, right?

425
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,371
You can wait till all the votes are in before
making me the second Mrs Aceveda

426
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,880
Well, I'm sure the first Mrs. Aceveda
will have an objection or two.

427
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,543
Are your suspects usually so flirty?

428
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,816
- No Who are you?
- We're looking for two killers,
the same people that...

429
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,982
jacked that car
you were trying to sell

430
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,959
They left three people dead
Where are they?

431
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,962
I understand there's a reward?

432
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,898
- For information leading to their arrest
- I don't know where they are.

433
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,595
I mean,
I just work for a car broker

434
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,138
They called, said they were looking
to dump a '99 Benz

435
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,140
I heard Edixon was buying--

436
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,143
I mean, I didn't know it was the ride
you were looking for till I was arrested

437
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,839
So you never spoke to these people?

438
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,314
No

439
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,977
But I can tell you
where the car is

440
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:53,752
I was careful. You know, all that pristine
evidence,just sitting there.

441
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,853
- And what will it cost me?
-Just the reward, up front.

442
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,296
And my boss and I walk

443
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,630
Hasn't talked to our shooters? Please
She knows more than she's saying

444
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,636
We've got to find that car

445
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,206
- I'm going to give her immunity
- Then kick her

446
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,298
Let me follow her
See what angle she's playing

447
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,502
Heard you got a lead on the vehicle
Need us to run it down?

448
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,604
Sure. Car thiefjust
gave up the car. Give me a sec...

449
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,082
I'll give you the exact location

450
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:20,285
- Where have you been?
- Working a triple murder

451
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,810
- Where have you been?
- Working a triple murder

452
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,152
- Can't get anywhere with the brother
He hates me
- What about the evidence?

453
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,783
- Did you go through the house?
- There's no trace of thallium anywhere

454
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,091
If he doesn't confess, he's gonna
walk out of here and do it again

455
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,462
Robert totally trusts him He can't
believe his brother poses any threat

456
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,297
What do you want me to do?

457
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,564
Let's recapitulate

458
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,539
Your brother is the success

459
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,339
You are not.

460
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,140
Your brother has lots of money

461
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,912
You're in the negative

462
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,853
Your brother is a well-adjusted,
caring individual

463
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:01,824
You are fratricidal
Which means

464
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,827
you're goin'tojail.

465
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,298
Is that perspicuous enough for you?

466
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,392
''Perspicuous'' You remember,
or should I get a dictionary?

467
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,494

468
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,937
- What the hell's going on?
- I'm interrogating a suspect

469
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,338
What is this shit?

470
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,879
Would you step outside?

471
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,722
Sorry. He's got an uncle
higher up on the force.

472
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,731
- We can't get rid of him
- She's just playing him I got here on merit

473
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,961
I've been doing this job
a lot longer than he has.

474
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,131
And he's always trying to teach me something,
like I don't know what I'm doin'

475
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,643
Sorry. I get worked up
just thinkin'about it.

476
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,846
- I get it
- Oh,yeah?

477
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,678
- I know someone like that
- No offense

478
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,810
he can't possibly be this bad

479
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,221

480
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,292
So what are you gonna do
about Tavon?

481
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,061
Booting the one black guy
we have on the team

482
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,392
Booting the one black guy
we have on the team

483
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,260
isn't going to win us any
favors with a Hispanic captain...

484
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,426
a black chief
or a black nanny

485
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,561
- Besides, we need him.
- For what?

486
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,199
He's an outsider.
He keeps us sharp about the money train.

487
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,472
Bullshit.
We never needed him before.

488
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,037
It's my call.
Live with it.

489
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:43,656
- All right now, this could be it

490
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,568
Man, she's fast

491
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,577
All right
Move in, boys Move in

492
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,738
- Copy that.

493
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,685
- Get out. Hands up!
- Get outta the car!

494
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,254
- Outta the car!
- Get out!

495
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,619
Against the car!

496
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,659
Man, twice in one day!

497
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,955
Damn! It's a good thing
we're friends, huh?

498
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,463
- Is that your car?
- No, but I have immunity

499
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,966
- No, not on this one, you don't
- Vic!

500
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,334
You talked to the shooter
Now save the snow jobs for Aceveda

501
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,101
because I will press charges on this

502
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,042
They sold us the stolen Mercedes.
They need a new car to get out of town.

503
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,113
Hon,just let me
handle this, okay?

504
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,274
Look, we were gonna do the deal,
and then we were gonna turn them in I swear

505
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,614
So they were gonna pay you
for stolen wheels...

506
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,951
- and you were gonna get the reward?
- Somethin' like that

507
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,048
I got a new plan

508
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,660
- Man, I hope these two idiots don't blow it
- I'd worry about Chucklehead

509
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,432
- The future Mrs Aceveda'll do just fine
Gimme a second

510
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,803
- Yeah
- Vic, Cassidy's missing!

511
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,307
- What?
- She's missing

512
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,435
The babysitter thought
she was in her bedroom

513
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,809
- but when I got home, she's gone
- Did she run away?

514
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,882
- I think so
- Call the police

515
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,315
They're on their way over

516
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,979
I'll be right there
Cassidy's missing

517
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,079
- Shit, man. What do we do?
-Just get these guys!

518
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,681
Hey, wait a second, man
Who's-- Who's in charge?

519
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,353
We're a team
Just get it done

520
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,926
- Any word?
- I called all her friends No one's seen her

521
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,972
- Did you set up a perimeter?
- We have six units on it

522
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,736
Juvenile detectives have been notified
They're en route to set up a command center

523
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,970
Good Okay

524
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,675
- Her bike's missing
- Oh, good Probably means she left on her own

525
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,513
- Where would she go?
- I don't know

526
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,246
- Think!
- I'm thinking

527
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,117
- Were you here?
- Yes

528
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,621
- Did you hear anything?
- No

529
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,919
- Nothing? What were you doing?
- No.

530
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,620
- Vic!
- I was workin' with Matthew

531
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,089
- Let's go find her

532
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,806
What are you doing here?

533
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,844
Aceveda called in extra units
until those killers are in custody

534
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,350
Hey,Julien. You think maybe
you came back too early?

535
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,353
What?

536
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,787
Maybe you should've
stayed on disability some more.

537
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,689
Vanessa worries too much

538
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,196
Look, things are good for me now.
Better than they've ever been--

539
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,100
- here, at home
- I was at your home.

540
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,469
Come on,Julien
You're not yourself

541
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,065
I am

542
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,009
Yeah? Well, what happened
to Carlson then?

543
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,418
He got hurt

544
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,653

545
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,696
Yo, Ronnie. That's them.

546
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,383
- Gun!
- Shit! He blew it!

547
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,976
Everybody out of the way!
Everybody down!

548
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,420

549
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,684
We know she's your girlfriend, man.
Just let her go.

550
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,454
- I'll still kill her
- Okay

551
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,656
You got a car, man
Just go Go, man

552
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,392
- Ohh!

553
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,968
- Don't move!
- Get on your stomach! On your stomach!

554
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,402
- Hands out! Palms up!
- Bring 'em around! I got him.

555
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,031
- Get your ass up
- Yeah, let's go

556
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:55,101
- Was she upset or something?
- I told her she couldn't go
to Piper's for a sleepover

557
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,977
She lost it But I told her that
we were gonna talk about it tonight

558
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,573
- after I got home from work
- I thought you were taking night shifts?

559
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,177
- This was OT
- And then this happens

560
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,884
- Camilla was there.
And Owen was with Matthew.
- I don't even know Owen

561
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,120
And-And-And who the hell is Camilla?
Jesus Christ, Corrine--

562
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,460
We're getting a divorce!
I need to work! This is not my fault!

563
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,659
- Whose is it then?
- Vic, shut up

564
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,862
Just shut up!

565
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,773
- I didn't do it

566
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,511

567
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,676
Wha-- Wh-Wh-What is it?

568
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,880
It's a qua--

569
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,981
drophenia report

570
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,221
Positive traces of thallium
were found in your kitchen.

571
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,390
I didn't have any thallium
in my kitchen

572
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,165
Then how do you explain that?

573
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,696

574
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,543
Yeah, what--
What happens now?

575
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,550
Dutch gets his name in the papers

576
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,849
Egomaniac roped in a reporter
to do a story on him

577
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,288
- He's in the building
- So everybody'll know he busted me?

578
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,293
He was assigned the case.
He gets credit.

579
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,397
Well, uh--

580
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,669
What if I tell you what happened?

581
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,935
I guess that I'd get the credit

582
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,782
Well, it's not like you think.

583
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,353
I mean, I knew I could never pay
Robert back all that money

584
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,688
And the thallium, it just-- it--

585
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,354
it just seemed easier
than disappointing him again

586
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,803
- There! There!
- Stop Stop!

587
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,804

588
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,844
- Cass! Are you okay?
- Yep

589
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,876
Cass?

590
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,547
All right
Come on Let's go

591
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,360
Cassidy

592
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,462
Let's go!

593
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,469
Right now!

594
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,112
I decided to partner you up again

595
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,015
I thought Tommy and I
were doing well together, sir

596
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,988
You two have a history. This made more sense
for me. Do you have a problem with this?

597
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,191
Not ifJulien doesn't

598
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,661
Trust me. This'll work.

599
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,460
You'll start
riding together tomorrow.

600
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,933
Yes, sir

601
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,364

602
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,175
- How's Cass, man?
- She's good

603
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,577
Looks like you guys
didjust fine without me.

604
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,116
- Oh,yeah!
- That's right.

605
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,118

606
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,183
Lookee what we got

607
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,265
Now you can get
the chief on the phone

608
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,174
- The shooter's in custody?
- Oh! It's chilly in here

609
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,835
Somebody turn up
the air conditioning?

610
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,003
- How'd you find 'em?
- By runnin' my ass off

611
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,241
Wyms had us going over
the stolen car looking for nose hairs.

612
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,184
So, how 'bout a preview,
bikini or Brazilian?

613
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,825
- Hey
- Hey

614
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,564
It's good stuff out there today
Avoided a shoot-out at the swap meet

615
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,833
- Could've got real ugly
- It's no biggie

616
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,841
Yes, it was.

617
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,843
It was great work.

618
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,072
Hey, you don't
have to go overboard

619
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,479
I do when I'm about
to ask someone a big favor.

620
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,216
- I need you to work it out with Shane
- Tell him

621
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,555
You could be the bigger man here
I dig what you do

622
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,255
- And Shane--
- He's a cracker with 'tude

623
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,593
He's just acting out,
'cause you're good

624
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,963
Help me make him feel secure

625
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,060
- Send him to a shrink
- I'm gonna talk to him too

626
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,071
But I'm asking you--

627
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,074
Take one for the team here, for me

628
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,047

629
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,049
Shit

630
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,721
Babe, what are we doing?

631
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:19,825
Maybe it's God's plan for us
just to have Randall

632
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,371
I want my own child too

633
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,237
- With you
- Randall is your child.

634
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:29,143
A man like Shane Vendrell can get
his woman pregnant without even trying

635
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,546
-Jesus!
- We're trying

636
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,711
- We'll just-- We'll keep trying
- You know what I mean

637
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,688
You're not comfortable I don't want
to start another fight about this

638
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,489
No fight I will go to the doctor,
and I will see what I can do

639
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,097
Two cases in one day
You're on a roll

640
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:56,105
You're the one who solved the poisoning
I was just your pawn

641
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,040
That's one way oflooking at it, I guess.

642
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,579
So, what's your story?

643
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,308
You running your two teams,
or are you

644
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,680
still a measly detective with me?

645
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:12,518
- I'm whatever you need me to be
- What if I need you to complete me?

646
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,523
Please don't say that

647
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:16,727

648
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,753

649
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,731
- Hey.
- Hey.

650
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,064
- What's goin' on?
- Your baby, man

651
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,138
Congratulations
I can't feel anything

652
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,230
Looks like
you're feeling somethin'

653
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,906
Look, man, um

654
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,878
- I was hoping we could talk
- Yeah, what about?

655
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,613
Figured we could, uh, work some shit out

656
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,619
How you feelin'?

657
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,122
As long as I have ginger ale
and crackers, I'm fine.

658
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,124
- Yeah
- Yeah

659
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:54,930
- So, you want anything?
- Just to clear the air

660
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,792
I'm gonna go check on the laundry

661
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,606
- Bye
- Thanks

662
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,913

663
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:22,721
All right Look
The Strike Team, that's your gig, okay?

664
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,422
You and Vic,you established it.
Everyone knows that.

665
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:32,729
- I just want to add what I can to the mix
- I appreciate that

666
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,067
But I don't wanna be along
for the ride if I'm not wanted

667
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,771
I wasn't tryin' to be a dick

668
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,071
But me and Vic built this thing

669
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,874
and I don't want somebody
coming in and screwing it up

670
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,717
I won't

671
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,188
You comin' here and apologizin',
I get that

672
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,589
Just as long as you know your place,
we'll be all right.

673
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,186
My place, huh?
What, like the back of the bus?

674
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,601
What, you think
you're driving the bus?

675
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,296
Damn it, Shane, you know what? He-He
doesn't want to hurt your little feelings

676
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,206
- But Vic has plans for me
- He's my best friend

677
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,673
- But Vic has plans for me
- He's my best friend

678
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,868
He's been my best best friend
for seven years

679
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,241
You really think he's gonna
push me aside for some darkie?

680
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,941

681
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:30,125

682
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,322
- Get off

683
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,231
- Stop!

684
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,734

685
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,399

686
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,276

687
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,150
- Where you going?
- No! No! No!

688
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,423
- Where you going? Come here
- No No

689
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,431
- No No Stop!
- Come here! Come here!

690
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,433
- Let go of me!
- Baby, please!

691
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,629
- Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!
- No No

692
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,071
Please Oh, my God

693
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,973

694
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,844

695
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,277
I wanted you to know.
That little problem before?

696
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,290
- All taken care of
- Good

697
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,020
My guys did good today

698
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,119
Just as long as they keep
their clothes on

699
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,221
Oh, you heard about that, huh?

700
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,826
Little wager--
good incentive for a great job

701
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,872
- Lucky you didn't lose
- I wasn't worried

702
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,033
No Lucky for us you didn't lose

703
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,077

704
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,069
Call 91 1 , man
Somebody

705
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,838

This way, please

706

Let's go
Keep moving

707
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,946
- Cage is clear Give 'em a two-minute warning

708
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,221
- Hello?
- I spoke to Cassidy's teacher.

709
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,458
You know, the usual
''this is normal in a divorce kind of stuff''

710
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,433
- Well, what do we do now?
- We all need to sit down together

711
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,970
and work it out with a counselor

712
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,235
Listen, uh,
this wasn't your fault

713
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,473
- I was just-- I was out of my mind

714
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,845
- I know
- Okay Um--

715
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,580
- I'm just glad she's home
- Me too

716
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,124
- Okay

719
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,636
God

720
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,575
What's up with that?

722
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,914
- Yeah!
- Work it, Walon! Work it!

723
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,684
Work that mother, man!

724
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,884

725
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:29,223
I cannot believe that Shane
and Tavon just missed that
