1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,099

2
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,044

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,122

4
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,318
- Daddy.
- Okay, honey. Okay.

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,990
It's okay. I'm here.
Let me see.

6
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,896
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,138
What happened?

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,641
I was in the bathroom,
and they had some soup on the stove

9
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,337
Matthew got ahold of
some cooking spray and--

10
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,040
- Where is he?
- My mom took him and Megan

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,640
He didn't know
what he was doing

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,519
Uh, hey Uh, listen

13
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,615
- Thanks for all your help
- Close call.

14
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,694
If your wife hadn't grabbed
that fire extinguisher

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,763
- this whole place could have burnt up
- Uh-huh

16
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,195
Yeah, you know what?
I, uh--

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,928
I left the stove on too high,
and the grease just went whoosh

18
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,335
Why don't you get some stuff together?
You and the kids are coming to my place

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,467
- Vic
- You can't stay here
Help your mom pack up, please

20
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,348
Listen, I, uh-- I think we both know
that this wasn't a grease fire

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,250
- Yeah. I just need to determine
if it was set intentionally.
- It wasn't.

22
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,951
I have a young boy
who has developmental problems

23
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,857
His mom is worried sick about him
He was just playing where he shouldn't be

24
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,259
He's only seven years old

25
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,958
I'm sure I can write
this up as an accident

26
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,434
I appreciate it
Thank your boys for me, okay?

27
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,062
Oh, uh

28
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,698
You ever need a favor

29
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,883
Hey, hear you're talking now

30
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:09,724
You're that new nurse here for my
sponge bath, right?

31
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,957
We lost you to the twilight zone
there for a few weeks, man

32
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,469
Doctor says you can
start rehab pretty soon

33
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,437
I'll be back riding
with you guys in a minute

34
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,205
Everybody misses you

35
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,473
You remember much?

36
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,085
The last thing I can see is

37
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,087
getting into it with Shane

38
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,957
You remember that?

39
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,419
I just remember
fighting with him

40
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,629
We got our first good hit
off the AGC surveillance

41
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,866
We've been monitoring the bugs
and cameras planted in four cars

42
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,740
Mainly just blunts and blow jobs
But, uh, some pretty good prelim intel

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,144
Chiefs been asking why we've sunk a ton into
this sting and haven't come up with anything.

44
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,307
Well, this ought to cure
his blue balls Check it out

45
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,145
What's up?

46
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,553
All right

47
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,958
Here's half the money
You're gonna get the rest after

48
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,691
After tomorrow night,
you guys will be long gone.

49
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,097
Hey, man
The Horde's good for it

50
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,638
That's Jantell Davis He's a player
with the Spookstreet Souljahs

51
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,638
Jesse Ventura here
is with The Horde.

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,731
The biker gang?

53
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:34,108
- What are the Aryans doing with
a black banger in Farmington?
- It's no Rainbow Coalition

54
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,944
Horde rolls into town to do a job

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,780
They grease the natives
Nobody's feathers get ruffled

56
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,820
Deal was probably
brokered in the joint

57
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,721
- What's the job?
- Uh, we don't know what the target is

58
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,194
Just that it's going down tonight,
and Jantell's providing getaway and layoff cars.

59
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,662
-The Horde's got a pretty violent history
-Yeah, no joke

60
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,496
They dropped two bank guards
last week in Sacramento

61
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,832
- So this is all we have?
- At the moment

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,603
So how do we find out the when and where
without exposing to them and the other marks

63
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,611
that we're bugging
A.G.C. 's cars?

64
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,806
It's gonna be a balancing act

65
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,475

66
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,385

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,082

68
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,159
- Someone miss the drive-through?
- Came up stolen

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,592
We were in pursuit
Driver tried to take a shortcut

70
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,391
- How bad?
- He dove out of the way just in time

71
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,934
Driver fled on foot,
and we lost him.

72
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,300
- Owners They been open less than a week
- I'll talk to them

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,274
Did you see the man
who was driving the car?

74
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,146
Scotch

75
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,239
- No tax sticker
- That's a lot of stolen booze

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,250
Yeah, 30-year-old booze

77
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,980
This stuff is worth
like 1 20 a fifth

78
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,819
- I'm a light beer man myself.
- This is single malt

79
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,689
- You don't know what you're missing
- You could school me sometime

80
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,664
No insurance. It'll come out of their pocket
if we don't find the guy who did this.

81
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,861
Yeah, well, even if we catch our rabbit,
I doubt he could cover these damages

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,599
- Who we looking for?
- Bootlegger

83
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,940
I thought we were gonna keep
this operation under wraps

84
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,813
This AGC sting could
go on for months, a year even

85
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,409
I'm gonna be moving on
Claudette's gonna be moving in

86
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
Might as well get her
up to speed now.

87
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,986
Jantell made a call after the meet
to a cloned cell phone

88
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,997
Reported in he got half
the payoff, 1 0 G's

89
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,502
It's gotta be something big
for the Horde to drop 20 grand.

90
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:43,337
Armored car schedules for today, plus personnel
info for banks and check-cashing joints

91
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,071
Do you want me
to alert these places?

92
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,910
No, let's do our homework first before
we get these people all worked up

93
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,679
We're also clamping down on Spookstreet
We'll bust one of their bangers on something

94
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,722
sweat him until he gives us this heist--
that'll keep AGC in the clear

95
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,225
If you need anything from this end,
run it through Claudette

96
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,557
Let's not make this
a contest, okay?

97
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,097
You work together.

98
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,506
You, uh-- You running
the Strike Team again?

99
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,585
Aceveda's just
keeping me in the loop

100
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,554
- Yeah? And?
- I'm in the loop

101
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,719
Yeah I've got my own things too
I'm very hush-hush

102
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,895
Tavon's up and talking

103
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,401
You spoke to him?

104
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,667
- He's groggy, but he's making sense
- Sweet

105
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,368
- Really?
- What did he say to you?

106
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,376
The good news is
he's recovering

107
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,537
The bad news is he remembers
getting in a fight with Shane

108
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,172
before Mara clocked him
over the head with an iron.

109
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,275
What?

110
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,355
- Tavon told you that?
- No, Vic did

111
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,482
- But Tavon remembers everything up to that
- Wait a minute.

112
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,254
- What happened?
- Shane put Tavon in the hospital
and then lied to us about it

113
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,388
- He came into my home.
- Yeah?

114
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,524
- He threw down first
- Why didn't you tell us instead
of making up some bullshit?

115
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,469
It was my call not to tell you guys, not
Shane's. I was just trying to protect the team.

116
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,474
- You think this is still a team?
- I'd do the same goddamn thing
for you or Ronnie.

117
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,376
- You know what? You won't need to with me
- There's dirt on your hands

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,209
Look, we can toss around blame,
or we can fix it

119
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,284
If this thing gets hung on Shane,
we're all gonna be under the microscope.

120
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,446
If they look hard enough,
they'll find our money train cash

121
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,856
- So what do we do about Tavon?
- He's only gonna remember more, not less.

122
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,095
Goddamn it

123
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,827
Shit

124
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,433
Jantell and his boys are hopping today.

125
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,109
Look, all the crap
we've been through lately

126
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,050
Trust me, we're a team.
Wejust gotta get through this.

127
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,688
We never should've
taken that money

128
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,691
God

129
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,862
- Hey, take a walk
- You take a walk We're on the eye here

130
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,564
Walon? What the hell
are you doing here?

131
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,572
- You're gonna tip these assholes off
- Me?

132
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,302
Why don't you just paint ''Five-O''
on the side of the van?

133
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,810
You're sitting on the Spookstreet crew?
What for?

134
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,780
What do you you care?
You're compromising everyone.

135
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,510
Trish is in the store.
Annie over there.

136
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,086
- You're stepping on our case
- We were here first

137
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,790
- Get lost
- You get lost!

138
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,019
Aw,Jesus Christ

139
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,857
Ripped by:

140
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,022
Hound

141
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,033

142
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,605
- A little tight in here, isn't it?
- Why you sitting on Spookstreet?

143
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,770
We're gathering intel on some goober named
Durwin He's making kid-on-kid sex tapes

144
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,110
That's pretty vile,
even for them.

145
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,151
Durwin's running this on the side.
Rest of the gang seems to be in the dark.

146
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,585
- Where does he get the kids?
- He's got a social worker in his pocket

147
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,987
Most of her caseloads
are crack moms

148
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,116
She inserts herself into their
lives, gets to know them

149
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,355
and after a while she offers it
as a way to earn

150
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,693
- Lovely
- We're putting things together

151
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,632
We should be rounding everybody
up by the end of the week

152
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,726
We don't have till
the end of the week

153
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,465
We gotta bring your banger in now

154
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,839
- What for?
- To corroborate a tip

155
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,436
- What for?
- We can't say

156
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,879
For reasons I'd like to share,
but I can't

157
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,842
So I show you mine,
but you don't show me yours?

158
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,855
Just like when I had your team
streaking through this place.

159
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,586
- You think this is funny?
- We need to fold your case into ours

160
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,493
- We're not even assigned to Farmington
- I've spoken to your captain.

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,831
We need to grab your porn guy now.
I'll decoy as a social worker...

162
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,836
Trish as the crack mom.

163
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,305
As soon as the money's exchanged,
we can use the guy for our thing.

164
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,935
Whoa, slow down You go in,
the real social worker walks

165
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,639
She's arranging for kids
to 69 each other, for Christ's sake.

166
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,548
Look, I don't like the wicked witch flying
away scot-free any more than you do

167
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,916
But believe me,
our thing is real

168
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,191
I'm not working for her again

169
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,693
You're already inside.

170
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,798
I'll just be helping
any way I can

171
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,303
Fine

172
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,273

173
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,404
- Hello
- Hey Ready for your seminar?

174
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,642
Yeah, I just got my schedule
You're still driving down, right?

175
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:57,621
You kidding me? How could I miss
''Groundwater impact on decomposition rate''?

176
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,350
Maybe you'd be
more interested in

177
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,655
''Rewards used to help motivate a dog
to perform special tasks''

178
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,423
- Hi
- Hi

179
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,055
I got us adjoining rooms.
Ocean view.

180
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,567
And yours is under the name
Jackson Benjamin

181
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,867
Ah, imaginative
Should I wear a disguise?

182
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,841
You laugh, but a lot of my colleagues are
going to be there, and they know Hunter

183
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,639
Relax I don't plan on
leaving the room much

184
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,277
- Neil O'Brien's missing?
- That's right Looks like
the Armenians paid him a visit

185
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,916
-Jesus Are you sure it wasn't just an angry maid?
- Turkish cigarettes

186
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,290
You can only get these
in Little Armenia

187
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,556
I thought your people had
O'Brien under surveillance 2 4-7

188
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,258
Last night someone logged into
our system with security clearance

189
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,358
from an agent who retired
five months ago

190
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,767
He pulled surveil off O'Brien

191
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,135
So are we thinking
he was snatched?

192
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,708
Unless he smelled
trouble and ducked out somehow

193
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,778
There's no blood.
Car's not in the garage.

194
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,479
In any case, the Armenians
have someone inside Treasury

195
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,075
Half the ROC is former KGB
with deep US ties

196
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,089
The Armenians work with the Russians
They got vodka buddies in very high places

197
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,853
- How do we handle this?
- It's been your case from the start.

198
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,928
Until I find this leak,
it's best if it stays local

199
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,827
I'll let you know
if I find anything on my end

200
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,095
Bring in Vic He's dealt with
the Armenians more than anyone

201
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,137
As a resource, right?
I'm still running this

202
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,207
Yes, Dutch
You're in charge

203
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,845
Okay, Durwin Gethers
Grew up in South Gate

204
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,177
In and out of custody
since he was 1 6

205
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,250
Anything else I need
to know about this guy?

206
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,149
Hey, I'm just a crack ho today.

207
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,712
I can't tell you how long it's been
since I've been undercover

208
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,090
Back in those days, there were hardly any
women on the job, let alone a black one

209
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,993
Those bad guys
never saw me coming

210
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,829
You'll be fine
Just like riding a bike

211
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,438
I've been a social worker
for 1 5 years

212
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,016
Hated it for the last 1 0

213
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,711
My ex-husband
gambled away our savings

214
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,881
so I earn on the side
from the crackheads...

215
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,960
who I can't help anyway
even if I wanted to

216
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,622
And you've been one of my cases
for the last 1 0 months

217
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,767
You'll be fine

218
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,206
If I could take back
what you went through

219
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,038
- You can't
- I'd take it on myself

220
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,705
We're cops.
Shit happens.

221
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,380
- Is everything all right?
- No I, uh--

222
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,388
Hunter was mugged
He's hurt

223
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,515
- Is he at the hospital?
- He's at home

224
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,355
- Are the police there?
- No, he called me

225
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,929
He didn't report it?
What happened?

226
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,057
I'm going home to find out, but,
uh, I have to cancel San Diego

227
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,593
I gotta go I'll call you

228
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,941
Hey,Julien

229
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,671
That wagon was jacked
from a school two blocks away

230
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,009
Customs reported 1 1 cases
of Glencallan scotch

231
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,582
stolen from a freight container
in San Pedro last week

232
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,777
Yeah, but there were only
seven in the wagon.

233
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,854
- That means there's still four unaccounted for
- Hey

234
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,083
- You guys busy?
- A little What's up?

235
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,287
- Uh, I got a mugging incident needs checking out
- What happened?

236
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,420
This guy got injured,
but he didn't report it

237
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,999
If you guys got an opening, maybe you
can go over, see what happened

238
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,558
- Who's the victim?
- Uh

239
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,969
Boyfriend of Lauren Riley

240
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,568
She's, uh, the dog handler, helped us
with the meth lab case She's a friend

241
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:44,342
- We can try
- All right Here's the address Thanks

242
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,350
Sure

243
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,424
Vic, our main suspect in the Armenian
money train robbery, Neil O'Brien

244
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,391
just disappeared
from his apartment

245
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,330
- Huh?
- We alerted airport security.

246
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,662
Posted unis at bus
and train stations.

247
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,033
- Any help you could provide
- Oh, if the Armenian Might got to him

248
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,663
- he won't be walking out of town
- I talked to his landlord

249
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,038
Neil has a taste
for Mexican hookers

250
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,907
What is it about Irish guys
and Latin tail?

251
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,674
Aceveda said I could
use your team

252
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,215
Well, I sort of got my hands full
with this other thing

253
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,775
- Which is what, by the way?
- Uh

254
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,515
Can't talk about it,
but nice try.

255
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,921
In any case, the captain's
pulling you off it...

256
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,358
to see if you can help
with anything on O'Brien

257
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:34,524
I'll canvass his neighbors, check the bar
where he said he ''found''the marked money.

258
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,091
All right I'll check out the dick dolls,
see what the street knows

259
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,194
Anything you find,
run it by me?

260
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,797
- Sure, Dutch-boy
- You have a problem with that?

261
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:47,242
Let's connect after you
get back from the Smogjumper.

262
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,577
- Talk to you later
- Yeah

263
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:56,383

264
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,423
- All right So what's up?
- We got a problem

265
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,655
That Irish hump we dropped the money off on's
gone missing The Armenians are on his tail

266
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,061
-Jesus. How'd they find out about him?
- There's a leak in Treasury

267
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,294
- If they get him, they'll kill him.
- They can't trace him to us

268
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,202
If O'Brien's dead, the feds will plant
themselves here, keep digging

269
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,935
If he's a fugitive, they'll keep busy
until his case collects dust

270
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,840
What about the fact
that the guy's innocent?

271
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,846
That guy's an asshole with a rap sheet
as long as your sad little face

272
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:27,578
- What, Tavon wasn't enough for you? Huh?
-Jesus Christ! Cut the shit

273
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,554
Look, you don't want this thing to
blow up, you better keep your head

274
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:38,560
Lem's right We dropped the money off
on O'Brien to divert the feds

275
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,292
- not to set him up for an Armenian hit
- What are we supposed to do now?

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Get to him before
the feet choppers do

277
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,700
Get his ass
on a Greyhound to Akron

278
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,034
There's no Armenian
power base there

279
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,475
God.

280
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,442
Get your ass in the van Start checking
the screw shacks in Byz Lats turf

281
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,950
We'll talk to Diagur, see if any of his
girlfriends are spreading for a gringo

282
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,146
- Yeah
- Go

283
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,460
Diagur

284
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,999
- Who'd you lose, man?
- My cousin Aramis in Chino, man.

285
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,003
Some Armenian chopped off his fingers,
and then he stabbed him in the neck

286
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,472
- You know why?
- No, man We ain't got no beef with no Armenians

287
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,705
- You think it's about the marked
cash the feds found on us?
- Could be

288
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,079
The Armenians got a guy inside Treasury
feeding them intel about the marked bills

289
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,778
Man, those cats do
some sick shit to people

290
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,754
This guy's number one on their most
wanted list His name's Neil O'Brien

291
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,485
We think he's behind the robbery.
I got to find him, prove it...

292
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,495
stop the Armenians from finding
the next pair of size tens

293
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:50,557
- What do you need then?
- He's a gambler He likes to hit cheap Mexican ass

294
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,694
If he's in the hood,
believe me, we'll find him

295
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,672
He hangs at Smogjumpers Have one
of your boys camp out on a stool there

296
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,537
Call us ifhe shows.

297
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,076
You're lucky
we needed a favor, Felicia

298
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,877
because throwing your ass
in prison was my first choice

299
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,543
I understand

300
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,713
You wave,
keep your mouth shut

301
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,354

302
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,628
- What's up?
- Durwin, you and me need to talk some business

303
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,066
- Who the hell are you?
- Felicia's supervisor

304
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,570
I don't know no Felicia

305
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,800
Who's that?

306
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,604
I'm also her business partner.

307
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,611
We split everything fifty-fifty

308
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,649
You paid her $ 1,200 last week for that
little movie star she hooked you up with.

309
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,650
Can I come in?

310
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,521
So what's this business
you tryin' to speak on?

311
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,656
- Felicia shorted me 300
- How's that my problem?

312
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,563
It's not

313
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,604
Just as long as we can deal
directly with each other from now on

314
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,140
All right, whatever

315
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,710
I just need to find me those two little
honeys she been lookin' into

316
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,303
- Tell me what you need
- It's like I told Felicia

317
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,475
They need to be dark-skinned,
no older than 1 1 , and ready to freak

318
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,485
I got two girls, eight and 1 0

319
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,546
- How much?
- Two thousand Mama's gotta get 500 off the top

320
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,683
These little breezies
gonna do whatever I say?

321
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,762
- 'Cause they gonna be gettin' into some hard shit
- It's no problem

322
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,763
Just tell me when you need them

323
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,231
I didn't file a report.
Why are you--

324
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,859
I mentioned it to a couple
of people at the station

325
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,098
- Where were you attacked?
- In the parking lot of my restaurant

326
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,675
He's a sous-chef
at Le Malpeste

327
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,176
I was going to my car,
and I got jumped

328
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,645
They-They wanted my money.

329
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,239
They? More than one?

330
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,841
- Three, I think.
- Did you get a look at them?

331
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,184
- No.
- Were there any weapons?

332
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,956
- No, they went for my watch
That's when I started swinging
- Hunter

333
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,055
Situations like this, it's usually best
to give them what they're after.

334
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,567
You gave me this watch
I wasn't just gonna let them take it

335
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,475
He came in a couple times a week...

336
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,375
- watch the game, place a few bets
- Who'd he bet with?

337
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,412
I promise I'm not out to hassle anybody for
making book I just need to find him

338
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,421
He's in danger

339
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,021
The bookie's name is, uh--

340
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,528
Damn He's got like
a dog's name Sparky?

341
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,531
Scout? Something like that.

342
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:39,297
I think he owns a furniture store,
upholstery place around here

343
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,703
- Faces I know, names--
- Okay.

344
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,276
If O'Brien or the bookie
come in, give me a call

345
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:50,747
Hey, any other cops come in,
meet with or ask about O'Brien?

346
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,286
Mackey? Shaved head,
redneck partner?

347
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,287
Don't think so

348
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,789
Okay.

349
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,722
All right, man I hear you
Thanks for the heads-up

350
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,267
Diagur found O'Brien in a motel
He's with a brown patch

351
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,099
- Let's go then.
- He also said that Dutch is looking into us.

352
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,641
Dutch? Why?

353
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,703
I slipped up

354
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,076
Mentioned the name of the bar,
Smogjumpers, to him

355
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,947
- Dutch knows I shouldn't know about that place.
- Dutch is looking into us.

356
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,919
Dutch would look into his own mother
if he thought he could catch a case

357
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,254
He's got nothing.
Let's just get O'Brien out of town.

358
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,430
I can't do this alone

359
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,375
-Señorita.
- Tome.

360
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,813

361
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,942
Come on, get up

362
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,159
- Hey

363
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,165
- Wash your hands
- What?

364
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,361
You just took a piss, man.
Wash your hands.

365
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,464
What? That's disgusting

366
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,373
- There's a lot of people
looking for you.
- Looking to kill me

367
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,743
I came home last night, saw those
Armenian freaks turning over my place

368
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,748
You gonna put me
in protective custody?

369
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,580
Not exactly Sit down

370
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,349
All right, look.
We're with Special Teams.

371
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,790
There's a leak in Treasury and our department
That's how the Armenians found you

372
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,588
Holy shit

373
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,428
The fact of the matter is there's not
a safe place we can offer you in this state.

374
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,764
- I got no dough to split
- What about the money
you took from the Armenians?

375
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,430
- I didn't do that
- Right

376
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,305
- What about the money you
found in front of Smogjumpers?
- Feds froze most of it

377
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,038
That's what I get for putting it
in a goddamn bank

378
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,944
The other 1 6 grand
I lost on a sure thing

379
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,075
- Smart
- I got three large on the Lakers tonight

380
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:11,019
- I make that, I can move
- You listen to the game
while you drive out of town

381
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,422
My guy Rex already has my bet

382
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,393
Look, we'll front you
the travel money

383
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,987
The Lakers come through, we'll make
sure Rex wires you the winnings

384
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,998
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Akron.

385
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,727
Where's that?

386
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,408
Where the kids at?

387
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,705
With my baby daddy

388
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,804
They'll be here in a minute
Where my money at?

389
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,815
When I see the kids

390
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,317
- Okay That's a nice touch
- Real nice

391
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,625
That's them over there
Eight hundred for the both of them

392
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,719
The deal was five.

393
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,730
- Man.
- Which one's the youngest?

394
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,493
Tayquanna.
She the one on the left.

395
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,369
She ever suck a dick before?

396
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:09,209
I had a boyfriend They got
'bout it a couple times

397
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,480
- Hey, Vic Followed up on that mugging for you
- Oh.

398
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,886
Things didn't really add up. Although
the girlfriend's buying the story.

399
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,050
She's fawning all over that guy
like he's some superhero

400
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,061
Well, they've been
together for a while

401
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,825
- It's probably complicated
- Or not.

402
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,867
Some women just have
a thing for assholes

403
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,235
- Any luck finding O'Brien?
- Uh, not yet

404
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,243
Hey, a while back

405
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,976
you asked me to keep Vic out
of the loop with the Armenians

406
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,211
Why was that?

407
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,187
He was working
on a quota mandate

408
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,452
I didn't want to distract him
with anything gang related Why?

409
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,928
-Just, you know, being nosy
- Sir, I need to talk to you.

410
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,498
- Is he being cooperative?
- Sir.
- Very

411
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,331
- Okay.
- Sir, they just found a body
behind Manzana Groceria

412
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:09,396
- The feet are missing
- Okay

413
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,985
Cigarette burns

414
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,215
You think Diagur bitched us out
to the Armenians?

415
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,317
He didn't know
we were involved

416
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,191
He knew we were looking
for O'Brien

417
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,424
And that we kept asking
about the marked money

418
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,710
Diagur Leyva
Ran the Byz Lats

419
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,746
Any luck with the hookers?

420
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,742
Me and my boys got laid,
but no O'Brien

421
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,254
Listen, uh, I gotta ask you

422
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,892
How is it you knew the name of the bar
when I didn't mention it

423
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,224
or you didn't read the report?

424
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,958
I-I saw O'Brien's rap sheet

425
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:12,196
Knew he'd been picked up on a bunch of
gambling stings, liked Mexican hookers

426
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,398
There's only one place in town
you can do both and be white

427
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,704
- Right Smogjumpers
- Right

428
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,869
You find anything there?

No

430
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,847

happy with the final product

Well, uh, we'll see

454
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,775
The kitchen still needs fixing.

the color of your room

456
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,708

- Ah, there she is
- You here on business or pleasure?

Come on Would I take you to
a show with jacked tickets?

465
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,746
You're a fence.
Isn't that what you do?

466
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,783
Come on, blue. I've been waiting
for like an hour to see you.

467
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,752
- Did I say you could come in?
- Okay, why you gotta step on
a brother's goodwill like that?

00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,449
- Come on, Taylor I'm busy
- Look We got a lot of paperwork

469
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,026
'cause some idiot crashed
while running stolen merch.

470
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,960
Did somebody say ''stolen''?
Did I hear ''stolen''?

471
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,327
Huh, huh?
How can I help?

472
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:59,028
Okay, we're looking for a guy
who's selling stolen scotch Glencallan

473
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,072
I don't know a lot of
hoodjoints that's pouring 3.0.

474
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:06,234
However, there are a couple of
possibilities that we can investigate

475
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:10,007
- We?
- Yeah, look I need a police escort

476
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,145
All right, I got a contractor coming over to
the house tomorrow to work up an estimate

477
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,588
I need to know what it's really gonna cost,
so the insurance people don't try to lowball us

478
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,559
Thanks for tonight
It was nice

479
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,764
What if one of the kids got hurt?

480
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,960
That aerosol can could've
blown up in Matthew's face.

481
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,060
We've got the new therapist
starting this week, but you need--

482
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,299
I need to what? Matthew doesn't
even think he did anything wrong

483
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,342
- How am I supposed to reason with him?
- Somehow

484
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,140
I can't spend every second with him
You can't take him

485
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,648
What are we supposed to do,
put him in a home?

486
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,646
You're serious

487
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,918
No I don't know

488
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,118
We are not gonna put him away

489
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,162
- I don't want to
- Then don't bring it up again

490
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,563
Megan has a shot at a normal life.
Is this fair to her?

491
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,295
Of course not But that doesn't mean
we commit our son

492
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,106
I am doing everything I can

493
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,741
Well, then I'm gonna
have to step in

494
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,117
Maybe you got me on an obscenity beef,
or maybe you don't

495
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,122
'Cause the constitution says
that titty

496
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,125
coochie and ''bedunkadunk''
is erotic expression

497
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,492
- So that shit is protected
- You're a pedophile, Durwin

498
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:37,398
I don't have to tell you what the life expectancy
is on the inside when you mess with kids

499
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,266
Someone has a chance to take out
a ''shorteyes''and doesn't, catches a shank...

500
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,895
in the back themselves.

501
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,133
Those mamas didn't have no problem
with their kids getting dirty.

502
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,700
Let's see how you get dirty in prison.
You ever suck a dick?

503
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,408
You cooperate,
and maybe we can file on you

504
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,283
in a way that keeps you
from getting your throat cut

505
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,425
Now, Spookstreet's got
its fingers in a lot of pies

506
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,793
What's happening with your boys?

507
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,890
Usual shit.

508
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:14,700
Can't help you unless
you got something unusual.

509
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,735
There's Primo

510
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:25,646
He just got out of the pen and he passing
around bad checks to get his pockets tight

511
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,412
- If he could've given us anything else

512
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,750
- don't you think he would've by now?
- He's a foot soldier

513
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,555
We just swapped a social worker who tricks out
kids for a guy passing bad checks That sucks

514
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,097
Let's see if this check kiter, Primo,
is any more plugged in than he is.

515
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,098
All right, but do it fast

516
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,104
Captain. I just got a call from
the bartender at Smogjumpers.

517
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,505
He says the bookie
was in the bar collecting bets

518
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,010
Apparently he needed the cash
to cover a large payout to O'Brien.

519
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:59,516
- O'Brien's still alive
- The bookie owns a furniture shop
nearby I'm tracking him

520
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,517
Ask Vic

521
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,247
I'm sure he knows
all the bookmakers.

522
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,380
I'll do that

523
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,629
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

524
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,829
I'm really sorry about this weekend
I was looking forward to it

525
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,396
The week you're going out of town this guy
gets mugged by three guys he can't identify

526
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,567
and he manages
to fight them off?

527
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,771
I bet you didn't know you were
shacked up with the man of steel

528
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,008
- You sent those officers over to see if he was lying
- He is lying

529
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,108
- He faked getting attacked
- Why is that such a stretch?

530
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:39,178
- Because it's pathological
- So is saying that he'll slit his throat
if you leave him

531
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,817
- I mean, are you ever gonna end it with this guy?
- It's not that easy

532
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,827
- It's not

533
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,057
Hey, Vic.

534
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,964
Just a minute

535
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,594
Did you find the bookie
Dutch was looking for?

536
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,230
- I'm sorry What?
- O'Brien's collecting on a bet

537
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,243
Dutch is trying to track down the bookie
He was gonna check with you

538
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,836
We must have missed each other

539
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,718
- Who won the Laker game?
- LA, by six

540
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,689
Hey The bookie, Rex,
where's his shop?

541
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,692
- Flores
- Let's go

542
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,127
- What's up?
- O'Brien stayed in town to collect his winnings

543
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,995
- Oh, what an asshole
- Dutch-boy's onto him We gotta get to him first

544
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,128
- You ready?
- Yeah

545
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,265
- Captain okay your extracurricular police work?
- Yeah

546
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,708
No OT, but he said
he's buying the first round

547
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,711
Hey, why are you still here?

548
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,544
They couldn't leave until they boarded up
their café I told them I'd stick around

549
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,346
- Any luck finding the driver?
- No, not so far

550
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,888
All right, man
Where are we going?

551
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,015
There's only four joints
that serve top-shelf scotch

552
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,787
And one of them,
the Bling Bling Room...

553
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,761
this hole hasn't served a legal shot
since the day it opened

554
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,889
- Okay, let's party
- Okay.

555
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:01,500
- Detective Wyms, can I ask you about something?
- What?

556
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,303
This couple back here trying to ID
the guy who ran into their café

557
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,174
I heard about them
What do you need?

558
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,442
Well, Dutch said you were dating
a guy who's a contractor

559
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,353
Their café needs
a lot of work, new windows.

560
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,322
So I was wondering if your boyfriend might
be able to get the materials wholesale

561
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,451
- That would help them out a lot
- I'll ask around

562
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,957
Glad to see you're
making the effort

563
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,557
No effort, really
They're good people

564
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,675
Rex?

565
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,612
- Oh, shit! No feet.
- Oh, man

566
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,615
Shit Goddamn it

567
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:50,278
- Hey, Vic! Vic!
- Vic!

568
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,756
- Oh, for Christ's sake
- It's O'Brien

569
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,622

570
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,022
They burned him
and dumped him in turpentine

571
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,531
Jesus. How long
do you think they tortured him?

572
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,634
He couldn't tell them anything if he didn't even
know what he was doing in the middle of this

573
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,932
He couldn't tell them anything if he didn't even
know what he was doing in the middle of this

574
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,029
- Goddamn it! Shit!
- Listen, listen to me

575
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,608
Dutch could be here any minute.

576
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,609
We gotta make
O'Brien disappear

577
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,645
- What?
- He's gotta stay a fugitive

578
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:20,581
Ifhe's dead, Dutch, Treasury--
they'll turn over every rock.

579
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,815
Eventually, we'll be under one of them
He's their prime suspect!

580
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,949
Ifhe's alive and missing,
he stays that way.

581
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:37,527
All right All right
So h-how do we get rid of him?

582
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,798
- We need something close, simple
- Okay, uh--

583
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,540
- Goddamn it.
- What?

584
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,440
I-I know where to do it

585
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,414
- So, Primo, you're fresh out
- Ten days

586
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,644
Long enough to get
the prison smell off of me

587
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,084
- What you been up to?
- Getting my drink on

588
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,748
my poke on, keepin' it G'd up
from the feet up

589
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:04,089
- Passing bad checks again?
- No, dog I paid my debt

590
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,856
That is a major
probation violation

591
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,994
You had three and a half years left on
your sentence when you got paroled, right?

592
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,404
Time to pay in full

593
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,773
I was just trying to get me
some ends, so I can start fresh

594
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:25,144
In an election year, there's
zero tolerance for serial offenders.

595
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,513
But, you know, this check
is yours to rip up

596
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,212
if you give us something to make us
look good to our bosses

597
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,553
In the joint, I heard about
this credit card ring

598
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,289
Federal beef Guy in a suit
will get all the love

599
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,799
I got a line on this ese cat
flippin' hot Sprewells

600
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,927
Give me something sexier My mom
wants to see my picture in the paper

601
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,137
I know a ring of''T'' girls out on
Santa Monica be rolling their johns

602
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,575
Johns got it coming.
Nice try, Primo.

603
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,874
Sorry, we can't do business

604
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,610
Hold on. Hold on.

605
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:08,282
What if I told you the Horde's
pulling a job tonight?

606
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,092
The Horde is in town?

607
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,600

608
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,671
Ronnie, make sure
his feet aren't in there.

609
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,899
- Shit
- I got it

610
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,942
Oh, shit

611
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,342

612
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,353
They're not here

613
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,350
They must have taken them
as trophies Let's go

614
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,949
Let's get him
in the couch Quick

615
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,257
One, two, three

616
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,725
One, two, three

617
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,734
- Okay,you ready?
- Yeah.

618
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,566
- All right
- 

619
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,727
Primo gave it up The Horde's going
after the LA Motor Club on Treadwell

620
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,692
Holiday weekend, they're
probably flush with cash

621
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,696
- Make sure the place is empty
Set up a perimeter
- I'm on it

622
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,028
The Horde's involved? They
can get pretty violent, right?

623
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,967
- I'm seeing if SWAT's available.
- Why don't you pull in the Strike Team too?

624
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,205
Aren't they working
O'Brien with you?

625
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,502
They haven't been able to turn up this
bookie either I'm working my own lead

626
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,236
They're all yours

627
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,912
- Heads up, heads up


628
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,315
Okay, hold it Hold it

629
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,316
Yeah

630
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,052
When?

631
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,628
Okay, we'll be there
in 1 0 minutes

632
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,527
That robbery's going down
Aceveda wants us at the takedown

633
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,328
- What, now?
- Yeah

634
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,064
Okay Park the van
in front of your place

635
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,107
People are used to seeing it They know it
belongs to a cop No one will screw with it

636
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,336
- Yeah, okay
- Okay We'll grab the gear

637
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,243
pick you up at your place
on the way to the takedown

638
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,146
We'll drop the body off late tonight
when things quiet down Let's go

639
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,083
All right
Let's do it

640
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,714
- That was quick.
- Yeah, Mr Bling Bling was very cooperative

641
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,793
when we discovered only two bottles
behind his bar that weren't stolen

642
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,020
When I'm right,
I'm all right

643
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,029
I told him we wouldn't
look into his supply room

644
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,225
if he gave up the name of the guy
who sold him the scotch

645
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,231
We'll pick him up

646
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,646
- Four inside. Driver's still in the van.

647
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,879
- Hold until they come out.
- Roger that.

648
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,656
No idea that they're about
to go tojail for a long time.

649
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,325
If it's our turn someday,
you think we'll see it coming?

650
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,768
It's time we turned our cash
over to the real estate guy

651
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:12,400
- Stop worrying about it.
- Yeah

652
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,001
I'll get it in motion

653
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,672
- They're coming out.
Everybody move.

654
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,751
- Welcome to Hollywood, asshole
- Lay down right now, right now

655
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,665

656
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,930
- Get your weapons down!
Get on your knees right now!
- Drop it!

657
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,476
Put your weapons on the ground!
Put your hands on your head!

658
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,945
- Drop it!
- Hands on your head!
Down on your knees!

659
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,676
- Go! Down on your knees!

660
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,378
- Hands on your head!
- You right there, drop the gun!

661
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,580
You, goddamn it,
put your hands up!

662
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,317
- Drop it!
- Get down right now!

663
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,417
They'll assume
Spookstreet gave them up.

664
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:09,556
So the AGC operation wasn't compromised,
keeps a dozen big cases viable Excellent work

665
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,567
I'm just part of the team

666
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,137
We're headin' out

667
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,264
- Thanks for the help
- Would've liked that social worker, but--

668
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,174
We'll stay on her, make sure she's
out of business You have my word

669
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,714
- Not a bad bust
- Not bad at all

670
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,147
Like riding a bicycle, huh?

671
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,845
A little stiff,
but at least I didn't fall off.

672
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,047
- Of course you didn't
- See you

673
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,588
This isn'tjust Margos
calling the shots. He's in town.

674
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,961
He's got a thing for feet,
and he's taking them off himself

675
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,864
- They get O'Brien?
- Luck of the Irish He slipped away again

676
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,835
The Armenian Might's
out of control.

677
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,376
I don't know who amped up these psychos,
but killing Diagur, this guy

678
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,379
They ain't stopping
till they get their money back

679
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,949
You think you can do something?

680
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,510
I make them, this Margos creep,
my number one priority

681
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,581
You give me the word
to hit back hard...

682
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,183
I'll unravel them foot by foot

683
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,895
I'll get Phillips
to sign off on it

684
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,471
You know how hard those people worked to
build that restaurant that you crashed into?

685
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,570
You need to loosen up, homes

686
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,417
Pretty soon, we're gonna
have to deputize you.

687
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:39,046
So, uh, tell the truth, blue. You had
fun clubbin'with me, didn't you?

688
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,817
That was business

689
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,752
Okay, better than
getting shot at

690
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,731
Okay, so what do you say
next time we do it for real?

691
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,906
All right I see where it is

692
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,240
You have my number,
if you change your mind

693
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,418
Might fool Dutch and the feds,
but the Armenians know the truth
