00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,871
Yesterday, Measure 16 on
the city ballot failed...

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,034
<i>which means we'll have to make do with the lack</i>
<i>of manpower here in the Barn and the street.</i>

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,012
Hold this out long enough, some people
feel compelled to take the gum.

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,582
It's a sign they'll crack under pressure.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,617
- Gum?
- Uh, no, thanks.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:23,052
- Here you go.
- Sure. Thanks.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,954
<i>You know I.A.D. Has been</i>

9

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,028
<i>We've got Lemansky. He lifted</i>

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,225
<i>We've been waiting for it</i>
<i>to spin into something more.</i>

12
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,598
- Got nothing on Mackey.
<i>- We got a C.I. Next to him. When he jumps dirty-</i>

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,297
<i>Vic and his guys are tight,</i>
<i>and Lemansky-he's a soldier.</i>

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,773
<i>So you're gonna need something to drive</i>
<i>a wedge between him and Mackey.</i>

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,540
<i>Terry was working forJustice,</i>
<i>and I think Vic had him killed.</i>

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,945
We killed a cop.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,076

20
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,591

- We want the guy that put it into motion.

21
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,559
<i>Who do you think I want, Curtis?</i>

22
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,067
<i>- [Mackey] Still no Lem?</i>
<i>- [Shane] Left a second message.</i>

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,735
He's probably knee-deep

24
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,405
<i>- Hope he's gettin'a discount.</i>
<i>- I hear yours charges by the minute.</i>

<i>Lookin'to run and hide from Vic Mackey?</i>

36
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,912
Oh, no.
He'd find you, and you'd get yours.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,920
Now assholes like him
lean on honest people...

38
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:07,186

- How long's it been goin' on?

42
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,994
Couple of months.
Man, I come in today-

Man, my son's right. He's right.
It's every man for himself from now on.

<i>You made a serious mistake,</i>

I'm a goddamn cop.

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,127
Gotta start with denial

51
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,531
It's cool. I understand.
Really, we got time here.

52
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,402
- I've never seen those drugs before.
- Come on, man.

53
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,704

Every guilty suspect

63
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,897
started with denial, right?

64
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,368

<i>We're gonna be here for a while.</i>

And I haven't been able to tell you
how I'm gonna keep you out of it yet.

94
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:02,886
You know, I read your package,
and I met with one of your old partners.

95
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:07,762
And he said that-
He said you made a lot of great arrests.

96

<i>They chose to cooperate with the police,</i>

No.

Terry was killed by a drug dealer.

- I know you were there.

But we both know that

Could you be
more full of shit right now?

132
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:41,583
Terry was killed in the line of duty.

<i>The one thing I know for sure</i>

There's a strong odor of alcohol.
Any bars nearby?

163
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,178
<i>Nah. Couple of auto body shops.</i>
<i>A church up the street.</i>

164
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,911
- I checked the wallet. Lives 10 blocks from here.
- Good.

165
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,989
You're starting to get an instinct
for the right things to look for.

166
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,320
He didn't walk here on his own,
not in that condition.

167
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:06,364
Check the houses on this side of
the alley, and look around for some teeth.

168
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,367
Guillermo Solis.
Alcohol-induced coma.

169
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,001
- E.M.T. Says it's 50-50. Where have you been?
- I'm here now.

170
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,478
Since when does a misdemeanor
drunk-in-public need two detectives?

171
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,015
I don't think this guy
got plastered and fell over.

172
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,847
He had broken teeth, facial cuts.
I'm calling it an assault.

173
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,478
- Any sign of robbery?
- Didn't take his money.

174
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,253
- I'm thinking he was dumped here.
- So he got drunk, he passed out.

175
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,693
They drug him here and let
somebody else deal with it.

176
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,357
It's not the most neighborly thing,
but we've seen worse...

177
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,366
and we didn't call it assault.

178
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,596
Well, maybe.

179
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,299
Hang on a second.

180
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,807
<i>[Dogs Barking]</i>

181
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,181
I saw you look out.
Now open up, now!

182
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,114
- Always look out your window?
- There's cops. I was curious.

183
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,287
Curious enough to see something
that happened earlier across the street?

184
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,957
We're gonna keep talking.
It's only gonna take your neighbors...

185
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,057
about 30 seconds
to figure you do know something.

186
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,966
So you might as well tell me
so I can get off your porch.

187
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,529
<i>- [Barking Continues]</i>
- Quiet!

188
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,576
I came home to let my dogs out...

189
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,078
and I saw somebody
leaving that house.

190
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,307
- What did he look like?
- Got something?

191
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,316
- I'm not leavin' till I find out.
- Okay.

192
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,409
The guy was scary.

193
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,251
He looked right at me,
and I went cold.

194
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,849
He looked like evil.
Okay? Go now.

195
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,657
I'm gonna take you in and
put you with a sketch artist.

196
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,928
- You said you'd leave me alone.
- A lot of people wanna know what evil looks like.

197
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,371
<i>Councilman?</i>
<i>Hey, hey, heyl Hey.</i>

198
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,274
I picked up Lemansky last night.

199
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,346
- Where is he?
- Back at the motel.

200
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,042
- Feel him out before I make a move, you know.
- What about the rest of the team?

201
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,483
You were right about Lemansky.

202
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,181
And-And this Terry murder-
It is the soft spot.

203
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,657
<i>But with me, it's still theoretical.</i>

204
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,251
I'm trying to get inside it,
and I will get inside it...

205
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,821
but I need you to add
that personal element to it.

206
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,494
The department brought you in to close this,
and you come running back to me?

207
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:30,371
I can just see where this is goin',
and I'm not above askin' for help.

208
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,971
Besides, I thought Crowley
was your friend.

209
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,640
He was.

210
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,514
You suspected Mackey all along,
and you just let him go.

211
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,519
I pursued it as far as I could.

212
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,988
- Well, here's another chance.
- Mackey's out the door in four months.

213
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,790
- Forced retirement.
- Out the door? Fifteen-year pension.

214
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,490
That ain't a bad reward
for killing a cop, is it?

215
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,829
Sorry. Please. Sorry.

216
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,065
- We could never prove it.
<i>- But you know it.</i>

217
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:06,577
And now, we got
someone that can prove it.

218
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,653
Hold on a second.

219
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,623
- Witness give you somethin'?
- You gotta see this.

220
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,193
<i>Sure looks a lot like</i>
<i>the Salvadoran we leaned on today.</i>

221
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,161
- Doomsday?
- Could be.

222
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,755
It's hard to tell.
Besides, he's tied up.

223
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,927
- Is that Doomsday?
- We put this out yet?

224
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,005
Yeah. Went out on the wire
a few minutes ago. Gets worse.

225
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,199
I.D.'s came back on
the victims at the house.

226
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,833
Community college geeks.
No history of trouble.

227
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,674
One of the males
last names was Hughes.

228
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,805
- As in Hughes Used Cars?
- It was his kid.

229
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,350
Big "D" said he didn't
pay last week, remember?

230
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,285
<i>- So Doomsday sent a message.</i>
- We don't know that yet.

231
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,720
A couple of busted windshields.
Why did we push so hard?

232
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,224
Because there's still some
goddamn laws in Farmington...

233
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,658
no matter what the voters reject.

234
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,959
Plus, he came at me.
He was in my face.

235
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,556
- That the suspect in the triple murder?
- Yeah.

236
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,729
- Do we know him?
- Could be a Salvadoran lowlife,
lives in the neighborhood.

237
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,739
We're trying to get
a 20 on him now.

238
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,934
You think this is
another racial incident?

239
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,170
- I'll let you know.
- Great.

240
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,304
Grab some extra unis
if you need 'em.

241
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,405
If we can find one.

242
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,448
So we cause a triple murder before
breakfast, start a race war before dinner.

243
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,454
That's a pretty good day.

244
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,684
<i>Get the word out to the Aztecs and Zulus</i>
<i>that this wasn't retribution.</i>

245
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,320
It's a beef about business.
That's all.

246
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,489
- You with me?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,286
- He chew through that goddamn thing?
- Holy shit.

248
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,654
We gotta find this guy.

249
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,819
- You got a minute?
- Sure. Come in.

250
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,489
I need a line on a Salvadoran,
calls himself Doomsday.

251
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,396
- You heard of him?
- No. Know where he lives?

252
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,561
<i>Temple/Colter area.</i>
<i>You got friends down there?</i>

253
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,105
I'll have to spread a little love around.

254
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,300
Ah. All right.

255
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,076
I need to pull this guy
off the street now.

256
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,245
Now, this is one of those times
you can earn yourself some real money.

257
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,552
That's too much, Vic. All I need
is a couple of dubs for my girls.

258
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,391
Keep what you save. Ten times
that amount if we can get him in custody.

00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,394
<i>Everything copacetic?</i>

260
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,400
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- That's what I like to hear.

261
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,570
All the emperor needs is a toga
and a violin while Farmington burns.

262
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,167
They offered you that job first,
you turned it down.

263
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,873
It would've been yours,
but you screwed it up. Mrs. Solis?

264
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,246
Thanks for comin' in.
How's your husband?

265
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,184
At the hospital. They said
the machines are keeping him alive.

266
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,347
<i>- But his brain-</i>
- Sorry.

267
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,894
We, uh-We just need
your signature here.

268
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,055
And you can take
his personal effects.

269
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,067
Did you see
your husband last night?

270
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,007
- I took him to church for his meeting.
<i>- Is it a 12-step program?</i>

271
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,840
A.A. Didn't work for Guillermo.
He just kept on drinking.

272
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,846
<i>What sort of meeting was this?</i>

273
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,884
Senor Romero has them drink
until the alcohol cures the sickness.

274
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:38,047
- Aversion therapy?
- You weren't concerned when
he didn't come home?

275
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,456
<i>Senor Romero lets them</i>
<i>sleep at the church...</i>

276
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,688

277
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,995
- Who's Senor Romero again?
<i>- Our minister.</i>

278
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,171
- Senor Romero?
- Yes.

279
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,740
- We need to talk to you about Guillermo Solis.
- Is there a problem?

280
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,752
He's in a coma, may not live.

281
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,755
Too much drink.

282
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,088
Lord, bless his soul.

283
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,994
We understand you were treating him for
substance abuse at the church last night?

284
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,090
I don't treat people.
I don't have a license for that.

285
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,659
- He attends our prayer group.
- Where you, uh, feed booze to alcoholics.

286
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,103
That's-That's fascinating.

287
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,539
Everything they drink,
they drink of their own free will.

288
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,076
We fight the sickness with sickness.

289
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,272
This aversion therapy,
it really works for some people?

290
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,043
It's how I conquered
my issues with alcohol. Otherwise...

291
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,142
<i>I wouldn't have</i>
<i>my business and my church.</i>

292
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,881
My ex-wife was a drunk.
You think if I'd hauled her off...

293
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,981
to happy hour every night,
I could've saved the marriage?

294
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,061
- I wouldn't wanna speculate.
<i>- [Claudette] Who else was there last night?</i>

295
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,154
Hector Santiago. He works with the church,
and he's going through the therapy.

296
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:57,998
- Just the three of you?
- Well, the group gets smaller
as more of us are healed.

297
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,301
- Well, uh, keep up the good work.
- Sure.

298
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,271
- I told you I had a feeling.
- Preachers need to stick to preachin'.

299
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,325
Want me to ask Romero if
he's got that in your size?

<i>- He's from North Carolina.</i>

Got out six months ago.

00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,414
You took some heroin.
You got caught.

321
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,925
<i>Now, we're not just talking</i>
<i>about your career here, Lem.</i>

322
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,395
<i>The city referendum showed all of us</i>
<i>what the public thinks of cops.</i>

323
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:11,663
The department's fighting to change that
perception, so somebody has to pay a price.

324
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,931
And right now, that's you.

325
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,065
Well, you know what? I'll take
my chances with the truth in court.

326
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,508
<i>Everything that Lieutenant Kavanaugh</i>
<i>told you about Terry was true.</i>

327
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,809
You know, Terry didn't have
a grudge against Vic going in.

328
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,446
But it only took him two weeks
to find out that Vic was a dirty cop.

329
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,492
<i>I have his original notes</i>
<i>detailing his suspicions.</i>

330
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:40,554
He was your teammate.
He was a threat, so he had to die.

331
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,794
No. Never!

332
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,707
You didn't know, did you?

333
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,869
Vic never told you.

334
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,280
<i>All this time, I thought</i>
<i>the four of you were in it together.</i>

335
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,150
But you really didn't know.

336
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,625
This changes everything.

337
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:13,397
You're saying you didn't
know about it until right now?

338
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,398
- It was the other guys?
<i>- I didn't say that.</i>

339
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,163
- I didn't say that.
<i>- But you didn't know.</i>

340
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,207
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I respect a guy being loyal...</i>

341
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:28,575
but now you're protecting a guy for
something that you don't have any stake in...

342
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,241
<i>something that you told me</i>
<i>the death penalty was too good for.</i>

343
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,342
This is a damn
witch hunt right now.

344
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,186
You cannot be a cop and be
a part of it with him. You gotta choose.

345
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,191
Vic did not kill Terry!

346
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,127
So prove it.
Wear a wire.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,256
Ask him as a friend.
Let's see what he's got to say.

348
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,734
You wanna railroad an innocent guy,
go ahead and do it.

349
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,805
Do it.
But I do not have to help.

350
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:58,638
So you'd rather take on prison...

351
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:03,545
than someone who took out
one of your own?

352
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:12,255
<i>That-That is a tough choice.</i>

353
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,260
But I understand.

354
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,267
<i>[Mrs. Solis] Guillermo was a jealous man.</i>
<i>The drinking only made it worse.</i>

355
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,269
Did you give him reason
to be jealous?

356
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,067
Why are you asking me
those questions?

357
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:33,338
Those are nice shoes. You get those
from Romero? Saw a pair like 'em.

358
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,505
They were a gift from <i>el señor.</i>

359
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,577
How long have you been
sleeping with Romero?

360
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,314
I have never done that.

361
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,449
<i>But he's made advances, hasn't he?</i>

362
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,518
<i>I'm a married woman.</i>
<i>He made me feel good.</i>

363
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,963
But I told <i>el señor</i>
I would not betray my vows.

364
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:59,594
You mean, uh,
"till death do us part"?

365
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,604
You know what? You know what?
I need a decision.

366
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,168
- I need a decision.
- What happened to having some time?

367
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,682
- Can't believe you need any.
- Look, Vic is your friend, and you're loyal.

368
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,481
But you also gotta be loyal
to your badge.

369
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,488
Gotta be loyal to yourself...

370
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,118
to an innocent brother cop.

371
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,488
<i>It's decision time.</i>
<i>You tell me.</i>

372
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,626
Do I parade you into Police 1...

373
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:36,935
or do I call a technician
and wire you up?

374
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:43,144
<i>You know, Lem,</i>
<i>if Vic is innocent like you say...</i>

375
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,342
you'd be helping him out.

376
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,058
If I do...

377
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,230
what do I get out of it?

378
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:07,430
<i>- [Shane] Doomsday's here?</i>
<i>- According to Emolia's friend.</i>

379
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,707
<i>[Shane]</i>
<i>That's not exactly laying low.</i>

380
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,175
All right, let's go.

381
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,208
- On the ground now!
- Let's go right now! Let's go right now!

382
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,185
- On the ground!
- Get down on the ground!

383
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,849
You son of a bitch.
You do need your ears cleaned.

384
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:42,362
- Where'd you put the dogs' heads?
- What are you talkin' about?

385
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,442
Right.

386
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,145
- Where does Mackey like to put these?
- On the chest.

387
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:56,915
Make a case on Mackey,
the others, you walk away free.

388
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:01,391
Here you go.
There's one more thing.

389
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,327
If you lie to me
or you try to screw me...

390
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,127
or you just don't live up
to the deal...

391
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:15,002
I will push for maximum
for distribution of heroin.

392
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,574
Just know that's the truth.

393
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,237
- Did you get all that?
- Perfect. Mike's working great.

394
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,109
Let's go.

395
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,251
Hey. Hey.
Where you going?

396
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,158
I've gotta run an errand. Sorry.
I'll be back in about an hour.

397
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,356
- Can't it wait? I'm trying to close this out.
- Sorry.

398
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,263
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. I'll hurry back.

399
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,098
Well, I'll start.
Jump in when you get back.

400
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,173
Tox report came back.
He was practically embalmed.

401
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,543
No way he had enough motor function
to swallow, much less hold the bottle.

402
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,946
<i>It even amazes me sometimes...</i>

403
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,714
how much these chronic
alcoholics can put away.

404
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,814
<i>You, uh, screwing any other sheep</i>
<i>in your flock, Reverend...</i>

405
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,689
<i>or you just like giving shoes</i>
<i>to all the pretty wives?</i>

406
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,694
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

407
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,163
<i>And in my faith,</i>
<i>I am called Apostle, not Reverend.</i>

408
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,530
<i>How did Guillermo's</i>
<i>front teeth get broken?</i>

409
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,833
- He must have fallen down.
- You shoved a bottle in his mouth.

410
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,840
Celia Solis said she wouldn't sleep
with you while her husband was alive.

411
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,536
<i>So you tried to kill him,</i>
<i>but only his brain died.</i>

412
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,638
<i>The devil did that to him.</i>
<i>Alcohol was his demon.</i>

413
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,343
Santiago said Guillermo had the shakes.
You notice anything like that?

414
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,116
I left them both asleep
in the sanctuary.

415
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,921
I went to my office.
I wrote this week's sermon.

416
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,087
When I returned,
Guillermo wasn't in the church.

417
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,791
I figured he had sobered up
enough to walk home.

418
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,031
And Santiago was too out of it
to say otherwise.

419
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,075
- You've got all your bases covered.
- I'll put my hand on the Bible.

420
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,668
Not as much fun as putting
your hand on another man's wife.

421
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,010
<i>- [Door Buzzing]</i>
- Get in there, you sick prick.

422
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,551
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>Glad you could join us.</i>

423
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,458
Hey.

424
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,555
Smells ripe, buddy.
Hope you put a little boom in her womb.

425
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,294
I had to stop by my friend's
on the way back from Chino.

426
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,303
The car broke down,
so I waited a half day for a mechanic.

427
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:31,432
Good thing you didn't call back, 'cause I ain't
about to haul my ass out there to pick you up.

428
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,111
<i>[Danny]</i>
<i>Hey, Vic. Downtown called.</i>

429
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,205
They wanna see any records
that you have on Terry Crowley.

430
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,546
<i>- [Mackey] They say why?</i>
- No. Just want anything you got.

431
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,250
- Probably just wanna close out the file.
- Yeah.

432
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:51,385
All right. I gotta pull a couple
of old boxes, but I'll see what I can do.

433
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,828
You missed the first half,
but we're still in the game.

434
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,299
- We just picked up a suspect in a triple murder.
- Put me in, Coach.

435
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,266
It's not him.

436
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,140
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>Oh, for Christ sakes. Don't do this.</i>

437
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,204
- I said it's not him.
<i>- This man killed three innocent people today.</i>

438
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,751
- That's not my fault.
<i>- What about the next person he kills?</i>
<i>That will be.</i>

439
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,755
He already killed my dogs.

440
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,588
<i>You think just 'cause you're not I.D. 'ing him,</i>
<i>he's not gonna try to kill you too?</i>

441
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,993
You're protecting a killer.
Makes you no better than he is.

442
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,122
<i>[Irma]</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

443
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:36,606
For the record,
I saw someone, but not him.

444
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:54,290
What happened to your hands? Looks like
you got into one hell of a dogfight.

445
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,292
Scratched 'em up someplace.

446
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,386
Senior Hughes refuses to pay
you protection, Junior winds up dead.

447
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,397
Niggers die every day.

448
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,468
Save that grin for the lineup
before I smack it off your face!

449
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,164
<i>Need a witness for a lineup.</i>
<i>Ruff-ruff.</i>

450
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,243
I'm holding you on suspicion of vandalism
for cruelty to animals.

451
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,781
That means we're about eight minutes
into a 12-hour conversation.

452
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:23,218
Wanna see how cruel I can be to animals
like you? A lot can happen in 12 hours.

453
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,258
Problem for you is, we don't scare like girls,
and our bite's as good as our bark, asshole.

454
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,660
- We gain entry and do what?
- Separate the parties.

455
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,432
Look for visual signs of injury.

456
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,469
- You taking the son?
- Yeah. You get the father.

457
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,273
Control the scene.
Use force if necessary.

<i>Thanks.</i>

- Trying gets you killed.

<i>the room. Then you used excessive force.</i>

477
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,852
Corrine. Hi.

478
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,952
Hi, Jon.
You picking up your son?

479
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,624
Yeah. My ex was supposed to.
She bailed out at the last second, so-

480
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,463
- Oh.
- I skipped out of work and came here.

481
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,833
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- It's par for the course. Hey, guys.

482
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:25,069
You know what? Why don't you guys go play
over by the swings for a little bit.

483
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,144
Watch your sister for me, okay?

484
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,545
- So was it a bad divorce, or-
<i>- Yeah.</i>

485
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,643
Uh, she's with this other guy now.

486
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:41,054
I got primary custody. She's supposed
to be paying child support.

487
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,059
She's this big-time money manager.

488
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,324
- I haven't seen a cent though
in, like, three months.
<i>- You're kidding?</i>

489
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,161
She doesn't even help out at all?

490
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,293
I'm just running a little late
on the tuition here.

491
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,502
And you're paying
for your children all by yourself?

492
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,201
Oh, no.
Uh, Vic helps out.

493
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,078
- But the occupational therapists
and the evaluations and-
<i>- Yeah.</i>

494
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,643
You know, Vic always comes up with
whatever extra cash I need for the kids.

495
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,349
- So-
- Sounds like a great guy.

496
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,892
- Well, let's not make him a saint quite yet.
- Yeah?

497
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,690
What's his bad side?

498
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,698
I'm just trying to compare him
to my ex's bad side, because-

499
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,291
<i>Okay, well, he's hardheaded...</i>

500
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:30,204
uh, he likes to get his way,
and job comes first.

501
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,538
Same here.

502
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,338
But he loves his kids.

503
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,539
- What's your boy's name again?
- Andrew. Andy.

504
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,515
- Is he-
- No. He's, uh-

505
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,055
He's doing some extra work
with one of his teachers right now.

506
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,956
<i>Maybe you can bring Andy around</i>
<i>for a playdate sometime?</i>

507
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,029
That would be a huge, huge help.

508
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,530
- Billings keeps asking what we got.
- We got nothin'.

509
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,430
- We got no prints, we got no weapons.
- No goddamn witness.

510
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,801
Why don't we just cut this guy loose and
continue this conversation on the street?

511
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,273
<i>- What kind of conversation?</i>
- Well, Irma's the only thing that we had.

512
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,435
<i>She ain't stickin'</i>
<i>her neck out ever.</i>

513
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,139
We could turn him on to Special Cases,
let them run with it.

514
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,148
Pass the buck?
And have the streets still think...

515
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,878
we're stuck behind desks
with our tail between our legs?

516
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,547
- They got resources, manpower-
- Every minute he walks free, we're a bigger joke.

517
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:23,593
We're gonna handle this guy
so people know that we got him.

518
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:29,223
<i>Hey, what about the- the guy</i>
<i>that we met on the Mexi sting last year?</i>

519
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:33,633
Hold on. Look, I gotta-
I gotta take off, man.

520
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,639
- Where you goin'?
- My stomach's been bugging me all day.

521
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,471
- Do you mind if I pick it back up tomorrow?
<i>- Sure. You gonna be all right?</i>

522
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,513
<i>Yeah. It's my medicine.</i>
<i>I'm back on it. I left it at home.</i>

523
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,946
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

524
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,245
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

525
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:53,153
- He gonna get paid for today?
- Keep goin'.

526
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,999
It's a great country,
respecting the human rights...

527
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,432
of a bloodthirsty
piece of shit like yourself.

528
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,640
I just might have to sue your ass.

529
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,972
I got a feeling your life
just took a turn for the worse.

530
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,844
Or it could just be wishful thinking.

531
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,941
- [Door Buzzes]
- You go back to filling out your paperwork.

532
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,444
Stay the hell off my street.

533
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,457
<i>[Danny]</i>
<i>Well, I told you to lose the earrings.</i>

534
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,357
I figured it was no big deal,
but I should've listened to you.

535
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,226
- Protocol's there for a reason.
- It won't happen again.

536
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,664
You know what?
Do yourself a favor.

537
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,702
Don't turn being a cop
and a girl into a juggling act.

538
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,235
All right.
See you later.

539
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,673
<i>You wereJulien's</i>
<i>training officer, right?</i>

540
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,869
He's a good guy and all,
reads the Bible.

541
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,210
But maybe he has a problem
working with women.

542
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,012
<i>We may have the same plumbing, but that doesn't</i>
<i>mean I'm gonna dish with you about your T.O.</i>

543
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,088
I didn't mean it like that.

544
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,680
You wanna succeed around here?
Do yourself a favor.

545
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:05,057
Just listen up
and do like you're told.

546
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,064
<i>What did I miss?</i>

547
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,134
Uh, everything.

548
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,699
<i>I lasered the power points</i>
<i>on the Romero thing for the D.A.</i>

549
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,433
- They weren't biting.
- You called the D.A.?

550
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,703
- I just said I lasered them.
<i>- What'd you tell him?</i>

551
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,711
<i>What Claudette told me.</i>

552
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,442
On my way out, he asked me
where we were. I filled him in.

553
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,452
Well, we're still investigating.
The guy's guilty.

554
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,148
<i>Look, your hunches notwithstanding,</i>
<i>my strong sense is...</i>

555
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,054
they're not gonna find the arena
sexy enough to file on.

556
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,854
Sexy enough?

557
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,896
<i>I'm just passing along what your partner</i>
<i>told me and what I found out.</i>

558

<i>You got a beef with her, figure it out instead</i>
<i>of walking on me with your anger shoes.</i>

559
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,104
Anger shoes?

560
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,645
That's him.

561
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,176
<i>Hello, asshole.</i>

562
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,254
Against the wall.
Come on.

563
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,552
- Somebody called for a police escort.
- Must've been you.

564
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,757
Always happy to help out
a citizen in need. Let's go.

565
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,617

- Yeah.

<i>- We can do this without you.</i>
<i>- Where's the fun in that?</i>

567
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,557
We're a team.

568
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,629
<i>Okay.</i>

00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,548
<i>Now, take everything that's</i>
<i>a name brand trademark violation.</i>

572
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,641
<i>- [Man] You got it.</i>
- Take him into custody.

573
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,395
<i>Is it worth taking</i>
<i>another run at the D.A.?</i>

574
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,397
Romero skates
on attempted murder...

575
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,297
at least he won't be selling
knockoff shoes anymore.

576
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,064
<i>You get lemons,</i>
<i>you make lemonade.</i>

Where is this "Hey, man, it's all good,"
"whatever" bullshit coming from?

578
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,677
- Excuse me?
- Catch the mediocrity flu
Billings has been passing?

579
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,679
This guy tried
to kill somebody.

580
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,444
He's getting off on a class "B" felony
while you took a half day of personal time.

581
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,384
I was out of the Barn
for an hour and a half today max.

582
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,547
Come on.
You're coming in late.

<i>When you're here,</i>
<i>your head's not in the game.</i>

584

I'm sorry the case didn't make.
It was never a slam dunk.

585
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,667
Hey, Julien?

586
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,767
"Officer Hanlon used unnecessary
and excessive force...

- That's what happened.

589
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,118
<i>Look, Billings hasn't seen this yet.</i>
<i>Why don't you sleep on it?</i>

590
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,556
You know, especially since she was
coming to the aid of a fellow officer.

591
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,629
The department is still liable for
her actions against an unarmed citizen.

592
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,291
<i>She's 5'4". Excessive for you, excessive</i>
<i>for her are probably two different things.</i>

<i>It's my call.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>

594
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,871
Hey, have you requested
extra baton training for her?

595
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,872
No.

596
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,876
Well, maybe you should think about
your responsibilities as a training officer.

597
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,038
I also have a responsibility
to wash her out if she can't handle it.

598
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,276
I could've washed you out
a couple of times.

599
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,616
I'd like to think that
I made the right decision.

Maybe they'll let you call

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,201
[Mackey]
You were there. You know what happened.

637
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,180
- Two-Time shot-
- You're not telling me everything.

638
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,409
- Of course I am.
- No. No, you're not.

639
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,918
- He was my friend.
- I'm your friend.

640
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,988
- You tell me.
- What the hell do you think you're doin'?

641
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,752
- Don't you lie to me. Don't lie to me!
- What are you doin'? Stop-

642
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,487
<i>- [Static Over Speaker]</i>
- Where's the sound?

643
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,291
- I don't know.
- I need sound.

644
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,662
I'm working, I'm working.

645
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,226
- I.A.D. Has me wired, all right?
- What?

646
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:31,297
I just disconnected it. I.A.D. Has me wired.
They're watching us right now.

647
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:35,105
They busted me with some heroin,
and they're talkin' prison if I don't do this.

648
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,043
What else?

649
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,877
I've been protecting you all day.
They're gunning for all of us.

650
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,350
Some I.A.D. Player and Aceveda.

651
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:47,356
Okay, I gotta make a decision,
and I gotta make it quick.

652
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,654
Why is it even a question?

653
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,859
- Because I think you're lying to me.
- I'm not.

654
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,768
Then you look me in the eye,
and you tell me the truth about Terry.

655
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,865
Okay, if I don't believe you,
I'm gonna start lookin' out for myself.

656
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,844
- Don't listen to them.
Don't buy into their bullshit.
- Tell me the truth.

657
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,575
- We're a team.
- Yeah, that Terry was a part of once.

658
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,651
- [Static Continues]
- Come on. Come on.

659
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,387
Now tell me.

660
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,423
How you can even ask me that-

661
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,391
They told me Terry was working
with the feds to bring us down.

662
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:28,454
Now answer me. Okay, you look me
in the eye, you tell me the truth.

663
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,897
If we're really a team,
tell me the truth already.

664
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,575
- Oh, my God.
- Lem, we're in on this together, right?

665
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,411
- I need to go.
- Everything's fine, right?
We're- Everything's fine.

666
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,247
- Where you goin'? We gotta talk.
<i>- I need to go.</i>

667
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,379
- Don't.
- Where is the sound?

668
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,719
<i>It's gotta be his mike.</i>

669
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,850
Lem!
