1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:08,437
<i>- I hear you're the best.
- Heat it up.</i>

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,105
<i>What's up, boss?</i>

3
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,277
While you two
were out playing putt-putt...

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,946
<i>Shane and me were taking down
a slice-and-dice gem operation...</i>

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,694
an Armenian kingpin,
two dozen of his crew.

6
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,685
<i>One guy who shall remain faceless.</i>

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,827
I can't believe
we missed out on that, man.

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,957
<i>It gets better. It gets better.
We found out the Zeroun family...</i>

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,696
<i>isn't only making illegal money,
they're also cleaning and shipping it.</i>

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,234
So we're going to take down
a money-laundering ring? Sweet.

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:46,937
Yes, it is. We're gonna bring it down,
pack it up, and save it for a rainy day.

12
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,911
We found out how and where
they distribute their dirty cash.

13
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:53,119
This is it, boys.
This is the one we've been waiting for.

14
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,883
<i>One big hit. In and out.
We're set for good.</i>

15
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,081
- What?
- Told you he'd be speechless.

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,159
<i>You're not serious.
You wanna rip off the Armenian mob?</i>

17
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,162
Shh. We have two months to plan this.
We can absolutely do this.

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,200
- No. Not me.
- What are you saying? It's all of us.

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,668
No, man. It's crazy.
It can't be that easy.

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,243
We'd have the mob chasing us
on one side, the law on the other.

21
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,336
What about you, huh?
You bailing too?

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,076
No. No.
It sounds interesting.

23
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,583
Lem, no one's rushing into this.

24
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,154
- Do you know a Connie Reisler?
- Yeah. Why?

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,897
- She's here.
- Oh, man.

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,635
<i>Hi, Vic.</i>

27
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,284
- You're clean.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,481
- I did 90 in County.
- It must have been hard on you.

29
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,319
It's what I needed.

30
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,222
What do you need from me?

31
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:16,630
I wanna help you. Provide information
on a professional basis.

32
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,964
Look, Connie...

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,834
I'm here for you.

34
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,133
But I don't have throwaway money
like I used to.

35
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,839
I'm talking about making it official.
I met someone inside.

36
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,744
Told me that the state
can give C.I.s a contract.

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,214
I can do that.

38
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,221
I hear things all the time.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,289
<i>I blend in on the street.</i>

40
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,329
<i>- No.
- Well, I'm tired...</i>

41
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,400
of sucking on pipes and balls, Vic.

42
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,605
You know my résumé.
Who else is gonna give me a job?

43
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,935
<i>- It's not as simple as all that.
- I don't need that much to live on.</i>

44
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:02,537
<i>Without it, you know,
I gotta go back to trickin'</i>

45
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,583
<i>I start trickin',
it's back to being a junkie.</i>

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,956
<i>I heard about this guy...</i>

47
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,889
who's selling heroin to kids.

48
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,327
- Yeah?
- This tip's real solid.

49
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,029
Okay. I'll see what I can do long-term.

50
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,536
In the meantime,
tell me about this dealer.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,304
Teenage kid.
Felipe Gomez.

52
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,414
<i>I know his sister.
He just started dealing to kids.</i>

53
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,709
Where?

54
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:43,311
Opposite direction. Which of
Newton's laws of motion applies?

55
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,655
Police.
Which one of these kids is Enrique?

56
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,531
<i>Schoolmates say you've been
flashing thumbnail bags of heroin...</i>

57
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,762
that you got
from some guy named Felipe.

58
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,829
- Smack got your tongue, Enrique?
- You got the wrong Enrique.

59
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,404
Oh, really?
Well, let's pat you down then.

60
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,872
- All right.
Up against the wall, "wrong Enrique."
- Can he do that?

61
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,603
You're in public school, Beaver.
You got no rights.

62
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,414
It wasn't just me, man. Felipe was
hanging out by the east gate...

63
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,047
- handing them out to everyone.
- Handing them out?

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,628
<i>Giving it away. Like free samples.</i>

65
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,362
I come out to go to work,
and I find my car like this.

66
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,933
What do you expect me to do?
This isn't my district.

67
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,335
Sir, the widow did this.
She knows where I live.

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,805
<i>Are you sure it wasn't random?
A prank?</i>

69
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,943
You heard her threaten me.
"Justice will find you."

70
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,274
Well, you need to file a report
with Hollywood division.

71
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,576
I take those reports.
It's a waste of time.

72
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,880
- If it's her, you need to document it.
- I guess.

73
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,319
Look, not to overburden you,
but the board's been on my case...

74
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,720
to get them Julien's six-month review.

75
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,191
<i>I'm almost finished with it.</i>

76
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,693
I need it today.

77
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:01,163
<i>We had officers search every student,
every locker.</i>

78
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,461
If they found drugs,
I told them to keep their lockers open.

79
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,038
I think you should
start calling some parents.

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,662
I can't believe
Lem's being such a pussy about this.

81
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,393
Uh, who knows.
Maybe he's right.

82
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,232
- We don't need him to pull this off.
- Yes, we do.

83
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,464
Lem doesn't care
if we ride solo on this thing.

84
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,576
Well, I care.

85
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:47,239
<i>Either we're all in, or we're all out.</i>

86
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:52,516
One guy knowing who isn't accountable,
isn't an option.

87
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,120
<i>We're a team.
That's the only way it works.</i>

88
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,890
<i>My educational reform
if middle schoolers are high on heroin.</i>

89
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,394
And if the police can't
keep drug dealers out of our schools...

90
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,296
is there anyplace
our children can be safe?

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
Sir, how do you answer
your political opponent's challenge?

92
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,127
I'm here as a police officer,
not as a candidate.

93
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:17,700
I want to remedy the situation, not turn it
into political hay. Excuse me.

94
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,071
<i>Jesus, what the hell went down here?</i>

95
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,615
Some scumbag was handing out tastes
of heroin like they were goddamn cookies.

96
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,953
Heroin?

97
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:30,218
Not your daddy's smack either.
Pure and cheap.

98
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,517
Snort it, smoke it, same high as shooting up
without the float... addictive as shit.

99
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,193
You're responsible for drug busts
in this district.

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,163
- I thought you had a handle on things.
- I did.

101
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,635
Then my handle got burnt
at the stake by Armadillo.

102
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,095
That drug dealer, Tio.

103
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,242
You wanna know
what my relationship with him was about?

104
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,744
It was about not letting things
like this happen.

105
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,804
I gave him slack, but I gave him rules.
He never dealt to kids.

106
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,784
With Tio out of the way, somebody else
saw these kids as an untapped market.

107
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,851
- So how do we fix this?
- Well...

108
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:06,457
No. No more arrangements with drug dealers.
Crack down on them... publicly and hard.

109
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,094
I can do that too.

110
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,233
Police!
Get your hands in the air!

111
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,237
<i>- Down! Down! Get down!
- Get down!</i>

112
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:33,917
Word is you think
you can start selling at schools.

113
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,255
Turn kids to clients.

114
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,030
Nope. No heroin here.

115
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,633
Here either, boss.

116
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,209
None in here either, boss.

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,641
"A," "B," "A," "B,"
"A," "B," "A," "B."

118
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,910
"A," "B," "A," "B," "A."

119
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,114
All the "A's," on your feet.

120
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,921
<i>Tell your fellow Torrucos that the next
asshole I catch selling dope to kids...</i>

121
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,996
I'm gonna find a soft, dark place
to jam this stick.

122
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,360
Now get out.

123
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,369
"B's" on your feet.

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,168
You're all busted! Whoa.
Whoa. Felipe, where you going?

125
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,745
You're not an "A."

126
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,179
You were handing out samples
at Truman East Middle School today...

127
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,847
which makes you a special kind of"B"...
my bitch.

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,956
- This guy's probably gonna need a medic.
- Okay. Call it in.

129
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,516
Get the rest of these guys
carred and barred.

130
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,359
- One-Tango-13, we need an R.A.
- Hello, Officer.

131
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,700
- Can I help you?
- You work with a Detective Mackey?

132
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:58,602
- Maybe. Why?
- I sometimes have information for him.

133
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,872
- You one of his C.I.s?
- Not officially.

134
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,176
I need to get a message to him.

135
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,770
I lost his number
and, uh, it's important.

136
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,641
- What's the message?
- The guy he's looking for isn't stopping.

137
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:16,948
And I'm afraid if Vic isn't careful,
he might start talking.

138
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,887
- That's the message?
- Mmm.

139
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,392
<i>What's your name?</i>

140
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,258
Tell him about the face.
He'll know.

141
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,809
Look at you, Felipe.
You barely got hair on your nads...

142
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,709
and you're already dealing
hard stuff to kids.

143
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,610
I'm not going to jail.

144
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,578
What fantasy world are you living in?

145
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,048
I'm 15.
Minors don't get time.

146
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,086
Unless the crime's serious enough.

147
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,282
You moved heavy weights of "H," amigo.
To hundreds of kids. You're done.

148
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,826
- But... But I'm a minor.
- In a major pile of shit.

149
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,590
- But... But I was told that...
- You were told wrong!

150
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,636
It's all right. You can cry.
You wouldn't be the first.

151
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,537
And you damn sure
won't be the last.

152
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,905
Nah.

153
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,138
Everybody's got game on the street.

154
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,218
Then you get caught.
Reality sets in.

155
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,251
Life as you know it is over.

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,653
- I was just following orders.
- I know.

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,956
- Go ahead. Let it all out.
- You don't understand.
You can't say no to him.

158
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,793
- To who?
- Armadillo.

159
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,095
You work for Armadillo?
You've seen him in town?

160
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,994
No. Everything goes through Duardo.

161
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:44,074
- You know where we can find Armadillo?
- No, but Duardo would.

162
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,114
- Armadillo's back?
- You start kids off for free,
get customers for life.

163
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,278
- I'm throwing everyone I have on this.
- No. You can't do that.

164
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,783
- Why not?
- The last time you couldn't
read between the lines...

165
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,119
so this time let me
draw you a clear picture.

166
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,384
Keep other cops...
Claudette especially... off my ass.

167
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,357
- What's your plan?
- Armadillo knows the law.

168
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,262
He's using minors to distribute
because they can't serve major time.

169
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:15,202
He'll also know that they can't be used as
undercover C.I.s in a major sting operation.

170
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,569
Okay.

171
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,373
I use Felipe as an undercover informant.

172
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,083
He leads us to Duardo.
Duardo leads us to Armadillo.

173
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,711
- Absolutely not.
- Are we going to do this or aren't we?

174
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,989
I'm for doing it in a way
that will actually secure a conviction.

175
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:33,152
- It's illegal.
- My way would be more of a gray area.

176
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,063
The last time we used a kid,
Armadillo raped and tattooed her.

177
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:39,463
Think of something else,
and do it fast...

178
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,329
or I am putting every unit I got
on tracking him down.

179
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,440
<i>- Vic.
- What can I do for you, gorgeous?</i>

180
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,943
- Got a message for you.
- Yeah, from who?

181
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,611
I guess you know the guy.
Left side of his face was scarred...

182
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,182
like he'd been in some sort
of fire or something.

183
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,615
Armadillo's declaring goddamn war.

184
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,120
What does he mean,
"You don't want him talking"?

185
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,258
Means he's gonna explain
the grill marks on his face.

186
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,692
Talk about how we were
protecting his drug competition.

187
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,323
<i>- If somebody else finds him before us...
- Can't happen.</i>

188
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,161
- We have to find him first.
- And what? Hand him over to Aceveda?

189
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,360
He'll pull his gun.
We'll have no choice.

190
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,772
- You see a better way?
- No.

191
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,711
Asshole should have gone back to Mexico
like you told him.

192
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,545
- What about Lem?
- He's not down with
ripping off the money train.

193
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,121
How the hell you think
he's gonna feel about this?

194
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,985
Keep 'im away from the action. Watching the
door or something. You know the drill.

195
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,957
What's up?

196
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,527
- What's goin' on?
- Aceveda wants us to find Armadillo.

197
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,964
We're just trying to figure out
the best way to do it.

198
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,910
My grandfather had Alzheimer's.
I know how hard it is.

199
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,275
I was only gone an hour. I mean,
the cleaning lady said she'd watch her.

200
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,118
We'll find her.
I promise.

201
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,882
Is there anyplace where she might go?
People she might visit?

202
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,247
No. Most of her friends
have been moved or passed away.

203
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,154
<i>- Any other family members in town?
- No.</i>

204
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,852
- I'm her only child.
- Good news is I talked
to the morgue and hospitals.

205
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,022
No matches on a Jeannie Sutton.

206
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,636
<i>Listen, uh,
we've notified our patrol cars.</i>

207
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:26,230
We're going to distribute a flyer
with your mom's photo.

208
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,874
Someone will find her.

209
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,469
<i>Dutch and I will oversee the search
until someone does.</i>

210
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,619
Hey.

211
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,055
- Uh, you busy a week from Sunday?
- I don't think so. Why?

212
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,850
- Actually, I'm getting married.
- Married? To who?

213
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,126
- Vanessa.
- The mom you've been seeing, like,
for a month?

214
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,029
- It's been seven weeks.
- Please, tell me this is a joke.

215
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,636
Uh, no. I love her.
She loves me.

216
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,239
Julien. Jesus.

217
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,842
- How goes it?
- Good. Good.

218
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,911
- I'm getting married.
- Holy crap.

219
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,138
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

220
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,909
- Thanks.
- Better you than me.

221
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,244
Yeah, that's what I hear.

222
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,380
Look, it's gonna be a small ceremony...

223
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,791
- but I really want you to be there.
- Julien...

224
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,222
- you are gay.
- No. I was misguided.

225
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,925
But with the help of God,
I'm now on the right path.

226
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,668
I've heard all about that reorientation crap.
It's completely twisted.

227
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,607
- That is just anti-religious propaganda.
- Julien...

228
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,474
- They are not helping you.
- They are helping me.

229
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,869
I just need to know whether or not
you're coming to my wedding.

230
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,182
She took three bags
of candy and then what?

231
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,080
<i>Then I yelled at her to stop and pay me.
But she was really out of it.</i>

232
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,881
You know, like, loco?

233
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,758
<i>I was really worried about her.</i>

234
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,226
If you were so worried about her,
why didn't you stop her?

235
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,461
I'm gonna tackle some old lady?
I called you, didn't I?

236
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,295
Yeah, I know that store.
My mom used to work there.

237
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,232
- She did?
- Yeah. A long time ago.
Used to be a soda shop...

238
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,996
called something else,
but that was her first job.

239
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,701
What other things did she do back then?

240
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,938
- Where've you been?
- Uh, I felt like a sandwich.

241
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,850
Your break was over two hours ago.
We've got a case here.

242
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,788
I was hungry.
And I wouldn't exactly call this a case.

243
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,985
<i>Jeannie was spotted in a store
she used to work in as a teenager.</i>

244
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,591
<i>Now, if she's in a delusional state,
she might be going back into her past.</i>

245
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,660
- If we do our homework...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

246
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,935
We're not going to find her by
psychoanalyzing the last 60 years of her life.

247
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,165
God knows how many
defining moments she's had.

248
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,807
- You have another theory, pitch it out.
- She's an old, white lady...

249
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:45,004
wondering around in a black and Hispanic
neighborhood in pajamas and slippers.

250
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,576
- Somebody's gonna call her in.
- Detectives.

251
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,046
Someone spotted your woman trying to get
into a locked apartment an hour ago.

252
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,649
960 Chester Avenue, number 16.

253
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,553
- See?
- How much you wanna bet
that's a blast from the past?

254
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,962
- Uh, excuse me?
- Yeah, excuse you.

255
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,657
No, asshole. You bump into somebody,
show some manners. Apologize.

256
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,363
- That's funny to you?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,099
How funny would it be
if I knocked those oversized teeth out?

258
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,910
Why don't you back up, Dutch-boy, before
you find my boot print halfway up your ass?

259
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,783
<i>Whoa. We got more important
things to do. Come on.</i>

260
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,650
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. Just not going to
take shit from people anymore.

261
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,524
<i>- Come on, man.
- That's not my lawyer, bro.</i>

262
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,762
Sit down.

263
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,038
Your baby brother's
stupid enough to stay in town.

264
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,268
You tell him that
I got some new rules for him.

265
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,375
- No more dealing to kids.
- I don't talk to Armadillo.

266
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,052
<i>You can get him word.
Farmington is my house.</i>

267
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,748
Nothin' gets dealt there
without my approval.

268
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,359
You keep it away from the kids.
There's plenty of junkies to go around.

269
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,859
Armadillo doesn't like rules.

270
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,898
See that One-niner over there?

271
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,901
I've done a few favors for his crew
out on the street.

272
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,865
He's willing to pay me back.

273
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,533
One phone call from me
and you're greenlit.

274
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,649
- Greenlit?
- It's an American prison term.

275
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,981
It means you'll be
shanked in the shower, asshole.

276
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,319
<i>Bleed out before the guards
even know you're late for breakfast.</i>

277
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,765
You tell Armadillo about my new rules...

278
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,327
and if he says one thing
about me or my crew...

279
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,304
I'll make that call.

280
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:06,016
- You greenlit Navaro?
- No. I just threatened to.

281
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,986
Greenlighting Navaro's a bluff.
Hopefully...

282
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,546
it'll get him to contact Armadillo,
give us his location.

283
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,490
If Navaro or any of his crew
make a call, the county guards...

284
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,854
will monitor it and let us listen in.

285
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,757
- Ronnie, work on tracking those calls.
- I'll wire us up.

286
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>And if Armadillo's
on the other end, we just bring him in?</i>

287
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,135
I mean, what if he talks about,
you know?

288
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,862
We're cops. He's a fugitive.
We got a job to do.

289
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,237
- I don't know, man.
- Maybe he'll buy this whole
greenlighting thing.

290
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,776
Keep his mouth shut to save his brother.

291
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,045
Okay.

292
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,545
<i>She was banging on my door.
Jiggling the knob.</i>

293
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,415
<i>I opened up, and she just
started yelling, "Who are you?"</i>

294
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,023
This the woman?

295
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,021
Crazy.
Yeah, that's her.

296
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,690
She was babbling mostly.
Kept asking about Earl.

297
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,502
- Earl?
- Yeah. "Where's Earl?" That's what she said.

298
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,369
Earl, you lived in Apartment 16,
960 Chester Avenue?

299
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,241
- Yeah, a long time ago.
- 1946 to 1948?

300
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,417
If you say so.

301
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,443
- Do you remember a Jeannie Sutton?
- No.

302
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,152
What about her maiden name,
Jeannie Russell?

303
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,258
Jeannie Russell.
Yeah, her I remember.

304
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,760
You date her?

305
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,924
Yeah, for about a year on and off.

306
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,660
Right after the war.

307
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,295
- I met her at a soda shop she worked at.
- Mmm.

308
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,807
<i>- You two keep in touch?
- No, no. I haven't seen her since...</i>

309
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,277
I don't know.

310
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,678
But if she still looks as good
as she used to, give her my number.

311
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:50,652
<i>Well, Earl, Jeannie has Alzheimer's now.
She's lost. We're trying to find her.</i>

312
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,120
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Detective.</i>

313
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,588
<i>We think she might try to contact you.</i>

314
00:19:55,661 --> 00:20:00,724
- If she does, would you give us a call?
- Oh, absolutely.

315
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,428
A civilian saw one of my flyers. Called in, said
she saw Jeannie hanging around Echo Park.

316
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,335
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Thanks.

317
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,338
This is a C.I. contract.

318
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,273
D.A.'s grateful for your school tip.

319
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,108
You'll be required
to provide four tips every month.

320
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,717
Tips that lead to arrests.

321
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,478
- And I get paid?
- Two thousand a month.

322
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,659
It's not free money, Connie.

323
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,390
Four tips every month, and you gotta
stay legit. You'll be tested at random.

324
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:36,359
- Why are they gonna test me?
- Because they care where their money goes.

325
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,833
- Why, you worried?
- No.

326
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,098
I just don't like peeing in a cup
three times a week.

327
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,811
- When do I get my check?
- As soon as you give us a tip.

328
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,213
- I gave you a tip.
- That was in good faith.

329
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,343
Clock starts as soon as you sign.

330
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,029
<i>I'll take a look.</i>

331
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,264
What happened?

332
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,002
A three year old opened a packet
of candy from his brother's backpack.

333
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,841
- Except it wasn't candy.
- The free "H"?

334
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,483
- Jesus Christ.
- Poor kid.

335
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,348
His brother over there
says he got it from school.

336
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,954
He's too young to go to Truman East.

337
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,585
He doesn't go to Truman East.
He goes to South Torres.

338
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,590
Armadillo's running this shit
through the grade schools too?

339
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,958
I'm sick of this. Whatever you're
going to do, do it quick.

340
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,364
- I've already done it.
- Well, do more.

341
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,506
- Yeah, like what?
- I don't know. Anything.

342
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,997
You can't use Felipe
in an undercover capacity.

343
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,836
Even though he'd lead us
to Armadillo, he's a minor.

344
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,078
And it's illegal to use a minor as a C.I.

345
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,749
Right.

346
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,526
How'd that two hours in the cage feel?

347
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:21,071
Huh? How's 20 years gonna feel?

348
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,332
I can't go when someone's watching me.

349
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:27,138
You better get used to it.

350
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,906
I'm gonna be watching you for a while.

351
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,346
Wh-What do you mean?

352
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,112
You're gonna do a good deed, Felipe.

353
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,686
<i>Make the Boys Club proud.</i>

354
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,054
What kind of good deed?

355
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,831
The State of California has a problem
with me using minors undercover...

356
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,356
so technically,
we're just gonna let you go free.

357
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,167
Keep an eye on you...
for your own safety.

358
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,202
Keep an eye on me?

359
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:58,377
You try to lose us,
you go right back in the can.

360
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,574
You're gonna reconnect with Duardo,
find out where Armadillo's hiding.

361
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,853
Yo, ma'am, shuffle broad.

362
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,252
Hey! Hey, hey!
Police. Hold it.

363
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,057
Hey, who taught you you could
treat an old woman like that?

364
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,327
<i>She can't tell. Crawling around,
clawing at the sidewalk.</i>

365
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,337
<i>- She's crazy.
- Okay, honey. It's all right.</i>

366
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,837
- Get out of here. Go on.
- We'll get you home to your daughter.

367
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,272
You all right?

368
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,544
Got her.

369
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,845
<i>- Danny, right?
- Hi.</i>

370
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,319
Vanessa. We met before.
Is Julien around?

371
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:49,824
- Uh, he should be right back.
- We're going over floral arrangements
for the wedding.

372
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,361
Right. Congratulations.

373
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,295
<i>Thanks.
It's all happening so fast.</i>

374
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,833
Yeah. Well, Julien's a special guy.

375
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:03,236
I have never met a man with such integrity.
He's gonna make a great father for Randall.

376
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,502
<i>I'm really lucky.</i>

377
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,737
Hi.

378
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,945
- You ready?
- Yeah.

379
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,580
Hey, Julien,
can I see you for a sec first?

380
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,624
I'll meet you at the car.

381
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,290
- My God. You haven't told her yet?
- It's not necessary.

382
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,123
Julien, she is a single woman
with a child.

383
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,033
- It's in my past. It is not important.
- She has a right to know.

384
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,766
- Every mistake I've ever made?
- About something
as important as this? Absolutely.

385
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,471
So you tell every man you've been with
about every shameful thing you've ever done?

386
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,313
You know what? If you don't
tell her before the wedding, I will.

387
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,121
<i>- What are you gonna do with your cut?
- What?</i>

388
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,599
Your cut.
From the money train.

389
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,397
Look, we discuss this
only when we have to.

390
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,529
The more we talk about it,
the more chance someone else hears.

391
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,771
- Our fugitive's calling in.
- Yeah, I got it.

392
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:22,246
I'm telling you, this money train?
It's a sure thing.

393
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,387
Taking mob money... that's not
why I signed up, joined the force.

394
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,459
Goddamn. You get any softer,
you're gonna start lactating.

395
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,053
You know, all the stuff we've been into,
there was a reason, a point to it.

396
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,296
Where's the good in this?

397
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,696
Money in our pockets
instead of those Balkan bastards.

398
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,362
I don't know, man.

399
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,242
You think I'm doing this for me?

400
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,811
<i>Vic's got a sick kid,
tuition payments...</i>

401
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,040
<i>doctor bills kicking his ass.</i>

402
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,283
I mean,
the guy could be facing a divorce.

403
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,581
<i>He really needs this.</i>

404
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,624
- Heroin in grade school.
- It's awful.

405
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,026
I'm gonna have to go on the attack now.

406
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,031
Find a way to turn this into votes.

407
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,137
Baby, what's wrong?

408
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,605
- I don't know how I got here.
- Hard work. Intelligence.

409
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,008
<i>- That's not what I meant.
- You'll catch whoever's doing this.</i>

410
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,310
<i>- Or Mackey will.
- Mackey?</i>

411
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,281
It's his investigation.

412
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,680
<i>- Can you trust him?
- No.</i>

413
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,581
- Then why?
- It made sense when it started.

414
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,022
And now there's so many loose threads...

415
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,028
To even pull just one...

416
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,597
- Oh, Christ.
- David. You're gonna win.

417
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,795
<i>Well, that's what
everyone keeps telling me.</i>

418
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:52,569
And if I don't, I embarrass myself...
embarrass you.

419
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,313
We have a daughter.
The only way you would embarrass me...

420
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,383
was if you weren't doing
everything you could...

421
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,248
to make those schools
as safe as possible.

422
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,213
Are you?

423
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,252
No.

424
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,756
<i>What's stopping you?</i>

425
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:13,523
<i>I want a wide net.
Hit the streets hard.
Check out all the schools.</i>

426
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,964
Grill every kid who got a free sample
and find out where they got it.

427
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,227
Sooner or later,
it's gonna lead us to Armadillo.

428
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,204
All right? Talk to all the gang-bangers
who got pushed out...

429
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:27,401
<i>when the Torrucos consolidated
and call me with anything.</i>

430
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,604
All right. Let's go.

431
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,585
Armadillo's in town?

432
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,053
Yeah. He's the one
dealing drugs in the schools.

433
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,156
- And you didn't tell me?
- I just found out.

434
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,556
- I need to talk to him.
- I know.

435
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,687
And as soon as I find him,
you'll get first shot.

436
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,594
And you and Mackey won't interfere?

437
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,394
No one will get in your way.

438
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,305
We'll give you a head start. You go in
and ask for a new batch of samples.

439
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,873
Phone.

440
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,514
<i>I'll call you
10 minutes after you're in.</i>

441
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,588
If the drugs are visible,
you pick up and say something clever.

442
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,124
If you don't answer,
I'll know they're not out.

443
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,956
- I'll keep calling until you pick up.
- Then what?

444
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,232
We'll make a little house call.
Pick up you and your buddies.

445
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,258
Once we get you back to the barn,
we cut you loose because you're a minor.

446
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:29,799
- No one knows we had this little arrangement.
- Okay.

447
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,506
- Cheers, little "G."
- Cheers.

448
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,586
- Thirsty, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

449
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,157
Hey I got some kids asking for more of
that stuff. I guess they like that shit.

450
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,323
All right, all right.

451
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,535
Cost them 20 now. Got that?

452
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,799
<i>- Yeah, yeah. I got it.
- All right.</i>

453
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,310
Yo, give him something
to carry this with, man.

454
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,880
<i>Yo.</i>

455
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,554
What, bitch?
I told you not to call me.

456
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,860
<i>- Little "G" settin'
the ho's straight already.
- Yeah.</i>

457
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,006
Hey, wh-what's the matter, dog?

458
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,775
That's what I wanna know.
Let's see who called you.

459
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,848
Get down!
Down on the ground. Down!

460
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,451
<i>Stay down!</i>

461
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,264
- You're dead.
- Shut up!

462
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:08,234
- You okay?
- No. I'm dead.

463
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,637
You wanted to see me?

464
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,282
Uh, yeah.
Close the door, please.

465
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,384
- I just got a call from the police.
- About my car?

466
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,153
Sit down, Danny.

467
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,468
- What?
- The call was from Maryland.
Your mother died.

468
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,901
<i>- A car accident.
- What?</i>

469
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,909
I'm so sorry.

470
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,210
- Can I call my dad?
- Yeah. I'll be outside.

471
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,725
Dad. It's me.

472
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,267
It was a goddamn prank.
It was a prank. My mother's fine.

473
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,671
- Slow down. What?
- I want that bitch's records subpoenaed.

474
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,673
- We have to prove that
she made that phone call.
- Danny, stop.

475
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,903
- I want a cop tailing her.
- Just calm down.

476
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,834
She destroys my car, and then she tries
to ruin my career. Now it's my family.

477
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,414
Okay. All right. We'll take care of this.
I'll take care of this.

478
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,182
<i>- The doctor said she can go home now.
- Great.</i>

479
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,314
- Thank you for all you did.
- Anne, hold on a second.

480
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,893
Your mom must have been 17, 18
when she dated Earl?

481
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,255
Pretty conservative times back then.

482
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,128
- Excuse me?
- Dutch.

483
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,734
You said she was going back
into her past. I didn't believe you.

484
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,532
But then Jeannie went back
to the store she used to work at...

485
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,366
<i>an apartment
where her old boyfriend lived.</i>

486
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,604
So why go back to a piece
of sidewalk in Echo Park?

487
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,548
<i>- Why?
- According to the L.A. Times archives...</i>

488
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:02,645
a newborn baby was found smothered to death
in that park, November 18, 1947.

489
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,078
Buried in a shallow grave.

490
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,420
<i>You wanna know
where that grave was located?</i>

491
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,460
Right where your mother sat today,
clawing at the asphalt.

492
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,894
<i>They built a sidewalk over the garden.</i>

493
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,900
Three blocks from Earl's old apartment.

494
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,537
No.

495
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:26,075
<i>- That's impossible.
- Someone in there helped
kill a baby boy, didn't they?</i>

496
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,047
I'm not even going to
waste my time with you.

497
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,812
You're running Armadillo's drugs
through the schools. Where is he?

498
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,682
Arma who?

499
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,757
Tell me. Tell me.

500
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,022
<i>Vic!</i>

501
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,929
<i>- Vic, open this door.
- Cállete.</i>

502
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,398
You ready?

503
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,437
- What's going on?
- I'm interrogating the suspect.

504
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,703
Duardo here runs the drugs
through the schools.

505
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,181
<i>- Isn't that right?
- I'm taking him back to the barn.</i>

506
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:06,173
- I'm not done.
- I'm taking him with me. Hand him over.

507
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,481
Come here.

508
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:17,158
You gave me the green light
to get Armadillo. I'm one step away.

509
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,931
I'm a little uncomfortable
with the steps you're now taking.

510
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:22,559
I saw the underage C.I. outside.
His cover's been blown?

511
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,936
We both knew that was a risk.

512
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:27,666
You've done a good job getting this far.
I just need to take it from here.

513
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,476
- Hey, you want Armadillo or not?
- I do.

514
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,501
- And Claudette and I will get him.
- Claudette?

515
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:37,907
She overheard.
There's nothing I can do about it.

516
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,142
We've got to do it by the book now.

517
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,185
<i>Shane, put him in my car.</i>

518
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,765
I spoke to Aceveda.
He said I passed my performance review.

519
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,838
You deserve to.

520
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,864
He also said I had communication and stress
management issues that need addressing.

521
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,506
- Look, you passed. Okay?
- This is because I didn't
cover you on that shooting.

522
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,080
You still think
I'm holding that over you?

523
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,751
<i>- Or maybe it's because I'm getting married.
- It's because it's the truth.</i>

524
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,549
Look, I think it's about something else.
Maybe it's because somebody's...

525
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,624
<i>messing with your car or they called on your
mom, and you're going to take it out on me?</i>

526
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,454
Hey, you are way past out of line.

527
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,152
I deserved higher marks on that.
That... That review goes on my jacket.

528
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,527
Truth is, Julien, I could've been
a whole lot tougher on you.

529
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,329
<i>Your inability to communicate
is a serious problem.</i>

530
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,133
You have this bottled-up pressure
because of your personal life...

531
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,206
and no release valve.

532
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,813
Things I've seen...
Your review could have been a lot worse.

533
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,951
I thought about
what you said about Vanessa.

534
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:50,409
- Good.
- I'm not gonna jeopardize
the only good relationship...

535
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,925
I've ever had because of something
I'm not and will never be again.

536
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,452
If you wanna tell her, fine.
That's on your conscience.

537
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,202
We found the heroin, your little sample bags.
We establish the ties...

538
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:07,399
to the schools, and you're sure to get
the death penalty for that little boy.

539
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,900
The only way to avoid it
is to give us Armadillo.

540
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,169
<i>He's your boss, right? Your supplier?</i>

541
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,711
How does he contact you?

542
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,887
Where is he?

543
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,462
- Yo, what's up?
- I got something for you.

544
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,702
This pimp's getting his girls
to roll johns in an alley off Western.

545
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:48,208
Okay, we'll check into it. But, tips like this
you can give over the phone.

546
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,349
<i>Okay. Vic.</i>

547
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:55,217
I really need to know where Brian is.
I need to see my son.

548
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,231
Connie, you can't.

549
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:12,927
I want him back, Vic.
I'm clean. I've got a job now.

550
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,299
He's with a new family.

551
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,704
You signed him over.

552
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,810
I was high then.

553
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,175
That's why you gave him up.

554
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:29,820
No. No.

555
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,914
I gave him to you
to take care of him for me.

556
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,124
You knew I'd get clean.
You saw how hard I was trying.

557
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:44,397
You don't know what this is like...
to lose your kid.

558
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,534
Please, Vic.

559
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:55,302
Brian's gone.
You have to accept that.

560
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,281
Okay.

561
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,025
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

562
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,599
Uh, that tip I just gave you?
I need a cash advance.

563
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,807
Thanks.

564
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,729
<i>Navaro make any calls yet?</i>

565
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,365
- Nope.
- They get Duardo to roll?

566
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,935
I don't know.
I'll be back.

567
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,409
- Hey, Carlton.
- What's up, Vic?

568
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,483
See this guy?
He's with the Lancaster Gang Unit.

569
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,915
He got you a spot
on their Clean Slate program.

570
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,754
- Is that like juvie?
- It's better.

571
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,819
Get rid of the ink, balls'll drop,
come back in a couple years a new man.

572
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,793
No one will even recognize you.

573
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,299
Hey, I had to pull a lot of favors
to get this to happen.

574
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,804
- Okay.
- Well, I'm waiting.

575
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,410
- Thank you.
- Go.

576
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,214
You killed your baby, didn't you, Earl?
You and Jeannie.

577
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:49,288
"Baby Boy Doe buried in the unidentified
grave section of the L.A. County Cemetery."

578
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,458
<i>We're gonna dig him up, Earl,
get your D.N.A. ...</i>

579
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:01,103
prove you were his father.

580
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,534
You really think Armadillo's
gonna reward you for your loyalty?

581
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,579
When we bust him,
he's gonna think it's because of you.

582
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,578
<i>He's got a lot of friends inside.</i>

583
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,487
You're gonna end up
burned to death in your cell.

584
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:20,583
And we're gonna get him.
All you guys think you're so brilliant.

585
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,658
We got you, didn't we?

586
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,923
What happens if I tell you where he is?

587
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,830
We'll make sure you're safe and sound
in Ossining, New York.

588
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,302
I can only tell you
where he's been staying lately.

589
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:44,114
- What's up?
- Duardo gave us Armadillo.
He's at a place in Inglewood.

590
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,445
- Great. I'll go get my guys.
- Not necessary.

591
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,481
- SWAT's already on their way there.
- SWAT?

592
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,347
I'll let you see him as soon as we
bring him in. All right, let's go.

593
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,990
<i>Vic.</i>

594
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:01,863
- Hi. What's up?
- I was thinking that...
we could get together tonight.

595
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,159
I can't do it tonight.
Rain check?

596
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,697
Name the time and the place.

597
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,199
You know,
I don't think that I can do this anymore.

598
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,041
Sure you can.
Just another time.

599
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:22,650
No, you know what? Um, this isn't working
for me the way that it used to.

600
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,153
I gotta get out of here.

601
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:33,092
You're wrong, Detective.
You don't know my mother.

602
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,890
I just wish you had a chance
to know your brother.

603
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,035
Should I be worried about you?

604
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,042
Not about me.

605
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,645
Maybe about the rest of humanity.

606
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,879
Bunch of sociopathic
little narcissists out for ourselves.

607
00:40:55,186 --> 00:41:00,055
Begging, stealing,
lying, screwing, raping.

608
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,927
Killing our babies.

609
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:07,330
<i>Whatever it takes to have a good time
and save our own asses.</i>

610
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:12,169
I can't even believe in an old woman
who's too sick to feed herself.

611
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:17,436
And it's not sad. It's not some big surprise.
It's just nature.

612
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,242
We're animals.
Nothing more.

613
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:24,006
And you know what?

614
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,308
I'm learning to be okay with that.

615
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,856
- Navaro's on the phone?
- Less than a minute.

616
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,156
- Prison switchboard confirms
he's talking to Armadillo.
- Give me the number.

617
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,768
This is 323.
Aceveda's going to Inglewood.

618
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,771
- That's 310.
- He's got the wrong address.
Go get the right one, quick.

619
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,871
<i>- What's he saying?
- Um, Armadillo's asking him
something in Spanish.</i>

620
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,614
- Something about a lawyer.
- Vic.

621
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,983
- What?
- We can't bring him in alive.

622
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,590
- What?
- Armadillo. We can't bring him in alive.

623
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:10,287
- Why is that?
- If we take him in,
the only thing he has to deal is us.

624
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,292
Look, I don't like it,
but this bastard has to go, Vic.

625
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,299
Jail won't slow him down. You tried reasoning
with him. I'm not going to lose my job...

626
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,771
so some kid-raping piece of shit can bargain
down his sentence, make me his bunk-mate.

627
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,167
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

628
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,766
- You talk to Shane about this?
- No, but I can.

629
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,174
<i>- 3938 Bonita Vista.
- Okay, let's go.</i>

630
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,943
Ronnie, stay on the line.
Call us with anything we need.

631
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,653
Lem, you drive.

632
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:37,416
Hey, uh, shouldn't
we be taking two cars?

633
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,752
- No, we're good.
- Yeah?

634
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,461
Armadillo's
still on the phone with his bro.

635
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
First guy who gets
a good shot takes it. Go.

636
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,948
- Nothing.
- Goddamn it.

637
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,320
- Think somebody tipped him off?
- Who?

638
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,554
I don't know.

639
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,194
- Yeah?
- I hope you all made it.

640
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,739
<i>Hey. Weren't you supposed to
meet me here to suck my dick?</i>

641
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,873
I wanted to speak to you
one last time.

642
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,414
You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.

643
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,312
I've already taken care of my brother.

644
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:23,186
<i>And now you've been greenlit.</i>
