1
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,668
So, how am I doing?

2
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:25,973
I got no complaints.

3
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,441
You wanna go someplace more private?

4
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,516
I thought this
was as private as it got here.

5
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,848
I mean, outside.

6
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:40,253
Sounds promising.

7
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,692
We gotta hurry up.

8
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,859
I don't want my boss to catch me.

9
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:52,065
Are you sure you're not a cop?
If I were a cop, would I do this?

10
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,707
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

11
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:58,639
No way.

12
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:02,416
How are we supposed to know
when these muggers try to jump him?

13
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:05,475
-We gotta go in.
-And ruin a good thing? He'd kill us.

14
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:09,647
Jesus.

15
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,488
-I just lost my appetite.
-Told you I saw something.

16
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:15,219
Sir!

17
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,264
You wanna stop jerkin' off there?

18
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,799
Get your hands
out of your pants and put 'em up!

19
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,129
All right.

20
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:22,897
Get up against the wall. Move it!

21
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,302
I can explain!
Up against the wall.

22
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:26,897
Get his wallet.

23
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,611
Turn around.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,714
Long way from Pasadena.

25
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,207
Alleys not good enough for you there?

26
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,851
This is the stupidest thing I've ever done.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,252
We call it a lewd act in public.

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,016
God.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,857
I guess she wasn't one of the girls involved
with the mugging ring.

30
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,421
-You dog. You nailed her, didn't you?
-Like I'd tell you three.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,798
-No, he was deep undercover.
-My God.

32
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:56,992
Yeah?

33
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,698
Calm down, Connie. What's the matter?

34
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:03,668
All right, hold on.

35
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:05,477
Listen, I gotta run.

36
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,707
Wait a half-hour
and then send the next guy in.

37
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:11,218
Rotate until one of you gets attacked.
Or gets a little tail.

38
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,116
All right, where are you now?

39
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,420
God.

40
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,782
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,419
Christ! Connie, what happened?

42
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,459
She was my mom.

43
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,633
DANCER ON So, tell me, Ronnie....

44
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,138
-He used his own name?
-Amateur.

45
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:36,199
Like, what kind of stuff you into?
You know, golf.

46
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:37,909
I'm a four handicap.

47
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:41,106
He looking to caddy for this chick
or get his junk greased? Jesus.

48
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:43,047
Sit right here and relax.

49
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:44,811
You like this?
Yeah.

50
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,385
Yeah?
But could you...

51
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,887
...like, just kind of tease me?

52
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,049
Tease you?

53
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,786
Not really take it off.

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,762
Like almost, and then not.
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,391
-Is he for real?
-All right, that's it. I'm going in.

56
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:00,729
That's it.

57
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:02,739
Ronnie.

58
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,798
What are you gonna do about him, Connie?

59
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,398
-I'll feed him.
-I mean....

60
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:13,539
Without your mom,
who's gonna take care of Brian?

61
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:16,412
-I can take care of him.
-You need help.

62
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,515
I'll get clean.

63
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:22,954
I won't need help.
You can barely take care of yourself.

64
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,456
No.

65
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,049
Connie--
Please!

66
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,562
They can't take Brian. He's all I got left.

67
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:35,762
My mom.

68
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:37,766
God, Vic.

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,864
My mommy's dead.

70
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:42,875
Help me, Vic.

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,309
You can get me through it.

72
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,473
Connie, you need to go somewhere.

73
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:49,844
Rehab...

74
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:52,676
...a treatment center.

75
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,286
The DA's still looking at my plea.

76
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,753
I'll go into detox, and they'll use that.

77
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,989
I'll lose Brian, and they'll take my aid!

78
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:07,491
Okay, I am, it's been
like 12 hours since I chased.

79
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:13,629
-Tonight and tomorrow, that'll be the worst.
-Connie....

80
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:15,939
I'm gonna get straight this time.

81
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,675
I have to.

82
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:22,949
I'm his mom.

83
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:44,516
Reporter?

84
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,256
From La Unidad.

85
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:49,986
Didn't you know our captain
is a Latino to watch?

86
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,726
How about a story about
a lanky white guy to watch?

87
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:56,563
Since your arrival, there have been
major drops in all areas of crime.

88
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,602
This precinct was an experiment.

89
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:01,963
But those stats aren't a coincidence.
The barn is a success.

90
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,633
The barn?
Farmington's called "the farm."

91
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,573
When we moved into the old church...

92
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:09,272
...one of the officers
nicknamed the place "the barn."

93
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,438
The name stuck.

94
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,744
It's ironic, taking over a church.

95
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,645
God moved out. The cops moved in.

96
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,709
God's still here. We just sublet.

97
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,082
You don't mind
if I talk to some of your people?

98
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,589
Get some background?

99
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:21,748
Of course not.

100
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,684
Good night for
Aceveda to have a sex sweep.

101
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,120
Yeah, we busted a one-armed hooker.

102
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,826
For $50, she'll let you
hump her in her socket.

103
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,997
Julien and I were in Koreatown,
caught this guy masturbating in the alley.

104
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:37,040
Wasn't even homeless.
It was just a regular Joe from Pasadena.

105
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:40,275
This guy, you remember
what alley he was in?

106
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:42,504
The one between Sixth and Wentworth...

107
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,310
...next to the laundromat
that keeps getting hit.

108
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:46,781
You're sure?

109
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,743
Positive.

110
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,351
He's not...

111
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,981
...honing in on your territory,
is he, Detective?

112
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,491
-What was his name? Do you remember?
-His name?

113
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:01,326
Yeah, it was on the ticket, right?

114
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:02,729
We didn't give him one.

115
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,694
He was a citizen. We just...

116
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:07,393
...gave him a verbal warning,
put the scare in him.

117
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,132
Try and remember. What was it?

118
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,777
-Sean, I think?
-Taylor.

119
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,069
Sean Taylor.

120
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,237
Yeah. That's it.

121
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,310
What was that about?

122
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,743
Who knows? It's Dutch.

123
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,284
If you put yourself or this kid
in harm's way...

124
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,758
...DCFS isn't gonna take him away, I am.

125
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,387
You understand?

126
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,961
I promise, Vic. I promise.

127
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,322
Okay.

128
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:38,162
You should drink a lot of fluids.
Water, juice.

129
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,495
Your mom got any bananas back here?
I don't know.

130
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,906
One of my guys is coming to sit with ya.

131
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,305
Where will you be?

132
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:47,568
I'm gonna take Brian away.

133
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,910
-No.
-Connie, trust me.

134
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:53,006
You're not gonna want him to see this.

135
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,447
Yeah.

136
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,516
Yeah, you're right.

137
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:00,617
Don't worry.

138
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:02,792
I'm gonna take care of him.

139
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,359
I love him.

140
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,656
I really love him.

141
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,858
I know you do.

142
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,432
You are so hot.

143
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,638
Yes, I am.

144
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,309
Am I turning you on?

145
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,179
That's nine inches of yes in there, darlin'.

146
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,943
Feels more like 10.

147
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:32,781
You know, I don't usually do this but...

148
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,788
...do you wanna go out back
and finish this off?.

149
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,655
All I got's time and money.

150
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:49,703
-What? I was doing good.
-I'm a four handicap?

151
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,434
I was laying the groundwork.

152
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,277
You're killing me, baby.
Let me take this thing off you.

153
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:58,008
Let me take this off you real quick.

154
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:01,051
He shoots, he scores.

155
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,351
Shit, Shane. Go!

156
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:13,058
Freeze! Police! Get 'em up!
Against the wall! Turn around!

157
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,496
Hands behind your head!
Get on your knees!

158
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,295
Get down!
Turn around.

159
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,562
Get on your knees!

160
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:19,897
Shane, are you all right?

161
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:24,397
Can you say anything?
Yes!

162
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,072
Danny!

163
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,512
Is this the guy you caught jerking off?.

164
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:34,278
No, I can't go in there! No!

165
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,545
Yeah.

166
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,844
Thanks.

167
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,914
No!

168
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,889
No, I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:44,950
No!

170
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,890
No, I'm not going in there!

171
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:50,127
You should have thought of that
before you solicited a cop.

172
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,096
Get off!

173
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:56,362
Get him off! He's biting me!

174
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,940
Get him off!

175
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,139
Goddamn it! Shit! Get him off!

176
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:06,642
Stay down!

177
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:07,809
Move!

178
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,655
You okay?

179
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,452
I gotta get to the hospital.

180
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,917
Have a blood run, PEP.

181
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:19,394
PEP?
Post-exposure prevention.

182
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:21,328
In case the guy's got...

183
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:22,823
...HIV.

184
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,460
-You think he does?
-You saw the guy.

185
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:31,704
Damn, I was so close to her.
That prick had to come and break it up.

186
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:35,506
-Dude, let it go.
-Look, I'm telling you, it wasn't just an act.

187
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,910
She really felt something.

188
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,379
That roll of $20s in your pocket.

189
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,976
I'm serious.
She was rubbing her ass all over my hands.

190
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,811
They don't just do that for everyone.

191
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:48,113
I've got a friend who lives in Chicago.

192
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,651
You from there?

193
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,484
Yeah. Rockford.

194
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,362
Is that like a suburb?

195
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,626
No, it's its own town.

196
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,031
What are you doing here, Detective?

197
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:01,767
-The officers should have given you a ticket.
-Okay.

198
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,441
What you did's a misdemeanor.

199
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,007
Trust me, nobody's
more embarrassed about it than I am.

200
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:11,010
We all do it. You just got caught.

201
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,975
This any good?

202
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,507
I guess that depends on what
you're looking for specifically, Detective.

203
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,951
About the radio.

204
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,820
The one in my car
only seems to pick up Spanish stations.

205
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,655
That's not your system,
that's just Los Angeles.

206
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,832
-I guess I'm done here.
-Okay, that's it?

207
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,294
That's it.

208
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,438
-Some husbands just bring home flowers.
-Yeah.

209
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,308
I didn't have time to wrap him up.

210
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:46,841
Who is this?

211
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,176
It's Brian...

212
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:49,748
...Connie's kid.

213
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:53,320
-Connie?
-This hooker. It's a long story.

214
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,621
You brought a prostitute's child home?

215
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,588
Why are you doing this?
Connie's mother died.

216
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,221
Stroke.

217
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,896
I'm sorry, but--

218
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,297
She's trying to kick her habit
so they won't take him away.

219
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:10,030
-You expect me to watch him?
-lt's just for one night.

220
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,265
Look....

221
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,108
I'm sorry.
You're the only one I trust him with.

222
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,570
It's okay.

223
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,646
-I hate you.
-I love you, too.

224
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,380
I gotta go.

225
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:29,344
Officer, would you see her
to her car, please? Thank you.

226
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,255
Who's the woman?

227
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,950
Nobody.

228
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,824
You'd think interviewing so many liars
would make you a better one.

229
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,921
What?

230
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:42,059
Everybody knows you're following up
on Danny and Julien's self-pleasurer.

231
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,697
Some of the guys started a pool
to see who'd come up with the best joke.

232
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,803
I think he's our serial killer.

233
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,568
Dutch--
He killed Sally and the others.

234
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,909
Got anything this time other than intuition?

235
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,142
-Like evidence?
-That woman?

236
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,516
That's his aunt.
She raised him after his parents died.

237
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,555
His early childhood fits the profile.

238
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,056
Shy, introverted, a loner.

239
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,955
You're getting colder, not hotter.

240
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:09,518
He was caught masturbating two blocks
from the corner where Sally worked.

241
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:12,964
Still cold. You never established
Sally was killed in that alley.

242
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,467
It's the classic opportunity offender MO.

243
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:19,632
They only kill when circumstances present
them with the perfect victim and time.

244
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,574
And if they're not perfect?
Plan B.

245
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,606
Relive the fantasy
at the scene of an earlier crime.

246
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,873
It's getting chilly again.

247
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,745
Think about it.
The guy has an apartment in Pasadena...

248
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,612
...has complete privacy there.

249
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:35,846
Why is he traveling to one of the worst
parts of town just to jerk off in an alley?

250
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,489
-You okay?
-I gotta get up.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,989
I gotta--

252
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,262
No. Just lay down. Just relax.

253
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,962
No!

254
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,972
Now, relax--

255
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,939
Jesus Christ!

256
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,636
Connie?
She hit me!

257
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,844
Okay, all right.

258
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,042
I'm here.

259
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,345
Vic!

260
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,484
Vic.
Here.

261
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,219
Try to drink something.

262
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,426
It's water. Come on, drink.

263
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,555
Okay, good girl.

264
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,558
Okay.

265
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,365
I love you, Vic.

266
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:26,763
Yeah.

267
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,430
Rest.

268
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,135
Okay? Connie?

269
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,510
Come on. Rest.

270
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,173
I love you, Vic.

271
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,942
Yeah.

272
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,481
Rest now. Rest.

273
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,222
Is your head okay?
No, it hurts.

274
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,595
I'm sorry about that, you know.
I didn't know you were a cop.

275
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,332
That was the idea.

276
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,440
I wanted to stop Carl from hitting you...

277
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,175
...'cause I think you're real cute.

278
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,677
Sexy.

279
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,241
Southern, right?

280
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,340
Atlanta...

281
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,543
...thereabouts.

282
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,609
Hot-lanta.

283
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,448
Yeah. So....

284
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,982
Tell me about Carl.

285
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:22,995
Carl introduced me to the club's owner.
That's when I started, you know--

286
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,121
Stripping.

287
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,522
Dancing.

288
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,656
I'm a dancer.

289
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,695
Sorry.

290
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,838
Then, this one night,
Carl comes to me with this, like...

291
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,374
..."relevation," asks for my help...

292
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,204
...and, you know,
he was getting my medicine...

293
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,802
...so I felt like I owed him.

294
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,644
I'm epileptic.
Puts you in a tough spot.

295
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,650
I knew it was wrong,
but he was such a sweet guy.

296
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,189
He hit me in the head with a tire iron.

297
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,823
Yeah, I remember that.

298
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,962
Why are you guys harassing me?

299
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,958
-My aunt?
-We just asked her a few questions.

300
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,959
-She's a nice lady.
-Yes.

301
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,502
She told us about the fire.

302
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,199
What fire?

303
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,706
The one your parents died in
when you were a kid.

304
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,876
I gotta give your aunt a lot of credit.

305
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,936
Couldn't have been easy raising a child
in those circumstances.

306
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,709
I owe her everything.

307
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,013
You deserve a pat on the back yourself.

308
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,084
Why?

309
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,754
To be able to lift yourself
above something like that...

310
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:28,323
...excel in the face of tragedy,
speaks volumes about your character.

311
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,160
-I did the best I could.
-I'd say!

312
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,162
Magna cum laude,
top 10 in your graduating class.

313
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,227
Turned down a full ride to law school.

314
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:42,207
Who wants to be a lawyer, right?
I hear ya.

315
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:46,002
But it does bring up an interesting question.

316
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,879
For a guy
with such impressive brainpower...

317
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:52,457
...why install car stereos for a living?

318
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:00,578
Look....

319
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:03,411
I jerked off in an alley.

320
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:04,949
Okay?

321
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:08,584
I'm embarrassed. Now just
write me a ticket, and let's be done with it.

322
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,160
You like to hunt, Sean?

323
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,890
-Do I like to hunt?
-Mike, your best friend in high school?

324
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:20,563
-How do you know about Mike?
-I talked to a detective back in Rockford.

325
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:25,570
"Two boys go into the woods
deer hunting. Only one comes back alive."

326
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,474
It was an accident.
Maybe.

327
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,911
Or maybe something
happened in those woods?

328
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,583
Or maybe you just have
a very active imagination.

329
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:41,189
"An intelligent, but underachieving loner."

330
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,954
I wonder how you give
your imagination a workout?

331
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:46,622
Look, I know what you're trying to get at,
Detective...

332
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,400
...and, frankly,
this whole psychoanalyzation thing...

333
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,629
...it just seems a bit out of your league.

334
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:55,639
-I'm just trying to get to know you better.
-Please....

335
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,136
I know more about you
than you'll know about me.

336
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,200
Really?

337
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,873
Either this guy's innocent,
or he doesn't scare easily.

338
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,415
He's the guy.

339
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,545
We'd better find something fast,
'cause we can't hold him.

340
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,350
Heard you've been
interviewing the masturbator.

341
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,581
What are you doing, getting tips?

342
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,627
Goddamn it!

343
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,729
-I want to go home!
-Connie, you are home, honey.

344
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:29,735
I want to die!

345
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,307
What is happening?
Connie!

346
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,942
Connie!

347
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,038
Vic.

348
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:42,644
That's right, sweetheart, it's me.
It's okay. I'm here. Okay, baby, I'm here.

349
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,881
I'm here. That's right.
We had sex.

350
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,924
I told him it was time to pay.

351
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:51,451
He said he didn't have to pay.
That's when he started hitting me!

352
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:54,155
Man, Connie--
He pulled out a gun!

353
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:58,090
-I took it and shot him!
-What's she saying?

354
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:03,134
You have to hit me.
Hit me, all right? Come on!

355
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,072
Connie.

356
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,471
Please, Vic.

357
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,840
Please, I wanna die.

358
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,475
I wanna die. I wanna die!

359
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,813
No.
Yeah.

360
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,855
No, you don't.

361
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:20,050
Detective Wyms?

362
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:22,756
-Tereza Verela.
-Yes, I know.

363
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:25,387
You have a minute?
People say you're the one to talk to.

364
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:26,521
About what?

365
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:30,465
I'm doing a piece on your captain, and
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.

366
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,095
Such as?
His effectiveness?

367
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:35,298
People skills? Relationships?

368
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:40,107
He's very effective.
He seems to do fine with people...

369
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,006
...and his relationship is,
he's my boss, a very good one.

370
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,513
He skipped a few steps
in his rise to captain.

371
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,610
More desk than street time.

372
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:52,082
-People resent that?
-I don't.

373
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,857
One big, happy family?

374
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,326
I don't know any family that doesn't have
the occasional disagreement.

375
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,862
Neither do I.

376
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,188
You're talking about the Strike Team.

377
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,858
Am I?

378
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:07,104
Our sources confirm numerous complaints
of excessive force...

379
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:11,071
...IAD investigations, civil suits--
I don't know.

380
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,509
I don't have your sources.

381
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:17,841
-Look, Carl totally rolled on Tulips.
-And Tulips totally rolled on Carl.

382
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:22,716
He's a Svengali guy who got the
dancers to go on his bait-and-bash scheme.

383
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,188
Carl says Tulips organized all the girls
and set up all the muggings.

384
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,987
Come on, she's an epileptic hottie,
not Amy Fisher.

385
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,618
Bottom line, who's the ringleader?

386
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,253
Him!
Her!

387
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,821
This has gotta be the easiest case
we've had all year.

388
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:37,595
-Are you telling me I have to get involved?
-No.

389
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,731
Then get to the bottom of it...

390
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:42,339
...or just nail both of 'em
for kicking Shane's ass.

391
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:43,930
I didn't get my ass kicked.

392
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,506
I got sucker-punched.

393
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,701
Right.

394
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:47,801
Sorry.

395
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,839
What'd the doctor say?

396
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,784
'Till Aceveda subpoenas
the prom queen's medical records...

397
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:58,720
...I take these pills,
get a blood test every 30 days.

398
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,986
I'm sorry. I took my eyes off him
for a second. It happened so fast.

399
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,892
I hit him with the baton.
It caused blood to get in your cut.

400
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,088
Look....

401
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,358
Julien, it's not like we shared needles.

402
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,993
I screwed up, though.
I should have played this smarter.

403
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:14,170
It's just a bite, you know?

404
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,420
The drug kit I'm on, I got no worries.

405
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,030
I heard what happened. You okay?

406
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,065
Just a couple of scratches. No big deal.

407
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:29,037
You let loose pretty good
on that queer last night.

408
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:31,035
Yeah.

409
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,746
You did the right thing, Julien.

410
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:40,950
That prick jumped you
in front of a dozen scumbags.

411
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,579
We need to send a message.

412
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,824
-What kind of message?
-Blanket party.

413
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,757
No, thanks, all right?

414
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,821
It's in the past.

415
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,067
You change your mind, you let us know.

416
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,573
What's a blanket party?

417
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,942
Somebody likes to draw.

418
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,238
"Detective Wagenbach craves respect.

419
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:12,950
"Fantasizes about being well-liked...

420
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:17,714
"...yet shows no outward manifestation
of his low self-esteem.

421
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,021
"Feels ignored, unappreciated.

422
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,527
"Inadequate with women."

423
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:27,863
It's just off some first impressions,
but I'll stand by it.

424
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,263
Maybe you'd like to read my palms, too.

425
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:33,237
Look at him.

426
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:37,236
Tell me I'm wrong.

427
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:43,410
It's why you became a cop.

428
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:47,616
You thought by having a gun and a badge,
they'd respect you.

429
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:48,916
They do.

430
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:54,293
Even in a uniform, you were still a joke.

431
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,624
It's why you became a detective.

432
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:59,529
Tell me more.
Dutch.

433
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,264
It's all right.

434
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:03,963
You're still the same lonely kid
from high school.

435
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:09,074
When you look in the mirror, you don't see
the person you wish you were.

436
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:14,711
Just a lowly civil servant
that you hoped you'd never become.

437
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,386
I hope you're here to pick him up.

438
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,617
Not yet.

439
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,224
What are you doing?

440
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:28,427
Bringing some things to Connie.

441
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,424
Is that where you were all night?

442
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:34,831
We're taking care of her.
She puked all over her clothes. It's ugly.

443
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,301
How about helping me?
It's ugly around here, too.

444
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:38,702
I'm sorry.

445
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,703
Why don't you just take
this crack whore to detox?

446
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,675
I can't. She'll lose him if I do.

447
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:45,769
What the hell's going on, Vic?

448
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,347
-What are you talking about?
-I'm not stupid.

449
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:49,973
Between you and her, what is it?

450
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,244
Nothing.

451
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,280
Are you sleeping with her?

452
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:55,184
Jesus, the kids!

453
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:59,620
God.

454
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,321
-Is this your son?
-Stop it.

455
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:06,593
Tell me!

456
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,528
I pulled her out of a brawl two years ago.

457
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:17,808
These Thai-towners were kicking
the shit out of her for stealing johns.

458
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,840
I gave her my number.
I told her to call me if she needed help.

459
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,577
One night, she did.

460
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:28,219
Cracked out on the floor
of a hotel bathroom...

461
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:32,959
...six months pregnant, screaming, crying,
begging for forgiveness.

462
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,588
I show up and find her
in a pool of bloody crystals.

463
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:42,526
She tried to get rid of him
with some Drano and a plunger handle.

464
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:45,068
I rushed them to Mission Cross.

465
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:47,603
They did an emergency C-section.

466
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:51,234
Ten weeks premature.

467
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:53,773
Jonesing at birth.

468
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,242
He's a tough kid.

469
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:06,153
I....

470
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:09,186
I have some old dresses in the garage.

471
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:11,594
Thank you.

472
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:20,002
We got a problem, Tulips.

473
00:24:20,076 --> 00:24:23,273
Carl says you were the one
who organized the muggings.

474
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:24,745
What?
Yep.

475
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:28,250
Says he was just the muscle,
that you were the brains.

476
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:31,684
-You don't believe him, do you?
-No, of course not.

477
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:34,222
But who knows how a jury would see it?

478
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,618
So what can I do?

479
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:42,624
Is there anything that you can give me
to prove Carl's guilt?

480
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,391
I don't know.

481
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,663
Come on. You gotta work with me here.

482
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,398
Victims' names, dates.

483
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:52,665
He was the one who set everything up.
I just did what he asked.

484
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,203
There's only one deal to be made here...

485
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,315
...and I'd really like to see you get it.

486
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,918
I want it.

487
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:11,320
I mean, there's gotta be
something I can put on the table.

488
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,155
Right?

489
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,868
I want to give you
a chance to explain yourself.

490
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:21,936
What's to explain?

491
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:25,462
-Why'd you bite my partner?
-'Cause I wanted to give her what I got.

492
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:28,500
You can't pass HIV through biting.

493
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,442
Aren't you the expert.

494
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,812
-So you were trying to kill her?
-I got it in jail.

495
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,312
Cops put me in jail,
so why shouldn't I give it to cops?

496
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,489
Look at you.

497
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,593
You're the reason why people hate faggots!

498
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,663
Wanna give me a big kiss, lover?

499
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:51,430
I should have bitten both of you!

500
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,437
-Where is it you're from again?
-La Unidad.

501
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,310
So, what is this room?

502
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:11,342
Observation. Victims and witnesses
can safely identify suspects.

503
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:17,956
And we get to monitor
interrogation techniques.

504
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,961
About three years.

505
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,363
I have less free time than you'd think.

506
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:25,559
That's right.
"The harm on the farm."

507
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:28,828
That's what people call
the policing tactics in Farmington.

508
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,160
Isn't it?

509
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,762
It's just PR.

510
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,139
Never hurts to have the bad guys
a little nervous.

511
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,411
I'd say they're more than nervous.

512
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,278
The complaints suggest brutality.

513
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:42,945
Really?

514
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:48,051
Does your captain
encourage that type of law enforcement?

515
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,189
I need my detective.

516
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,059
Who is that woman?

517
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:00,973
What are you telling her?
Me?

518
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:03,963
-She's the one looking for dirt.
-So she goes where it's dirty?

519
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,031
You and I don't like each other.
That's not a new headline.

520
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:08,201
No, it's not.

521
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:12,145
One thing you know,
if I come after you, it'll be straight on.

522
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,909
This one'll cut your hands off...

523
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:16,850
...and then sweetly smile
as she asks you to clap louder.

524
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:21,448
If she keeps digging, I don't think
either one of us is gonna be happy.

525
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,185
Agreed.

526
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,687
So how do we shut her down?

527
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,597
I heard Danny went home early.

528
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:36,331
The medicine she's on
is making her nauseous.

529
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:40,433
I hope she doesn't end up another Watson.

530
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,704
Knock wood.
Who's Watson?

531
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:44,878
Got stuck with a needle.

532
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:46,647
No one ever mentioned him before.

533
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:47,875
What do you expect?

534
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:53,017
Cop gets shot in the line of duty and it's all
commendations and 21-gun salutes.

535
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,854
Some queer in a dress gives you AIDS...

536
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:59,251
...you end up unemployed
and the city's dirty little secret.

537
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,588
The guy who bit her couldn't care less.

538
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,963
You know, just because Danny...

539
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:08,629
...doesn't want to give him a blanket party
doesn't mean this fairy doesn't deserve one.

540
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,938
Count me in.

541
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:19,977
Last cage on the right. Let's go, darling.

542
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:21,941
-How's the case coming?
-Sweet.

543
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,451
I cut a deal with Tulips
to testify against Carl.

544
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,956
Roped in the girls who were in on it.
Consider the mugging book closed.

545
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,425
I was doing a little channel surfing
up in observation.

546
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:34,193
I didn't know we got the Spice Network.

547
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:37,969
-You saw that.
-Yeah. I better not see any repeats.

548
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:41,102
I talked to the girlies.
They all say the same thing.

549
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,443
-Tulips was behind the whole thing.
-What?

550
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:47,848
Yeah. Apparently Carl was just like
her sexual pawn she totally manipulated.

551
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,086
Imagine that.

552
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:58,191
Tulips.

553
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,770
-So when am I gettin' outta here?
-I'm not too sure, darling.

554
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:10,040
See, your dancer friends and Carl...

555
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:14,977
...they have a different hit on who's been
calling the shots in your slam-dance scam.

556
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:16,805
You.

557
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:25,318
-So what are you saying?
-I'm saying that with their testimony...

558
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:29,153
...two years is the best I can get for you.

559
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:32,089
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:40,103
How much time are you getting
for sexual misconduct?

561
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,370
Pardon me?

562
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:45,633
I got a yammy
full of Georgia joy juice, darling...

563
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,838
...enough DNA to have you
writing parking tickets in Pacoima.

564
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:51,472
So, am I walking out of here...

565
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,746
...or do we need to call your supervisor?

566
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,557
Do I look okay?

567
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:09,463
Beautiful.

568
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:20,535
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

569
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,477
Would you like a drink?

570
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:26,842
Yeah.

571
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,210
You should lie down.
Okay.

572
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:32,586
-Can you just get me some tea first?
-Sure.

573
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:56,339
I'm tired of talking about my parents.

574
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,442
Let's talk about you.

575
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:02,450
How does your father feel
about the way that your life's turned out?

576
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,248
He's proud of me.

577
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:05,711
Sure.

578
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,953
That's what he says to your face.

579
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:11,921
-Man!
-Guys, come here.

580
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,361
You gotta check this out.

581
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:15,899
-What's up?
-Dutch is getting hammered by this civvie.

582
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:16,991
It's brutal!

583
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:20,629
It's like watching a train wreck,
only it's more horrific!

584
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,101
Whatever you're after, put it on the table.

585
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,604
Okay.

586
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,773
Tell me about
the increased allegations of brutality.

587
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:34,279
We're a proactive force.
Bad guys don't like to be arrested.

588
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:36,080
Allegations are all they are.

589
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:38,752
So you're not promoting use of force...

590
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:42,290
...as a way to inflate
your impressive crime statistics?

591
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,418
Please.

592
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:44,583
Listen...

593
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,720
...he's the top cop in this building.

594
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:49,425
He gets results,
but not at the expense of the law.

595
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:51,434
He deserves a lot of credit.

596
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,834
What about your alleged rape
of a 21-year-old white girl?

597
00:32:00,478 --> 00:32:01,570
What?

598
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,473
Would you like to take credit for that?

599
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,210
Give us a minute.

600
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:18,592
What are you doing?

601
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:22,894
A captain with a history of violence
is in command of the district...

602
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:26,198
...with the highest percentage
of brutality complaints.

603
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,697
Now he wants to be on the city council.

604
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,802
That was 15 years ago.

605
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,868
Hospital records show
Maureen Wilmore had signs of bruising...

606
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:36,413
...and burns.

607
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,515
I'm not gonna discuss this.

608
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:41,480
I have a wife and daughter.

609
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:45,511
And how would you feel if their rapist
wanted to be their representative?

610
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:48,492
There's not a story here.

611
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:54,126
I'll take that as a "no comment."

612
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,453
Truth is, Sean...

613
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,427
...I may not have been the most popular guy
in high school but I got laid.

614
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,935
More than a few times.

615
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,131
I'm getting laid now, too.
And guess what? She's hot.

616
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,472
Pathetic.
Man!

617
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,010
What's going on?

618
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:36,944
Sherlock Holmes
is getting smoked!

619
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,980
Truth is...

620
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,079
...I just like to solve puzzles.

621
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,119
I would have told you earlier but I needed
to buy some time to do a few things.

622
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,248
Now....

623
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:51,157
Here's what I know about you.

624
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,895
You're perceptive.

625
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,900
You can sense when people are vulnerable.

626
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,271
You have access...

627
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,533
...to other people's cars.

628
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,137
That way, they can't be traced back to you.

629
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,243
Meticulous.

630
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,518
There wasn't a speck of dust in your shop...

631
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,521
...'cause in your business,
you can't make any mistakes.

632
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:28,293
Did you put a Sony CD player
into a green Ford Taurus five weeks ago?

633
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,363
I don't know. I work on a lot of cars.

634
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:35,564
Customer said you returned it
with a broken right rear tail light.

635
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,075
Now, that does sound
vaguely familiar there.

636
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:49,417
You remember Sally, Sean?
Should I, Dutch?

637
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,918
My God!

638
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,587
Someone stop it!

639
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,823
I wanna leave.

640
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,229
You had the chance to leave earlier.

641
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,826
Instead,
you decided to stick around and show off.

642
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,065
We got the judge
to issue us the search warrant.

643
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,163
For what?

644
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,535
He gave us the keys to your place.

645
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,071
You're not gonna find anything there.

646
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:19,104
Just the standard collection
of bondage-domination porn.

647
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:23,285
Which is why we also got
a search warrant for your aunt's house.

648
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,050
You can't do that.

649
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,958
You co-signed the mortgage papers.
Technically, we can.

650
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,761
I thought this guy
was eatin' Dutch for lunch.

651
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,364
Let me draw you a picture, Sean.

652
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:38,995
This...

653
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,035
...is your aunt's house.

654
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,035
This is the porch, and this....

655
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,838
This is the crawlspace...

656
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,210
...Pasadena PD just dug two bodies out of.

657
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,746
How many more are we gonna find, Sean?

658
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,146
Five?

659
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,881
10?

660
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,802
17!

661
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,630
17?

662
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,811
Jesus Christ!

663
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,313
That's just under the crawlspace, you know.

664
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,347
The other ones I dumped.

665
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,012
I ran out of room under my aunt's house.

666
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,987
That's pathetic.

667
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,256
What is?

668
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,160
How typical you are.

669
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,059
As soon as you're caught,
you try to be special.

670
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,839
I killed 22 people...

671
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:59,277
...23 if you want to count
the hunting accident back in Rockford.

672
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,943
I'm special, all right.

673
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,852
If you're so special...

674
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:11,088
...how come a lowly civil servant like me
just caught you?

675
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:22,104
That's something
they don't teach you at the academy.

676
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,201
Yeah!

677
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,068
Dutch!

678
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,370
That was a great job, man.

679
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,573
Thanks.
Really.

680
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,646
Dutch.
Yeah.

681
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:37,186
-Told you we'd get this guy.
-Yes, you did.

682
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,415
I thought I would have to do all the work.

683
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,582
Right.

684
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,086
Good job.

685
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,654
Thanks.

686
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,534
Looks like you're quite the celebrity.

687
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,047
Way to go, Ron Jeremy.

688
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,681
A simple investigation and you cage
everyone except for the evil stripper.

689
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:16,555
At least we got the guy who hit me,
and she's a dancer.

690
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,360
You think the dancer will have any trouble
findin' another loser with a tire iron?

691
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,992
Come on. Everyone else here
is free to just bang away.

692
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,662
Lem here's nailin' Chiquita Banana.
Hey.

693
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,604
-You know what I'm sayin'.
-I'm tired of you sayin' it.

694
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,903
So once again, I'm the asshole.

695
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,535
No, just leave Tigre out of this. I dig her.

696
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:38,047
This whole West Side Story thing's
got a life span of two weeks, tops.

697
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,275
What?

698
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,210
Where's Connie?
Gone.

699
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,559
Shit.

700
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:52,331
You're my wife.
I don't want to keep anything from you.

701
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,063
Who is this woman?

702
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,862
Maureen was a girlfriend...

703
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:57,398
...at USC.

704
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,037
Her father is Chester Wilmore.

705
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,369
The publisher?
Yeah.

706
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:06,539
Maureen, she liked to play...

707
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,210
...rough.

708
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,651
Pleasure-pain kind of thing.

709
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,652
It was....

710
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:17,989
Just tell me, David.

711
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:23,398
One night, we were drinking,
and she asked me to tie her up.

712
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,759
I did.

713
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,394
Pour hot wax on her stomach.

714
00:39:27,637 --> 00:39:28,797
I did.

715
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,741
She wanted me to choke her
to heighten the....

716
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,074
I couldn't.

717
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:39,006
It was too much.

718
00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:43,813
Next day, I broke up with her,
and she got pissed off...

719
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,349
...obsessed.

720
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:49,353
One night, she tracked me down.
We got in this huge fight.

721
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,153
She grabbed my roommate's pocketknife.

722
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:58,857
-I didn't get this scar from rock climbing.
-Jesus.

723
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,403
And when that didn't get my attention,
she filed charges on me.

724
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:07,065
Got Daddy's lawyers involved.

725
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:10,069
What kind of charges?

726
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,279
Sexual battery, attempted rape.

727
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:20,116
-lt was a long time ago.
-My God, David.

728
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:23,451
If Verela prints this story...

729
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:26,222
...who knows what the public will believe?

730
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:28,363
You want to fight it.

731
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,224
Babe, you just say the word...

732
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:34,195
...and I will step away from all of this.

733
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:39,337
Let the bitch come after you.

734
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,044
Are you okay?

735
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,320
Perfect.

736
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,760
Sorry.

737
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:09,170
-I tried.
-I know.

738
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:11,237
Come here.

739
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:23,218
Is he okay?

740
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:26,344
Yeah, he's good.

741
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,651
Good.

742
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:36,988
Look....

743
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:40,970
-I just wanted to be sure.
-You need help.

744
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:43,369
I can't...

745
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:45,538
...be helped.

746
00:41:51,147 --> 00:41:52,444
He can.

747
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:58,483
He's a good boy, Vic.

748
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:03,654
-Someone will love him.
-He's your boy.

749
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:05,856
A happy white baby.

750
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:12,794
Couples will be fighting over him, right?

751
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:14,999
He needs his mother.

752
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,549
That's just not me.

753
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:04,920
There you go.

754
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:13,156
No!

755
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:16,627
Come on.
No!

756
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:19,167
She's your partner, man.
Come on!

757
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:23,596
No!
Shut up.

758
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,407
Shut up.

759
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:31,773
No!

760
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:35,513
Julien! That's enough!
You're not supposed to kill him!

761
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,247
Get off!
He's had enough!

762
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,652
All right.

763
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,948
Dutchster, great job!
