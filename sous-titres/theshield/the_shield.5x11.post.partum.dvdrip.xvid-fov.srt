<i>That I saw your guy</i>

- What?

33
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,485
<i>You're not going to prison. We made a deal</i>

Antwon's blaming me.

36

- Lem, this is about keeping you alive!

<i>I promise you that.</i>
<i>I promise you we're gonna make this work.</i>

40
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,214
He screwed my ex-wife

41
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,945

seem like a personal vendetta.

42
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,953

48
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,363
I hated that I wasn't able

He's already half an hour late.

61
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,886
He'll be here.
How are you this morning?

62
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,513

64
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,123
If I was going to jail for 18 months,
I wouldn't be in a rush either.

65
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,256
Give him some time.

66
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,035
I've made you coffee,

<i>You need to go.</i>

68
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,048
Okay, stop. Stop. Stop!

<i>- Don't touch me.</i>
- Right. You're right.

<i>- That's good. That's good.</i>
- Why are you still here?

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,721
[Sighs]
Because there's nowhere else.

72
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,392
Don't you see how lonely
he's made both of us?

73
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,959
I'm not lonely. I'm moving on with my life.
You need to do the same.

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,638
Not until there's justice.

75
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,506
- You need to let this go. You need to let it go.
- No, I don't.

76
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,944
<i>Because nobody ever</i>
<i>fights back against him.</i>

77
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,244
Nobody ever takes his punch
and just smacks him one right back.

78
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,751
You need to leave.

79
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,219
If I take this fight to him...

80
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,591

81
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,355
I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

82
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,023
'Cause I don't want you

83
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,260

84
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,930

Yeah. He said
he wanted to ask me...

93
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,030
a few questions
to wrap up his case, but-

94
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,696
- Did he try to touch you?
- Why would you ask that?

95
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,001
[Exhales]
Wh-What did he say?

96
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,009
He was desperate and kind of lonely,
and I felt bad for him.

97
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,410
Then out of nowhere he said he's coming
after you, and he wanted to make sure...

98
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,415
- me and the kids would be okay if-
- If something happened to me.

99
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,578
This is about Lem.
He didn't show up at court to turn himself in.

100
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,179
- Where is he?
- Nobody knows. He's a fugitive.

101
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,852
Kavanaugh probably figures
I had something to do with it.

102
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,522
No, I didn't. He's just pissed
because his case against Lem tanked.

103
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,727
He's making it personal.
He wants to hurt me through you.

104
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:14,432
Please, don't let him
in this house again. All right?

105
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,409
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- All right.

106
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,810
- Be careful.
- Always.

107
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,754
- Where's Lemansky?
- I don't know.

108
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,820
You screwed him once, and now you've
done it again, putting him on the run.

This was a calculated move
by Lieutenant Kavanaugh...

481
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,384
of the vending machines
at the Farmington Police Station.

482
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,185
- Hey, it's Curtis.
- Hi.

483
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,728
- Look, I'm kinda in a hurry. What's goin' on?
- They're in a holding pattern.

484
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,956
They said they'd take
your offer under advisement...

485
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,000
but gave no indication
when or what the answer might be.

486
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,763
Jesus Christ.
Okay, look, uh...

487
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,304
I need you to get
a message to Vic.

488
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,237
- That would be breaking the law.
- Shit.

489
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,708
- All right. Forget it. Forget it.
- It's gonna be worse if they catch you.

490
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:37,441
Now that I've told them what you want,
they know there's more shit to uncover.

491
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,315
- Kavanaugh will show no mercy.
- I know.

492
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,755
There is one other
option though.

493
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,224
- What?
- Witness Protection.

494
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,454
And you tell them everything.

495
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,795
- Witness Protection.
- The entire truth.

496
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,199
Imagine. You'd be free
of the lies, the running.

497
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,239
People pay a price
for what they did.

498
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,911
I can't. I can't.

499
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,912
Curtis, you're the one
with the heart.

500
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,948
Now use your head!

501
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,075
This isn't about
my goddamn heart!

502
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,346
I'm just trying
to help you here, Curtis.

503
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,581
No, you're trying
to get me to turn...

504
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,658
on my family.

505
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,324
Please just get me my deal.

506
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,133
- He held on as long as he could.
- He's still holdin'.

507
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,267
- He didn't want to run in the first place.
- He'd run before he'd rat.

508
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,675
- How do they know about the money train?
<i>- Educated guess.</i>

509
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,544
There's always been plenty of suspicion,
just never any proof.

510
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,640
- Unless Lem gave it to them.
<i>- [Mackey] We know Lem.</i>

511
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,311
If he had a change of heart,
he would have tipped us.

512
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,218
Or he wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

513
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,884
I'm not saying that it happened. I'm just saying
are we willing to bet our freedom-

514
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,225
I'm not gonna believe it
till I see it with my own eyes.

515
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,265
Lem's not contacting us to protect us.
We're gonna meet him tonight at midnight...

516
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,835
and he's gonna travel tonight-
that's it.

517
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,870
Okay.

518
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,872
On whose nickel, man? This spic cop
doesn't take American Express.

519
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,874
- I know.
- It's already taken care of.

520
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,876
I told Mara that Lem
was in trouble.

521
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,879
She felt strongly
that we needed to help him.

522
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:21,042
<i>So we pulled a little cash out of the house.</i>
<i>It's not a lot, but-</i>

523
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,747
Five grand oughta keep him
in burritos and beer long enough, man.

524
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,423
All right.
Go get this cashed.

525
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,496
Keep half of it for tonight.
Put the rest on the wire.

526
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,302
Lem must have said something
to Becca about Terry too.

527
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,176
All that gives Kavanaugh
is a little more suspicion.

528
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,839
Doesn't mean we're gonna catch a case,
let alone a needle.

529
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,849
Lem starts talkin'...

530
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,284
he puts teeth in an otherwise
empty rumor.

531
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,685
<i>These people,</i>
<i>every time they look at us...</i>

532
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,849
they're gonna see
two cop killers.

533
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,859
<i>That's on me.</i>

534
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,930
- Terry was a decision that we both made.
<i>- I forced it on you.</i>

535
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,193
Now you're in Kavanaugh's crosshairs.
That's on me.

536
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,167
Lem's gonna have to hide under a rock
for the rest of his life.

537
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,205
- That's on me too. I know that.
<i>- And skewering yourself is helping Lem how?</i>

538
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,240
How's it gonna help
any of us?

539
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,903
You made a call, and that call
was to protect the team.

540
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,980
That couldn't have gone down
any other way.

541
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,573
And it's done. It's done.

542
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,710
Now, is he still on our side
against Kavanaugh?

543
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,948
I'm gonna find out.

544
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,558
<i>[Mackey]</i>
<i>Yol</i>

545
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,026
What the hell was that
powwow upstairs about?

546
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,063
- Call me later.
<i>- I'm runnin'out oflater.</i>

547
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:44,464
Now. Are you and me still allies
against Kavanaugh?

548
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,970
Or do I pull out my flamethrower
and start that scorched-earth plan...

549
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,267
that I talked to you about?

550
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,741
Becca's being a good lawyer.

551
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,972
Lem wants to turn himself in
if he can get his original deal back.

552
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,642
Kavanaugh won't sign off on it.
He's gonna file new charges for him running.

553
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,585
- I thought Kavanaugh was outta the picture.
- He was until Lem didn't show.

554
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:07,124
And now the chief's believing
that Kavanaugh was right.

555
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,159
He's giving him back
all his power.

556
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,423
- What about Lem? Gonna
let him twist in the wind?
<i>- Claudette's gonna call the D.A.</i>

557
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,432
But she's waiting as long as she can
to give Kavanaugh a chance to find Lem.

558
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,697
- That's all I know.
- You gotta throw a wrench in the works.

559
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,466
You wanted an inside guy for intel.
You got one.

560
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:26,873
You need help aiding
and abetting a fugitive, find someone else.

561
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,485
<i>- [Billings] What happened to your face?</i>
- Nothing. What happened to yours?

562
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,889
<i>Where were you</i>
<i>at 8:00 a.m. This morning?</i>

563
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,486
<i>- Driving. Working.</i>
- On what, your right cross?

564
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,065
<i>Witness says</i>
<i>you attacked Tori Burke.</i>

565
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,501
Also says you two had an argument first.
What was that about?

566
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,539
You just think you can go around
beating women on the street?

567
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,337
<i>How do you know her?</i>
<i>She take your cab?</i>

568
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,344
You stalking her or something?

569
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,879
Okay, your thing is just knocking the shit
out of random total strangers.

570
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,217
- Works for me, Gilbos.
- So l- So I picked up a hooker.

571
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,382
<i>I'm not the only guy</i>
<i>who's had to bust out of a slump.</i>

572
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,393
Doesn't mean I deserve
to get rolled and robbed.

573
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,725
- Say again.
- She set me up.

574
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,163
<i>Soon as I got my clothes off</i>
<i>and my dick hard...</i>

575
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,497
these two black guys ran in,
started smashing me up.

576
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,436
Took everything.

577
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,440
The woman you attacked
is a volunteer tutor for at-risk kids.

578
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,511
She was on her way to a session
when you jumped her.

579
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,046
That whore flagged my cab, okay?

580
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,174
Offered me anything
in the book for a C-note.

581
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,515
<i>Picked the motel,</i>
<i>then had her buddies steal my wallet...</i>

582
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,385
and a chain
my mother gave me.

583
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,516
<i>So I gave her a little payback.</i>

584
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,789
<i>Arrest her ass-not minel</i>

585
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,934
<i>So, did you find him?</i>

586
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,698
We did.

587
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,764
Good. So I guess that means
that I can go now...

588
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,868
and, uh, you'll just let me know
if you need me in court or anything?

589
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,879
<i>We talked to people</i>
<i>at the community center.</i>

590
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,781
- You volunteer there
at least three days a week?
- I read to disadvantaged kids.

591
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,820
Are you a prostitute, Tori?

592
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,821
[Laughs]

593
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,756
Maybe in your fantasy
I'm a prostitute-

594
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,161
<i>You know what? Um...</i>

595
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,131
if I'm gonna be insulted on top of assaulted,
I think I'd like to leave.

596
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,929
Okay. Uh, we need
to ask you a few more questions.

597
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:36,268
You're a suspect in
a separate assault and robbery.

598
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,910
I'd like to see
my legal counsel.

599
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,849
<i>[Mackey] All right.</i>
<i>They're moving the blow into the van.</i>

600
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,682

<i>- They'll lead us to him.</i>

603
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,421
What, the Mexican chicks
in the El Camino?

604
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,261
They don't look like Kavanaugh's boys.
I think we're all right.

605
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,631
<i>[Ronnie]</i>
Gracias. <i>Hey.</i>

606
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,001

Meet and greet in T.J.'s confirmed.

607
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,632
<i>Now we just need to get</i>
<i>Lem on board.</i>

608
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,870

00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,477
Hey. Come on.
Pairing me up with Billings?

612
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,490
You know a guy like this
is gonna throw me off my game.

613
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,358
- You'll adjust.
- L- l- I'm filing for a transfer.

614
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,692
- Dutch.
- No, I'm serious.

615
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,131
Things haven't been the same between us,
even before you got captain.

616
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,137
There is no reason
why we can't work this out in a new way.

617
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,139
Yes, there is.

618
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,041
<i>The only reason I was hanging around here</i>
<i>was because we were partners.</i>

619
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,409
That's gone.
I'd just like to move on.

620
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,312
Okay. I'll prepare
the paperwork.

621
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:56,512
Okay. Check this out.
Tori has an M.B.A. From UCLA.

622
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,421
Worked as an account manager at a brokerage
firm until she was fired six months ago.

623
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,550
- What for?
- Well, her work started to get sloppy...

624
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,594
and she stopped showing up
half the time.

625
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,186
- But no arrests.
- Yeah, if she's a hooker, she had me fooled.

626
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,598
- I can usually smell 'em.
- Excuse me, Captain.
This guy is here for Tori Burke.

627

I'm her legal counsel.

What are your credentials,
"Mr. Wallis, Esquire"?

629
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:23,073
What I have is a client,
and I need to see her immediately.

630
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,776
Now, do I get to see her now?
Or do I file for a dismissal?

631
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,250
- She's in 2. Show him up.
- Yes, ma'am.

632
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,260
I'll check him out.

633
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,996

00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,546
<i>And it's connected</i>
<i>to the one between her legs.</i>

816
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,208
I just figure out
how to fill it...

817
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,445
and then I feed it to her.

818
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:40,182
And I keep feedin' it
to her till it's overflowing...

819
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,315
until she can't live without it.

820
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:46,920
And then I take it away.
That makes me God.

<i>I had nothing to do with no illegal shit.</i>

831
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,056

no charge- my black ass

833
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,184
Anyone here believe
Lem cut a deal?

834
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,687
Maybe he felt like
he had no choice.

835
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,690
<i>[Mackey] He's out there in the wind alone.</i>
<i>Becca's probably pushing it.</i>

836
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,625

<i>this ranch in San Ignacio...</i>

837
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,821
or the money we're gonna
be funneling to him.

838
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,832
- Becca told you he took a deal.
- No. Aceveda.

839
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,596
<i>- Aceveda?</i>
- He's got a stake in this too.

840
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,728
- Not like we do.
- He could be full of shit.

841
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,968
Look, the truth is we can't know what's inside
Lem's head until we see him face-to-face.

842
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,601
We need an exit strategy.
How are we gonna get outta this?

843
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,112
We don't need an exit strategy.
We need to fill Lem in.

844
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,978
<i>On the cash, the ranch,</i>
<i>lines of communication.</i>

845
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,542
He's right. You know, Lem- he's been
in the dark as much as we've been.

846
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,158
And if Lem is talking,
it's because he believes...

847
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,959
that Antwon has marked him
as a dead man behind bars.

848
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,125
<i>Now, once he knows</i>
<i>what we've pulled together for him...</i>

849
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,202
he'll go along.

850
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,164
<i>He will.</i>

851
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,244
We go to the spot.

852
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,314
If he doesn't show...

853
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,847
- assume he made the deal.
<i>- And then what?</i>

854
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:52,353
[Shane]
If he does show...

855
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,515
then we'll take
his temperature...

856
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,956
make sure he's still
solidly on board.

857
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,426
He'll be on board.

858
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,520
Lem trusts us.

859
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:06,029
He trusts us.
And I still trust Lem.

860
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,730

Well, she's still learning her fieldwork.
But her instincts are good.

897

to take her under his wing.

Someone was ripping off
the Gourmet Quick-Mealer.

00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,925
I figured it was an inside job,
so I put a nanny cam in the locker room.
