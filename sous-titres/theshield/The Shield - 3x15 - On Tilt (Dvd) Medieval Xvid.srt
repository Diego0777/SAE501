1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,903
Bring your behind out here! I see you, fool!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,032
Why you hidin'? Why you hidin'?
I see you hidin'in there, punkass!

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,042
- Drop the hose
- Get your ass out here

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,840
- I called. Can you
get this under control, please?
- Drop the hose.

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,507
- What happened?
- He's always startin'trouble.

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,174
- Who?
- Mr Super Soaker in there

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,844
- He sprayed us first.
- You wanna step outside, please?

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,582
Sir, did you spray these women?

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,624
Wait till Juicy get ahold
of your ass.

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,285
I was watering down my sidewalk.
If some crack whores...

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,329
happen to get wet,
that's just life

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,990
We got the right to walk public streets.

13
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,431
You don't have the right
to work them

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,766
- Look,you can't spray people like that.
- I was just hosing down the hos.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,363
Well, it's a public sidewalk
That's a crime

16
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,910
What about them sellin' ass
in the front of my store all day long?

17
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,673
Or what about them dope dealers
selling crack rock-- is that a crime?

18
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,341
You need to worry about
yourself,comic boy.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,544
- You don't wanna be making threats.
Come with me.
- Wait tillJuicy gets your ass

20
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:58,022
- He'll wrap that hose around your neck
till your eyes pop
- This hose right here?

21
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,058
- Yo, right here
- Drop--

22
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,828
A hundred and ninety-five
thousand All that's left

23
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,995
- That's split three ways, right?
- Yeah Yeah

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:16,132
- Sixty-five grand apiece
- Turns out Lem's cut was 2.8 million in ashes.

25
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,573
So we got the goddamn Armenians after us,
Treasury, for, uh--

26
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,776
for 65 grand

27
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,894

28
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,932
Look, we can't show up
every time you see a hooker take a stroll

29
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,731
- Plus, there's no one out here
- These whores see you drivin' up
and they get ghost

30
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,033
Soon as you leave,
they're right back out here

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,199
Antagonizing them is gonna
make things worse for you.

32
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,209
Well, I'm tryin'
to make things better, man.

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,304
- Your primary concern needs to be
your own safety
- I can take care of myself

34
00:01:55,415 --> 00:02:00,148
And I'm not leaving.
I'm not goin'anywhere.

35
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:04,485
Everything else'll be exactly the same:;
the same school, same friends.

36
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,321
You'll just
be living with me

37
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,363
And weekends with me--
just a reverse of the way it is now

38
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,764
- How do I get to school?
- I'll bring you when I can, and I'll get some help.

39
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,769
Just like Camilla
helps Mom

40
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,101
What about Matt and Megan?

41
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,869
Megan will live with Mom.

42
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,243
but that just means
I'll have you all to myself

43
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,754
Cassidy, do you want to
talk about this some more?

44
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,291
Why are you mad at me?

45
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,061
I'm not mad at you, baby

46
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,501
Cassidy, your mom and I just love you
and want to spend time with you, that's all

47
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,868
It-- It's just my turn
for a little while

48
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,873
Okay?

49
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,476
That hobbit we found hiding in an oil drum
finally spit out the truth.

50
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,075
- The Armenian heroin bust?
-Just one small slice of a much larger pie

51
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,087
that Margos has smuggled
into Tinseltown

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,718
- How much larger?
- Frodo says 1 0 to 1 5 times
the size of yesterday's haul.

53
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:18,126
- Holy shit
- Margos has it stashed in a residence.

54
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,031
Once a week, they pick up enough
to feed their suppliers

55
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,831
- Tomorrow's delivery day
- Great

56
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,432
Uh, you showed up
on Shane's door last night

57
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,377
wanted to see
some storage locker of his?

58
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,881
The Armenian money train cash is still
unaccounted for, so's the prime suspect, O'Brien

59
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,856
It was suggested that I look into
your team's involvement

60
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,157
- Dutch?
- After this Armenian thing
gets cleared up, I need you...

61
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,163
running the AGC
car surveillance sting

62
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,200
but not if you're gonna be under suspicion
for something like this

63
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,792
And Wagenbach's
still pushing you?

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,464
I haven't been able to convince him
that it's a dead end

65
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,945
- What are you doing?
- You got Aceveda lookin' into me?
Kitchen's closed

66
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,415
You whisperin'
into my boss's ear?

67
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,576
You don't have the sac
to face me head-on?

68
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,520
You knew the name of the bar where O'Brien
says he found the marked money

69
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,422
- I already explained that
- A little too smoothly, in my opinion

70
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,426
How you comin' along
finding O'Brien?

71
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,225
Not too far
I been bustin' half the Armenian mob all week

72
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,393
Why is it Shane Vendrell
had an empty storage locker
under the name ''Cletus Van Damme''--

73
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,030
the same name he gave to an Armenian
who witnessed the money train robbery?

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,836
If that's all you got,
I wouldn't be lookin' so smug

75
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,674
- Absence of proof isn't proof of absence
- You're back on my shit list

76
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,647
- Excuse me?
- Number one with a bullet, Dutch-boy

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,846
You look into me all you want.
You're back to being a joke in this building.

78
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,548

79
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,787
- Let's go!
- Hands on your head!
Put that phone down! Drop that phone!

80
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,193
- Hands on your head.
- Get on the couch! Sit down right now!

81
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,392
- Get your ass on the couch!

82
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,628
- We're clear?
- We're clear!

83
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,569

84
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:11,372
All right
Where are you hidin' the hell dust? Where?

85
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,079
Last chance before
we start renovating

86
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,048
Claudette Wyms,
ADA Rommi Cohen

87
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,485
We've met before

88
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,489
I brought Rommi down here
to discuss the Lisa Kensit situation

89
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,788
- I know you had some worries
- Good work on picking up her shooter.

90
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,795
Thanks

91
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:35,061
I'm just pulling things together
I was gonna contact your office in a few days

92
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,331
You have some suspicions of
possible drug use by the victim?

93
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,032
More than that
I've got her dealer and her hook-up

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,042
Marlon Gault. Says, off the record,
he supplied her for over three years.

95
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,341
He'll go on record if your office can provide him
with some consideration

96
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,940
He shot her in the face He's a dealer
Why would we shave years off?

97
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:57,079
Well, because if it's true, some ofher clients
may not have received adequate counsel.

98
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,387
No, she's a junior P.D.
All ofher cases are signed off on.

99
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,461
Trust me
They got adequate counsel

100
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,898
You can be sure there wasn't even one mistake
in almost 300 cases?

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,901
You wanted it brought to the DA
She'll look into it

102
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,699
Now you can get back
to the rest of your caseload

103
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,915
She means well
She just doesn't see the big picture

104
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,576
Well,you seem
to have her under control.

105
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,213
Phil's having Gault's statements
about dealing to Kensit suppressed at his trial

106
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,621
We're not going
to let it get far

107
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,216
As long as you pull the files
and everything's aboveboard

108
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,796
Well, most of the arrests originated here.
Maybe we could...

109
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,730
get together for dinner later this week
and discuss a game plan

110
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,733
Or drinks?

111
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,895
My wife and I
have a rule about me

112
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,701
having dinners alone
with female colleagues

113
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,608
Oh. I'm sorry. I--
I didn't see a ring.

114
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,614
Oh, I, um, must've forgotten to put it on
after the gym this morning

115
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,686
Just an accident

116
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,053
I'll let Phil know how, uh, helpful you were
Thank you

117
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,353
And thank you

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,994

119
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,644
- Nothin'

120
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,340
Shane, anything?

121
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,010
- Nada
- Goddamn it.

122
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,087
Keep lookin'

123
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:42,061

124
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,533
Enjoying the show?

125
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,195
Margos moved the heroin yesterday
when you captured Kail

126
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,498
- Where is he?
- Right now, no clue

127
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,976
- He's gonna find me after I have your answer
- Answer to what?

128
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,479
You've done
a lot of damage to us.

129
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,676
He wonders if maybe there's a way
to stop this war?

130
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,948
- What does he want?
- Move the heroin up north

131
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,955
He wants you
to provide security

132
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,352
And what do I get?

133
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,659
Five percent commission on the sale.
That'd be about a half a mil.

134
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:25,328
Plus, Margos leaves LA
and guarantees the safety of you and your men

135
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,804
Otherwise--

136
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,467
They want us to escort the heroin
from this address

137
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,477
- in two hours
- Well, how do we know this offer's even legit?

138
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,675
- We don't.
- It would get us back to even, but, uh--

139
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,719
Workin' with these psycho assholes
is off the table

140
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,621
- Yeah.
- Question is-- What's their angle?

141
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,957
- You think it's a trap?
- Only the three of us, no backup--

142
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,121
- Which leads us to the next problem.
- What?

143
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,328
If we bring in extra bodies, and Margos is there,
some other cop can take him alive.

144
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,963
And all he's gotta do is get a message
to his lawyer.

145
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,838
We take a bullet
while he's eatin' three hot ones in county

146
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,745
No We've gotta take him down
in a way that clears departmental review

147
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,044

148
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,324
- Listen, Lem--
- Yeah, I got some time coming,
about eight weeks.

149
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm gonna take it
When I get back, I'll put in for a transfer

150
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,301

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,310
Okay.

152
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,852
Margos is still after us

153
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,514
We're safer together
until we've got him

154
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,026
Maybe you should hang with us
until we get it sorted out

155
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,767
Yeah

156
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,436
Ripped by:

157
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,807
Hound

158
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,881

159
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,081
All right, there it is

160
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,750
Quiet street Only one way in

161
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,089
I don't like that

162
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,097

163
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,099
We could go in hard

164
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,169
Without knowin'
who or what's inside?

165
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,069
We don't show, Margos
almost has to come after us.

166
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,370
We may not know what's inside,
but they don't know when we're comin'

167
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,377
Unless they have a spotter

168
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,937
Margos was watching
our drug bust from on high

169
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,075
Now, see, there--

170
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,314
maybe top floor,
one of the three or four with a view.

171
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,428
- Hey!

172
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,499
- Don't move!

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,094
Nice lookout. 
Is it a trap?

174
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,765
- Is Margos inside? Get up!

175
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,170
Tryin' to get us killed,
you little prick? Huh?

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,305
All right

177
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,044

178
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,349
Write Write!

179
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:34,825
L-I-F-E

180
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,657
New word New word

181
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:43,568
S-U-X

182
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,766
Ronnie, open that window.

183
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,072

184
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,280
Looks like you're gonna die
a bad speller

185
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:01,217
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Inside, waiting for you, to kill

186
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,520
- No, no, no
- Is Margos inside?

187
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,593
No

188
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,322
- Is he inside?
- No!

189
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,991
- Who sent you here?
- Goma Goma Magar

190
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,161
- Who's he?
- American

191
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,000
Scruffy guy, about six foot?

192
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,201
Yeah I met him
this morning

193
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,279
- Here Eat this

194
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,684
No Margos, no heroin?

195
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,224
- Nah,just guns Call for SWAT
Have 'em flush 'em out
- Yeah

196
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:44,590
Lisa and I were close, but after a while
it was just better for her to move out

197
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:49,327
Her shooter suggested he'd been providing her
with drugs for years

198
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,802
- What difference does that make now?
- She handled a lot of cases...

199
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,873
a lot of people
who went to jail

200
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,874
Who deserved to go.

201
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,877
Isn't this something the D.A.
should be looking into?

202
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,881
I'll need more evidence before they'll touch it.
I need your help.

203
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,185
She might die
I'm not ruining her reputation

204
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,052
and if she lives,
I'm not ruining her career

205
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:17,118
She made some bad choices,
but she's still my friend.

206
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,924
- Can't you talk to him?
- We have.

207
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,363
I mean, the guy comes off
like a regular citizen, but

208
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,833
he's probably flyin' around
that store with a cape on

209
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,404
- He's just standing up for himself
- Oh, come on,Julien.

210
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,201
He's not just pissing off hookers and pimps
It's drug dealers too

211
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,937
- The guy's gonna get killed
- If other people on that street
stood up like him...

212
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,172
the drugs and the girls
would already be gone

213
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,273
Sure, and I can just put on my genie outfit
and blink 'em away.

214
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,751
Keep talkin' to the residents
and find out how bad this problem is

215
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,015
- What's goin'on?
- I rescued these on a bust.

216
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,526
I'm just tryin' to give 'em away
before the pound drops the gas on 'em

217
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,120
- You want one?

218
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,065
Oh, look at that face
How could you say no?

219
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,932
He's just thinkin'of all the times
pussy told him no.

220
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,734

221
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,832
Pussy said yes plenty

222
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,310

223
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,313
Uh, no thanks

224
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,012
- How's it goin'?
- D.A. won't deal.

225
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,422
If Lisa Kensit was handling cases
high on Oxy for three years

226
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,496
they don't want to know about it,
Aceveda either

227
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,624
- That's a lot of plea bargains
and convictions at stake
- I spoke to her old roommate

228
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,702
She won't corroborate
the drug use

229
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,398
Look, you've done more
than the job calls for

230
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,805
Wh-Why keep pushing this
and pissing everybody off?

231
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,743
I could ride this one solo,
and if

232
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:46,340
Aceveda and the chief come down on me,
it's one more time

233
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,580
You don't have to put
your job on the line too

234
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,152
Okay

235
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,130

236
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,065
Listen, uh, Lem's dad's not doin' too great
He's gonna need to take some time

237
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,830
- I'm sorry to hear that
- Well, depending on what happens

238
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,304
he might not be back at all

239
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,707
With Tavon gone, now Lem too, I'm not
gonna be able to do it all with just three guys.

240
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,609
I'm gonna need
to bring on a man or two.

241
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,051
When I reduced your team
to buy-busts

242
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,246
it was because the chief was evaluating
special units throughout the city

243
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,323
to see what would happen

244
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,324
- And?
- Crime went up

245
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,624
but not enough tojustify the lawsuits
and bad press over the last few years.

246
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,699
The police commission has advised
phasing them out

247
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,767
- They're dumping Special Teams?
- Chief won't admit failure by disbanding them

248
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,500
but he's not going
to re-man them either

249
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,974
So, wejust wither and die.

250
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,774
If Lem leaves,
the Strike Team won't be functional

251
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:54,615
You can still cover the AGC sting, but--
but no gang or drug detail

252
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,188
- Are you kidding me?
- So now Lem's boned us twice.

253
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,952
Money train was my idea
Everything that came after started with me

254
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,690
I'll set it straight, but we might have to try
to talk Lem into staying

255
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,495
I'd rather break up domestics in Van Nuys
than worry if Lem's got my back

256
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,899
You don't really
believe that

257
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,667
Got an address
on that Goma guy

258
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,176
Come on. Come on. Come on.

259
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,547
Got it Here

260
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,646

261
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,625
- Oh, great Fido's home

262
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,753
- I got an idea
- Hey, hey!

263
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,593
- You don't need to shoot him
- I don't need to, but I'd like to

264
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,658
- What's your idea?
- Ronnie, go around back, bang on the door,
draw his attention

265
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,534
Go, go, go

266
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,569
- Come here, puppy! Come here

267
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,442
Come on.
Come here, puppy. Whoo!

268
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,015
Sorry to step
on your happy

269
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,882
Right there!

270
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,081
Hey! Hey! Come on!

271
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,019
- Oh, shit! Get out! Get out!

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,725
- Damn it

273
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,973

274
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,909
- He saved you a bullet
- Cost him a pair of tighty whities

275
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,042
- Looks like you found something
- Ah, like most cases, they're all judgment calls

276
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,347
Well, if she was high,
her judgment was off

277
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,185
These on top are the sketchiest:
iffy eyewitnesses, no evidence, no follow-up I--

278
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,057
- I'd start here
- Thanks

279
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,022
Was that the public defender
Ben Horton?

280
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,000
- Yes
- What was he doing here?

281
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,867
Dropping off
Lisa Kensit's files

282
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:58,739
Goddamn it, I told you to leave this alone
Are you in on this too?

283
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,938
- No
- No These are public records

284
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:07,542
- Why would you commit career suicide like this?
- Myjob comes before my career.

285
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,722
You know, she's just trying to make sure
nobody innocent's sitting in jail

286
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,765
We're all trying to uphold the law, Dutch
It'd be nice if she remembered that sometime

287
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,826
Speaking of which, um, whatever happened
with you lookin' into Vic?

288
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,429
I didn't find anything

289
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,508
Did you try?

290
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,635
Actually, I did

291
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:35,247
- I got nothing promising.

292
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,613
- I got nothing promising.

293
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,184
- I have a bunch of receipts here.
- For what?

294
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,276
- Uh, dry cleaning
- What else?

295
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,151
Well, they're for thousands of dollars, though
These are oriental rugs

296
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,385
You don't dry-clean
oriental rugs

297
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:55,098
My-- My mom had some
She made me hand clean 'em when I was a kid

298
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,862
They used rugs for a front for their drug running.

299
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,030
Ayla cooked the books for 'em

300
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,341

301
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,238

302
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,318
Can you talk?

303
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,021
Listen, I, um--

304
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,521
I talked to the guys
at INS

305
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,528
They're doctoring your paperwork
to make it look like you were deported.

306
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,827
This way the bad guys back home
won't know that you helped us.

307
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,163
When do I go back to Armenia?

308
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,338
As soon as we get Margos

309
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,274

310
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,674
You recognize these receipts?

311
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,516
I do, um, invoices for these

312
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,611
But the work
was never done, right?

313
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,589
No dry cleaning. No.

314
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,389
There's no, uh, store name or address
You know where this place is?

315
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,956
I, uh, delivered papers once.

316
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,092
I know where it is

317
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,841
Goma, right? It's your unlucky day, asshole.

318
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,007
Come here!

319
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,251
- You remember me?

320
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,312
- You tried to kill me today

321
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,655
- You here to do your dry cleaning
or to see Margos?
- No

322
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,660
- Where is he?

323
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,322
- I don't know 
- Think again

324
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,959
I'm just here
to check on the heroin.

325
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,403
- The drugs are here? All of it?
- Uh-huh.

326
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,737
- How many men are usually inside?
- About a dozen

327
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,676
- Cuff him and keep him outta sight

328
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,180
Call Aceveda and tell him I need a warrant
and every available cop

329
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,183

330
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,153
- What?

331
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:03,923
If Margos is here, one of us has to separate him,
make sure he goes for a gun

332
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,430
- Do you understand?
- Christ 

333
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:12,231
He wants us dead He can do it
from his prison cell He can't do it from his grave

334
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,272
- If this is too much for you,
why don't you just go home?

335
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:21,210
- Christ. What is that, blood?
- My ulcer.
What I've been doing every night the last month.

336
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,747
- If you don't have the stomach for this,
maybe you--
- No No!

337
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,619
I'm with you

338
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,993
- Find anything?

339
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,895
Mmm. Tons of guys got crappy deals,
but they all look guilty.

340
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,524
Well, maybejustice can be blind
and stoned.

341
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,067
This guys doing five to 1 0

No evidence
Sole witness is over a block away

343
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,446
- Vic Mackey is the arresting officer
- I'm sure it's by the book then.

344
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,815
I'm gonna take the drive out
to Victorville

345
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,855
and see what this guy Walter Clifton
has to say for himself

346
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,585
- He's gonna say he's innocent
- Well, we'll see if I believe him

347
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:15,194
- Go, go, go!
- Everybody down!
Get down on the ground!

348
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,133

354
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,371
Vic!

355
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,614
- Nice haul

356
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,279

357
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,264
All right, bring 'em out.

358
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:27,337
Must have been 1 0, 1 2 million worth of''H''
in there, man Thanks for your help

359
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,842
- I didn't help you
- Come on We couldn't have done it without you

360
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,208
- What are you doing?
- Showin' you the love

361
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,508
Crack, get off the block!

362
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,481
Crack, get off the block!

363
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,484
- Dial 911!
- Hey!

364
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,020
Get off the block!
Crack!

365
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,522
I told you to put the camera down,
you asshole

366
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,287
- Come here so I can see your face
- Get away from him!

367
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,962
Get off of him! Get off him!

368
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,158
- Get up You all right?
- Yeah Never felt better

369
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,068
Uh-huh You got locked up
How you feel now, crack?

370
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,005
- Got you thrown in jail Who laughin' now?
- Shut up!

371
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,544
Lock him up!
I'm gonna clean this place up!

372
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,545
Get off the block!

373
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,877
What happened exactly?

374
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,177
Our comic book guy videotaped him dealing

375
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,118
- He started swinging.
- He's not backing down

376
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:20,385
All he wants to do is to get those people
offhis block. Instead of trying to stop him...

377
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,154
maybe we could make
his problem go away

378
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,661
All it will do is move the problem
down a block

379
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,860
Then, when someone on that block
calls with a problem, we'll move it again

380
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,971
I'll assign some unis
Organize a sweep

381
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,177

382
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,377
Where do you see yourself in the department
a year from now?

383
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,886
I don't know
Detective, maybe?

384
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,718
I liked doin' that undercover work
with the Strike Team

385
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,021
You can't apply for those positions
without P3 status

386
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,891
- Yes, sir I am aware of that
- That's why I'm bumping you back up

387
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,398
You're proactive You take charge
You've lived up to our deal

388
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,368
Run the sweep
when you're out there today

389
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,904
Five to 1 0 for armed robbery is pretty much
what you would have gotten if convicted.

390
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,878
- It's not much of a plea bargain
- She said~witnesses put me at the diner

391
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,974
I've already got two felonies
If I went down for this, it'd be my third strike

392
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,020
- Five's better than 20
- Sounds like you came out ahead

393
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,589
- For somethin' I didn't do?
- Why should I believe you?

394
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,590
I don't give a shit
if you believe me or not

395
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,559
I got a new lawyer
who's gonna look into my case

396
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,860
And find what? Two other armed robberies and
you runnin' around with the Farmtown 1 2 in here?

397
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:39,130
That was all about survival
I didn't wear no colors on the street

398
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,535
- Time's up.

399
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,302
- I just started
- Warden says it's over

400
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,472
Look, I don't know
who this witness was...

401
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,040
- but he didn't see me 'cause I was never there

402
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,028
- What the hell is this?
- Looks like I've pissed off the right people

403
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,594
You think this is funny?
Where's your stuff?.

404
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,643
- Lisa Kensit's clients
- Oh, yeah

405
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,244
- What's going on?
- Some cowardly shitheads messed with her desk

406
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,260
- I'll look into it
- Yeah, right!

407
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,387
- Excuse me?
- Don't tell me you're not a part of this

408
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,658
I just got carried out of Victorville

409
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,596
I spoke to Ben Horton's boss
and the chief

410
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,172
He wasn't too pleased to hear
what you'd been doing.

411
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:53,677
You mean to tell me this entire house would
rather me pack up and leave than look into this?

412
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,078
Chief and I did discuss this house
and who's gonna run it when I leave

413
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,617
He's decided
to go another way.

414
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,449
- Bring in somebody else
- Now she's not getting the captaincy?

415
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,286
- You gotta be shittin'me.
- It wasn't my choice. It was hers.

416
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,562
She understands

417
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,135
Okay You've had your show
Now go to hell!

418
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,641
- Yeah, I'm talkin'to you, Stone.

419
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:31,106

420
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,184

421
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,847

422
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,391
Yo, it's my booty,y'all. I'm out!

423
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,232
- What's your name?
- What do you want to arrest me for?

424
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,802
All right. Get her. Bring her in. Come on.

425
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,770
- Yeah See?
- 1-Tango-1 3. We're at Sunset and Laveta.

426
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,777
- We got the area blocked off
- That's what I'm talkin'about. Yeah.

427
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:06,215
What am I always tellin'you, Benjamin?
You can live with it, or you can change it.

428
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,775
Thank you, Miss Officer
I really appreciate it

429
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,187
Operation is Code 4
All right, bring 'em in Come on!

430
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,998
- What, not hungry?

431
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,593
Anything else I can get for you? Huh?

432
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,400
Next show I put on for your pals
is handin' you CI cash

433
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,703
and lettin' them loose on the phones

434
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,074
''Collect call for Mr Margos''

435
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:40,050
Okay I don't know where he is now,
but there's a guy who helps him with his travel

436
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,554
He's a Greek guy Mihalis
Runs a small limo service

437
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,955
and, um, gets him tickets, fake passports,
places to stay

438
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,493
- Thanks, pal
- Hey

439
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,964
Remember Walter Clifton,
armed robbery on Creston, the diner?

440
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,227
- A couple of years ago?
- Yeah.

441
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,964
- How is old Walter?
- He's rotting away
because Lisa Kensit cut him a shitty deal

442
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,972
I guess you get
what you pay for.

443
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,771
I'd like to look at your notes.
I wanna talk to everybody in that diner.

444
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,904
- The arrest report's a little lacking
- So's Dutch-boy's dick

445
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,847
- but I ain't helpin'lookin'for that either.

446
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,182
Oh, and, uh, for the record,
I didn't screw with your desk...

447
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,779
but that's just because
I didn't think of it first.

448
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:26,659
Where the hell
is Vic at?

449
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:29,094
He went to get
something to eat Greek

450
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:33,860
Didn't Vic eat
like an hour ago?

451
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:37,864
Oh, shit Shit

452
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:41,876
Hey, ''Gomer'' Wake up
Where's Vic at?

453
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:47,143

454
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:49,809
- I'll be with you in a minute

455
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,320
- You'll be with me now
- What do you want?

456
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:57,756
Your favorite frequent flyer,
Margos Dezirian

457
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,455
I don't know--
Oh! Oh, my God

458
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:05,864
- Margos!
- Oh, my God I don't know, man

459
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:09,665
- I'm just leaving messages to him
- Good I'll dictate

460
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:12,036
You dial

461
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:15,907
You tell him that Goma called
Sounded strange

462
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:18,674
He wanted a one-way ticket to--

463
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:21,750
- Where would someone go to hide from Margos?
- Hell?

464
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,153
Venezuela

465
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:27,916
Good. You tell him...

466
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:31,425
that Goma wanted the ticket
delivered to him at his house.

467
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:34,292
Try not to sound
too stuffy

468
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:38,492
- Asshole!

469
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:43,561
- Will you be careful?
- I saw him Besides, that's not even a crosswalk

470
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:49,636
From now on, they're gonna look for
every opportunity to get rid of you

471
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:52,077
- You'll have to be perfect
- Then I'll be perfect

472
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,649
Trust me. It's hard.

473
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:57,853

474
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:04,223
- Mr. Papi, do you know
what a time card scam is?
- When you get your buddies...

475
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,420
to punch you in at work while you play hooky.
You ever do that?

476
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,294
- I'd be fired
- We went to your print shop

477
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,563
Pulled your time card the day you say
you saw Walter Clifton in the school yard

478
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,537
Says you were workin'

479
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,579
- So which is it?

480
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,342
Marta!

481
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:37,154
I was in the school yard.
I saw the man running, not Papi.

482
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:43,765
- So why'd you say you saw him?
- These gangsters would hurt her
if she'd said something

483
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:46,596
Let them try
to mess with me

484
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,736
- I understand
- Detective Mackey know any of this?

485
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,401
No. He show me pictures.
I picked out the one...

486
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,978
closest to what Marta
said he looked like

487
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:03,351
- Hope you're pickin' up tips
on how to reattach body parts
- So, did Mihalis help you?

488
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:06,910
No, which means
our friendship is over

489
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:13,223
- Hey, hey, hey
- Munroe

490
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,524
got that CI cash ready?

491
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:17,622
Here's the first 300

492
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:21,829
We'll give you the rest when you give us more
information Make sure they get their phone calls

493
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:26,237
- I did not help this guy!
- Yeah. Wejust found that heroin by smell.

494
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:28,537
Margos will kill me, man

495
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:31,670
- Where am I supposed to go now?
- Anywhere but home

496
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:38,547

497
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:41,054
Looks like Vic was here

498
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:44,183
- Please help me, guys
- Yeah Sure thing, Nero

499
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:48,423
- Nero was Roman
- Yeah Sure thing, Zeus First-- hey--you help us

500
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,989
- The guy that was here What'd you tell him?

501
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,036

502
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,505
Goma!

503
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,078

504
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:09,479
Goma!

505
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:15,524

506
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:24,098
- Margos!

507
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,259
Drop it

508
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:28,529

509
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:35,242
Now turn around

510
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:45,447

511
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:49,183

512
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,020

513
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:27,893
Yeah
I've got an officer-involved shooting

514
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:32,593
- My detective is poking her nose in Kensit's files
- I thought you told her not to?

515
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:36,262
I did. I--

516
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:42,311
Walter Clifton, armed robbery
Sole eyewitness now admits he faked it

517
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,902
- Why?
- To protect his granddaughter

518
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:48,381
She saw the robber
Grandpa didn't want any reprisals against the girl

519
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:51,976
- Can she give us anything?
- Not now. Too much time's gone by.

520
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:54,578
Well, this is good.
It'll speed things up a bit.

521
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,624
So you'll look
into the Kensit files?

522
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:59,922
I told you we would.
I just wanted to be discreet about it.

523
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:03,430
Any more foot-dragging, and I'll call the press
You won't have a chance to be discreet

524
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:05,557
All right. You've made your point.
Spare us the sermon.

525
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:08,068
- What do think you've achieved here?
- We freed an innocent man

526
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,004
- How many guilty ones go free?
- As many as it takes to fix a wrong

527
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:13,802
Don't rub our noses
in your moral superiority

528
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:16,207
This isn't superiority
It's decency

529
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:20,009
And I have to give that up to play ball
with you and the chief

530
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:23,915
I'm glad you're keepin' your job

531
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:33,126

532
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:41,068

533
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,333

534
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,409
- Hey!

535
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:49,636
- Everything okay?
- What happened, man?

536
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:54,682
- Margos He had a gun

537
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:59,846
- Hey, they just saw you get here

538
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:01,923
You stay in sight.

539
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:04,492
This one's all me

540
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:11,666

541
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,065

542
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:18,073

543
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,287
You're goin' home
on Friday

544
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:36,586
I've arranged for your sister's body
to be on the same flight

545
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:39,855
- He's in prison?
- No

546
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,896
Dead?

547
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,764
- How?
- I--

548
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,840
It was me

549
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,474
Uh--

550
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:02,550
All right

551
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:04,949
Okay

552
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:08,022

553
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:15,489
Hey, uh, Ayla
No You don't --

554
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,600

555
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,136

556
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:25,035

557
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:45,393

558
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,306

559
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:10,352

560
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:40,104

561
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:44,150
All that's left
is the fugly, blind runt?

562
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:46,551
Real classy, people

563
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:50,386
New friend?

564
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:53,188
Uh, somethin' for me
to take care of

565
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:57,755
Thought you were supposed to be
takin' care of me? Isn't Kim allergic?

566
00:38:57,866 --> 00:39:01,632
Um, she moved out
a few months ago

567
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,705
What?

568
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:06,831
- She left around the time of the cuddler rapist.
- Ah,Jesus, Dutch

569
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:11,845
I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it
I didn't want people to think I was distracted

570
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:16,646
- Guess what I'm gonna call her? Claudette

571
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:19,277
- No, you're not
- Yes, I am.

572
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:25,960

573
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:39,204
Ah, baby Damn

574
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:42,072
Baby, don't leave.

575
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:56,625

576
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:59,319
- Hi

577
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:02,556
- There's a lot of heat out tonight
- Really

578
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:05,656
So what do you like, huh?
'Cause I'm up for whatever

579
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:09,669
- Bet you are
- This is a real nice car

580
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:14,299
Nice clothes
You a nice man?

581
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:18,470
You want a bad girl tonight?
I'll do whatever you like

582
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,516
- Be my pleasure with you
- Okay.

583
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,858
That just gets you a discount, big man

584
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,933
I don't ever want to see you
out here again

585
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:51,172
- Whatever you say

586
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:53,611
Officer

587
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,819

588
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:04,051
She's got Dr Breen next Tuesday
The orthodontist?

589
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,753
Right Um,
I'm gonna need that address

590
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:10,491
- That appointment took two months to get
She can't miss it
- She won't.

591
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,567
She's petrified
of getting braces.

592
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:15,933
You really need to talk to her
and tell her everything's gonna be okay

593
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:20,475
- I know how to talk to my kid
- You need to hear what she's saying.

594
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:23,806
Ten is complicated
She's never direct

595
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:28,110
- She's really sensitive
- That's why I'm doin' this

596
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:31,845
So she can get more attention
We can get to know each other better

597
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:35,047
Where are we going, Mommy?

598
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:38,615
Matthew, honey, don't you remember me
telling you? Starting tomorrow

599
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:42,458
Cassidy's going to be living with your dad,
and we're gonna be staying here, okay?

600
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:44,555
- Why?
- Mommy...

601
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:48,898
I'm leaving my stuffed animals here for Matt
and for me on the weekends

602
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:52,269
- Great
- Okay. Come here, tiger.

603
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:58,346
It's gonna work

604
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,028

605
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:28,399

606
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,605
Can't let you
leave us now, man

607
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:37,276
Not after goin'through somethin'like this.
We've been to hell and back a few times.

608
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:41,552
That's gotta count
for somethin:

609
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,587
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah

610
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,402
How 'bout you?

611
00:42:57,606 --> 00:42:59,938
Yeah

612
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:03,238
Oh, man,you guys scared the shit outta me,
bringin'me out here.

613
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:06,542
Yeah, well, we didn't want
the Barn to hear us beg.

614
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:10,744
Plus, we figured once you said yes,
we'd go have a couple of beers

615
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:12,752
Okay Yeah Great

616
00:43:12,854 --> 00:43:15,755
- Good
- I knew you'd see things eventually

617
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:23,092
- Yeah, see what?
- That burnin'the money
was the right thing to do.

618
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:28,329
- I wouldn't get into that call.
- Yeah, but as long as you know
I was doin'it to protect us.

619
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:35,938
You know, it didn't protect us The only way
to protect us was to kill Margos, what Vic did

620
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:39,207
You burned our futures
The only reason that you're even here--

621
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,748
Hey, hey Whoa!
Hey Come on Leave it Leave it

622
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,750
- No, tell him
- Stop it

623
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:45,547
What?

624
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:50,652
Aceveda will disband us
if you leave

625
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:53,455
- So we're stuck with you.
- That's not the only reason we want you back

626
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:56,998
Of course it is Otherwise,
I wouldn't be breathin' the same air as him

627
00:43:57,098 --> 00:44:01,194
That money is gone There's no reason why
we should lose the whole team because of it

628
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:04,101
I can't do this anymore I can't--
I can't do this anymore

629
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:08,734
Stealin' drugs, money Always hiding
I mean, I'm pukin' up blood, for Christ's sake

630
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:12,746
You torched enough cash
to buy a thousand doctors, you dumb shit

631
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:16,011
- You dumb shit!
- You know what? Forget it, man

632
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:18,278
- Will you shut up?
- NoJust let him go

633
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:20,354
No
We gotta talk about this

634
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,185
- The guy doesn't care He--
- Shut up, goddamn it, I said

635
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,851
- He didn't give a shit! Let him go!

636
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:28,452
Stop! Don't do this
Lem, come on!

637
00:44:28,563 --> 00:44:31,691
He doesn't give a shit about his friends.
Let him go.

638
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,826
They are going to disband us!

639
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:38,963
No, they're not No, they're not
Go after Lem Try to talk him down

640
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:42,510
Shane and I are gonna go to his house
in case you miss him Let's go

641
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:46,707
- What are we doin'?
- It's not what we're doin:
You're gonna go apologize.

642
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:49,340
- Make this right.
- Lem's the one that should be apologizing

643
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:53,911
I did not go through this shitstorm to lose
our whole team over your goddamn temper!

644
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:56,149
Hey, I didn't ask you
to go alone after Margos

645
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:59,352
I was right there next to you
You ditched us

646
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:03,593
- To protect you
- I didn't ask to be left behind.

647
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:07,031
- I don't need protecting
- Oh, yeah? What about Tavon?

648
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:12,995
You know, you talk--
you talk like we're brothers

649
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,474
Yet you treat me
like I'm a little brother

650
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:19,013
- Where'd you get that line-- Mara?
- Hey, she's my wife now

651
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:21,605
Start wrappin' your head
around that

652
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:24,685
She might kiss you in all the right places,
but when the time comes

653
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:26,754
she'll turn on you too

654
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:34,059
- Is that the way you want this to go?
- Come on. Right now.

655
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:36,528
- Right now.
- Yeah? You better watch out

656
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,067
'cause your wife isn't here to hit me
in the back of the head with an iron

657
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:45,401
I've made some mistakes.
You never let me forget 'em.

658
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:49,443
You even come down on me
when I didn't do anything You thought I took

659
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:51,512
that seven grand from the storage locker,
didn't you?

660
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:53,547
- I didn't know who took it
- Oh, bullshit!

661
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:56,913
- Bullshit You thought it was me
- Nothin' else made sense at the time

662
00:45:57,018 --> 00:46:01,250
I told you the truth
I looked you in the eye, and I told you the truth

663
00:46:01,356 --> 00:46:04,621
And you still thought
I was a liar in your head

664
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:09,561
- I was with you every step
of the way on the money train
- Like I had to drag you into it

665
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:12,599
- You wanted that money as much as I did
- You're goddamn right

666
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:17,297
You're goddamn right And now you're backin'
the guy who burned it over me

667
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:22,172
- I never-- I never put the money above us
- Do you think that's what I did?

668
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:24,211
That's what
you're doin' right now!

669
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:27,042
This bitch has you so turned around
you don't even see it!

670
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:30,914
Well, I'm goin' home to that bitch
Who the hell are you goin' home to?

671
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:32,987
- My daughter
- Oh, yeah?

672
00:46:33,088 --> 00:46:37,149
Yeah, the good father?
How long do you think that's gonna last?

673
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:40,594
You f--

674
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:47,827
We've been through a lot,
you and me

675
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:52,270
I'm givin' you one chance to walk away
You take it

676
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:05,619

677
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:18,088

678
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:21,794

679
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:27,705

680
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:32,480
