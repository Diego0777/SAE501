00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,534
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:09,701
We're talking about
making a case

3
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:12,567
that puts Mackey
behind bars for a long time,

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:14,867
and I want you
to help me prove it.

5
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,200
OK.

6
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:27,801
Detective Terry Crowley was
pronounced dead at 2:15 this morning.

7
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,867
No!

8
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:32,734
We killed a cop.

9
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:36,367
Get over it
and don't bring it up again.

10
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,601
Stay on Mackey.

11
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,034
All of his guys.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,400
You sure?

13
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,500
I wish I wasn't.

14
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:44,500
Your captain's been
relieved of duty.

15
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,001
We need someone to cover
in an interim capacity.

16
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,267
What was that about?

17
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,200
He asked me to be the
company yes man jellyfish.

18
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,001
Told him to shove it.

19
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,001
Where's his stash?

20
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,233
It's in there, man.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,068
All right. We find
the dead girl's body,

22
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,801
you get this back.

23
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:04,001
Those drugs were never
logged into evidence.

24
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,867
Wally called in one of
my colleagues immediately.

25
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,867
We were able to I.D.
Lemansky from her description,

26
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,434
search his vehicle
while he was sleeping,

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,634
procured the heroin, and replaced
it with a non-narcotic substance.

28
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,867
Vic likes me
and my boy.

29
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,367
He wants to take care of us.

30
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,734
We can use that.

31
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,667
I thought
you were Vic's C.I.

32
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,200
Whoever's got the money.

33
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,734
Police!

34
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,534
Police!

35
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,534
All right,
let's split 'em up.

36
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,167
Hey! Hey!

37
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:25,934
Goddamn you!

38
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,367
Get out of here!
Get out!

39
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:31,367
Stay there.
Ronnie, you all right?

40
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,434
Yeah.
Everybody, just be quiet.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,834
Who hit me?

42
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,434
Jesus Christ?

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,167
Come on, man. Turn around.
Let me see your hands.

44
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,068
Hey?

45
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,601
Nothing. No blood
on the mexis.

46
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,167
Blacks
are clean, too.

47
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,834
Shit.

48
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,767
Go to the e.r.
Get that looked at.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,500
Get a wagon. Haul in
the grieving families.

50
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,801
Tell the captain
I said to send it.

51
00:02:58,867 --> 00:02:59,801
All right.

52
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,534
Bullshit uni calls.

53
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,968
Better
get used to it.

54
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,867
Sir?

55
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,968
You see
who domed my guy?

56
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:15,701
Black kid.
Got, like, a blond afro.

57
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,534
I see him hanging out

58
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:18,867
in front of kwiky's liquor
on my way home.

59
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,734
What the hell's
going on here?

60
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,034
This is, like, the second
black and latino brawl

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
I've had this week.

62
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,300
Where do you live?

63
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,034
Culver city.

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,968
Well, you better learn how to
coordinate your colors, there, westside.

65
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:31,767
Last week,
some black guy

66
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,801
went hit-and-run
on a Mexican kid.

67
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,034
Crushed his skull.

68
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,467
We couldn't generate any
cooperative witnesses.

69
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,500
Cholos took it
on themselves.

70
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,334
Hunted down the driver
and beat him to death.

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,567
Black hood jumped in
and killed two Mexicans.

72
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,200
Went sideways
ever since.

73
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,367
I didn't know.

74
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,567
Yeah. Thanks.

75
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:59,001
She's got three
punctures in her back.

76
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,834
Who found her?

77
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,767
A Junior. Zellie praza.

78
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,601
She's pretty devastated.
She's in my office.

79
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,267
Do you have any
metal detectors here?

80
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,068
Some of them
don't work very well.

81
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,100
Any other witnesses?

82
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,801
Well, there's 1,500 students
in the school.

83
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:11,801
I would think so.

84
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,200
Thanks.

85
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,267
Good questions.
Nice work.

86
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,400
Officer, would
you like to see Zellie?

87
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:20,734
The detectives will. Keep her in
your office until they get there.

88
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,100
Tina?

89
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,701
Tina?

90
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,767
Hey, Tina!

91
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,701
What?

92
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,400
You're contaminating
the crime scene.

93
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,500
Aw, shit!

94
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:33,734
Oh!

95
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,534
All right, guys.
Come on.

96
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,667
The captain's gonna address
the troops in the briefing room.

97
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,734
Let's head in.

98
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,200
This should be
educational.

99
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,001
Hey. Hey, come on.

100
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,667
I'm hormonal and
I expedite your paychecks,

101
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,233
so let's move it.

102
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,867
What's going on?

103
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,233
A pep talk.

104
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,968
Yeah, 'cause when I
think pep, I think Billings.

105
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,200
OK.

106
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,434
Thanks for joining me.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,834
Betcha lunch
he says,

108
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,834
"and so forth"
at least twice.

109
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,667
As you probably know,

110
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:13,034
yesterday, measure 16
on the city ballot failed,

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,001
so it looks like
those temporary budget cuts

112
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:16,001
are now permanent.

113
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:18,834
That'll be 17%
across the board...

114
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,100
Which means...

115
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,467
which means
we'll have to make do

116
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,300
with the lack of manpower
here in the Barn

117
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,901
and on the street
and so forth.

118
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,434
The chief wants you to know

119
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,167
this is by no means
a reflection

120
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:39,100
of the fine job that you're
all doing for our city.

121
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,233
Of course not.

122
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Listen, starting next week,

123
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,834
we're going to be going
to single unit patrols.

124
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,068
I know. Which means

125
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,500
if you have more than
6 months on the street,

126
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,901
you're gonna be flying solo.

127
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:56,834
And speaking of flying solo
at 6 months,

128
00:05:56,901 --> 00:06:01,200
officer Sofer might be mum
on who the daddy is,

129
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,100
but she'll gladly spill the
beans on your new assignments.

130
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,534
OK.

131
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,500
That's all I have.

132
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,601
You guys keep up
the good work. All right?

133
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,934
Hey.

134
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,300
Cheap bastards
don't wanna cough up

135
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,233
a half cent
of sales tax, screw 'em.

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,968
Next time somebody bitches
p.d. Didn't show up,

137
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:28,334
tell 'em that could've
bought 2 cops on time.

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,801
Hell, yeah, Vic.

139
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,434
So let's keep showing up.

140
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,601
Everything else'll
even itself out.

141
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,267
That's right.

142
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,001
Everything
always evens out.

143
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,300
And so forth.

144
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,400
Don't hate me
'cause I'm always right.

145
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,500
We need to talk to
the rest of Zellie's class.

146
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,934
Well, the juniors
are at lunch.

147
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,834
The entire class?
We'll be here all day.

148
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,200
Hey! Hey!

149
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,667
Hey!

150
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,601
Come on! Move it!

151
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,500
Gunshots!

152
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,400
Come on! Get out!

153
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,867
Julien!
Tina!

154
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,988
EXTRACTION

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,167
we got a full-blown riot at
wellman-Chase high school.

156
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,934
Shots have been fired.
Officers need help.

157
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,467
Tactical alert.

158
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,334
All we got.
Get 'em there now.

159
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,001
Have f.d. And e.m.s.
Stage two blocks out.

160
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,233
Tell 'em it's chaos
on arrival.

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,400
Shit!

162
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,801
Go on!
Get out of here!

163
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,167
Get the hell
out of here!

164
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,867
All right, fire it up!

165
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,400
Vic, wilshire east
came through!

166
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,801
Set up a mobile field force.

167
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:22,567
Come on,
get up, punk.

168
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,068
This was your solution?

169
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,500
Turn the goddamn fire hose
on my kid?

170
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,500
What was I supposed
to do, open fire?

171
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:30,867
Never stopped
you all before.

172
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:33,534
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm David
Aceveda, your councilman.

173
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,267
I can assure you that
it was the safest option

174
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,634
to protect
all these kids.

175
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,133
Right.

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,068
Let's get
a gurney over here.

177
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,200
Get the labs rats
to lift those prints.

178
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,267
Maybe our knifer?

179
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,434
It's not. Ahem.

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
Paramedics?

181
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,400
Officer Hanlon. She got a little
bit too close to the crime scene.

182
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,500
I've already
discussed it with her.

183
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,267
You went into the bathroom?

184
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,701
It's my fault.
I should have...

185
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,367
preserving the scene is training
officer 101. That's how...

186
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,434
murderers go free.

187
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,734
I'm really sorry,
detectives.

188
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,834
It won't happen again.

189
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,367
It's OK.

190
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:14,934
Let's go.

191
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,867
It's a rookie mistake.

192
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,901
She's way too young for you.

193
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,034
I am mature
and distinguished.

194
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,767
A lot of young women
appreciate that.

195
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,834
You really ought to
cut back on the porn.

196
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,434
All right,
please move back.

197
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,734
This shooting related
to our stabbing,

198
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,267
or was this
just for extra credit?

199
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,734
Either way,
he's not graduating.

200
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:41,068
You OK?

201
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,634
I'm fine.

202
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,034
I can grab
those paramedics.

203
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,068
I said I'm fine.

204
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,068
Let's give that to Vic,

205
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,367
and we'll stick
with the stabbing.

206
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,801
OK.

207
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,567
Parents want to take
their kids home.

208
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,233
Nothing would
make me happier.

209
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,901
Unfortunately,
all the little shitheads

210
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,267
are suspects and witnesses.

211
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,567
They want to talk
to a captain.

212
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:01,867
And I want more hair.

213
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,034
All right,
you handle it.

214
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,434
It's good mothering practice.

215
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,634
Vic, what do you got?

216
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,934
Armed and dangerous.
A taser.

217
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,233
He was in the cafeteria
when the kid got shot.

218
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,767
All right, listen. Anything you
can do to quiet this shitstorm

219
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,334
and get it off my plate,

220
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,601
it's got my blessing.

221
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,968
You a member of
the varsity taser club, Weston?

222
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:38,734
Eleven of your classmates
are in mission cross,

223
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,034
some critical, one dead.
And this...

224
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,801
puts you at the top of the most
likely to be tried as an adult list.

225
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,867
A knife and gun
did the damage.

226
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,100
That don't mean shit.

227
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,034
Shit!

228
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,834
That's persuasion by proxy.

229
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,300
I didn't hurt nobody!

230
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:04,901
Yeah? Well, what do you
use this for, huh?

231
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,001
Toastin' pop tarts?

232
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,068
Protection, man.
Shit's crazy, goin' on.

233
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,867
What shit?

234
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,467
Aah!

235
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,233
Goddamn!
That shit ain't right!

236
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,701
All right, all right,
all right.

237
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,567
There's a kill clock.

238
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:24,534
Some Mexican's gotta kill a
couple brothers by tonight.

239
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,133
Why?

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,034
I don't know the whys,
man, just the what.

241
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,567
Who's the Mexican?

242
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:33,467
If I knew that, I wouldn't
be carrying the zapper.

243
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,167
That's for being a wise ass.

244
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,267
Claudette, I might know
what your stabbing's about.

245
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:46,567
Guy in one thinks there's
a kill clock ticking.

246
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,701
Kill clock?

247
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah. Gangs use it
to set a time limit

248
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,133
on an initiation
or a retaliation.

249
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
He heard some Mexican's
gonna try to kill two blacks.

250
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,300
Just randomly?

251
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,267
You think
it's legit?

252
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:56,601
That doesn't matter.

253
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,300
If it stirs up enough fear,
it's real.

254
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,034
Would explain why our
witness isn't talking.

255
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah.

256
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,801
Keep at her. I'm gonna
tap into a C.I. Of mine.

257
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:03,801
OK.

258
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,934
Hey, that girl
that was stabbed...

259
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,434
caroline tylin,
she just died in surgery.

260
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,167
Sorry.

261
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:13,034
Hey, how you feelin'?

262
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,034
How do I look?

263
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,200
Great.

264
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah?

265
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,901
Pretty much how I feel.

266
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,701
Thanks for asking.

267
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,968
Bad news, Zellie.

268
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,100
We know about the
black/brown retaliation.

269
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,801
And right now,
you're the closest brown

270
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,233
to our dead black girl.

271
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,534
She died?

272
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,500
Which means you were
involved or you know who did it.

273
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:40,100
By not talking, you're
interfering with an investigation,

274
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,567
and that's a crime.

275
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:49,034
All right. I saw him
running out as I came in,

276
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,567
and then I saw her
by the sink,

277
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,133
all bloody and shit.

278
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,834
Who was it?

279
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,434
Lorenzo Lavedra.

280
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,767
All right. This kill clock's
gotta fall gangland.

281
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,701
Vic and I should
follow up on this.

282
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,400
OK. We'll take over
the cafeteria shooting.

283
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,100
I'll tell the captain
we traded cases.

284
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,133
Why confuse him?

285
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,601
That it?

286
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,767
For now.

287
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,233
You'll hear from me soon.

288
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,300
Somethin' else?

289
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:33,200
No.

290
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,901
Excuse me.

291
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,300
You're here early!

292
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,968
Come in, please.
Come on.

293
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,667
Come on. Have a seat.

294
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,968
I've only got
a few minutes.

295
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,367
How can I help you,

296
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,567
lieutenant Kavanaugh?

297
00:14:56,968 --> 00:15:00,567
You know that I.e.d. Has been
looking into detective Mackey

298
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,567
and the Strike Team he ran
while under your command?

299
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:06,667
Captain Rawlings began
that investigation.

300
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,267
I was aware of it.

301
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,001
That investigation
still ongoing?

302
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,734
Yes, it is.

303
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,701
Well, what have you got?

304
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,001
What have I got?

305
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,968
We've got Lemansky.

306
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,267
He lifted a brick of tar
off the el Salvadorans.

307
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:29,001
We've been waiting for it
to spin into something more.

308
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,701
Which means you've got
nothing on Mackey.

309
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,901
His day job's
keeping him busy.

310
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:37,367
He hasn't had the freedom
to navigate much game.

311
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:40,467
But we got a C.I. Next to him
and when he jumps dirty,

312
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:41,968
we'll know.

313
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:46,167
Until then, I was hoping that
you might be able to help us out.

314
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,100
You've got my
letter.

315
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,567
And I've got
nothing else to add.

316
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,534
Mackey's your problem
now, not mine.

317
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,034
No.

318
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,334
<i>Perception is your problem.</i>

319
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,367
I'm going after Mackey.

320
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,901
And his team.

321
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,300
Now, you can get on board
and be proactive,

322
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,100
or you can sit back
and spectate.

323
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,734
Just like you did when he was
running dirty on your watch!

324
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,667
Hey, I did everything
I could to rein him in.

325
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:16,133
Don't sit there and
threaten me with bad p.r.

326
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,534
You're right.

327
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,133
I was out of line.

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,601
Hey, I'm sorry.
Please, come on.

329
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,834
Sit down.

330
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,200
Mackey's jacket is like
a 20-page cautionary tale.

331
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:31,567
This is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

332
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,500
I just want to get him off the
street before he does any more damage.

333
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:35,934
That's it.

334
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:39,167
P.d. Is looking for a
poster boy for corruption.

335
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,167
They crucify
one of their own,

336
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,934
the public
will trust the rest.

337
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:47,834
And next time, that
ballot measure, it passes.

338
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,167
Hmm?

339
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,934
When you were captain,

340
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,701
Mackey and Vendrell
were interrogated

341
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:59,867
about the shooting death
of a detective Terry Crowley.

342
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:05,667
From the notes, it's very clear
that you thought Mackey was involved.

343
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,300
And your comrades
ruled it line of duty.

344
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:13,934
I was hoping you might be able to
shed some light on the specifics.

345
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:17,734
The rumor has it that the feds
might've been involved with that.

346
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,467
Is that true?

347
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,367
What's my end?

348
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,634
Your suspicion.

349
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,834
This is your letter.

350
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,634
We say you got
the ball rolling.

351
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:43,267
You followed it through
even after you left the job.

352
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:46,968
Now, that's the man
that I want to be mayor.

353
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,968
I would vote for that man.

354
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,034
Vic and his guys are tight.

355
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,233
And Lemansky,
he's a soldier.

356
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,734
He'll follow Mackey
anywhere.

357
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,934
But he's also the one
with a conscience.

358
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:07,667
So you're going to need something to
drive a wedge between him and Mackey.

359
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,901
I need that wedge,
councilman.

360
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:11,968
I need that wedge.

361
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:15,567
If I give you this,
I'm done.

362
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,867
I don't want that guy's
stink on me anymore.

363
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:20,267
My word.

364
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:32,200
Terry was working with justice
to bring down Mackey,

365
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,934
and I think
Vic had him killed.

366
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,467
What kind of proof
you got?

367
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,968
Detective Crowley's
deal with justice.

368
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,534
That's good.

369
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,834
That's good.

370
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,200
That's good.

371
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,233
Can I get the intel
by the end of the day?

372
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,200
Sure.

373
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,034
No, thank you.

374
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,133
This is a fresh pack.

375
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,934
It's juicy fruit.

376
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,734
I said no.

377
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,467
Thank you.

378
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:16,233
You hold this out
long enough,

379
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,400
some people feel
compelled to take the gum.

380
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:24,500
It's a sign they'll
crack under pressure.

381
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,200
I know.

382
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,901
Ha ha ha.

383
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,567
Ahh.

384
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:33,701
Hey, listen...
oh, there he is!

385
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:37,068
Hey, sebastian,
how you doing?

386
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,300
Look how big
you got.

387
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,767
Oh, wait a minute!

388
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,200
Wait a minute.

389
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,500
How'd that
get in there, huh?

390
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,500
You want that?

391
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,500
Yes.

392
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,601
Here.

393
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,467
You want
anything?

394
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,434
No.

395
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,034
Here on business.

396
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,767
I got a kill clock
ticking.

397
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,001
Mexican on black.

398
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,068
These things usually
start on the inside,

399
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,133
so check with your
prison contacts, OK?

400
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
OK.

401
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,734
Good.

402
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,200
Uh... your C.I. Renewal papers
hit my desk.

403
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,467
You need me
to sign them?

404
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:14,968
Look, I know
it pays the rent,

405
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,267
but C.I. Work,

406
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,834
is a roll of the dice.

407
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,200
We've had
a good 6 months,

408
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,801
but you should get out
before you get hurt.

409
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,934
I need that money, Vic.

410
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,068
What else am I gonna do?

411
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,200
Anything else.

412
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,601
I'll help you find something.

413
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,034
You're worried about us.

414
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,968
I just want this to end
on good terms.

415
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,734
Now tell me
you'll think about it.

416
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,334
OK.
I'll think about it.

417
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,567
Good.

418
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,400
And if you hear anything
about this kill clock...

419
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,968
I'll let you know.

420
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:47,400
Good.

421
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,200
Was the riot
gang related?

422
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,601
Well, we're still
putting the pieces together,

423
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,934
trying to get
a clear picture and so forth.

424
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,367
Well, what the hell
started it?

425
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:02,701
We don't have a motive yet,
but we have a suspect.

426
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,934
Good.

427
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,434
I need a minute.

428
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,634
Shut the door.

429
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:21,367
This about me
hosin' down those kids,

430
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:24,567
I'd rather have 'em pissed
off and wet than dead and dry.

431
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,400
Ha, what?

432
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,934
You breaking up
with me, Roy?

433
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,001
Got a call from pensions.

434
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,867
Chief's having them
put through your papers.

435
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:39,133
They want you out
when you hit your 15.

436
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,167
You're puttin' me on the beach?

437
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:10,133
This referendum failing,
cutbacks are hitting hard.

438
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,601
Anybody near their 20 or
carrying a risky jacket

439
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,200
is getting a push.

440
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,300
At least you'll get a
piece of your pension.

441
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,233
There aren't enough
cops as it is.

442
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,968
It's not personal,
it's policy.

443
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:23,100
If it's not personal, then why am
I gettin' the news hand-delivered

444
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,968
to me by the chief's
inner circle?

445
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,334
Figured I owed you
a face-to-face.

446
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,701
It's bullshit
and you know it!

447
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,200
It's some suit makin'
a judgment call!

448
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,767
Can't you put in
a good word?

449
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:41,167
Turn it my way?

450
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,334
I'm not Gilroy.

451
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,834
It's a different time.

452
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,834
Play this smart, Vic.

453
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:56,701
Don't give 'em a reason
to pull your pension.

454
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,467
Hey, A.C.

455
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:02,634
Hey.

456
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:06,968
Uh, kid who did the stabbing,
Lorenzo Lavedra, 17.

457
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,500
Couple misdemeanors,
nothing violent.

458
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,267
No gang ties.

459
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,701
His pops, however, is a...

460
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,634
is doing a dime in chino.

461
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,834
Assault.

462
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:19,001
Good.

463
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,133
What's up?

464
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:39,167
Jesus Christ, these are
retirement papers.

465
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,634
Yeah.

466
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:41,634
Am I missing something?

467
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:44,834
Department's cuttin'
its liabilities.

468
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,601
Phillips wants me out by the
time I hit my fifteenth year.

469
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,968
That... that's like
in 4 months.

470
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,767
That's crazy!

471
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,367
Um...

472
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:05,200
but what
are we gonna do?

473
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,200
I'll walk out the front door
on my own

474
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,734
before I'll let someone
push me out the back.

475
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,233
This is between
you and me.

476
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,534
Not a word.

477
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:32,968
Ha ha ha!

478
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,068
Ha! That's right.

479
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,367
Hey! How's the head?

480
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>Intact! Man, nothing
can hurt that cabeza.</i>

481
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,567
Ahh.

482
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:41,267
Is it sore?

483
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:44,133
OK, OK. I see it.

484
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,334
I want that asshole
who clubbed me.

485
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,901
Oh, we'll get him.

486
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,968
Hood needs
a little reminder.

487
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,901
You hurt us,
we hurt you worse.

488
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:52,968
I'll make sure
that measure passes.

489
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,834
We got a clock to kill
first, guys. Let's go.

490
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:07,400
We're lookin' for Lorenzo.

491
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,001
Haven't seen him
since this morning.

492
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,534
Hasn't been home
all day today?

493
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:12,133
Don't know.
Just got here.

494
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,100
Was picking up Cisco
from soccer.

495
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,434
Hey, that's our guy!

496
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,968
Stay here!

497
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,001
Hey.

498
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,300
Aw, hell, he went down!
Shit!

499
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,601
Stop!

500
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,901
Asshole's trying
to finish the kill clock.

501
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:56,434
Can't let him
get out of browntown.

502
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,934
I got it!

503
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,734
Get out now!

504
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,534
You OK?

505
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:05,934
Give me your keys
right now!

506
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,534
Get down!

507
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,367
Ah, damn it!

508
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,267
Get out of the car!

509
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,334
Hey, get out
of the car!

510
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,100
Hands on your head
right now!

511
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,968
Don't move
or you're dead!

512
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,534
Let me see hands!

513
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,233
Let's go. Let's go!

514
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,500
Come on.

515
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,167
Let me see
your hands, buddy.

516
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,701
Stop struggling.

517
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,701
Got him?

518
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,367
Yeah, I got it.

519
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:41,133
What are you doing? What are you
doing?! Why are you arresting him?!

520
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,500
He ran a stop sign.

521
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:50,868
Where's Cisco?

522
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:51,988
He's downstairs.

523
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:53,654
The black guy,
the guy with the bible,

524
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:54,754
is he dead?

525
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,888
He lost a lot of blood,

526
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,521
but he'll live to see
Armageddon.

527
00:26:57,587 --> 00:26:59,988
My son was scared.
He panicked.

528
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,654
He sees what white cops
do to Mexican kids.

529
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:02,854
Oh, really?

530
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,020
He panic when he stabbed
caroline tylin today?

531
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:08,053
Got a witness saw him
fleeing from the bathroom.

532
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,721
No. Tell him
you didn't do it, renzi.

533
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,554
What time is it, mama?

534
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,654
You got someplace
you got to be?

535
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:15,787
I don't feel so good.

536
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:17,621
I wouldn't feel
too good either,

537
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:19,120
if I just slaughtered
an innocent girl.

538
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:22,187
I'm guessing you didn't
download the death photo

539
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:23,521
with your ring tones.

540
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:24,787
Oh, Jesus.

541
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,687
Lorenzo.

542
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:28,254
Oh, Christ.

543
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:32,254
Take him to the bathroom,
please.

544
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,020
Hey, officer Hanlon.

545
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:39,487
Got a little job for you.

546
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,521
Anything you need,
detective.

547
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:44,220
Clean him up.
Get him to the John.

548
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,821
OK.

549
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:50,554
I'm Mexican.

550
00:27:50,621 --> 00:27:52,053
Why am I gonna be
offin' up some other homes?

551
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,053
Maybe you had
a beef with him.

552
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,387
Maybe it was so crazy
in the cafeteria,

553
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,220
you got caught up
in the rush,

554
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:58,320
fired off some shots.

555
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,387
I didn't do that.

556
00:27:59,454 --> 00:28:00,320
Sure, you did.

557
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,320
No, I didn't.

558
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,687
Then who was it?
I don't know.

559
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:03,621
Because you shot him.

560
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,487
Ha ha ha.
Why you keep sayin' that?

561
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:08,153
'Cause the truth rolls
comfortably off my tongue.

562
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,921
Heard you been braggin'
about the new gun you bought.

563
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,220
Tellin' kids you pack it
for protection.

564
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:16,554
Well, that was just
me talkin'.

565
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,487
I didn't even
bring it to school.

566
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:20,587
You snuck it past the
lame metal detectors.

567
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:22,087
You pulled it out
during the riot

568
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,187
and you shot him
in the back.

569
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:24,654
It wasn't me!

570
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,254
Fine. Call juvie.

571
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,187
Let him spend
a few weeks in lock-up,

572
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:29,787
get a taste
of his future.

573
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:32,187
Maybe a little truth will
seem like a good idea then.

574
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,521
It's Every-Day!

575
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,454
What's everyday,
that you shoot somebody?

576
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,954
Evan Dayne.

577
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,454
Call him Every-Day.

578
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,654
Bangs with the hope hill set.

579
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,654
He can't know it's me
that said anything.

580
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,821
Uggrrhh!

581
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:09,754
Dutch!

582
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,754
Stop it!
You're killing him!

583
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,487
That's it!
It's over!

584
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,621
That's it!

585
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:20,954
Are you OK?

586
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,153
Fine. I'm fine.

587
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,787
Shit.

588
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:32,320
Goddamn it!
This is a new suit!

589
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:33,687
Have a wonderful day.

590
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:36,587
Bye. Bye, guys.
Love you.

591
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:39,888
Bye.

592
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,387
Hey.

593
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:44,888
Jon. I'm new here.

594
00:29:44,954 --> 00:29:46,020
Corrine.

595
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:47,487
Which one's yours?

596
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:50,120
He's inside already.
Orientation.

597
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:54,287
Gum?

598
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:55,387
No, thanks.

599
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:57,187
Come on.
It's a fresh pack.

600
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,587
Here you go.

601
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,954
Sure. Thanks.

602
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,454
That's your boy?

603
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:09,254
Yeah, yeah...
and our daughter.

604
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,487
Two?

605
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:12,087
Wow. That must be tough.

606
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,921
And I'm struggling with
just one autistic child.

607
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:17,254
It's the challenges
of a single parent, I guess.

608
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,487
Yeah. Doing it alone
is hard.

609
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,087
You, too?
Yeah.

610
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,454
The daddy's not
in the picture?

611
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,153
Uh, he does what he can.

612
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,087
My ex, she doesn't even
acknowledge our child.

613
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:33,787
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:36,320
Sometimes I wonder why
I even married her.

615
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:38,888
You ever feel like that?

616
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:42,921
I'll see you around.

617
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:46,187
Can I call you sometime?

618
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:48,187
I'm sorry. It's just that
they told me I should try

619
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:51,254
to get to know some
of the other parents and...

620
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,888
I'm out of my depth.

621
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:55,521
Uh...

622
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,153
I can talk to you or I
can talk to your husband.

623
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,654
Either one if...
you know, whatever...

624
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,954
uh... OK. Last name's Mackey,

625
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,020
and, uh, you can call me
about the kids or the school.

626
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,687
My husband's not gonna
be much help.

627
00:31:06,754 --> 00:31:09,454
Thanks.

628
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:12,754
Thank you.

629
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,187
Hi.

630
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:17,687
Hey, Julien.

631
00:31:17,754 --> 00:31:20,153
You gotta give me
the scoop on Danny's baby.

632
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,521
What do you mean?
The father.

633
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,287
The pool's up to
1,100 bucks.

634
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:27,254
Of course there's a broker's fee
for any insider-training buzz.

635
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,954
She won't say. Why don't you
guys just leave her alone?

636
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,354
Come on, man.

637
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,787
What's your take?

638
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:33,954
Oh, I always take shane
in these things.

639
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,254
Not me, brother.
I'm married.

640
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,387
That's means no sticking,
just licking.

641
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:39,654
Charming.

642
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,988
Besides,
I like my women tiny.

643
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:44,487
So the dick
fits better?

644
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,654
Oh!

645
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,988
Easy. Easy.

646
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:52,254
Put me down for 20
on the sperm bank.

647
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,254
I gotta get this organized.

648
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,554
"Tina. 20. turkey baster."

649
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:59,187
<i>You OK, mijo?</i>

650
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:02,554
I'll see you later,
darlin'.

651
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,921
I got him.

652
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:16,220
Are you on drugs?!

653
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:19,921
I didn't raise
an animal!

654
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:21,053
You hear me?!

655
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,721
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

656
00:32:24,787 --> 00:32:26,787
Who set
the kill clock?

657
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:32,354
Don't you touch him!

658
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,654
Vic. Vic.

659
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,287
The little kid who got
run over last week

660
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:42,220
was a nephew
of a Los mag capo.

661
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:43,787
Doing 20 in chino.

662
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:46,420
Los mags are reaching out
to settle the beef.

663
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:49,053
Chino's where Lorenzo's
pop is stretching.

664
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,287
Hood's been under
the microscope.

665
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:52,487
Maybe the mags
us a proxy,

666
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,954
make sure no blood blows
back in their direction?

667
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,454
I got a few juvie graduates
in chino.

668
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,053
I'll find out
what pop's story is. Come on.

669
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,621
Shane, give me a minute.

670
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,220
Where's Sebastio?

671
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,153
My mom's watching him.

672
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Here.

673
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:13,020
It's OK.
I'm... I'm on the clock.

674
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,921
I know how much
gas costs. Come on.

675
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:17,487
More and more.

676
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:19,387
Thanks.

677
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:21,888
Any thoughts about
hanging this up?

678
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:25,020
Still thinking.

679
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:36,220
A Los mag cap set
the kill clock from chino.

680
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,420
Same cell block where
your father got caught

681
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:40,554
helping the black
brethren distribute smokes.

682
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:43,087
<i>Pissed off
the inked vatos.</i>

683
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:45,821
Asshole can't even play
by the rules in prison.

684
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:51,754
My guess is Lorenzo Senior offered
you up as a Junior assassin...

685
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,587
to settle both scores.

686
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:55,554
Is that true?

687
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:58,454
Does that bastard have
something to do with this?

688
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:01,420
Answer me!

689
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,621
Mommy can't help you.

690
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:08,554
Grow a dick.
Tell the truth.

691
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,854
It's about justice.

692
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,187
He said I could
help the cause.

693
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:21,020
It's mexl-pride.

694
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,754
Jesus, mother of God!

695
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,320
I didn't want
to hurt no one.

696
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,754
Dad started crying.

697
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:28,821
Said if I didn't kill
2 dark by 10:00 tonight,

698
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:30,487
Los mags were
gonna waste him.

699
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:32,954
It was him you were on
the phone with last night?

700
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,254
I gotta finish it
or he dies.

701
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,487
Why? Why would you
do this for him?

702
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:42,387
Not for him.
I hate him!

703
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:45,087
But if I don't do it, it falls on Cisco.

704
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,754
He was on the other
line. Dad told him, too.

705
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:50,053
He gave us the combination for the guns.

706
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,287
Guns? There's more than one?

707
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,387
Oh, no!

708
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:56,954
Cisco still thinks my
dad's like a real dad.

709
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,721
He'll do it.

710
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:01,487
He'll throw it all away
for that asshole.

711
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,721
Paula! Where's the kid that
was sitting in that chair?

712
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,187
Cisco!
What kid?

713
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:09,988
Shit!

714
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:15,884
Description
of the shooter

715
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:16,884
sounds like our
lost brother.

716
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:17,951
Go!

717
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,550
Hey!

718
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:21,817
What happened here?

719
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:23,283
Little spic came
and shot him cold.

720
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,550
I mean, tommy never
saw it coming.

721
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:25,851
He's gone.

722
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,151
Which way did he go?
Out the back.

723
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:28,917
Come on, shane.

724
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,817
You know that crazy kid stopped
to take a goddamn polaroid?

725
00:35:31,884 --> 00:35:33,184
I stuck him with
my best pair, though.

726
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,584
You struck him
with your scissors?

727
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,884
Stay here. Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!

728
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,751
Hey.

729
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,450
Yeah.

730
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:49,851
Easy.

731
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,617
Hey.

732
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,484
Cisco!

733
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,784
Put the gun down, kid!

734
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,550
Put it down right now
or I'll shoot!

735
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,084
I gotta get this
picture to my dad.

736
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,684
Hold it!

737
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,951
All right.

738
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:13,851
We'll talk about the picture
after you put the gun down.

739
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,151
You'll take it to him?

740
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,383
Yeah.

741
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,851
Yeah, I'll take it
to him myself.

742
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,851
That's it.
Where we can see it.

743
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,283
Good boy.

744
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,417
Go!

745
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,350
Give me the camera.

746
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,650
It really hurts.

747
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:35,118
Don't! Shit!
Jesus Christ!

748
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:37,017
Apply some
pressure on it!

749
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:38,051
Go get those paramedics!

750
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:39,650
Goddamn it!

751
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:42,817
Oh, Christ almighty!
Watch out! Go! Go! Go!

752
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,051
All right.

753
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,450
Hurry up, Ronnie!

754
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:48,051
What happened
in the cafeteria?

755
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:50,917
I heard those shots and hit
the floor like everybody else.

756
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:52,484
Anyone else see that?
Don't know.

757
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,784
We all ran for the door.

758
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:56,218
We got 3 people who saw you
pull the trigger, Every-Day.

759
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,051
Well, then
you got 3 liars!

760
00:36:58,118 --> 00:36:58,984
3 against one.

761
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,350
Those aren't very good
odds for you.

762
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,417
I'm used to it.

763
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:06,317
We're gonna need a little
more than a bad attitude

764
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:08,784
to be convinced
of your innocence.

765
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,151
You best tell
pale boy here

766
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:13,017
to get out of
my goddamn face.

767
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,784
look,
I ain't...

768
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:24,784
I ain't been playin'
trouble for a while now.

769
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:25,851
Y'all can
ask around.

770
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,884
We did. That's how
we got the statement.

771
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:29,151
From who?
Some chill-sitters?

772
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:30,717
They're killin'
us niggas.

773
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,484
You don't think they want
to put another one away?

774
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,584
That sounds like
motive to me.

775
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,851
Lazy-ass cop.

776
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,484
Hey, I bust my ass
on this job!

777
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,550
Well, your busted ass
suck at it!

778
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,317
Hey. Book him
for murder.

779
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:47,250
This is wrong, man! I
ain't killed nobody, man!

780
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:49,218
Come on. It's been
a long, shitty day.

781
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,517
Every day.

782
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:54,084
The emt says
he's gonna make it.

783
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:55,017
<i>Gracias a dios.</i>

784
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:56,717
Well, I wouldn't be
too thankful.

785
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:58,784
He just killed
an innocent man.

786
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,250
I wanted to kill
their father a dozen times,

787
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:03,017
and I never did
for their sake!

788
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:05,851
Los mags should slit
his throat from ear to ear.

789
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,984
Ma'am!

790
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:14,084
She's right, you know.
That prick should die.

791
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:18,851
He will.

792
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,484
Just not today.

793
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,617
Look, this isn't the way
I wanted to do it,

794
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:24,484
but at least it will end
this round of blood.

795
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,051
Talk to your guy
in chino.

796
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:27,817
Find out where
those pictures go.

797
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:29,250
We got 2 hours
to get them there...

798
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,218
all right.
Stop the clock.

799
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:33,884
Get it done.

800
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:36,650
Got a call from
a teacher at wellman.

801
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:39,984
He just realized his gun was
stolen out of a locked desk drawer.

802
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,884
Evan dane is any
of his classes?

803
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,151
Homeroom and science.

804
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:45,250
Now we know where
Every-Day got his weapon.

805
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:48,584
What ever happened to rappin'
a kids knuckles with a ruler?

806
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,984
Uh, good job. Thanks.

807
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,851
It's, uh...
it's Vic's kid.

808
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:00,650
I got 50 bucks
in the pool.

809
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:04,984
That's funny.
'Cause I got 50 on you.

810
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:10,917
I tried calling.
No one answered.

811
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:12,218
Something wrong?

812
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,151
I thought maybe I'd...

813
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:18,051
I'd try to catch them before
they went to bed, say good night.

814
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:19,417
It's not your usual night.

815
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,851
I know.

816
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,784
Vic, you can't just
show up. I mean...

817
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:24,817
they have a schedule.

818
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,283
And mine's
always changing.

819
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,617
You want me to ever
see them or not?

820
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:31,118
These aren't my rules.
It's the custody agreement.

821
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:33,250
Oh, Jesus.

822
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:35,584
Is that blood?

823
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:42,051
Shit. I thought
I got it all.

824
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,851
12-year old.

825
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,584
It's been a shit day.

826
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,584
I just wanted to
kiss 'em good night.

827
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:58,017
Wash it off
before you see them.

828
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:06,751
Hey.
Daddy!

829
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:08,184
Ha ha ha.

830
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,550
Ooh...

831
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,851
aw, my baby.

832
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,283
Heard you already have
a suspect in custody

833
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,784
on that cafeteria
shooting.

834
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,717
Most cases are solved
within the first 24 hours.

835
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,751
After that, the odds of solving
them decrease exponentially.

836
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:31,550
I'm gonna learn a lot
from you, aren't I?

837
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:33,884
Could be.

838
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:36,084
Have a good night,
detective.

839
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,851
You, too.

840
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,617
Relax.

841
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:43,984
What?

842
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,517
The residue tests came back on negative.

843
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:49,917
We're sure
about this guy?

844
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:53,951
He knows when
to wash his hands.

845
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:55,951
So do I.

846
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:05,717
We're looking for
a brother.

847
00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:08,751
Blond afro, tall.
Hands might be cut up.

848
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:10,151
Ain't seen nobody
like that.

849
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,484
We know he hangs here.

850
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,417
And we know this shop's been
hit 9 times the last year.

851
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:15,417
Twice
last month.

852
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,118
And it took you guys
3 hours to show up

853
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,751
last time I called.

854
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:22,584
Well, next time...

855
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,151
you call us.

856
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,517
We're your new 911.

857
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,984
We'll make sure that people
don't mess with your shop.

858
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:30,717
We'll steer that kind of
business someplace else.

859
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:35,417
You talkin' straight
about keeping my place safe?

860
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:38,450
I got a badge, don't I?

861
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,517
Darius mcbride. D-mac.

862
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,250
Came in this morning, bought
some band-aids and beer.

863
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:48,884
Lives over
on belmont green.

864
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:52,484
Consider your
protection clock running.

865
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:03,283
Hey!

866
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,684
Anybody, any color,
hits this store,

867
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:09,684
I will beat them
half dead

868
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:14,084
and put enough shit on them to
send them away for a 10 stretch.

869
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:16,650
Spread the word.

870
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:19,584
Screw up!

871
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:31,217
Guys like the girly-girls.

872
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:34,284
Who says you gotta look
like janet reno, right?

873
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,251
You replaced
your breast plate

874
00:42:39,317 --> 00:42:40,917
with lipstick
and tampons?

875
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:43,984
A place to put your shit,
you know?

876
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,517
Yeah, well,
that's a reprimand.

877
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,783
As well as probably
getting you killed.

878
00:42:51,384 --> 00:42:55,417
Lose those hoop earrings before
someone rips your ears off.

879
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:56,950
Did I do something
to piss you off?

880
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,517
You know what? You have a
job, sweetheart, all right?

881
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:00,618
Take it seriously.

882
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:03,050
You're a cop,
not a kelly girl.

883
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,451
OK, look...

884
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:08,150
I appreciate you being straight with me.

885
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:10,950
It's just hard to catch
a break with these guys.

886
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:12,584
Treat you like
you don't belong.

887
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:16,017
Yeah, I know.

888
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:17,651
They talk a blue streak
about equality,

889
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,117
but the truth is the
shit heads just think

890
00:43:19,184 --> 00:43:21,251
we're a bunch of little
girls playing cops.

891
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:23,850
So we have to
prove them wrong.

892
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:26,351
Yeah... we do.

893
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,517
Thanks.

894
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,950
It's good to
have some back-up.

895
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:41,217
Here you go.

896
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,351
You still here?

897
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:45,684
I thought you were supposed
to be more 9:00 to 5:00.

898
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,517
Thanks. Tell that
to Billings.

899
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,317
Huh. You pretty much
run the place.

900
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:52,684
Yeah, I'd rather be running
the streets with you.

901
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,883
Hell of a lot easier.

902
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,718
Don't be so sure.

903
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:57,684
I got my work
cut out for me.

904
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,817
Tina... she ain't
no Danny Sofer.

905
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:03,317
Well, who is?

906
00:44:03,384 --> 00:44:06,017
Anyway, I wouldn't
write her off too soon.

907
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,317
She's raw, but
she's got potential.

908
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:11,618
Yeah. Guess I made a few
mistakes out there myself.

909
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:13,451
Yeah,
you still do.

910
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,984
You're supposed to have
your dfa hours on my desk

911
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,184
before the end
of the shift.

912
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,451
I'll get Tina
right on it.

913
00:44:19,517 --> 00:44:22,150
See? I did
train you right.

914
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:23,984
Yep.

915
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:40,783
shit.

916
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:50,651
Curtis Lemansky.

917
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:53,917
Yeah. What's up?

918
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:57,451
Jon Kavanaugh,
I.A.D.

919
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:58,850
I need you
to come with us.

920
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:01,384
What about?

921
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,150
Get dressed.
Dyson?

922
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,317
Please.

923
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,684
Please.

924
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,584
I'll get dressed.

925
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:23,783
Halter.
Yeah.

926
00:46:20,684 --> 00:46:22,484
Bye.

927
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,417
Hey.

928
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:36,883
Come here!

929
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,351
Get off!

930
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:34,750
About 6 months ago...

931
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:38,783
we found this kilo
of pure heroin...

932
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,950
in the glove compartment
of your car.

933
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:45,384
We seized the drugs,

934
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:47,850
documented it on camera,

935
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:52,351
and replaced it
with dummy tar.

936
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:56,251
But you never logged it
as evidence.

937
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:58,217
So you've been watching me for 6 months?

938
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:00,950
I don't want you to spin
a story right now. Really.

939
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:06,317
I just want you to think
about what this means.

940
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:11,117
Felony theft under color
of authority.

941
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:14,950
Intent to distribute.

942
00:49:15,017 --> 00:49:17,017
You're a smart guy.

943
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,251
You've been on the
other side of this table

944
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:19,817
a long time.

945
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:21,883
You know how that
will play out.

946
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,517
Does that seem fair
to you? Hmm?

947
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:27,984
Look if you were
arresting me,

948
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,384
we'd be at police one.

949
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:33,017
You'd be parading me
past o.I.g.

950
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:34,750
What do you want?

951
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:39,284
I want us both to do
the right thing, Curtis.

952
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,284
Really?

953
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:45,251
Why is it that the guy
with the conscience

954
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,117
always has to get caught
holding the bag?

955
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:52,517
And we never really
want that guy. Do we?

956
00:49:52,584 --> 00:49:58,117
We want the guy that
put him into motion.

957
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:01,750
The one who is
really dangerous.

958
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:09,050
Who do you think I want,
Curtis?

959
00:50:11,017 --> 00:50:14,084
Come on, man. Come on.

960
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,351
Who do you think
I want?

961
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:19,865
