1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,902
-Jesus, it's freezing out here.
- Decoy Squad's in the clubhouse

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,531
We're working late tomorrow night, boys.
You got any plans, change 'em.

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,201
Uh, I got tickets forJourney.
What's goin'on?

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,142
We're getting the marked money
list out of Aceveda's safe

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,806
What?
I thought there was no way?

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,782
- Things change.
The president's in town campaigning.
- What, in Farmington?

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,820
His schedule changed.
Added a stop in Century City.

8
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,187
Which takes him right through our
shitty neck of the woods at about 65 miles an hour

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,351
What's that got to do with the list?

10
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,429
Every cop on duty's
stuck on security detail.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,090
Which means a skeleton crew inside
the Barn all day and night tomorrow.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,292
Yeah You forgetting
about the combination?

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,860
Aceveda's safe is county issue.
That means the combination's on file.

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,702
Anybody from Property
ever ask you for a favor, you do it

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,709
We get one shot.
After the president's gone, that's it.

16
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,508
This works, I might even
have to vote for the guy

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,680

18
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,244
All right. I'm going.

19
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,256
It's 6:00 in the morning

20
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,383
Come on
You got to stop that

21
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,791
It's just one to start the day

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,354
- To go with the other eight butts right there?
- Six of them are yours

23
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,957
Maybe you should stop, too,
for Christ's sake

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,936
That's just the hormones talking

25
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,131
My mom knows about the baby

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,609
Jenny opened her big mouth to my aunt

27
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,804
Okay So-So now she knows

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,645
- God, she's gonna milk this one.
-She can't be that bad.

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,552
Yeah? Well, I'm the only one that still talks
to her, so that means I get all her crap

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,625
All right, don't-- don't worry
about your mom, okay?

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,852
- You're supposed to be off today
- Well, now I'm on.

32
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,558
The-The-The president's in town

33
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,897
- Bye

34
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,207
Okay It's half an hour before
morning shift is back on duty

35
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,508
It's a ghost town out there

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,583
Boo

37
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,375
All right

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,274

39
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,717
- Clear Four, eight, five, two, one

40
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,949

41
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,083
Oh, shit Oh, shit

42
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,322
- She's here Nina's here

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,593
Get down Get down

44
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,170
- Hey, you're here early
- So are you

45
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,467
You gotta beat the bad guy
to the punch

46
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,498
- Where's the list?
- Ask your property guy when he
pulls his head out of his ass

47
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,626
Oh, Christ

48
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,840
- You sure you punched in the code right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure

49
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,775
- We got to figure out another way
- There is no other way.

50
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,815
Especially when ''employee of the month''
clocks in two hours early

51
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,374
I might be able to crack the safe,
if I had enough time

52
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,046
- You ever tried something like that?
- Never stopped me before

53
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,954
Look, Shane was in there 30 seconds.
We almost got caught.

54
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,890
If we could get the safe out some time
tonight, Ronnie could take his sweet time

55
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,901
And how's Aceveda not gonna
notice a missing safe?

56
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,495
He'll be gone
Plus we'll put in a twin

57
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,441
That safe is standard police issue

58
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,443
There's gotta be a thousand
of them floating around

59
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,480
- Hey, your girlfriend's back

60
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,881
Oh, Christ.
This I don't need right now.

61
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,890
- Detective
- Mrs-- Mrs Maldonado

62
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,722
Reina's friend give me this song

63
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,853
It says he killed her

64
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,090
It says he stabbed
and killed mi hija.

65
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,498

66
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:35,302
This is supposed to be hip? It sounds like
a Chihuahua threw up on an accordion

67
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:40,107
It's a narcocorrido-- a song about crimes
Very popular in Mexico

68
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,113
And making their way up north.

69
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,049
Chaydez loved her,
but he couldn't have her.

70
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,313
Couldn't let her go
It's a love song

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,616
- Not quite.

72
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:56,525
As they made love, he stabbed her once
for every day they were together

73
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,929
And buried her by the underpass
in Frogtown Flats by the river.

74
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,434
- A real chart-topper
- Who's this victim, Reina?

75
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,705
Fifteen year-old girl, disappeared
about six months ago It's Bobby's case

76
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,245
- I helped out for a day checking gang angles
- And?

77
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,680
Wasn't gang Chaydez worked for her father
He was the only suspect

78
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,684
I guess nothing ever came of it

79
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,916
Ever since Bobby took early retirement,
Mom's been coming to me looking for updates.

80
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,289
- Do we know the singer?
- Otilio Ramirez Self-published

81
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,555
The cowboy crap
is straight ranchero

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's see if we can locate him
Also, get a canine unit and look for the body

83
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,164
- Why?
- Because the song says she's buried there

84
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,832
We gonna bring in Eminem
every time he raps about killing his ex?

85
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,968
Rap songs are fantasies
Narcocorridos are recorded history

86
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,775
Oh Learn something new every day

87
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,044
If we're looking for a body,
it must be Lauren Hey

88
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,485
Careful Boris doesn't
play well with other dogs

89
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,492
Oh, I must have the magic touch

90
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,858
Give him time to get
to know you better. Heel!

91
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,988
Sit!

92
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,193
So, um, what brings us
together this time?

93
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,102
Heard a song about a lovesick cholo,
buried his chiquita out here

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,106
They brought us out here
because of a song?

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,167
Look at it as quality time
You still got that boyfriend?

96
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,406
- Still got that wife?
- No Still got that boyfriend?

97
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,009
- The cook, right?
- Chef

98
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,388
- Find
- How's that going?

99
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,427
Um, he's trying to
establish his career

100
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,463
Been a while
Still don't see a ring

101
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,964
Don't worry
He'll get to it

102
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,969

103
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,130
Body

104
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,332
They don't write love songs
like they used to

105
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,879

106
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,515
- Body

107
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,553

108
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,218
Body.

109
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,991
- I need more flags

110
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,034
Ripped by:

111
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,730
Hound

118
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,085
Hey, can I get your autograph, man?

119
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,757
Yeah, like on a confession?
Pack up.

120
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,663
- Who are you?
- We're big fans

121
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,599
- The biggest
- What're you doing?

122
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,405
Let's go

123
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,971
- What're you doing with Otilio?
He didn't do nothing
- Oh, yeah?

124
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,911
He seems to know where all the bodies
are buried, don't you, partner?

125
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,608
- You can't silence me
- Hell, no We're gonna make you talk

126
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,685
Just get your wiry ass in the car

127
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,419
- Look, I know all my rights

128
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,426
Relax You might get
a new album out of it

129
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,359
Is that our corridor?

130
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,864
Yeah Not as tough as he sings

131
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,961
They pulled eight bodies out of Frogtown All
young women in various stages of decomposition

132
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,803
Eight? Any of them stabbed?

133
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,742
Some were there too long to tell
We'll have to wait for the ME

134
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,746
So these guys actually write songs
celebrating crimes?

135
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,817
- The popular ones even get commissioned.
- Musical confessions?

136
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,615
I'm gonna go see what they recovered
from the dead women's bodies.

137
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,748
- You gonna start with Otilio?
- I'll make him sing

138
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,554
Your song says that Reina Maldonado
was stabbed to death

139
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,188
and dumped by the railroad tracks--
that sound familiar?

140
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,166
- My songs speak for themselves
- I'd rather hear it from you, rock star.

141
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,098
She was 1 4 years old
when she went missing

142
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,438
- You sing about Chaydez stabbing her
- What are you doing?

143
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,809
Trying to find out why your shitty CD
led us to eight dead women.

144
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,905
Help! Help! Help!

145
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,916
-Jesus Christ!
- Y-You stay away from me

146
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,680
- What's your problem?
- Help! Help! Help!

147
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,655
- What's going on?
- Nothing

148
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,817
- Really
- I don't want to be alone with him

149
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,225
I didn't touch him.
Go look at the tape.

150
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,797
- No, I'll just sit in
- That's not necessary.

151
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,867
Everyone's on presidential detail.
I can lend a hand.

152
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,936
Now where were we?

153
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,467
I don't commit crimes
I'm a journalist

154
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,978
Is that what you think you are?

155
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,981
Did Chaydez commission that song?

156
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,410
A reporter protects his sources

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,182
- Reporters don't protect killers
- I just write the truth

158
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,951
Arrest me, arrest the L.A. Times too

159
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,187
- Sol Negro needed money for his family.

160
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,891
He planned to take it
from a liquor store on San Marco

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,369
but the shop owner
hated Mexicans, pulled a gun

162
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,371
Sol Negro bravely
shot him in the neck

163
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,567
- I remember that shooting
You remember that shooting?
- I sure do It was Christmas

164
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,543
Yeah It can't be this easy, can it?

165
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,309
Otilio's got three CD's
Who knows how many cases we might close

166
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,375
Run ''Sol Negro'' See what street name
comes up Show the mug shot to the victim

167
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,455
Who am I, the Strike Team
all of a sudden?

168
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,457
- What?
- That sounded like an order

169
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,153
It's not How do you want to go?

170
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,856
The same way It's just--
It's nice to be asked

171
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,297

172
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,499
- Are you arresting Chaydez?
- He's just here for questioning

173
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,372
- Does he know where Reina is?
- If he knows, I'll know

174
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,940
Listen, this could take a while

175
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,847
- So why don't you go home, get a little rest?
- I want to stay here

176
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,819
For the good news

177
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,980

178
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,082
You hear that, Chaydez?
He's singing about you.

179
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,953
-Just a song

180
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,726
No, it's a map to eight dead girls

181
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,893
- and I got a big bet that
Reina Maldonado is one of them
- You're wrong

182
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,030
What I don't understand is why an asshole
like you would put a stabbing to music.

183
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,872
- I didn't write that song
- No, you killed Reina
and had Otilio write it for you

184
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,106
- Never happened
- Narcocorridos are real They're not made up

185
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,341
The singer's reputation depends on it

186
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,578
Now he sung about a dead body
We found eight

187
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,290
- You were off my radar Now you're back

188
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,587
- Can I see you two outside?
- Later

189
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,890
Now, I think

190
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,165
We heard from the lab

191
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,167
Early best guess says that the deaths

192
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,170
look like poisoning from
long-term chemical meth exposure

193
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,502
Reina was hooked up with
some asshole cooking crank?

194
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,041
Maybe not
Her dental records are on file

195
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,703
She wasn't there
She wasn't one of the bodies we pulled

196
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,974
Oh. Maybe there's another burial ground.

197
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,816
So we have a meth operation that's
poisoning its workers and a missing girl.

198
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,182
Claudette, you run the meth thing
with Dutch Vic, you stay with Reina

199
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,456
- What about the singer and his muse?
- Keep 'em till we find out more

200
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,929
How? We're at the deadline.
We got nothing to charge them with.

201
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,728
Find something

202
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,360
The Secret Service wants to
meet with some of the captains.

203
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,598
I'll be back in about an hour

204
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,640

205
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,802
What did he tell me to do?
Drum up charges to hold them?

206
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,847
Trust me-- that doesn't work
He didn't mean it, right?

207
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:38,017
I could free up part
of the Decoy Squad for a few hours

208
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,389
- Then I'll cut Chaydez loose, keep a tail on him
- That's your call, not mine

209
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:46,193
Okay I'll take responsibility When Walon's
team comes into the Barn, cut him

210
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,582
All right, get it inside the clubhouse

211
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,210
Aceveda's out of the office for an hour.
Decoy Squad's on the way in.

212
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,686
-Just enough time to make the switch
- I really don't like this

213
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,758
Well, you'll pretend

214
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,226
- What's with all the Rolaids, man?
- I got an ulcer

215
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,529
- Since when?
- Since the Armenian mob started
looking for me This helps

216
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,161
Stop worrying your guts out, man.
We're not gonna get busted.

217
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,502
What are we doing breaking
into a captain's office?

218
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,805
We've nailed 20 guys we can lay the cash off
on, get 30 cents on the dollar

219
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,777
Let them worry about washing it.

220
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,576
Partner up with criminals?
I'm trying to find the flaw in that plan

221
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,708
I'm just saying there's other ways

222
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,448
That are fine if you want huge risk
and 30 cents on the dollar.

223
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,854
But I want a dollar on the dollar

224
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,664
- Hey Somebody moving?
- Well, we're just, uh

225
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,499
moving a little stuff out of the clubhouse,
make some room for you and your team

226
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,334
Oh. I thought you wanted us out?

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,273
I do Might as well be all
comfortable in the meantime

228
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,901
Listen, I heard you guys
came by to help us out

229
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,912
Well, it beats going home
to an empty bed

230
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,948
I can't help you with that tonight

231
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,644
Oh, don't worry I haven't
needed a slump buster yet

232
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,152

233
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,523
Hey, uh, what happened
with the Secret Service?

234
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,526
It got postponed

235
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,188
Uh, thank you for the, uh, the help
with the Maldonado case.

236
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,427
I was kind of glad when you,
uh, came in when you did

237
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,868
Listen, I-I-I just about
wrote this girl off for dead

238
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,031
I poked my head into it
for a little while...

239
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,632
but when we hit the wall,
I just checked out.

240
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,542
- Then make it right
- You're not hearing me

241
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,815
Um, Reina's father died a month ago
from a heart attack

242
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,324
He just couldn't stand his daughter
missing, you know, not knowing

243
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,364
I was just hoping to get the mom
some good news, that's all

244
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,435
Well,just keep trying

245
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,947
- How's your stomach now?
- Better when this is done

246
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,023
- We're halfway home
- Right

247
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,319
- Let's go
- Yeah

248
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,820
All right,you're on. We gotta get inside
this safe and make a copy of the list...

249
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,093
before the day shift comes back on

250
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,499
- Glad there's no pressure
- Lend him a Rolaids

251
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,938
- Three-hole punch
- Yeah. 39-73.

252
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,034
- Any tape dispensers?
- I got five units

253
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,113
Right Stapler

254
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,712
- Six
- Great

255
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,048
Only 57 more to find

256
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,748
And then we'll see
what our next punishment is.

257
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,584
Look, I told you that I was gonna go
to Aceveda and you still went out there

258
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,655
- It was the right thing to do.
- Maybe But you could've
also gotten hung out to dry

259
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,802
It was the right thing

260
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,471
I had to make a deal with
Aceveda to get my job back

261
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,307
Tell him if I saw any cops
going out of line

262
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,081
When I made that promise, I sure
didn't think that you'd be one of'em

263
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,990
One-inch binders

264
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,992
Got it

265
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,894
Liquor store ownerjust I.D. 'd
Sol Negro, a.k.a.Julio Gallegos...

266
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,264
as our shooter in that Christmas robbery

267
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:47,601
If we close any more cases because
of Otilio's songs, we should deputize him

268
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,334
Maybe I can get him to write a tune
about my cuddler rapist.

269
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,342
- You coming?
- Can't.

270
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,469
One of our dead women had a friend's
phone number in her pocket

271
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,548
She should be here any minute

272
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,591
That's Leticia

273
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,786
She was my best friend in Mexico

274
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,262
Well, her body was found
along with seven others

275
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,129
all showing signs of
long-term chemical exposure

276
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,226
What kind of chemical?

277
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
The kind they use to make
methamphetamines.

278
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,706
She would have had to breathe
an awful lot to die of exposure.

279
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,642
She never touched drugs

280
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,714
- When did she come to L.A.?
- I don't know

281
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,616
She saved up for a coyote to bring her up,
but I never saw her

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,520
- She called me two weeks ago,
but I only got a message
- Saying what?

283
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:43,459
That she needed help
But then it hung up

284
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,963
- And you didn't report her missing?
- To who?

285
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:52,936
To say what? That she was being smuggled
over the border and needed help?

286
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,237
- Sol Negro--spelledjust like it sounds.

287
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,040
- Any problems?
- Piece of cake

288
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,945
- I'm gonna jump back on the cuddler case
- I need some help

289
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,780
I've hit a wall ID'ing
some of the other bodies

290
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,413
So, what, we're just gonna
drop all of our other cases, is that it?

291
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,787
Since when does eight dead women
not fire your engine?

292
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,350
I don't want to lose momentum
on the rape case I can't do both

293
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,493
- FineJust give me a second
- Thanks.

294
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:31,302
Otilio! Otilio!

295
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,844
- Buzz me! Buzz me!

296
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,317

297
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,962
- Get up!

298
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,869
- You guys all right?
- Evan, get him to the ER
Make sure they take an X-ray

299
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,103
- What was that guy saying?
- ''There's your next song''

300
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,447

301
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,394
- Tell me I'm rich again
- I can't crack it

302
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,934
Well, can you pull the lock out?

303
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,267
- Not so you wouldn't notice
- This keeps getting better

304
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,240
How do we get the safe back inside
with Aceveda still here?

305
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,210
Let's worry about the list first.

306
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,714
We got one window and in about
three hours it's gonna slam shut

307
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,250
We'll each take turns
tracking Aceveda's movements

308
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,651
- Smitty could get in the safe
- No!

309
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,317
I wanna keep this in-house
until we absolutely have to

310
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,123

311
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,500
Oh, shit.

312
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,702
Oh, shit.

313
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,679
- Look, I'm really busy, Mara

314
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,548
- Guess who I just spent
four hours on the phone with?
- Can we talk about this later?

315
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,951
She calls me in a panic.
It's always the same old shit.

316
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,422
My mom says that they're gonna
kick her out of her apartment

317
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,254
if I can't help her with the rent.

318
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,760
I haven't even sold a single house yet.

319
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,797
- We'll talk about it later, okay, baby?
- Later? When?

320
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,027
Are you ever coming home?
I really need you

321
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,467
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

322
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,165

323
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,407
- Hey, Dutch, we have to do the annual inventory
- Lucky you

324
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah Listen, uh, did you
check out a departmental laptop
computer about 1 0 months ago?

325
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,685
- No
- According to this you did. A Dell 5 1 00.

326
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,155
- Well, whatever you're looking at, it's wrong
- Is that your signature?

327
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,489
- Yeah
- Good work out there today.

328
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,624
- Thank Boris
- Yeah I saw him out there

329
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,397
- Uh, he seemed a little restless
- He's frustrated

330
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,438
He gets worked up
and he wants to go all night long

331
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,507
Corpus interruptus

332
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:21,511
You know, one of these days we're
gonna meet up under better circumstances

333
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,174
- Why leave it to chance?
- Why isn't the narcocorrido in the cage?

334
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,048
Uh, I don't know.
I could check the logbook if you want.

335
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,316
- Then you go get it.
- I gotta get Koto

336
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,723
Narcotics called and they said that they
wanted him to sniff out an after-hours club.

337
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,227
- Uh, good luck
- Okay See ya

338
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,490
Where's Chaydez and the singer?

339
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,591
We had to cut them loose.

340
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,899
Oh, Christ

341
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,065
You cut them loose after I told you
to keep them in custody?

342
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,075
His hold time was over
We had no choice

343
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,635
You think you can disobey
a direct goddamn order?

344
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,341
He didn't I did

345
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,651
You?

346
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,449
We have to protect the case. I don't think you
realized how long we had them in custody--

347
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,457
I realize that I am still captain here!

348
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,120
And I will not put up
with shit like this again!

349
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,441
Hey Um, did you find
that computer yet?

350
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,443
- No, not yet Did you?
- No

351
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,740
If you don't locate it,
the city's gonna bill you.

352
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:34,149
- Yeah Um, I did remember what I was using it for
- What?

353
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,312
Child porn

354
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,450
I had some downtime, so I was
going to local chat rooms, uh, Web sites

355
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,029
to see if anybody was peddling smut
or trying to lure kids

356
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,622
and, uh, I got drawn to something else,
forgot about it

357
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:52,397
So when we find this computer
that was last signed out by you

358
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,200
it's gonna be loaded up
with kiddie porn?

359
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,971
Yeah I-I would appreciate a chance to
delete any files before anybody gets a look

360
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,843
I-I swear it was just work 

361
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,517
Nina, my guys need some
new things for the clubhouse

362
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,786
Could you pull out your scissors
and cut through some red tape?

363
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,522
You have to submit a request
to each department

364
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,793
Ah Everybody knows
you need something done, come to you

365
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,199
I've got my own emergency
to deal with right now

366
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,203
Well, maybe I can help

367
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,432
Not unless you're
a licensed locksmith

368
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,634
Locksmith?
Smitty's your guy

369
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,008
I have one
Thanks Thank you

370
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,346
Hector Moreno? Please
Try Pelican Bay

371
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,522
He got sent up on a burglary
eight months ago

372
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,990
We've used Smitty before

373
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,823
But, hey, you know
what you're doing I'm sorry

374
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,825
Is this Smitty person nearby?

375
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,641
Why are we meeting
in the back of a van?

376
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,142
We need a little help
getting into a safe.

377
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,714
Listen, guys, I'm kinda turning over
a new leaf, you know what I mean?

378
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,513
- Yeah It's about time
- Sounds like a good idea.

379
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,746
I gotta be kinda selective
about the jobs I take

380
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,914
I'm gearing up a new business now

381
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,151
- Home security, right?
- Yeah.

382
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,227
We got a start-up gift for you

383
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:30,794
Home burglaries in Farmington over the last
two months, plus addresses and phone numbers

384
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,735
You say hello
to a hundred and fifty sure things

385
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,545
First things first

386
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,442
I'm gonna need the combination

387
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,265
- This could take a while
-Just get it open

388
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,805

389
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,204
Let me know when you get in

390
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,425

391
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,793
- Yeah?
- Five, nine, five--

392
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,866
Five, four, six.

393
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,429
All right, make a copy of the list,
get it back here quick.

394
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,270
- Aceveda's got some other stuff in here
- Forget 'em.Just get the list.

395
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,004
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Got it

396
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,080
- Go! Go, baby, go.
- Got it

397
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,317
Just came from the bank Chaydez cleaned
out his account the minute the bank opened

398
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,447
- Who's on him now?
- Walon. Chaydez had that account in two names.

399
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,652
- I showed a picture to a teller
She ID'd the Maldonado girl
- Reina?

400
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,628
- When did she see her?
- About a week ago.

401
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,359
She's alive? Uh, the teller's
sure it was the same girl?

402
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,731
She says she remembers because
they seemed like an odd couple

403
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,896
Said she seemed too old to be his daughter
and too young to be his girlfriend

404
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,304
- Reina was seen a week ago

405
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,409
I knew it
I knew she was alive

406
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,178
How well did she and Chaydez
know each other?

407
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,758
Not well

408
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,528
Chaydez, um,
worked for my husband

409
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,791
Tiling

410
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,030
I knew he was hanging
around her too much

411
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,105
Could they have been closer
than you think?

412
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,937
No No! No
Her papa would have killed her

413
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,807
What if Reina kept it a secret?

414
00:26:54,913 --> 00:27:00,510
She was 1 4 She don't keep
a secret like that from me

415
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,519
No No

416
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,181

417
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,815
Oh, no, wait Hang on
He's coming back

418
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,190
- Activity at Chaydez's house.
- What kind?

419
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,093
- Where is he now?
- In and out ofhis garage.

420
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,326
- He's unloading something out ofhis van.
- What's he taken out?

421
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,334
Boxes and a bunch of bags

422
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:23,305
Something that looks like wire or rope
He's getting ready to move something

423
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,433
- No sign of the girl?
- Nothing.

424
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,239
- Stay on him
- What if she's the thing being moved?

425
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,247
- Is there any way to see inside?
- The shades are drawn

426
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,249
What about the back?

427
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,319
- Same thing
- Same thing.

428
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,255
- Go in
- What?

429
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,758
He could be prepping
to kill her right now

430
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,297
Uh, if he's got her stashed someplace else,
we might never find her

431
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,026
And any evidence we find
might be thrown out

432
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,932
We can give him
a few more minutes

433
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,971
I said go in!
Get the girl!

434
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,606

435
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,614
- No sign of her?
- Some clothes, shoes

436
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,184
- She was there for a while at some point
- Any proof she's still alive?

437
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,345
Found a receipt for some makeup
bought three days ago

438
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,355
It's not admissible
Nothing in the house will be

439
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,324
We don't know that for sure
We went inside in good faith

440
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,487
We have to assume it's no good

441
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,360
So we can't even get him
on playing house with a minor?

442
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,195
We found her clothes
in your apartment...

443
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,705
- a receipt dated a week ago.
- I haven't seen her

444
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,005
The bank teller remembers
you two opening an account together.

445
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,308
That's a problem, seeing how you're still
on probation for one statutory rape.

446
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,314
You got something against pubes, man?

447
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,283
I didn't do anything wrong

448
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,752
Well, as you see it, you're in love

449
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,688
Yeah. Forget the fact
she's barely out of algebra.

450
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,521
You're connected to the dead women.
We'll find out how.

451
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:53,085
What I still want to know
is what happened to Reina

452
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,531
It's just one more.
You help us, maybe we can help you.

453
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,228
I can see how you liked her.
Uncomplicated.

454
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,101
Too inexperienced to see
what a dick you really are

455
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,041
I liked her, but I wouldn't be with her.
H-Her parents were crazy.

456
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,511
- She was 1 4
- You keep telling the mom
I had something to do with it

457
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,809
and she keeps coming by
my place looking for her

458
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,374
That's why you had him write the song, right?
To get the parents off your back

459
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,614
- It's just a song
- I'm talking to you!

460
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,622
Look at me

461
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,591
I liked her
She liked me

462
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,824
Enough to go to prison for her?
Or did you hate the mom so much
you made the song come true?

463
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,263

464
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,000
- I got it

465
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,072
She's not a victim.
She loves me.

466
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,807
Hey! Hey!

467
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,312
Enough! Enough! Enough!

468
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,490
You sit down there,
keep your mouth shut

469
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,296
I had to put a new door on

470
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,394
Here's the combination

471
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,943
Write him a check

472
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,930

473
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,340
Enough! Enough--

474
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,983
Ever see her before?
She died of chemical meth exposure

475
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,224
She had a phone number on her.

476
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,727
We checked the records,
found out she used your phone to call it

477
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,854
Maybe I dialed the wrong number

478
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,493
- And left a message doing an impression of her?
- I have a few cell phones.

479
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,571
I don't keep track of'em all the time

480
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,139
- What kind of work do you do?
- Whatever I can, whenever I can

481
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,910
You trying to pass yourself off
as a migrant worker?

482
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:30,249
I'm from Sinaloa.
We are migrants.

483
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,621
That's nice threads Must have found better
work than picking strawberries in Oxnard

484
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:39,754
Now she was found with traces of lye
and red phosphorous in her lungs

485
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,890
- She worked in a meth lab
- Horrible

486
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,198
Bullshit She worked in your meth lab
She used your phone

487
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,829
I don't think so

488
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,736
Vic, Chaydez give you anything?

489
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:58,180
Nothing Hey, uh, thanks for taking
all the heat with Aceveda

490
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,444
- Where is he now?
- He had to run out

491
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,214
Baodelo was arrested in Sinaloa last year
for manufacturing meth.

492
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,552
No conviction
Not even a trial

493
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,355
- But he was arrested.
- What, did you expect
the policia to be honest?

494
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,589
I expect them to at least pretend
It makes three dead ends we've hit

495
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,030
Uh, Chaydez, Baodelo and the narco.

496
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,126
- Your guy know our guy?
- I don't think so Why?

497
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,967
'Cause Chaydez
is chewing his ear off.

498
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,201
- Maybe our two cases are related.
- Hey, Dutch.

499
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,335
I understand you lost
a department computer?

500
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,111
- I saw it missing on their inventory report.
- Yeah Yeah

501
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,016
- Still haven't located it?
- No, not yet But it'll turn up

502
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,520
Well,just so you know,
I had to call IAD

503
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,060
- Excuse me?
- They're gonna have to investigate

504
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:48,258
Any missing city property valued at
over $500 has to be investigated by IAD

505
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,163
I just wanted to warn you

506
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,793
- Smitty do you right?
- Yes, thank you

507
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,896
Sorry, Dutch-boy

508
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,768
Um, please tell me
you put her up to that

509
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,970
I didn't Sorry

510
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,514

511
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,583
We'll find it

512
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,687
We'll find it

513
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,253

514
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,187
- Hey, I'm coming home soon
- I'm bleeding It's the baby

515
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,199
Bleeding? Are-Are you sitting down?

516
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,201
- No
- Sit

517
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,397
- Did-Did you call your doctor?
- No, I called you

518
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,101
- Page her Tell them it's an emergency
- Shane, our baby

519
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,771
Hey, call the doctor, all right? Lie down
I'm-I'm on my way home right now

520
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,881
Got something

521
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:43,545
Our boys, Chaydez and Baodelo,
are second cousins

522
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,952
Huh

523
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,858
So, uh, Chaydez finds out about
his cousin's meth lab cemetery

524
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,295
possibly helps him bury the bodies

525
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,096
and passes one along
to Otilio for the song

526
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,638
Any thoughts on how to get our killing cousins
to turn against each other?

527
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,999
Maybe we should take it to the press

528
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,812
Not only is Reina not buried by the tracks,
she's not buried at all

529
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,147
She's alive.
So much for yourjournalistic integrity.

530
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,551
But I saw a body

531
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,850
And now you just admitted
to being an accessory

532
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,788
No No, I didn't

533
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,454
Chaydez had a second cousin
in the meth business

534
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,726
Somehow all his workers seem to end up dead
That's who you saw

535
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,199
I thought you reporters were
supposed to get your facts right?

536
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,602
- That makes you a fraud
- How's that gonna play down in the barrio?

537
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,539
Thought you guys were supposed to be
all about the truth?

538
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,978
I thought it was the truth

539
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,380
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows it wasn't

540
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:52,150
Wouldn't want your fans paying
good money for a corrido con job, huh?

541
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,884

542
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,892
They talking?

543
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,462
Oh, Chaydez can't keep his mouth shut

544
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:03,261
Trish took a bath in
Southern Comfort. Gotta say, she commits.

545
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,131
Let's hope her Spanish is as good
as her homeless routine.

546
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:13,334
Chaydez told the truth,
the whole truth and kept telling the truth

547
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,878
He's been hiding her out at a friend's place
Guy's name is Joaquin

548
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,711
- We'll find the friend
- Also said his cousin runs
his meth lab out of a truck

549
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,876
Right now it's in an industrial park
in Boyle Heights

550
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,623
Let's go

551
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,998

552
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,163

553
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,807
- Go! Go!
- Go!

554
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,641

555
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,453
Okay. Let's get
the trailer open.

556
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,252
Hazardous fumes
Don't breathe inside the trailer

557
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,387

558
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,126
- Policia!

559
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,263

560
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,375

561
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,316

562
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:33,250
Welcome to the land of promise.
Come be our slave.

563
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,155
Yeah Heard that one before

564
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,593
- There

565
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,676
Chaydez?

566
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,644
Hello, Reina
We're here to rescue you

567
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,047
- All right, you're gonna wait in here
- Do I have to see her now?

568
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,125
Yeah, you do

569
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,329
S-Sit down

570
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,772

571
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,273
- Reina's safe She's safe She's okay
- Where is she?

572
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,973
Uh, she's inside

573
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,277
But there's something
I gotta tell you first

574
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:39,555
She, uh, she went away
with Chaydez on her own

575
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,625
What?

576
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,560
No

577
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,426
She knew that you and your husband
would never approve

578
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,760
Pero the funeral?
She didn't come

579
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,668
Well, she's young
She thought she was in love

580
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:00,107
- She made a mistake
- No You're wrong

581
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,907
She's still your daughter

582
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,381
Reina's only 1 5
She made a mistake Let her fix it

583
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,577
She needs to see you

584
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,619
No! Not now

585
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,396

586
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,104
Look familiar, you big perv?

587
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,366
- Where was it?
- Desk drawer back in the storage room

588
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,966
Also found your renewal card
for Tiger Beat. I mailed it in

589
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,512
Funny later, not funny now

590
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,911
You're back

591
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,477
Yeah I had this odd feeling
I'd made a mistake in my paperwork

592
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,080
- You never made one before
- You can't be too sure

593
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,095
Maybe you were just
hoping you'd run into me

594
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:56,394
There is a difference
between confidence and overconfidence

595
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,636
- Boyfriend cooking for you tonight?
- He works weekends

596
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,540
- I can throw parsley on a plate
with the best of them
- It's a bad idea

597
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,375
- Name one bad thing about it
- I'm involved

598
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,506
Mentally, you're already checked out

599
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,409
What makes you say that?

600
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,545
I'll explain it over dinner

601
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,657
- What do you have to go back to work for?
- It's just for a couple hours

602
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,162
We'rejust finishing something up.

603
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm having a miscarriage,
and you're leaving

604
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,696
It's just spotting
Doc says everything's gonna be all right

605
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,704
But you got to take it easy

606
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,297
You gotta take care of our baby

607
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,309
Hmm

608
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,345
Now you sure you don't need
anything else before I go?

609
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,882
Just for you to stay

610
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,383
I'll be back as soon as I can
I promise

611
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,280
Bye-bye.

612
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,326

613
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,328
- You should know
- You want to try
drawing a house like this?

614
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,694
That's not bad

615
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,500
- Hey, guys
- Can we watch a movie tonight, Daddy?

616
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,731
Well, maybe.
What's going on?

617
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,967
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure

618
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,636
Hi, honey

619
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,306
- Fix this
- Oh, it's okay

620
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,112
- Can I ask a favor?
- What?

621
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,186
Can you take the kids this weekend?

622
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:26,415
- I don't have them till next weekend
- Please?

623
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:31,689
- Why?
- Um, I have some things I have to do and I, um--

624
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,366
Um, I don't want them
to be around me like this

625
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:44,539
Has something happened?
Is it your mother?

626
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,336
No Um

627
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,713
did you know it'd be this hard,
this-this empty?

628
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,555
I-- I don't know
what it would be

629
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,752
I'm having a hard time

630
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,099

631
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:20,906
Uh, can you take the kids this weekend?
I really don't want them to be--

632
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,036
- Sure Sure
- I'll take them next weekend if you want.

633
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,081
- That's okay I miss them
- Okay.

634
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,412
Great

635
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,919
I'm gonna be all right.
Um... okay.

636
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,661
- I'm sorry. I can't do tonight.
- Everything okay?

637
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,567
A better offer
Two nights with my kids

638
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,600
- It's probably a sign
- It's a scheduling snafu Next week?

639
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,908
No, it feels like a sign

640
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,609
Maybe we'll catch another case
again together sometime

641
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,446

642
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,434
We made the case against Chaydez.
Found Reina.

643
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,234
Good

644
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,537
- What's this?
- Interrogation room tape from today.

645
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,176
You cut me a break when
I went off the grid for Tommy

646
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,947
Can't stand owing you something

647
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,648
- Dad, let's go!
- I'm coming, baby!

648
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,853
- Hey, Rigo

649
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,731
There a family reunion
I didn't know about?

650
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,360
How you doin', man?

651
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,403
You all right?

652
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,851
- What, you couldn't stop them?
- He had a gun to my head.

653
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,389
- You couldn't do anything?
- What would you have done?

654
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,352
- Does Aurora know?
- Nobody knows

655
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,762
Man, all I wanted to do was survive.

656
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,907
See my wife and--

657
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,542
See my wife
and my little girl again

658
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,549
And now all I do is make up
excuses not to go home

659
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,144
You did what you had to do

660
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,152
No one can blame you

661
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,227
I went after a suspect today

662
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,388
and I kicked the shit out of him

663
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,503
And the only thing that stopped me was
I started to piss my pants

664
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,572
I'm losing control of everything

665
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,645
Then take it back.

666
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,174
I don't know how

667
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,547
You're a captain.
You command 200 men.

668
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,819
Hell,you're gonna be
the next city councilman.

669
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,189
You have power, David.

670
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,956
You have a gun and a badge.

671
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,589
Now these werejust
a couple of punk assholes.

672
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,403
Do you know who they are?

673
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,166
I could find out

674
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,906
But even then, what?

675
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,314
If it was me, I'd kill them
