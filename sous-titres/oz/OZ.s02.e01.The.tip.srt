1
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,206
Oz.

2
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,356
The name on the street

3
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:47,200
for the Oswald
Maximum Security Penitentiary.

4
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:52,964
Oz, where after months of tension,
a riot erupted.

5
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,566
Hey, this sucks, motherfucker.

6
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:08,201
The unit known as Emerald City
was overtaken by its prisoners.

7
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:11,723
The governor ordered
his troops to recapture it

8
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:15,197
by any means necessary.

9
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,158
When the smoke cleared, literally,

10
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:34,798
six prisoners and
two correctional officers were dead.

11
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,606
Thirty-four others were injured.

12
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,926
Some overcome by the gas.

13
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,723
Some from the beatings.

14
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:49,402
- Show us.
- Why don't you hold this bitch up?

15
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,127
Some from rifle wounds.

16
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,044
Among those shot,

17
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,879
Tim McManus,

18
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,277
who invented Emerald City

19
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,085
and some say,

20
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:05,876
ran it into the ground.

21
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,920
The rest of the prisoners
were moved to Gen Pop--

22
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,123
Somebody named people.
You're a motherfucker.

23
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:19,640
Meet your fucking--

24
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,447
- Asshole.
- l'm gonna kill you, motherfucker.

25
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,518
Fuck you. Let me at you.

26
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,245
Fucking bitch.

27
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:35,525
--except for the riot leaders,
who were drop-kicked into solitary.

28
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:49,241
By dawn peace descended on Oz.

29
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,958
Yeah, right.

30
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,403
Let me just say this about that.
l've already started to put together

31
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,922
a gubernatorial commission
to investigate

32
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:05,645
one, the causes of the riot,

33
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,275
two, the criminal activities
of those prisoners involved,

34
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,883
and three, the appropriateness
of the response to it by Warden Glynn.

35
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,799
Governor, who will the chair
the commission?

36
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,559
Well, l've just spoken to Alvah Case,

37
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,797
who's the dean of law school
at Kaufman-Ferber University.

38
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,481
He's agreed
to lead the investigation.

39
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,717
To my mind, there's no more
respected jurist in the state.

40
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,800
l can assure you his findings
will be fair and complete and impartial.

41
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,165
Fuck you, governor.

42
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,919
What, am l asking so much?

43
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,043
You want me
to come out on your side,

44
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,675
you wanna close down
Emerald City permanently,

45
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,236
you want me to say that the prisoners
are guilty of everything

46
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:42,797
and that you were totally justified
in bringing in the SORT team.

47
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,482
You want your hands clean
of the blood of those eight dead.

48
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,160
My hands are clean.

49
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,636
- My conscience is clear.
- Well, then, back off.

50
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,037
And let me do
what you appointed me to do.

51
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,118
Okay.

52
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,960
But keep one other thing in mind.

53
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:02,200
Marvin Suttle is stepping down
as state's attorney general.

54
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,245
l'm looking for just the right man
to replace him.

55
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,246
Come in, warden, we're done.

56
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,916
Find truth, Case,

57
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,000
because the truth shall set your fee.

58
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,196
Truth. What is the truth, Leo?

59
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,403
ls Devlin guilty?

60
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you?

61
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,957
Leo,

62
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,119
depending on what l do find,

63
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,755
you could be the one who gets fired.

64
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,479
Yeah.

65
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:43,481
You may be doing me
one huge fucking favour.

66
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,844
How's it hanging, Vern?

67
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,965
C.C., hello?

68
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,355
Yo, something fucked.

69
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,916
Oh, great. More Em City prags.

70
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,076
You fucks have a hissy fit,

71
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,238
now the rest of us
gotta sleep on top of each other.

72
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,238
Hear me, boys, and hear me good.

73
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:15,002
This is my cell, this is my bunk.

74
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,796
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

75
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,446
Feel like a candy star--

76
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,236
Hey. Hey, l'm talking to you.

77
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:27,638
Hey, either of you hear what happened
to Dobbins or Vahue?

78
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,160
- No.
- Shut the fuck up.

79
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,316
Were they in the hospital?

80
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,284
l was only in the ER.
l couldn't see into the ward.

81
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,438
- Shut the fuck up.
- How do you like your--?

82
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,245
Beecher!

83
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:37,840
Shut the fuck up.

84
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,486
- Tits. l don't care.
- Beecher!

85
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,036
How do you like your--?

86
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,276
Shut the fuck up.

87
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,563
Fuck.

88
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,126
Chill, little brother.

89
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,959
Who the fuck you calling
little brother, man?

90
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,162
Get off me, man.

91
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,759
- Get off.
- Get him off me.

92
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,040
Let me go!

93
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:12,801
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us now pray.

94
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,605
Please stand.

95
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,681
Lord,

96
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,998
we pray for the souls
of our friends and colleagues,

97
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,842
Officers Edward Hunt
and Anthony Nowakowski

98
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:31,205
and we pray for the souls
of the six prisoners who died as well.

99
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,722
You got a little brain damage there,
don't you?

100
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,845
We pray for the recovery
of Officers Joseph Mineo

101
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,965
and Jason Armstrong,
and for Tim McManus.

102
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,957
And Lord,

103
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,595
we ask your blessing on this place.

104
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,476
We ask for understanding.

105
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:59,717
We ask for patience.

106
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,557
We ask for the strength to forgive.

107
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,082
We ask to be forgiven.

108
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,807
l said no negotiations.

109
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,764
l say we cut off Em City's water
and electricity,

110
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,566
then tonight when they're sitting
in the dark, we fire tear gas.

111
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,046
What about the hostages?

112
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,959
- Hopefully, SORT will reach them.
- Hopefully?

113
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:24,279
So that we might renew ourselves
in this important work that we do.

114
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:27,516
Amen.

115
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,484
- Amen.
- Amen.

116
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,115
Blame is a beautiful thing, baby.

117
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:35,120
Blame keeps this whole planet
spinning.

118
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,763
You can point your finger
at the next man,

119
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,883
you can shift the weight onto him,

120
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,686
you don't have to carry that shit
around yourself.

121
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,760
You can slide into bed
and get a good night's nap.

122
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,244
Yeah, right.

123
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,518
Mr. McManus?

124
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,441
Mr. McManus.

125
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,279
Alvah Case.

126
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,756
Yes.

127
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,918
Our grand inquisitor.

128
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:12,846
- This is not an inquisition, sir.
- Bullshit.

129
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:17,000
Devlin's been trying to dismantle
Em City since the beginning.

130
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,317
This is his chance.

131
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,762
Leo told me you'd be tough.

132
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,760
He says you two
aren't always in agreement,

133
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,964
but he admires your vision,
your ideals.

134
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,561
What is it you want, exactly?

135
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,963
l wanna ask some questions.

136
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,197
l have nothing to say.

137
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,723
The governor is busy picking
the other members of the commission.

138
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:46,243
ln the meantime,
l'm doing some preliminary interviews.

139
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,796
l have nothing to say.

140
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,685
Look,

141
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,680
ultimately, it's going to be up to me
to decide

142
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,202
if Em City ever reopens.

143
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,677
l have nothing to say.

144
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:12,163
Minister Said?

145
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,523
Alvah Case.

146
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,485
l'm here to interview you
about the riot.

147
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:25,684
ls that interview, or interrogate?

148
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,361
l guess that depends
on what you're guilty of.

149
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,677
There was no riot.

150
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,485
Oh, really?

151
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,684
There was a righteous struggle
against repression and injustice.

152
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,803
Well, righteous or not,

153
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:42,882
there are still eight bodies
rotting in the morgue.

154
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,436
l grieve their deaths.

155
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:50,475
Do you mind?

156
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,285
Please.

157
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,444
l understand
that from the minute you came to Oz,

158
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,882
you started organizing
other Muslims?

159
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,436
Converting stone-cold killers,

160
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:07,646
all the while sowing seeds
of discontent.

161
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,879
- l spoke the truth.
- Then speak it now.

162
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:15,882
Oh, come on, Said,
you talk a good game about the truth.

163
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,403
But how come it doesn't include taking
responsibility for what you've done?

164
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,556
l didn't fire those rifles.

165
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,163
Did you create a set of circumstances
that caused the rifles to be fired?

166
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:27,637
The judicial system
created those circumstances, not l.

167
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,367
Your commission is a fraud, Case.

168
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,360
Governor Devlin, the one man
whose actions should be investigated,

169
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,405
is the man that appointed you.

170
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:40,242
That's like me getting to pick the jury
at my own trial.

171
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,915
Want to lick my balls?

172
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:13,006
Judge Fee and Mr. Balling will focus
on events leading up to the riot.

173
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,319
Bishop Callahan and Mr. Dodge will
deal with the behaviour of the inmates

174
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,364
and the staff during the riot.

175
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,563
Mrs. Eiduson and Dudley Fried.

176
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,605
will concentrate on their decision
to send the SORT team.

177
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,201
Mr. Case, how long do you estimate
the investigation will take?

178
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,959
Days? Weeks?

179
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,243
Well, it will take as long as it takes.

180
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,363
- ls it true that--?
- Who were the leaders?

181
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,483
- And you're?
- Augustus Hill.

182
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,956
Hill, Hill, Hill...

183
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,845
Hey, can l ask you a question?

184
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,759
Two prisoners
got released on the riot,

185
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,918
Eugene Dobbins, Jackson Vahue.

186
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,725
- Shut the fuck up.
- Somebody help him.

187
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,196
Dobbins was hurt pretty bad.
You know what happened to them?

188
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,881
My questions first, Hill.

189
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,958
So tell me,
in as many words as necessary,

190
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,004
what you think led to the riot.

191
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,920
Those men are violent.
All they know is violence.

192
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,238
The COs, man,
they treat us like shit.

193
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,398
Sometimes the inmates get bored.

194
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,684
They took away conjugals.
They took away smoking.

195
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,519
No, it's more than that.

196
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:25,441
You deny a man his freedom,
his family, his privacy, his dignity,

197
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:27,723
then all he has left
is time to simmer.

198
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,355
And eventually,
the simmer becomes a boil.

199
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,006
Said! Said!

200
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,000
We'd been hearing whispers that
the Muslims were gonna start trouble.

201
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,044
The Aryans are paranoid.

202
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,720
What caused the riot?

203
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,845
Two brain-dead, crackhead
motherfuckers playing checkers.

204
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:46,125
And then all of a sudden,
the world imploded.

205
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,517
Fucking cops.

206
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,598
We treated the hostages good.

207
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:51,756
They treated us like shit.

208
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,326
We tried to negotiate.

209
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,556
Their demands were ridiculous.

210
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,002
And then the lights went out.

211
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,160
There was tear gas.

212
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,396
Guns.

213
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,603
Tim McManus got shot in the chest.

214
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:07,237
l saw the side of Rodrigo's head
get blown off.

215
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:12,767
Hunt and Nowakowski
were both hit in the back.

216
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:15,043
What about Scott Ross?

217
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,004
What about him?

218
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:20,603
Well, according to the autopsy,
he was shot three times,

219
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:24,965
once in the head, once in the heart
and once in the testicles.

220
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,687
- Yeah?
- Well, it's curious.

221
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,839
Bullets flying randomly,
every which way

222
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:36,639
and he gets shot three times
in three very precise places?

223
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,559
Yeah, that's right.

224
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,480
They say curiosity killed the cat.

225
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,356
What the fuck was the cat
so curious about that got him killed?

226
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:07,806
Solitary sucks, man.

227
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,320
But if you really want
some company,

228
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,762
you just gotta go
through withdrawal.

229
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:24,758
l love you.

230
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,676
Just what l love.

231
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,246
My prison in lockdown

232
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,126
crawling with outside investigators
and TV cameras.

233
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:33,640
What are you afraid we'll find?

234
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,763
lt's not what you find,
it's the way you find it.

235
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,964
All these questions,
they stir things up.

236
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:42,085
And God knows, everyone's
stirred up enough right now.

237
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,685
Leo, who was Scott Ross?

238
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:46,996
Ross?

239
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:52,878
He was a biker, drug dealer,
three-strikes lifer. Why?

240
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:54,241
Oh, l'm not sure yet,

241
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,402
but Ross may have been murdered.

242
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,035
- What?
- During the SORT team's attack,

243
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,196
he may have been killed.

244
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,880
Deliberately.

245
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,003
What makes you think that?

246
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,762
He was shot three times,
almost execution-style.

247
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,363
And the bullets in Ross' body
were 9 mm's,

248
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,837
not double-oughts,
which were in the SORT rifles.

249
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,601
The SORT team uses 9 mm's
in their handgun.

250
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,997
- Right.
- So SORT team member A,

251
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,635
he enters the common room
in Em City, lowers his rifle.

252
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,286
Ross comes at him
from out of the dark,

253
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,005
he raises his handgun, fires.

254
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,885
That's not murder.

255
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:33,403
You throw a bullet in someone's brain,
you pretty much figure he's done.

256
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,080
Maybe he shot him
in the heart first,

257
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,726
or the balls,
and Ross just kept coming.

258
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,639
Yeah, but the bullet from Ross' brain

259
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,322
was in the wall below
the command centre by a TV set.

260
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:45,320
And the one that went through his
heart was embedded in the floor.

261
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,443
So unless he died falling upwards...

262
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,598
lt's murder.

263
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,406
Come on, head up. Head up.

264
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:54,796
ln all that chaos,

265
00:16:54,967 --> 00:17:00,325
what a perfect chance to off Ross
and get away with it, scot-free.

266
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,237
That's him over there.

267
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,443
Officer Heim.

268
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:23,441
The bullets that killed Ross
came from the same box

269
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,246
as the ones
that you put in your handgun.

270
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:28,159
So?

271
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,558
So your gun was used to kill Ross.

272
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:36,402
Yet you don't mention
firing at him in your report.

273
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,920
l didn't.

274
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,043
Then who did?

275
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:41,959
l don't know.

276
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,883
Did you hand your gun
to someone?

277
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,878
No.

278
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:55,086
Was it in your holster
when you entered Em City?

279
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:58,398
- Yes.
- And then?

280
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,086
lt disappeared.

281
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,807
Did you feel anyone take it?

282
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:08,643
No. Things were crazy in there,
you know? Happening pretty fast.

283
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,242
So you're telling me

284
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:15,922
that someone lifted the handgun
out of your holster

285
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,442
without you knowing.

286
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,596
That's right.

287
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:24,443
Well, how come you didn't mention
that little ditty in your report?

288
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,235
Because l found it on the floor.

289
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,155
Officer Heim,

290
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:37,242
do l look like
a stupid fucking idiot to you?

291
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,399
No, sir.

292
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,842
Then cut the shit.

293
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:46,556
You SORT guys love your weapons
more than pussy.

294
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,195
You'd die
before letting anyone take it

295
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:53,121
and you'd sure as Christ
know it was gone.

296
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,082
Who are you covering for, huh?

297
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:07,483
Scott Ross was a lowlife scum fuck,

298
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,196
just like all those other scum fucks
in there.

299
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,200
They hurt Armstrong and Mineo.

300
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:18,326
Because of them,
Hunt and Nowakowski died.

301
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,239
Are you seriously
going after some CO

302
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,877
because they whacked
a fucking pig like Ross?

303
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,805
Who the fuck's side are you on?

304
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,878
The law.

305
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:32,766
l'm on the law's side.

306
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:38,040
Now you can go.

307
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,004
Thank you.

308
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,326
l never lie.

309
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,886
Not because l'm so honest,

310
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,003
but because l have a bad memory.

311
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,284
And you can't be a good liar
if you got a bad memory.

312
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:04,323
Wangler, you okay?

313
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,160
l need some tits, help me.

314
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,841
Tits is the last thing you need, man.

315
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,806
Hey. Come on, wake up.

316
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,639
- Get up for a second.
- No.

317
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,240
- Come on, man.
- No, fuck you.

318
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,635
Suck my cock, man.

319
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,798
Come on, man, suck my cock.

320
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:33,721
- Come on, man. Suck my cock, prag.
- Fuck you.

321
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:37,436
- All right. All right.
- Get up. Let's go.

322
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,677
Come on.

323
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:43,237
- What the fuck, man. Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

324
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,956
Come on. Come on, bitch. Let's go.

325
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:50,845
Yeah.

326
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,999
Oh, yeah.

327
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,238
lt's all right. lt's okay, it's okay.

328
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:31,003
- You still on the job?
- Yeah.

329
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,600
So are you.

330
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,725
Well, we had
a couple incidents tonight.

331
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,605
Anything l should know about?

332
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,280
No.

333
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,919
What are you doing in here?

334
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,682
l'm trying to figure
this Ross thing through.

335
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:52,238
There were six hostages left
when the SORT team attacked.

336
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:58,164
McManus, Wittlesey, Mukada,
D'Agnasti, Hunt and Nowakowski.

337
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:01,046
Now, Hunt and Nowakowski died

338
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,767
during the first moments
of the assault.

339
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,441
And McManus was shot,

340
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,519
so there's less of a chance
that he killed Ross.

341
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:13,043
What makes you so sure
it was a CO? Why not a prisoner?

342
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,596
Ross wasn't exactly beloved
by his fellow inmates.

343
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,235
That was my first thought,

344
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:21,717
that someone used the opportunity
to take revenge on the guy.

345
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,845
But after talking with Officer Heim,

346
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:28,966
who, by the way, Leo,
is lying through his teeth,

347
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:31,925
l realized
he'd never cover for a con.

348
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,117
He's protecting one of his own.

349
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,402
D'Agnasti.

350
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,797
Or Wittlesey.

351
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,559
Or Mukada.

352
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,843
Alvah, stop.

353
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,601
Father Mukada wasn't involved.

354
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,883
You never know.

355
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,123
How did Ross treat everyone?

356
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,643
He was a condescending little prick.

357
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,038
Did he do any harm
to you personally, physically?

358
00:22:58,207 --> 00:22:59,196
No.

359
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,756
What about Officers Wittlesey
or D'Agnasti?

360
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,202
l don't remember.

361
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,803
l'd been beaten pretty badly.
And l was...

362
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,276
...terrified.

363
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,481
Anything else you remember?

364
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,444
My nose itched.

365
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:21,202
But because our hands were tied
behind us, l couldn't scratch.

366
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,846
Stand in a straight line.

367
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:26,158
When they come in,
you get hit first.

368
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,238
Through it all,

369
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,524
through the tear gas
and the gunfire

370
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:35,077
and the fear
and the adrenaline in overdrive,

371
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,637
the only thing l could think of was:

372
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:42,083
Christ, would someone please
scratch my nose?

373
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:46,877
Tits! l need some tits, some diesel.

374
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,483
- Man, shut the fuck up!
- Hey, fat fuck.

375
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,445
Did you hear anything
about Dobbins and Vahue?

376
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:55,837
l'm asking you a ques--
D'Agnasti.

377
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:58,475
- l need some tits.
- No.

378
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,797
Thank you.

379
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:02,962
- You junkie fuck.
- Shit.

380
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:04,924
- Shut the fuck up.
- Kiss my ass.

381
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,805
- l'll kick the shit out of you.
- D'Agnasti.

382
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,844
D'Agnasti. D'Agnasti.

383
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:11,396
- Who that?
- Can l ask you a few more questions?

384
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,639
- l'm working here.
- l'll be brief.

385
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:21,205
All of the hostages
were bound, right?

386
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:24,564
- Hands behind your back with rope.
- Yeah.

387
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,001
When did you get free?

388
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,078
Sometime after
the shooting stopped.

389
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,125
Who tied you up?
Which prisoners in particular?

390
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:32,686
Scott Ross.

391
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,441
Settle down, Wangler.

392
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,762
You didn't like Ross.

393
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,805
- What was there to like?
- Tits.

394
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,356
Shut the fuck up.

395
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,798
- Pretty quiet.
- What?

396
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,276
Well, compared to your
last assignment at Emerald City,

397
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:54,597
this is pretty quiet.

398
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:57,715
Whoa, can l help you?

399
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,684
Yeah, l'm here to see my husband,
Billy Kempf.

400
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:01,360
l'm sorry, ma'am, we're in lockdown.

401
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:04,280
No, no, no.
Okay, l drove 31 2 miles.

402
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:08,440
Look. Look, it says l'm supposed
to see Billy Kempf today.

403
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,598
Well, we had a riot here.
Maybe you heard about it?

404
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,361
Fuck, yes, l heard about it. l also heard
the fucking thing was over.

405
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,563
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, so then, you let me see Billy.

406
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:16,876
You won't be seeing him today.

407
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,005
- You don't get it. l drove 31 2 miles--
- Can l help you with anything else?

408
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,284
- Yes, you can open the fucking gate--
- Can l help you with anything else?

409
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,756
l don't have to stand
for this bullshit, okay?

410
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:27,758
Who the fuck do you think you are?
l drove 31 2--

411
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,201
This is bullshit!

412
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,278
- Wow.
- Stop fucking touching me like that.

413
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,280
Maybe it's not so quiet after all.

414
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:37,359
Now, Diane, what happened

415
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:40,405
from the point
the SORT team entered Em City?

416
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,517
- l told you this already.
- l know.

417
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:48,885
Dumb-ass me, l lost my notebook.

418
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:56,400
Well, the tear gas
made it hard to see.

419
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,001
Tim McManus and l,
we ducked behind a column.

420
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,443
We heard gunfire
for what seemed like forever

421
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:04,359
and then silence.

422
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,119
We thought it was over.

423
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:08,084
Tim leaned out and he got shot.

424
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:11,080
- He fell to the floor?
- Yes.

425
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,317
And you...?

426
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:19,243
l cradled him in my arms
until help arrived.

427
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:21,796
What kind of prisoner
was Scott Ross?

428
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:26,165
What kind?

429
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:28,477
Model? Trouble?

430
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:30,160
Average.

431
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,922
You and me, we're joined at the hip.

432
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:36,840
And ain't nothing
you can do about that.

433
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,436
Thank you. Thank you.

434
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:45,719
You ask most people
and they'll tell you lying is wrong

435
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:49,084
and then immediately go out
and lie like a motherfucker.

436
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,600
But that's cool.

437
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,803
We all know

438
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,606
lies are necessary.

439
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,156
- Yes, l was talking to them yesterday.
- What'd they say?

440
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,921
They say Tim will be out
of Benchley Memorial next week.

441
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,875
Oh, jeez. l feel terrible.
l've only been to see him once.

442
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,356
- Hey.
- Hi.

443
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,041
This guy Case,
has he been talking to you?

444
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,597
- Yeah, he interviewed me yesterday.
- Yeah, me too.

445
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,166
Did he ask about me?

446
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:21,643
Not in particular, no.

447
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,320
Okay.

448
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,041
Hey, Jackson.

449
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:39,243
You okay, man?

450
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:41,766
How's Dobbins?

451
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:46,005
He's dead, man. He died.

452
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,125
Fuck.

453
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,598
There you are.

454
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,598
- You've been looking for me?
- Everywhere.

455
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,884
Balling and l have been trying to meet
with you. What have you been doing?

456
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,926
- l've been working this murder angle.
- Oh, Christ.

457
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,726
Alvah, forget about that.

458
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,115
Really.

459
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,960
You don't wanna concern yourself
with things like that.

460
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,642
Believe me,
you're looking in the wrong direction.

461
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,765
Well, it's all part of the story, judge.

462
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:23,316
lt's all part of the story.

463
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,764
Well, we've sedated Adebisi
pretty heavily.

464
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:33,838
He should be out
for a couple hours.

465
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:37,044
Good. l could use a break anyway.

466
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,767
And how about you?
You ever take ten minutes?

467
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,122
- Sure.
- Good.

468
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,642
Can l buy you a cup of coffee?

469
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,356
- l don't think so.
- Why not?

470
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,961
You make me nervous.

471
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:52,401
Who, me?

472
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,558
Listen, l'm the sweetest guy
on the planet.

473
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:56,399
Ask my mother.

474
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,364
Yeah, well, if we went out
for coffee together,

475
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:02,964
l wouldn't be sure
if you were interrogating me or--

476
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:05,436
- Dr. Nathan, l swear,
- What?

477
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:08,075
l'm far less devious than you think.

478
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,363
l'm a college professor,
for Pete's sake.

479
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:14,805
- l give lectures, l grade papers.
- You train lawyers.

480
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,685
Yes.

481
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:21,840
Okay, l'll stop being adorable
and just ask my questions.

482
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:38,356
Mr. Robson, your glans,

483
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,404
the tip of your penis
has been severed.

484
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,603
How's your dick, man?

485
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:47,437
--dick bit off.

486
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,315
Severed. Severed. Severed.

487
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:57,556
How's it feel?

488
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,566
Weird.

489
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,320
Oh, shit.

490
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:32,886
Get the fuck away from me!

491
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,116
- Hey!
- Get off me!

492
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:36,278
Get the fuck off me. Get off me.
Get them off me.

493
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:39,325
- Another junkie asshole spiralling out.
- Get the fuck off me.

494
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:40,681
Hey, take it easy.

495
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,917
The public outcry
against Governor Devlin's decision

496
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,237
to use force
at Oswald remains high,

497
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:48,638
even as a gubernatorial commission
searches for answers.

498
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,479
Guys, help me out, here.

499
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,239
What the fuck is taking so long?

500
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,921
You want this done right or fast?

501
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,725
Both.

502
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,559
l want you to hold
another press conference,

503
00:30:58,727 --> 00:30:59,842
give them an update.

504
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:01,156
l'm tired of saying,
''Be patient,''

505
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,522
and l'm tired of telling them
l have absolute faith in you,

506
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,166
because frankly, l don't.

507
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,316
We'd be moving a lot faster

508
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:09,047
if Alvah could just stay focused
on the big picture.

509
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:10,242
What do you mean?

510
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:12,796
He's trying to solve a murder
that for all we know isn't murder.

511
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,559
- lt's a murder.
- Well, if it is,

512
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:16,524
it is only a small part
of our overall mission.

513
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:20,202
l disagree. l think it's endemic
of the whole problem here at Oz.

514
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,846
You are so full of shit.

515
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:22,996
Well, you know, Benji,

516
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:26,159
given the last three decisions
you've handed down from the bench,

517
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:27,726
you're the expert on full of shit.

518
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,798
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Don't fuck with me.

519
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:31,161
Guys, guys. For God's sake.

520
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,557
- That's fine, forget it. l'll resign.
- No, l'll resign.

521
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,558
No one is resigning.

522
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,400
Last thing l need is the media to hear
the commission itself is fighting.

523
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,478
Now, everybody,
back to your corners.

524
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,399
- And back to work.
- Yeah, right.

525
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,798
The sooner we get this done,
the happier we'll all be.

526
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,441
Sweet dreams, motherfucker.

527
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,685
Dr. Nathan.

528
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:47,002
Doctor, you know, the last time
l had a woman tie me down like this,

529
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,361
l married her.

530
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,963
Well, if she kept you like that,
you might still be married.

531
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:53,958
l feel good.

532
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,560
You can let me go now.

533
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:56,842
No. Before that happens,

534
00:33:57,007 --> 00:34:00,477
you, Sister Marie and l
need to spend a little time together.

535
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,005
All right.

536
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:09,035
Hey, doctor, my dick is hard.

537
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,276
ls that good?

538
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,403
You tell me.

539
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:30,565
What are you looking for?

540
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,639
Your impressions of Ross.

541
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:36,640
- You're a teacher, right?
- l used to be.

542
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:41,278
Now that l'm a dean, l spend less
and less time in the classroom.

543
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,358
You know how teachers get
favourite students sometimes?

544
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,836
- Get a real affection for them?
- Oh, yeah.

545
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,646
l couldn't wait
for Ross to leave the office.

546
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,798
Did he frighten you?

547
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:55,199
That, and he had
a terrible hygiene problem.

548
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:58,962
Did he ever mention
having a sexual relationship

549
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:00,276
with anyone on the staff?

550
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:01,436
As you'll see in the files,

551
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:04,679
he said a lot of things.
He was a compulsive liar.

552
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:07,998
- Do you ever counsel staff members?
- Sure.

553
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:11,239
Did anyone ever talk of Ross?
l mean, negatively?

554
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:13,967
- Sure.
- Who?

555
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:15,685
Everybody.

556
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,003
Can you be a little more specific?

557
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,603
Come on. You know a nun
doesn't reveal a confidence.

558
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:24,838
You're not a priest.

559
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:28,556
The silence of the confessional
doesn't apply here.

560
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,682
As a psychologist, it does.

561
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:36,806
Then we may have to let a court
determine that.

562
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,117
Well, that's fine.

563
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,085
l want those files back
when you're through with them.

564
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,206
Anything else?

565
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:47,640
No.

566
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,519
Ryan O'Reily.

567
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:54,359
Yo, yo, that's me, man.

568
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,882
Vehicular manslaughter,

569
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,083
reckless endangerment,

570
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:02,478
possession of controlled substances,
possession of a deadly weapon,

571
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,956
violation of parole.

572
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:06,606
That's an amazing list of crimes.

573
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,361
Yeah, well, you know,
l applied myself.

574
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,519
Still, l mean,
even with all those talents,

575
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:15,918
you must have had a hard time
adjusting to life in Oz.

576
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,315
No.

577
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:20,923
- l can take care of myself.
- Yeah, l can see that.

578
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,281
But how?

579
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:26,121
l'm like
the Lord of the fucking Dance.

580
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:29,199
- l got moves.
- Yeah, l bet you do.

581
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,517
Of all the guys that led the riot,

582
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,201
you were the only one
with no firepower behind you.

583
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:38,155
Yet the others included you
in all the decision-making.

584
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,363
l had nothing to do with the riot.

585
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:46,123
- Oh, l guess l was misinformed.
- l guess you were.

586
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:51,407
Like l heard, from what l thought
was a reliable source,

587
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:56,357
that you and Ross were close.

588
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,483
Close? No.

589
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,524
You and he were lovers.

590
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:03,524
Now, who the fuck told you that?

591
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,645
Ross poured his heart out
to Sister Peter Marie.

592
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,640
Hey, look, l'm no fag, pal.

593
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:14,198
But if l were, l wouldn't put my dick
anywhere near Ross' scumhole.

594
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,040
That cocksucker would fuck anything
on two or four legs.

595
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:20,563
Yeah, what about the COs?
Has Ross ever fucked one of them?

596
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,598
How about some help
getting me out of this place?

597
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:28,522
Sorry, you're not going anyplace
until the investigation is over.

598
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,839
Well, then, how about a cigarette?

599
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:38,679
This is good.

600
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:40,485
When l'm done puffing on this,

601
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,480
l can suck
on my own secondhand smoke.

602
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:44,966
So?

603
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:50,242
Ross had a thing for Wittlesey.

604
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,045
Yeah?

605
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:53,401
Yeah.

606
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:56,320
He claimed they knew each other
on the outside. Makes sense.

607
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:59,081
They were always sneaking off
and whispering to each other.

608
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:03,718
What's the matter?

609
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,526
This guy Case,
he gives me the creeps.

610
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,166
Why?

611
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,204
You got nothing to worry about.

612
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:14,042
He'll do his enquiry, he'll be gone.

613
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:17,358
- Yep.
- Right?

614
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,485
Yeah, l guess.

615
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,963
They also say if you repeat a lie
often enough,

616
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,560
it becomes the truth.

617
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:30,515
Or at least, you convince yourself
it's the fucking gospel.

618
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:35,317
You run the Aryan Brotherhood,
Mr. Schillinger?

619
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:36,476
l used to.

620
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,480
- You have a parole date coming up.
- Yeah.

621
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:41,603
Think you got a chance
at getting out?

622
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,399
l hope so.

623
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:46,405
My sons need me.

624
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:52,241
Well, l'd be happy to put a letter
of recommendation in your file.

625
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,638
- lf l help you out.
- That's right.

626
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:57,798
Scott Ross.

627
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,242
Poor son of a bitch.

628
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,999
So you were friends?

629
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:09,877
Did he ever mention having any kind
of a sexual relationship

630
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,163
with Officer Wittlesey?

631
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:17,162
Sure. Ross and Wittlesey's ex
were in the same bike club.

632
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:19,363
Ross said...

633
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,404
...he nailed her
behind her hubby's back.

634
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,035
But then again, Ross was sometimes
a lying sack of shit.

635
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:26,721
So who knows if it's true?

636
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,117
Did anything go on
between the two of them

637
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:31,039
since he came to Oz?

638
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,563
According to Ross,
he was banging her pretty regular.

639
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,002
You think
he was lying about that?

640
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,485
Probably.

641
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,599
Thank you for getting me permission
to come to the library.

642
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,644
Lockdowns can be boring
with nothing to read.

643
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,399
Oh, no problem.

644
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:53,446
They tell me you know everything
that goes on in Oz.

645
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:54,881
They exaggerate.

646
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,515
Do you have any idea,
if anything, what transpired

647
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,157
between Officer Wittlesey
and Scott Ross?

648
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,557
- Cigarettes.
- l beg your pardon?

649
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,479
Cigarettes was what was going on
between them.

650
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:08,002
Wittlesey smuggled them in,
a carton a day.

651
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,361
She gave them to Ross to sell.

652
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,485
Everything was going smoothly
till McManus found out.

653
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:15,923
He made Wittlesey
shut down the operation.

654
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:18,442
So Ross hated McManus for that.

655
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:22,917
And because Wittlesey and McManus
started sleeping together.

656
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:33,316
Hey, got a cigarette?

657
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:39,086
You know, why would you?
Ross is dead.

658
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,679
lt's funny, you know,

659
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,645
what a guy can see with one eye.

660
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:48,959
ln the dark, through the tear gas.

661
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:50,958
Don't worry.

662
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,403
l didn't tell that nigger Case
a fucking thing.

663
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:56,762
So, what do you want from me?

664
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:02,082
Well, l got a parole hearing
coming up.

665
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:07,359
l think maybe the best thing for you
would be for me to be out of here.

666
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,280
So you think Wittlesey killed Ross?

667
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,597
She had motive, opportunity.

668
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,280
l've known Diane for years.

669
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:22,041
Don't walk in here
and talk about motive and opportunity.

670
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,401
Give me some evidence.

671
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,683
Well, in the heat of the riot,
maybe she just lost it.

672
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:28,884
No. No, it had to be a more
specific reason than that.

673
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,520
Ross had to have done something
at that moment

674
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:35,678
to get her to pull that trigger.

675
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:40,806
Hello?

676
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,242
Yeah, okay. Okay.

677
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:48,244
Officer down in ad seg
says a prisoner wants to talk to you.

678
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,601
Which one?

679
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,485
Tobias Beecher.

680
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,356
Hey, chief.

681
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:06,162
You asked to see me?

682
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,356
l got a secret.

683
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,040
About?

684
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:16,884
Scott Ross.

685
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:18,719
Tell me.

686
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:22,402
lf l tell you, it won't be a secret.

687
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:27,437
Would you excuse us, please?

688
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:34,921
Okay?

689
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:40,564
l bit the tip off a guy's penis.

690
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,638
So l heard.

691
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:46,202
You're not afraid?

692
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,881
Well, l've got my pants on.

693
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:55,366
l used to be a lawyer,
you know that?

694
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,522
Went to Harvard.

695
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,564
So did l.

696
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:05,884
Crimson.

697
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,237
l've been under a lot of stress lately.

698
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:15,638
l haven't been behaving very nicely.

699
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:18,640
Like this biting thing.

700
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:25,077
But l'm using my time in here
to turn my head around.

701
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:35,405
When l get out of here,
l'm gonna be a better person.

702
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:43,203
Because, like, this whole biting thing
just isn't working for me, you know?

703
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,365
So as a sign
that l'm on the straight and narrow,

704
00:43:51,887 --> 00:43:54,447
l'm gonna tell you my little secret.

705
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:56,279
And then,

706
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,677
l'll be on the road back, right?

707
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:01,406
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:08,076
l saw the shots fired.

709
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,637
Which shots?

710
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:14,241
Check the bullets.

711
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,280
The bullets that killed Ross?

712
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,846
No.

713
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:24,678
Check the bullets in McManus.

714
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:32,286
Hey.

715
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:47,322
McManus wasn't shot
with a 9 mm

716
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,398
from a SORT team handgun.

717
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:53,162
The striations show
he was hit with a 9 mm,

718
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,637
probably from a Glock
or a Sig Sauer.

719
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,160
Sig Sauer?

720
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:02,240
Well, we know there was a Sig Sauer
in Em City during the riot.

721
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,159
Whose was it?

722
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,283
Kareem Said.

723
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,922
You shot Tim McManus.

724
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:18,601
- No.
- Well, if you didn't, who did?

725
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:19,961
l don't know.

726
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:21,879
You had a Sig Sauer
in your possession.

727
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,958
Now, if l say yes,
that's another nail in my coffin.

728
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:27,244
- l look like a fool to you?
- Are you comfortable here, Said?

729
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:28,726
Because you know it's up to me

730
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:32,197
when and if you get out
of solitary confinement.

731
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,643
Now, l know how important it is for you
to be among your people,

732
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,763
leading, guiding, nurturing them.

733
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:42,398
That's gonna be hard to do
through 8 tons of steel.

734
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,161
You're an academic, right?

735
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:49,245
You know about hypotheses
and theories, right?

736
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,556
Well, theoretically speaking,

737
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:56,002
if l had a gun
when the SORT team entered,

738
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,395
here's what might have happened.

739
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,445
l might have been
underneath the control panel

740
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,598
at the command station
holding that gun

741
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:06,396
when a SORT team member came in
and started to beat me.

742
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:09,081
And in not wanting to kill anybody,

743
00:46:10,527 --> 00:46:13,166
l might have thrown that gun
over the side.

744
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:16,524
Where someone else picked it up?

745
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:21,317
Theoretically speaking, yes.

746
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:25,606
l know you got nothing to say to me,

747
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:27,644
but l have a couple of things
to say to you.

748
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:31,004
First, you've got balls.

749
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,239
You voluntarily went into Em City
to negotiate the release

750
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,921
of the injured officers
and Diane Wittlesey.

751
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,476
You traded yourself
for Armstrong and Mineo,

752
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:44,198
putting yourself into what can only be
called a jackpot situation.

753
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:48,963
Especially knowing that you'd fall
into the hands of Scott Ross,

754
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,436
a man you despised.

755
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:55,441
How ironic is it then,
that he was the one who shot you?

756
00:46:56,687 --> 00:46:59,076
- Any last words?
- Suck my dick.

757
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:03,885
Who told you?

758
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,560
That Ross was the one
who shot you?

759
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,605
- Yeah.
- You just did.

760
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:21,882
You know,
Oz is just like anyplace else.

761
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:26,563
Everybody loves to gossip
about everybody else.

762
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:30,356
- Not me.
- Oh, but they gossip about you.

763
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:35,396
Well, maybe it's because
you're one of the few women around.

764
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:39,446
Maybe it's because
there's truth to the rumours.

765
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,565
Like, for example,

766
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:48,484
that you were smuggling cigarettes in
that Ross could sell.

767
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:52,196
And that you and McManus
had an affair.

768
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:54,483
Are you accusing me of something?

769
00:47:54,647 --> 00:47:56,399
Yes.

770
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,204
Yes, l am.

771
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,720
You killed Scott Ross.

772
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,885
Me? How did l do that?

773
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,686
Ross picked up Said's gun.

774
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,317
He fired into McManus' chest.

775
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:18,560
You took Officer Heim's pistol
and shot Ross.

776
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:24,923
That's not possible.
My hands were tied behind my back.

777
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,396
No they weren't.

778
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,445
You managed to loose the binds
before it all came down.

779
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:35,522
You told me that after McManus fell
to the ground,

780
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:42,525
you, quote, ''l cradled him in my arms,''
end quote.

781
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:51,843
How could you cradle him
with your arms behind your back?

782
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,646
- Have you ever been in a riot?
- No.

783
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,718
You have to understand
what's involved.

784
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:02,358
The idea of being a hostage,
the mob mentality.

785
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:03,801
You get carried away.

786
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,765
You stop being human.
You become part of something else.

787
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,004
l have made every mistake there is.

788
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,886
l've fallen in love
with the wrong men,

789
00:49:16,047 --> 00:49:17,685
l had a baby out of wedlock.

790
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:20,486
l drank too much,
l snorted too much.

791
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:23,639
l have done things to make money,
including this job,

792
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,206
which make me dread
getting out of bed.

793
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,722
But each time, l made the choice.

794
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:30,799
l chose to drink, l chose to stop.

795
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,800
When my husband got abusive,
l chose to walk.

796
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:37,403
l refuse to be anybody's victim.

797
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:41,198
These mistakes l've have made,
they are a part of me.

798
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:43,483
They are like my skin.

799
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:48,719
And l do not regret what l've done.
Do you hear me?

800
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,560
No regrets, no remorse.

801
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:53,877
l just keep going.

802
00:49:58,407 --> 00:50:01,717
- What are you gonna do?
- When l know, you'll know.

803
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:08,763
She has a young daughter,
a mother in and out of chemo.

804
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:10,440
So what, Leo? So what?

805
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,120
So if you expose the truth,

806
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:14,676
you destroy this woman's life
and her daughter's.

807
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,599
And for what? Scott fucking Ross?

808
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:17,756
Come on, Alvah, please.

809
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:19,804
What do you want me to say, Leo?

810
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:23,198
Just say that Ross died
like the others,

811
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,198
from bullets fired by a member
of the SORT team

812
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:27,801
in the performance of his duty.

813
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,037
l just read the preliminary draught
of your report.

814
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,437
- Yeah, what's wrong?
- You recommend not filing charges

815
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:34,006
against Said
and the other riot leaders?

816
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:37,045
From a legal standpoint,
the evidence is circumstantial.

817
00:50:37,207 --> 00:50:39,004
From a moral standpoint,
it's laughable.

818
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:42,318
l want those bastards on trial,
on TV.

819
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:43,966
Look, governor, as far as l can see,

820
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:47,483
whatever they did came about
as a direct result of your actions.

821
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:48,636
You've exonerated me.

822
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:52,163
Oh, yeah, your commission behaved
like good little boys,

823
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:54,079
but you can't have it both ways.

824
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:58,126
lf the prisoners are guilty,
so are you.

825
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:05,040
This is not the kind of attitude l expect
from an attorney general.

826
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:07,437
Yeah, well,

827
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,121
l've thought about it.

828
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:13,404
l don't wanna be attorney general.

829
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:15,842
l wanna be governor.

830
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,645
What?

831
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:21,083
l'll see you on the campaign trail,
Devlin.

832
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:26,321
Now, l've got
a press conference to do.

833
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:39,435
lt is the considered opinion
of this commission

834
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:41,518
that though the riot itself

835
00:51:41,687 --> 00:51:46,556
and the deaths
that followed are tragic,

836
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:49,480
no one in particular is at fault.

837
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:51,842
lf no one is at fault,
who's responsible for the--?

838
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,601
We do feel
that there are certain measures

839
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:58,362
that can be taken to ensure

840
00:51:58,527 --> 00:52:03,123
that an event like this
does not happen again.

841
00:52:16,607 --> 00:52:18,040
Bitch.

842
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,363
So as it turns out,

843
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,525
no one was to blame for the riot.

844
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:35,160
ln fact, if no one was to blame,
that means nothing bad happened.

845
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,837
Nothing at all happened.

846
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,875
So life can pretty much go on
as it has before.

847
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,641
Yeah, right.
