1
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,751
Oz... the name
on the street

2
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:58,424
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

3
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,160
level four.

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
You may have heard
on the news

5
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,331
that we've been having
a little...

6
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,929
tension around here.

7
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,462
Well, after
14 fun-filled days

8
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:08,906
of sitting in your cells

9
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,409
smelling your
roomie's farts,

10
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,071
a man is ready
to forgive everybody

11
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,807
for everything,

12
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:16,145
just to come up
for air.

13
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,859
Attention, the following
will step out of their pods:

14
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:42,466
93A234, Adebisi;

15
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,412
97 A622, Arif;

16
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:52,407
97 S444, Said;

17
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,910
99P334, Pinkerton;

18
00:02:55,956 --> 00:03:00,416
95B327, Bismilla;

19
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,725
85T61 2, Tyrell;

20
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:07,995
95W856, Wolf;

21
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:12,698
and 88A578, Ahmad.

22
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,105
Get in line
behind officer Howard.

23
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:22,107
All right, that's it,
move it along.

24
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,013
Let's go.
Move it along.

25
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,109
What the fuck
is going on?

26
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:29,053
What do you mean?

27
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,853
They're taking
all the niggers.

28
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,324
All right, quiet.

29
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,995
l said quiet!

30
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,970
Shut up now!

31
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,817
For the past two weeks,

32
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,787
we have been
in 24-hour lockdown.

33
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,652
Now l'm not gonna go
into the specifics

34
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,749
as to what caused
this situation.

35
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,851
You know it.

36
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:12,490
l've brought you together
to say this:

37
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,763
When the lockdown ends

38
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:19,238
depends on you.

39
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,263
lt is my intention
to put this prison

40
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,503
back on a routine schedule.

41
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,306
But hear me good,

42
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,007
if there is
one single incident

43
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,107
of race-related violence,

44
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,380
l will lock you
away again,

45
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,910
black and white,

46
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,980
24-7,

47
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:41,187
for the rest
of your fucking lives.

48
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:49,599
See?

49
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,434
All that shit you talk
ain't gonna do nothing.

50
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:56,033
Be patient, Kenny,
l have a plan.

51
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,609
ls Glynn
fucking crazy?

52
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:02,740
This ain't over.

53
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,273
l know, the niggers
are up to something.

54
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:06,842
And so with
order restored,

55
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,945
Warden Leo Glynn
has ended the lockdown.

56
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,081
ln a related story,

57
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:11,647
the wife of
inmate Hamid Khan

58
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,283
has won a State
Supreme Court ruling

59
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,726
to have her husband
removed from life support.

60
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,491
Khan, who was serving
a 10-year sentence

61
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,690
for aggravated assault,

62
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,723
went into a coma after
being hit in the head

63
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,530
during a prison
boxing match.

64
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,730
McManus wants
to see you.

65
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,534
The family's in
with Khan now

66
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,006
saying their
final farewells.

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,340
And they've asked that you
say a prayer over the body,

68
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,642
- Just before the end.
- Bearing in mind

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,944
what happened
between Khan and l...

70
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,785
l'm honored
they asked for me.

71
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,264
With Brother Khan gone,

72
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,270
we'll need
someone to lead us.

73
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,072
l bet l know who
you have in mind.

74
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,838
Yourself.

75
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,315
Yes.

76
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,615
But l need
to know, Said,

77
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,621
will you oppose me?

78
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,486
No, Arif.

79
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,822
l've lost the taste.

80
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,953
- The taste?
- For power.

81
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,327
l hope you use yours
more wisely than l did.

82
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,731
Let's go.

83
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:05,303
The man l hit,

84
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,008
is he getting better?

85
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,170
Yeah, he'll be fucking
fine in about 10 minutes.

86
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:16,182
Now go to sleep,
Cyril. now.

87
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,321
Oh, Allah, forgive him
and have mercy upon him.

88
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,056
Give him peace
and pardon him.

89
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:11,034
- What do you want?
- You killed me, Cyril.

90
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:17,133
- l didn't mean to.
- Then what about him?

91
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,307
Who is that?

92
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,338
lt's Preston Nathan,
Gloria's husband.

93
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:26,910
We're never gonna
leave you, Cyril.

94
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:30,013
We're gonna be right here
inside your head forever.

95
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,854
For all eternity.

96
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:48,330
Cyril, Cyril, shh,
hey, hey, hey!

97
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:49,602
Wake up!
Wake up!

98
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:51,940
Shh... shh.

99
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,746
Shh, it's all right.
Shh.

100
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,689
My brother Cyril,
you know,

101
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,123
He keeps on having
those terrible nightmares.

102
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,684
The valium is not
helping him to sleep?

103
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,697
No. We gotta try
something else.

104
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,394
As l said before,
the nightmares are rooted in his guilt

105
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,665
- for causing those deaths.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,867
And the cure
for your brother

107
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,670
is to alleviate
his guilt.

108
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,506
And, in the case
of Hamid Khan,

109
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,705
l'm not even sure
that's possible.

110
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,613
However, with
Gloria Nathan's husband--

111
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,277
l'll do anything.
Anything.

112
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,878
You heard about
the interaction program l started?

113
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,650
Victims and/or
victims' families

114
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,590
Sit down with the person
who hurt them and talk.

115
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:43,585
- Talk about what?
- Their feelings, their anger, whatever.

116
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,225
And, the guilty person
gets a chance

117
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,030
to express remorse.

118
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,195
Yeah, okay.

119
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:54,206
- Yeah, sign Cyril up for that program.
- Wait a minute,

120
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,209
- Both of you.
- What?

121
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,733
l am not about
to ask Gloria

122
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,643
and Preston's parents
to join us

123
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,376
unless you both
participate.

124
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,213
Hey, l got
no problem with that.

125
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:13,058
No, absolutely not.

126
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,186
l can't even be in the same room
with the O'Reily brothers.

127
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,787
lt makes
my skin crawl.

128
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,856
This is a chance
to put the past to rest.

129
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,028
l could give a shit about Cyril O'Reily
sleeping better.

130
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,367
Hell, l'll quadruple
his dosage of valium,

131
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,702
maybe he'll sleep
permanently.

132
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,503
Gloria, this is not about Cyril
and you know it.

133
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,635
This could give
Preston's mom and dad

134
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,578
a chance
to have closure.

135
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,080
You could have closure.

136
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,241
Closure?

137
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,615
People always
think l'm a nurse.

138
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,951
No matter how many times
they hear me referred to as Dr. Nathan,

139
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,082
they call out to me,
''Hey, nurse.''

140
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:49,618
Now l don't know
if that's because l'm a woman or Latina.

141
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,893
Maybe l'm just too goddamn
nice to be a doctor.

142
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,456
Does this mean
you'll do it?

143
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,368
lt means l'm not taking shit
from anyone anymore.

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,169
Damn!

145
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:17,222
Hey, Sister Pete, hey.

146
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,883
What did Gloria say?

147
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,917
She says no, Ryan.
l'm sorry.

148
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,521
Maybe in time,
she'll change her mind.

149
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,997
Yeah, but
what about Cyril?

150
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,968
l mean, come on.

151
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,470
l guess we
increase his dosage.

152
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,337
What?

153
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:56,521
Ahh!

154
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,325
Ryan!

155
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,994
- What happened?
- O'Reily cut himself.

156
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,232
There you go.

157
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,571
- Now how's that feel?
- Tight.

158
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,442
- You rest here for a while.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,812
You know, l asked Said
to tell me about last night,

160
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:24,914
about Hamid Khan's death.

161
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,686
Said told me that
you wrapped Khan's body

162
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,353
in a clean
white cloth

163
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,986
and then added perfume
and prayed.

164
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,793
O'Reily, you don't
care about Hamid Khan.

165
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,390
No, l do,
l don't know.

166
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:37,494
l just wanted to make
sure the fucking thing got done right.

167
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:43,072
Hey, my brother won
that fight fair and square.

168
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:53,111
Congratulations,
America.

169
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,483
This year
the prison population

170
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,454
has reached
an all-time high--

171
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:57,979
two million.

172
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:00,185
Two million people are,
what do you call it?

173
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,488
lncarcerated.

174
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:02,960
Two fucking million.

175
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,428
That's the population
of Vienna.

176
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,864
That's the population
of Houston, Texas.

177
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,862
of the world's
population,

178
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:12,632
yet it has 25°/%
of the world's prisoners.

179
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,196
Whoopee!

180
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,833
Bevilaqua.

181
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,709
Alvarez.

182
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,286
Giles.

183
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,822
McCullum.

184
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,024
Fuck me!

185
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,499
Command,
this is C-11.

186
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:44,367
We have a 7 4, cell 23.

187
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,104
- What happened?
- ls he dead?

188
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,879
Yeah, but Christ almighty,
look at his arms and his legs.

189
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,579
- They're all chewed up.
- He ate himself.

190
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,087
That's disgusting.

191
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,248
Yeah, l'm gonna be
filling out paperwork for a month.

192
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,554
You goddamn
piece of shit!

193
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,523
The M.E. has ruled
McCullum's death as suicide.

194
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:14,590
He bit into his skin,
chewing off chunks of muscle

195
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:18,035
over the course of a week or so causing
himself to bleed out.

196
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,597
- Sweet Jesus!
- Like a cannibal.

197
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,302
A cannibal eats
somebody else's flesh.

198
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,276
So what do you call a guy
who eats his own flesh?

199
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,802
- lnventive.
- How he did it

200
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,008
is not as important
as what he did.

201
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,950
This is the third suicide
we've had in solitary in two years.

202
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,783
Well, not to mention Alvarez's
almost successful attempt.

203
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,311
What's your point?

204
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,256
We've got to do something
about the conditions in there.

205
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,817
Conditions? lt's solitary,
for Christ's sake!

206
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,658
What do you want us to do,
serve high fucking tea?

207
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,859
There's no reason to talk like that.
No reason for the attitude.

208
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,459
l'm sorry, l wish
life in solitary

209
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:52,494
was all peaceful and rosy
like it is in Emerald City.

210
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:56,133
But we get the dead-enders
you other units can't handle.

211
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,938
l agree with Claire.

212
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,171
The only way to deal with
these types of criminals

213
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,702
is to sit on them.

214
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,805
You got no arguments
out of me, warden,

215
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,145
but l think there
is a compromise.

216
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,447
- Let's hear it.
- A lot of other maxs,

217
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,077
they give the dinks
in solitary

218
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,815
one hour of rec time
every day or so.

219
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:11,914
- Very controlled.
- That's right.

220
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,926
So if they get a chance
to walk around,

221
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,793
- they have more incentive to behave.
- lt's worth a try.

222
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,821
As long as it's
my ass on the line,

223
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,698
any of you wanna volunteer
to serve as escort?

224
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,202
Okay, Claire, enough.

225
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:27,138
Like Gloria says,
it's worth a try.

226
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,601
Bevilaqua!

227
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,086
Prisoner number 99b521,

228
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,257
Louis Bevilaqua;

229
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:33,797
Convicted,
April 2nd, 1999;

230
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,466
Murder in
the second degree,

231
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,806
illegal possession
of a firearm.

232
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,311
Sentence: 25 years,

233
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,906
up for parole in 1 2.

234
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:46,042
Hey, Alvarez,
why you in solitary?

235
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:49,816
This time, it's for
killing Carlo Ricardo.

236
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,686
Carlo's dead,
you killed him?

237
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,658
Yeah, well, l had to.

238
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,820
El Cid sent me here
to a-hole me, brother.

239
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,658
Carlo was my cousin.

240
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,892
You're supposed to be
exercising your legs,

241
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,332
not your mouths.
Shut the fuck up.

242
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:38,135
Bevilaqua says he just found out
Alvarez killed Carlo.

243
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,762
Bevilaqua wants
to know, man,

244
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,569
if you want him to finish
the job on Alvarez.

245
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:48,079
Tell him yes.
Tell him l want him dead already.

246
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,475
Alvarez.

247
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,354
Bevilaqua.

248
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,150
Hey, Aqua, man.

249
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,288
l got a funny story
to tell you, bro'.

250
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,697
You know, Glynn started
giving me a hassle

251
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,792
about who raped
his daughter,

252
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,702
so he put me
in solitary.

253
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:16,469
- l told him Carlo did it.
- Carlo wasn't there.

254
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,409
Yeah, l know.

255
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,718
What do you think
will happen

256
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:30,654
when Glynn finds out
you raped his kid?

257
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,966
Command, this is C-11.

258
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,902
We need backup
in the gymnasium, now!

259
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:48,100
- l repeat, backup in the gymnasium!
- Bevilaqua's dead.

260
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,007
- What about Alvarez?
- lntensive care.

261
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:54,035
- ls he gonna live?
- Unfortunately.

262
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,707
l hope this puts
an end to rec time.

263
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,310
Yeah, but l'm also transferring you
to another unit.

264
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,651
- 'Cause l was right?
- Open the goddamn door.

265
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:14,228
Peter...
Peter Marie.

266
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:16,393
Yeah, that's right.

267
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,933
William, why?

268
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:24,705
l, little shaver,
cookie jar,

269
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,007
Mama mad,
George Washington,

270
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,640
cherry tree,
chop-chop.

271
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,583
So you told your mother the truth
about stealing the cookies?

272
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:35,382
Chocolate chip,
yum-yum.

273
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:38,185
But what has
that got to do

274
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:41,387
- with attacking Bevilaqua and Alvarez?
- Liars, liars.

275
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:45,124
l kill, but never lie.

276
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,497
Never, ever lie.

277
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:51,094
Fucking Alvarez, man,
he's got more lives

278
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,603
- than a cat!
- Yo, man, he still alive?

279
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,663
He's barely,
in the hospital ward.

280
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,698
Well, you make sure
that fucking scumbag

281
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,370
don't make it out
of there, okay?

282
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,317
This one's for me.

283
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,096
Shit!

284
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,103
What's up?

285
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:28,806
- Your sons?
- Yeah.

286
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,537
A cousin of
mine sent it.

287
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:34,239
She heard
about Andrew.

288
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,214
Hard to get over
losing a kid.

289
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:40,014
Makes me miss my other son
Hank that much more.

290
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,350
You haven't heard
from him, right?

291
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,551
Not since
l came to Oz.

292
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,822
When they're this young,

293
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,490
all you see is
the possibilities.

294
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:57,093
Let's go.

295
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:08,710
Oh, time to renew
my subscription to TV Guide.

296
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,840
Hey, Beecher,
this one's for you.

297
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,044
lt's empty.

298
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:19,421
Yeah, we had to
confiscate the contents.

299
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,982
A letter from
my grandmother?

300
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,425
What could have
possibly been in here

301
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,928
that you had to
confiscate it?

302
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:27,524
Well, if l told you,
then you'd know.

303
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:44,477
- Hello, Tobias.
- Father M.

304
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:45,642
ls Pete around?

305
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,652
Ah, no, she went into town
to see her psychiatrist.

306
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,517
She's seeing
a psychiatrist?

307
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,250
Yeah, ever since
she started thinking about

308
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,019
not being a nun.
l thought you knew.

309
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,424
No.

310
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:59,295
Well, it's really
none of my business.

311
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,363
How are you
doing, Tobias?

312
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,666
Uh, you know.

313
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,672
Yeah.

314
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,072
Any more trouble
with Vern Schillinger?

315
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,669
Well, there's always
gonna be trouble,

316
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,872
at least until one of us
ends up in the morgue.

317
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,540
Oh, now
l don't believe that.

318
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:18,880
l know that
the two of you

319
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,147
caused each other massive amounts
of pain over the years,

320
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,552
but there's gotta
be a way to call a truce.

321
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,423
You've got to
forgive Schillinger.

322
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:32,328
l tried that and l ended up
bleeding internally.

323
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,264
lf it wasn't for Chris Keller,
l'd be dead.

324
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,960
How did you let him know
that you forgave him?

325
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,663
What do you mean, how?
l told him to his face.

326
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,763
Well, maybe this time
you don't tell him.

327
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:43,832
Maybe this time
he just knows.

328
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:49,442
So any ideas?

329
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:52,348
You must do something absolutely
extraordinary for Schillinger,

330
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,352
but you must never
tell him that you did it.

331
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,183
Well, then how's
he gonna know?

332
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,553
All these things have a way
of revealing themselves.

333
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,558
But when Schillinger
does find out,

334
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:03,584
He'll see your gesture
for exactly what it is--

335
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,598
an act of kindness,
reconciliation.

336
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:08,657
- This is bullshit.
- Chris.

337
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,101
No, you're not
doing anything.

338
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,297
You got that?

339
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,431
What, are you
giving me an order?

340
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,200
Fuck yes.

341
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,746
- Hello, Dad.
- Toby...

342
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:34,225
oh, God, son,
you look terrific.

343
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,092
Well, better than
the last time you were here.

344
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:43,359
- l've put more money in your account.
- Thank you.

345
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:45,734
There's not much else
l can do, is there?

346
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,899
Well, actually, Dad,
there is.

347
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,933
One of the other prisoners,
Vern Schillinger,

348
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,606
had two sons.
his oldest, Andrew, was--

349
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,945
died recently.

350
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,008
The other, Hank--

351
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:02,384
well, Vern's
lost track of him.

352
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,911
They're estranged.

353
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:06,254
l was hoping
one of the P.l.s

354
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,225
from the law firm
could do some digging.

355
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,728
You want to
locate the boy?

356
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:14,028
This is all the information l've been
able to pull together so far.

357
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,402
Mm-hmm.

358
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,371
Well, l'll put
Swannee on this.

359
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,669
He's the best
private investigator we have.

360
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,335
Thank you, Dad.

361
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,810
Toby, l'm very proud
of you.

362
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,108
- Proud?
- Well, here you are

363
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,811
Living in hell
with your own problems,

364
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,716
and you're trying to
help a fellow inmate

365
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:38,314
to reunite with his
last surviving son.

366
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,417
You are a remarkable
human being.

367
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:44,759
Yeah.

368
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:48,358
l'm remarkable
all right.

369
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,069
Hey.

370
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:01,943
How's Daddy?

371
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,642
Good, great.

372
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,053
You smell sexy.

373
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,952
lt's my father's
aftershave.

374
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,320
Mm-hmm.

375
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:15,258
- Hey, don't.
- What?

376
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,455
l need to talk to you.

377
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:24,028
So what's so
fucking important?

378
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,276
Look, l know
how you'll react.

379
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,438
Jesus, what?

380
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:38,711
l asked my father to locate
Schillinger's other son.

381
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:43,317
We discussed this.
Yeah, we agreed.

382
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:46,654
- No, we didn't agree.
- So now all of a sudden,

383
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:48,159
you wanna help that fuck,
Schillinger, huh?

384
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:51,253
No, l wanna help us,
you and me.

385
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,890
l wanna stop living
every fucking day in fear.

386
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,560
Hey, that's what being
alive is all about, pal.

387
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:00,805
lt doesn't
have to be.

388
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:06,938
Chris, sometimes,
most times,

389
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,913
l wish l could
wipe away the past.

390
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:14,385
l wish l could wipe away
everything l've done,

391
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,411
everything l've said
to hurt the people l love.

392
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:18,684
l wish l could
look at people

393
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,385
and not see all
the hurt they caused me.

394
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:23,189
And maybe, maybe
this is the way

395
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:25,128
to start making
that wish come true.

396
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,961
Are you listening
to yourself, man?

397
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,934
What are you,
Tinkerbell?

398
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,833
You wishing
upon a star?

399
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,465
l'm partially responsible
for Andrew Schillinger's death.

400
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,634
l need to
atone for that,

401
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,667
so should you.

402
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,407
You know what?

403
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:46,883
Oz didn't make
you a bitch.

404
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,581
You were born one.

405
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,021
Yeah, okay.

406
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,292
Shit.

407
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:06,227
- Let's go!
- Come on, you bitch.

408
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,171
- Hey, who started it?
- l fucking started it!

409
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,504
- Take him to the hole!
- l'm nobody's bitch!

410
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,737
You're not
my fucking bitch, you cunt!

411
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,076
Party's over, guys.
Break it up!

412
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,821
l'm nobody's bitch.

413
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,492
Now most citizens would say,
''two million inmates?

414
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,836
l got no problem with
that 'cause crime is down.''

415
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:46,003
But California, which increased
its prison population

416
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,308
at a much higher rate
than say, New York,

417
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:51,009
had a smaller drop
in crime.

418
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,450
Cause and effect?
l don't think so.

419
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,146
Shirley Bellinger,
who sat on death row for a year

420
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:01,523
awaiting execution for the murder
of her young daughter,

421
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,723
will be returning to Oswald State
Correctional Facility today.

422
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:07,288
Bellinger's death sentence
had been commuted

423
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,857
when she became pregnant
while serving time.

424
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,927
But after she miscarried
under suspicious circumstances,

425
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:15,371
Governor Devlin
revoked his decision.

426
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,810
Here you go, Shirley.

427
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:32,119
Well, can't l have
my old cell back?

428
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,954
As you can see,
it's occupied.

429
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:35,960
Well, maybe
he'd switch with me.

430
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,827
Would you
switch with me?

431
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:41,128
Sorry, sister,
l'm all spread out.

432
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,963
l'll make it
worth your while.

433
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:46,198
- There's nothing you got that l want.
- You'd be surprised.

434
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,502
Get inside.

435
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,483
How do you do?

436
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,651
My name's Shirley,
what's yours?

437
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,422
Suck my dick,
you fucking cunt.

438
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,828
Well, that's not polite.

439
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,991
How about you?

440
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,092
You got a kind word
for a stranger?

441
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,227
Yeah.

442
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:21,136
Moses Deyell.

443
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,733
Moses? Well,
maybe you can lead us

444
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,743
out of Egypt
to the promise land.

445
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,938
l wouldn't
count on it.

446
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,004
How'd you end up here?

447
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:52,830
Prisoner number
00D7 18,

448
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,965
Moses Deyell;

449
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:59,374
Convicted
February 3rd, 2000,

450
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:02,312
on two counts of murder
in the first degree.

451
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:05,111
Death.

452
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,311
She was cheatin' on ya?

453
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,320
Yeah...

454
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:11,447
with her husband.

455
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,219
They were married?

456
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,522
The bitch told me
they was through.

457
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,551
l don't fuck with
another man's wife.

458
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,565
- l got principles.
- Oh, l love a man with principles.

459
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,468
You know, when l was
first elected governor,

460
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,600
crime was
out of control,

461
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:34,203
but we went to work, fighting
for three strikes and you're out.

462
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,407
That bastard's running
for another term

463
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,109
after all the crap
he's pulled?

464
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,242
l'm voting for him.

465
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:40,273
What, why?

466
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:41,546
Well, things
are better now

467
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,883
than they were
four years ago.

468
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,183
Better for who?
Not for us.

469
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,349
Well, in general,

470
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,292
life has improved across the state
since Devlin took office.

471
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,852
The economy's up,
crime is down.

472
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,627
- You'd actually vote for that asshole?
- Yes.

473
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,226
You can't vote.
You were convicted of a felony.

474
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,829
- You are no longer eligible to vote.
- Really?

475
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,270
Really.

476
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:04,707
Oh. well, that's okay.

477
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:07,041
l never used
to vote anyway.

478
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,642
The courage to lead--
James Devlin, Governor.

479
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,845
- Welcome.
- Thanks for seeing me.

480
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,582
l get a call that the governor's
campaign manager

481
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,647
wants to chat,
l'm intrigued.

482
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,488
Please,
have a seat.

483
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:25,958
You'll find that l'm not
the type to dance around.

484
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:29,125
Frank Feeley won't be running for
re-election as lieutenant governor.

485
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,465
We haven't announced
this yet to the press,

486
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,437
but he has cancer,
throat cancer.

487
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,439
- Pity.
- l know.

488
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,737
He was a great draw
for the upstate vote.

489
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:40,711
Governor Devlin has asked me
to make a short list of people

490
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,838
to replace Frank
on the ticket.

491
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,782
l'd like to add
your name to the list.

492
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:49,275
Me?
Run with Devlin?

493
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:52,381
l know that you and the governor
have had your differences in the past,

494
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,757
but l also know you're as conservative
as he is on most issues.

495
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,421
This wouldn't have
anything to do

496
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:00,454
with Alvah Case announcing
he's running against Devlin?

497
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:03,365
Well, l'll be honest, sure.

498
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,562
This administration's
reputation

499
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,767
with the African-American
community is a bit tarnished.

500
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:12,607
But deeper than that, l think you'd make
a great lieutenant governor.

501
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:15,112
You offering me this?

502
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:18,547
No. You're on the list.

503
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,143
The convention
is two months away.

504
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:23,586
Between now and then, you'd need
to increase your public profile.

505
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,557
- How?
- Well, that's what l'm here for,

506
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,957
to walk you
through the steps.

507
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,087
l'm glad you're
interested, Leo.

508
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,893
- l haven't said that l am.
- Oh, yes, you have.

509
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,870
- Hey, Andrea.
- McManus.

510
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,270
What brings you downtown
from Emerald City?

511
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,468
- Well, have you seen Diane?
- No.

512
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,409
Wasn't she due back
from vacation today?

513
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:49,038
Yeah, but she didn't show up for her
shift, so they asked me to stay,

514
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,072
which is a pain in my ass
'cause l think l got the flu.

515
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:53,584
Oh, look, look.
Don't breathe on me.

516
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:56,382
- l can't afford to get sick.
- And l can?

517
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,615
Please, l got three kids.

518
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,851
My husband's been puking
for the past two days.

519
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,621
Oh, shit. Well, listen,
if you hear from Diane,

520
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:04,253
will you please
tell her to call me?

521
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:06,594
- Sure.
- And feel better.

522
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,529
l've been thinking
or feeling.

523
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:14,265
l know l've been all over the place
and back with this thing,

524
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:18,037
but maybe we could
try it again together.

525
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,712
You busy?

526
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,484
Oh, no, no, no,
come on in.

527
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:33,548
What's the problem?

528
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:35,081
No problem.

529
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,584
Hey, l just got off
the phone with Diane.

530
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,063
Where is she?

531
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:42,328
Well, she's
still in London.

532
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,733
l just called her hotel.
They said she checked out.

533
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,670
- Yeah...
- You know, her two weeks are up.

534
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:51,164
She was supposed to
come back to work today.

535
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,143
What's she still
doing in London?

536
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,169
Well, you know,
she and Didi

537
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,773
were standing in front
of Buckingham Palace

538
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:01,149
and she got into
a conversation with

539
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:03,017
a guard.

540
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,648
- l thought they didn't talk.
- He was on break.

541
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,024
Anyway, one thing
led to another,

542
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,460
and...

543
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,965
they're going
to get married.

544
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,231
Right.

545
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:24,741
l'm serious.

546
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:33,882
- She's getting married?
- Yeah.

547
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,476
To a Bobby?

548
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,353
No, no, not a Bobby, Tim,
he's a guard.

549
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,290
He guards the Queen.

550
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:44,159
Yeah, well, then l can see how they've
got a lot in fucking common!

551
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,459
Oh, fuck!

552
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,062
Jesus fucking Christ!

553
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:57,199
Did she leave
a number?

554
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:58,869
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

555
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,037
Well, l got a hell
of a lot l wanna say to her!

556
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,240
Which is why she doesn't
wanna talk to you.

557
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:06,580
- She really feels very badly.
- Oh, really?

558
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,780
Now listen, Tim,

559
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:12,312
Diane Wittlesey has
not had an easy life.

560
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:16,657
Poverty, spousal abuse,
single motherhood,

561
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:18,753
her mom dying after
a very long illness.

562
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:21,459
And just now
on the phone, her voice--

563
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,024
she sounded so happy.

564
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:26,229
Happy?

565
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:30,773
Sure.

566
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:42,217
lf you need
to talk--

567
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,483
What l need
is a drink.

568
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,893
- Tim--
- Don't worry, Sister.

569
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,089
This is what guys
who've been dumped do

570
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,564
in order to move on.

571
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,904
Cheerio.

572
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,671
Adebisi, you still
got the gun?

573
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,838
Lower your voice.

574
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,581
- You still got it?
- Yes.

575
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:15,677
And when you
gonna use it?

576
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,018
- l'm not.
- Then what is the point of having a gun

577
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:20,650
if you don't
use the shit?

578
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,058
lf l use the gun,

579
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,655
l end up in the hole,
solitary or death row.

580
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:31,658
No, our goal was to get rid
of McManus, remember?

581
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:34,194
To have a black man
running Emerald City.

582
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,537
Yeah, like you can
make that happen?

583
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:42,342
l can, depending on
who l get to shoot the gun,

584
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,713
- And who gets shots.
- l don't understand, man.

585
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,986
Of course
you don't, Kenny.

586
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,989
Of course you don't.

587
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:54,651
All right, time to go
back to your cages.

588
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,785
Line up!

589
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,659
Andrew said you was
gonna get me, Poet, and Pierce

590
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,561
sent back to Em City.
what's up with that?

591
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,361
- l will.
- When?

592
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:07,071
Patience, Kenny.
Patience.

593
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,163
Fuck patience, man,

594
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,299
that's all you ever
say is patience!

595
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,865
Patience!

596
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,073
l've got too much time
in this motherfucker to be patient!

597
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:17,604
- No, l won't do it.
- Why?

598
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:20,174
Look, Wangler accused me
of sexually harassing him.

599
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:23,585
- l don't want him anywhere near me.
- Look, Wangler admitted

600
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:27,250
- he exaggerated his claim.
- Exaggerated?

601
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,782
Look, Tim,

602
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:32,284
Adebisi came to me
requesting that Wangler,

603
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,265
Poet and Pierce get
transferred back to your unit.

604
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,325
Now l'm trying to put
a lid on the racial tension.

605
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,235
And if giving Adebisi
this one small thing helps do that,

606
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:43,035
l don't see what
your problem is.

607
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:47,602
lf you say no,
l'll transfer him anyway.

608
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,670
Fine.

609
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,230
- What's up?
- Baby.

610
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,366
Same old shit.
What's up, baby?

611
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,438
Welcome home.

612
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:32,688
Yo, let me
see the gun.

613
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,384
Let me see the gun.

614
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:50,364
Damn.
Let me hold it.

615
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,774
Let me
hold that piece.

616
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,470
Come and get it.

617
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,174
You three have been
chosen to do your time

618
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,947
in an experimental unit
we call Emerald City.

619
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:05,717
ln Emerald City, you're given a lot more
leeway than the rest of Oz,

620
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,851
But the leeway has a price.
we've got rules.

621
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:11,259
There's no yelling,
no fighting, no fucking.

622
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:13,126
You're expected
to keep yourselves

623
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,564
and the common
areas pristine.

624
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,795
You obey the rules,
we get along fine.

625
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:21,464
You don't, we drop-kick
your ass to Gen Pop.

626
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,770
Now these guys, these guys are gonna
be your sponsors,

627
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,335
help you acclimate
to your new life.

628
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,109
Augustus Hill,
that's Desmond Mobay.

629
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:34,050
Chucky Pancamo,
that's Ralph Galino.

630
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:37,953
And Guillaume Tarrant,
that's Jaz Hoyt.

631
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,617
You've gotta be
kidding me, man.

632
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,097
Where you from, man,
Jamaica?

633
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,074
Yes.

634
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,909
- How long you been in the States?
- Six months.

635
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,779
What got you
sucked into Oz?

636
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:10,280
Are you writing
my life story?

637
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:17,661
- l don't know you.
- Like he said, my name is Ralph Galino.

638
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:20,129
l don't know you or where
the fuck you came from.

639
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:23,827
Well, l'm a contractor.
l built a housing complex that collapsed

640
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:26,894
it killed two people,
but it wasn't my fault.

641
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:30,635
- So you're not connected?
- Connected? You mean...

642
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,303
- Anybody got their arm around you?
- Oh, God, no.

643
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:36,108
Until this little brouhaha,
l never even gotten a parking ticket.

644
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:38,240
- Oh, yeah?
- No offense, Mr. Pancamo,

645
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,546
but not every ltalian-American
is mobbed up.

646
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,212
ls that so?

647
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:43,982
Yeah, most of us live normal,
law-abiding lives.

648
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:47,184
The Guido gangster is an
ugly and unfair stereotype.

649
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:50,126
So who is he?

650
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:52,391
Just another
fucking asshole.

651
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,193
Yo!

652
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:59,368
You got money?
Gimme it.

653
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,968
Fuckin' pussy.

654
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:11,445
Everybody in Oz has
a job, which can range

655
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,882
from maintenance
to food service to machinery.

656
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,886
You have
secretarial skills,

657
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,753
so the warden has requested
that you work in his office.

658
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,886
- Okay.
- You also have a history of drug abuse.

659
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:26,488
History.
l'm done with drugs.

660
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:27,896
Uh-huh, just in case,

661
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,264
l'm gonna have you take
part in our rehab sessions,

662
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:32,235
at least for
a few weeks.

663
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,862
You keep
your nose clean,

664
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:35,805
both figuratively
and literally,

665
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,502
and we'll get along.

666
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:40,408
Go see the warden.

667
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:43,207
Next!

668
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,916
Yeah.

669
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,992
Warden, this
is Desmond Mobay.

670
00:41:57,028 --> 00:42:00,555
- Okay, you can leave him, Armstrong.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:06,836
- Detective Basil.
- Hello, warden.

672
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:08,702
Have a seat.

673
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,366
Nice little prison
you run here.

674
00:42:10,408 --> 00:42:11,739
Little?

675
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:14,472
Oz is the largest correctional
facility in the state.

676
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:17,640
And, yet the place feels
so intimate, so friendly.

677
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,617
Now l have to tell you
the drug problem here is substantial,

678
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:21,811
but l'm not sure
how effective

679
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,912
an undercover
operation will be.

680
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,788
Several years ago we had another
narcotics detective come in.

681
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,223
- Paul Markstrom.
- Yeah.

682
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,692
l knew Paul.
He was a good man.

683
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,820
Then you also know
he was executed,

684
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:35,526
- hung by the neck.
- Those are the risks.

685
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:39,263
Well, l intend to keep
a close eye on you.

686
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:41,669
That's why l wanted you
working here in the office.

687
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,105
l want to be
updated constantly.

688
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,767
No problem.

689
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:48,370
All right, let me
show you your desk.

690
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:49,879
The place might
be a mess.

691
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:52,747
My last secretary left
in kind of a hurry.

692
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:54,546
Very nice.

693
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:57,383
l can use this
to e-mail my partner.

694
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:59,981
By the way, l type
85 words a minute.

695
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:02,584
Shit, l might hire you
as my secretary for real.

696
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,357
lf l don't make this bust,
l'll need the job.

697
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:07,887
My lieutenant,
he wants results.

698
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,593
What's your first step?

699
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:14,161
Making good friends
with the bad guys.

700
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:21,776
Yo, man,
how's it going?

701
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:24,542
Some cultural reading, eh?

702
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:29,547
What, all of a sudden
you wanna be my Yaga-Yaga?

703
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:32,385
l asked around.
people say you cool.

704
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:35,119
- Do they?
- They also say

705
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,024
you know where a man
can get some relief.

706
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,394
- Some relief or some reefer?
- Same thing.

707
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:43,161
Though l could use
something stronger.

708
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,829
Well, whoever
you jawing with,

709
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:49,669
they're misinformed.
l don't do drugs.

710
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:53,507
- No?
- No, not no more, no.

711
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:54,943
Oh.

712
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:58,608
So who do
l talk to?

713
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:00,617
Just stand still,

714
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:02,846
they'll come to you.

715
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,718
Hi, honey, it's me.

716
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:09,617
How am l doing?

717
00:45:09,653 --> 00:45:11,518
How the fuck do you
think l'm doing?

718
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:14,388
Listen,
call Dan Bosey,

719
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,325
Tell him to get
his ass in gear.

720
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,328
l want that appeal
signed and sealed.

721
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:22,264
l've gotta
get out of here.

722
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:24,995
l love you
too, babe.

723
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,867
All right, bye.

724
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,301
What do you want?

725
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,138
Permit me
to introduce myself--

726
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:34,770
Nikolai Petrovic
Stanislofsky.

727
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:37,144
- Okay, what do you want?
- That cell phone.

728
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:39,945
How did you
get it into Oz?

729
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,645
My brother brought
it to me, why?

730
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:43,710
They're not allowed.

731
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:46,279
Really, no one
mentioned that.

732
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:48,223
The prison, they want us
to use the pay phones.

733
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,319
First, because they
monitor calls randomly,

734
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:54,456
and second, because the state gets a cut
from the phone company

735
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:56,728
of all the long-distance
calls we make.

736
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,667
Shit, l guess
l better turn it in.

737
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:00,966
l don't need any more trouble
than l already got.

738
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:04,202
You know, if you like,
l will take care of it for you.

739
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,436
l can say l found
the cell phone

740
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:08,570
and no one will
be the wiser.

741
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:12,680
lt's up to you.

742
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:15,150
Thank you.

743
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,653
What's your name?

744
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:19,281
- Nikolai.
- Ralph.

745
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:22,258
- l owe you one.
- No, no problem.

746
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:24,420
Better take
the charger too.

747
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:06,932
Prisoner number 00T416,
Guillaume Tarrant;

748
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,875
Convicted

750
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:17,610
concealment
of a deadly weapon.

751
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:22,278
Sentence: 10 years,
up for parole in three.

752
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,680
Yo, what's up, yo?

753
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:30,023
Welcome to Em City.

754
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,585
Nice shoes.

755
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,858
Your mother
give you those

756
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,298
before they shipped you
off to summer camp and shit?

757
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,096
Leave me alone.

758
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:40,228
What kind of accent
is that? Where you from?

759
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,738
Leave me alone.

760
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:44,366
Yo, man, l'm just trying
to start a conversation, dog.

761
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:46,501
l'm just being
friendly and shit.

762
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:51,505
Where you going?
Huh, where you going?

763
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:55,451
Yo, just sit your ugly
white ass back down.

764
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,922
Check this. Your shoes,
offer 'em to me.

765
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,484
- What?
- Offer 'em to me.

766
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:06,462
Do it.

767
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:09,726
Would you
take my shoes?

768
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,758
Louder.

769
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:13,997
Would you
take my shoes?

770
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:17,030
Louder, motherfucker,
louder, louder.

771
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:20,168
Take my shoes, please!

772
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,145
Oh, damn, cool,
a gift for me? Word.

773
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,706
Hook me up.
Let me take those shoes.

774
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:29,344
Let me see these.
Oh, these the real deal.

775
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:32,014
My size and everything.
Hook me up.

776
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:33,956
Yo, for real.
Thank you.

777
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,357
All right, damn,
good looking, cuz.

778
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:38,691
My love, appreciate it,
all right?

779
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:40,526
See ya,
all right?

780
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,837
And then they took them.

781
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:55,639
Here you go,
blow your nose.

782
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,979
Guillaume,
here's the problem.

783
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:04,681
lf l go to Wangler and tell
him what you just told me,

784
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:06,917
he's gonna deny it.
his word against yours.

785
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:09,619
Well, he's got Poet
and Pierce to back him up.

786
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,525
What you need is
evidence or a witness.

787
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:15,464
He's wearing the shoes.
That's evidence.

788
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:16,989
But then you have
to find somebody

789
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:19,696
that says that they saw you
wearing the shoes earlier.

790
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:23,434
- Can you do that?
- No.

791
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:25,203
See, any witness
l find is gonna say

792
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:28,006
that they heard you offer
the shoes to Wangler.

793
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:33,178
- So what do l do now?
- Call your family.

794
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:35,651
Have them send you
another pair of shoes.

795
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,951
Wangler will just
steal those too.

796
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:41,480
Probably.

797
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:44,187
Look, ummm...

798
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,890
l don't like those three

799
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,125
being around here
any more than you do.

800
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:52,067
So if you ever see
or hear anything

801
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:55,071
l can use to hang
their balls out to dry, let me know.

802
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:57,471
And in the meantime,
go to the infirmary,

803
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:58,805
tell them l sent you,

804
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:02,175
get a pair of slippers that
will tide you over until...

805
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,921
Yo, Frenchy!

806
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,984
How about a game
of one-on-one? Me and you.

807
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:21,054
- No thanks.
- l'm not asking.

808
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:49,617
That's why we say it
like that, baby.

809
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:54,056
- lt must be the shoes, baby.
- lt must be the shoes.

810
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:56,157
Good game.

811
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,867
- Hey, McManus.
- l got no time for you today, O'Reily.

812
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,344
Hey, you ought to transfer
Frenchy out of Em City, man.

813
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,007
Hey, since when
do you tell me

814
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:13,107
who lives here
and who doesn't?

815
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,482
You don't do something,
there's gonna be trouble.

816
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,885
Yeah, thank you
for the advice.

817
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:29,359
Hey.

818
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:36,101
Oh, man. l heard what
those niggers did to you.

819
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,540
- Go away.
- Hey...

820
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,566
this is for you.

821
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:44,246
- Marijuana?
- Yeah, plus a little something extra

822
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,908
We call a ''duster.''

823
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:48,144
Oh, no, why don't you
wait a few minutes?

824
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:51,211
lf the hacks see you, they're gonna
eat your ass for lunch,

825
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:52,722
so all right?

826
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:56,487
Look, life in Oz,
it sucks.

827
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:59,428
The only way
for you to survive

828
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:02,455
is to teach Wangler
and his crew

829
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:04,467
that they can't
bully you around like this.

830
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:07,402
How?
How do l do that?

831
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:10,032
Well, l don't know.

832
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:14,533
But if an opportunity
presents itself, grab it,

833
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:18,309
'cause you're not
gonna get a second chance.

834
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:55,945
The scariest part is,
all those criminals

835
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:58,546
that were locked into all
those prisons in the '80s--

836
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,648
you know, the good,
old Reagan years--

837
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:04,092
all those criminals,
their sentences are up.

838
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,563
Those bad men who
are more dangerous now

839
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:10,931
than when they went in,
they're getting out...

840
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:14,460
and coming to dark
street corners near you.

841
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:16,564
Lights out!

842
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,709
Beecher.

843
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:05,552
- Who are you?
- Tarrant, Guillaume Tarrant.

844
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:08,422
You the guy that
destroyed that statue?

845
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:12,292
- Oui.
- Fucking sicko bastard.

846
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:24,067
Damn, your mom work quick.

847
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,337
- She send your shit air mail?
- Get the fuck away from me.

848
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:28,571
Tough talk. you know
you shouldn't swear,

849
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:31,581
- your mama'd be P.O.'d.
- l'm warning you to back off.

850
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:33,549
What the fuck, son?
You trying to get tough now?

851
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:36,348
Huh? What the fuck
you gonna do, huh?

852
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:38,115
Huh, huh?

853
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:56,766
Stay down, stay down...

854
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:09,717
Ow! God damn it!

855
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:13,553
Chris!

856
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:07,170
Come on,
put the gun down.

857
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,441
There's no way out.
put the gun down.

858
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,505
There's no way out.
